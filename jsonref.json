A six-month-old cocker iel once tried to bite me. Puppies should not know those \u0027swear words\u0027, as I call them. The fact they do means they\u0027re over-stressed and well on the way to becoming an aggressive dog.So how can we change this situation? If you\u0027re starting to see behaviour changes in your pet, ask yourself what has changed. Something will have. Then try to bring some routine back — always feed and walk at the same time —stick to it and make sure it\u0027s constant. That\u0027s the key.If it\u0027s a medical issue, see your vet. Otherwise, you need a behaviourist (Association of Pet Behaviour Counsellors, (apbc.org.uk).If you get a puppy, make sure you socialise them. It\u0027s so important to expose them to positive events, traffic, people and other animals in their first year or they will get stressed when you eventually do. And prepare them for being away from you. Find a safe space for them and leave them first for 60 seconds, then five minutes, building up slowly to when you can leave them for a few hours.Another big thing for dogs is exercise — a tired dog is not an anxious dog. Pheromone diffusers and collars, which release calming hormones, are great, too.When most people are told their pet\u0027s problems are being caused by the owner\u0027s stress, they are relieved.

Since then, over 300,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and over 5,000 people have died.Globally, over 200 million people have been diagnosed and over 4\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Janssen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?Dose: Two doses, between 4 and 12 weeks apartEMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th. On June 28th, Niac revised its advice again and said the vaccine could be given\u0026nbspto people aged under 40, although the mRNA shots were preferable for that age group.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2-8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st.On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac initially recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50, but this was revised to include the under 40s on June 28th. Those aged 18-34 can apply to get the Janssen vaccine at pharmacies around the country.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2-8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?Over 80 per cent\u0026nbspof people in Ireland aged over 18 are now fully vaccinated, with over 90 per cent in receipt of at least one dose.

Photograph: Tolga Akmen AFP via Getty ImagesThe current shortage of heavy goods vehicle (HGV) drivers “did not happen overnight” and opportunities to address it have been missed by the government, a Stormont committee has heard.Seamus Leheny of Logistics UK said the shortage of 76,000 drivers across the UK is a problem that has grown over a number of years.John Martin of the Road Haulage Association said there is a shortage of between 4,000 and 5,000 HGV drivers in Northern Ireland.MLAs also heard a plea for recognition of drivers and an academy to keep a flow of young people entering the industry.Mr Leheny said there was a lack of young drivers, with fewer than 2 per cent of HGV drivers in Northern Ireland aged under 25, due to insurance costs and lack of visibility of the industry. He also cited the lack of facilities and safe secure parking for drivers as contributing factors.Overwhelmingly maleAddressing the Infrastructure Committee, Mr Leheny also referred to the overwhelmingly male workforce, with fewer than 1 per cent of qualified drivers in Northern Ireland being female.Mr Martin described contributing factors to the driver shortage as the loss of 2,400 HGV tests due to the coronavirus pandemic, which will take 12-15 months to claw back.He also described a loss of capacity in the sector due to post-Brexit trading arrangements between Britain and Northern Ireland.“That has slowed down the logistics chain and the result is that trucks are coming over to Northern Ireland with less product, maybe only 50 per cent to 75 per cent full, so there is a loss of capacity within the sector,” he said.Mr Martin said delays at many of the major distribution centres meant drivers were having to wait up to six hours to be given a slot to offload.  “There are a number of reasons for that, partly down to a lack of warehouse staff.”UncertaintyChris Slowey, managing director at Manfreight, said his firm had to recruit drivers from England because those from Northern Ireland do not want to go to Britain due to the uncertainty over when they will get home in the current climate. He said his firm has 224 full-time drivers and 72 part-time drivers with an average age of 56.Mr Slowey said the company and others have established their own academies for training drivers and were putting through three to four people per month.He said HGV drivers are not recognised as “professional people” despite their unique skillset. He called for drivers’ accreditation system and a progressive path within the industry.“As a committee, I am asking you bluntly, it’s recognition that this is an industry that you need for the economy, give us an academy, we will contribute to it from a collective of companies towards the running costs,” he said.“It gives us a skilled set of iniduals entering the industry that has the ability to complete the tasks, to go out to the marketplace to deliver the goods and we can manage them and develop from there.” – PAStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"mica redress we just want our lives and our homes back","story":"Noel Noone and Joan Faulkner with their children, Shaun (17), Aoife (15) and Eimear (9),  outside their mica-affected home in Quigley’s Point, Co Donegal.  Photograph:  Joe DunneThis will be Noone’s second time protesting in Dublin a member of the Mica Action Group, he was among thousands who attended a first mass protest in June, but says the expectation in Donegal is Friday’s protest will be even bigger. “There’s a real groundswell of support out there.” His home is one of at least 5,000 in Co Donegal affected by defective bricks made of mica – a mineral that can absorb water leading to cracks and crumbling in blocks. It was also used in the construction of at least 700 homes in Mayo, and may have been used in some other counties. Campaigners want 100 per cent redress for families whose homes have been destroyed or significantly damaged by mica and have rejected the existing scheme – which offers a maximum of 90 per cent of repair and rebuild costs – as insufficient. Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien told the Dáil on Friday that full redress for families whose homes have been destroyed or significantly damaged by mica is still under consideration.He said that “nothing, including the caps or the 100 per cent is off the table”, adding that the changes would require legislation. He said he will bring proposals offering a number of options to Cabinet in the coming weeks.‘Forever home’Noone and his wife Joan moved into their “forever home” in 2006, just days before their second child was born. “That’s where we lived and that’s where we made our memories.” They first noticed cracks a few years later, and in 2011 a relative noticed they were getting bigger. “There was moss and grass starting to grow in them.” An expert examined the house in 2014 and found “cracks running physically through the blocks... he was able to take his car key and actually pick the block apart, and he said in his assessment the blocks were defective.” The family can no longer live in their house, which is so badly damaged it must be demolished. “The cracks have opened up, one corner has actually come away from the house... the plaster has all fallen off, windowsills are lifting and spreading.” They moved out about a year ago to care for his father-in-law and remained after his death, where the wider family have agreed they can stay until they get their own home again now everything is “on hold” while they wait to hear from Government on the redress scheme. “We are fortunate enough that we’re not actually homeless but the house had got progressively worse and we, at that stage, had to move on with trying to salvage what we could and putting it into storage and seeing what we could get fixed,” says Noone. “But when we started getting quotes back which were talking €100,000 on top of a mortgage on top of a grant scheme to fix the house – we can’t afford that, it’s not feasible.” ‘Living nightmare’Noone’s son is now 17, and his daughters are 15 and nine. “Hopefully one day I would love for them to live in their own home and have their own bedrooms and get on with their lives and not worry about mica.” Nine-year-old Eimear has already been to one protest, in Lifford, and is keen to come to Dublin on Friday. Noone describes the personal impact on the family and the stress of campaigning it has been a “living nightmare” and “all-consuming”, he admits. “The older two know more about the financial strain and the impact it’s been having on us as a family, knowing we have to watch the pennies and can’t overspend, that we can’t do this or that. On Friday the family will stand together on the streets of Dublin in June, Noone found it “overwhelming” to see so many people there supporting them. “It made me proud to be from Donegal, the way people were dignified, we walked without major fuss or disruption, we had our protest and everybody made their way home, and there was nothing but compliments from gardaí. “It does make you proud, we’re not a crowd of thugs, we’re not down here to make a thing, we just want our lives and our homes back.

Photograph: Alan BetsonThe right to collective representation is a basic one appropriate to all workers, President Michael D Higgins has told Defence Forces members, who are seeking to be allowed to affiliate with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (Ictu). In an address to the Permanent Defence Forces Other Ranks Representative Association (PDForra) conference in Killarney, Mr Higgins said the role played by the trade union movement historically was too often downplayed. He noted that amid a culture of inidualism and “the insatiable wants of the inidual over the needs of the group”, only about 25 per cent of workers were unionised today, down from some 62 per cent 40 years ago. Mr Higgins added that the fight for citizenship and for dignity in the workplace was part of the battle for Irish independence and was still a basic right. The union movement, North and South, had been united in seeking to avoid unnecessary deaths in the War of Independence and the Civil War, he said. “It is the trade union movement, on an island basis and internationally, that has been most steadfast in opposing sectarianism,” the President said. “The right to be represented, to collective representation, is a basic right appropriate to all workers as is recognised in, among other places, European law.”He said PDForra was founded 31 years ago at a time when “many members of the military were living in substandard accommodation, working in poor conditions and trying to exist and support families on extremely meagre pay”. Mr Higgins said it was a matter of the greatest concern that so many Defence Forces personnel were leaving citing better pay on offer elsewhere as a reason.“The importance of your work and the positive impact which it has in this country and beyond our shores must be valued, recognised and supported,” he said. PDForra on Wednesday called on Minister for Defence Simon Coveney to permit the organisation to affiliate with Ictu, saying it wanted to be represented at talks on pay and conditions rather than to gain the right to strike.The organisation, representing more than 6,500 enlisted members, voted in 1994 to be allowed do so, but has been blocked by various ministers for defence. The European Social Rights Committee three years ago said a complete ban on affiliation was not necessary or proportionate.In his address to the conference, Mr Coveney said he was “very much aware “of PDForra’s strongly held desire to affiliate to Ictu” but that it would be inappropriate to comment further given the matter was being litigated.Harassment allegationsRegarding allegations of harassment and bullying of women in the Defence Forces, who account for just 7 per cent of the membership, Mr Higgins said there could be “no doubt that the degrading, discriminatory and sometimes violent treatment meted out to female members, or indeed any member, of the Defence Forces is shameful”. “Strategies, and impunity or evasion, that allow any belittling and demeaning those who are of a different gender, religion or ethnic background than the prevailing majority have no place in any organisation in a democracy,” he said.Defence Forces Chief of Staff Lt Gen Seán Clancy told the conference that he welcomed an independent review and other measures announced by Mr Coveney following revelations about harassment and bullying in RTÉ’s Women of Honour documentary.“There is no place for any type of abuse or failure to act on any form of inappropriate behaviour, towards any inidual, within the Defence Forces,” he said. He said many instances brought to light in the documentary were historic, “but many are not” and that he had listened to people sharing distressing experiences in the three weeks since the programme aired. The Women of Honour group on Wednesday welcomed comments and commitments from Mr Coveney in response to the concerns they have raised. They said that “for it to finally be widely accepted that there were and still are such devastating systematic problems...is a very positive move in the right direction”.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"rsa to tap four more countries to plug lorry driver shortages","story":"The road haulage industry has estimated that there is a shortage of between 3,000 and 4,000 heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) and wants more new foreign drivers to help fill jobs. File photograph: GettyThe Government has directed the Road Safety Authority (RSA) to look at negotiating potential driving licence exchange agreements with four more countries to help tackle the shortage of lorry drivers.Minister of State at the Department of Transport Hildegarde Naughton has asked the authority to contact the licensing authorities in Moldova, North Macedonia, Ukraine and Argentina about potential agreements that would allow lorry drivers from those countries to drive on Irish roads.The road haulage industry has estimated that there is a shortage of between 3,000 and 4,000 heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) and wants more new foreign drivers to help fill jobs. The authority is examining a possible licence exchange deal with New Brunswick in Canada. If agreed, it would be the 13th jurisdiction with which the State has a lorry driver licence exchange. Ms Naughton said the reciprocal agreements can take up to 12 months to organise as both parties must be happy that similar road safety standards apply.“We are working to try and expedite that as quickly as possible,” she said. Raise the quotaThe Fine Gael TD said she had asked the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to raise the quota of 320 employment permits granted to HGV drivers from outside the European Economic Area so there is no barrier to new lorry drivers coming into the State. To date, 175 employment permits have been issued to HGV drivers, many from South Africa. “Every country is grappling with HGV driver shortages,” said Ms Naughton. The shortage of lorry drivers has affected the UK worst of all, with petrol stations running out of fuel because there are not enough fuel tanker drivers on roads to replenish supplies.Ms Naughton said the shortage was “concerning” for the supply chain but she pointed to the period when Brexit came into effect as an example of how quickly the Irish industry can adapt.‘Double crisis’“We are dealing with a double crisis of Brexit and Covid which is throwing the industry into a new space that we need to be dealing with,” she said.She acknowledged that road haulage was not an attractive business to new-entrant drivers. She said the Government was developing a 10-year strategy to make the industry more attractive to new drivers by examining pay and working conditions, and barriers to entry.“The perception is that it is a tough job. It is hours, days and weeks away from your family. There needs to be some recognition of that.

Photograph: Peter ByrnePA Wire The Minister for Foregin Affairs has said he does not believe that the UK Government is likely to trigger Article 16 in the near future.Simon Coveney said on Wednesday that he did not think it was likely that Boris Johnson’s Government would take what is seen to be the nuclear option of triggering Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol.Mr Coveney was speaking following comments by Britain’s Brexit minister David Frost at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester, in which he hinted that action over Northern Ireland’s Brexit deal could be taken by Christmas as he called for “short, intensive” talks with the EU to get under way swiftly.If the UK and the EU cannot strike an agreement, Mr Frost said Britain will consider using Article 16.The move would effectively tear up parts of the deal to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, which he negotiated with the EU last December.Mr Frost told the Conservative Party conference in Manchester that he would “soon be sending” new legal texts to the EU with proposals to resolve the “serious political problem”.“I hope that might change over the next couple of weeks or so. It does need to be resolved though, one way or another, whether it’s through negotiations or Article 16,” he told a fringe event arranged by the Policy Exchange think tank.Mr Coveney said on RTE radio that there had been a lot of “tough talk” this week from Mr Frost.He insisted that he did not believe that the UK government would use Article 16.“My understanding is that the British government is not likely to trigger Article 16 any time soon,” he said.The Minister said he believed the UK was “committed to an intensive negotiation process for the rest of this month, with the European Commission, who are developing a new package of measures to try to ensure that we can take on board legitimate concerns that have been expressed with the implementation of the protocol”.Mr Coveney said that the Irish Government and the EU had listened “very carefully” to Mr Frost’s comments but said that he believed negotiations between the two sides would continue.“What we’re trying to do here is ensure that it is implemented in as flexible away as possible to reduce its impact, and I wouldn’t read too much into the tough talk at a Conservative Party conference,” he said.The protocol effectively keeps Northern Ireland in the EU’s single market for goods, but as a result has imposed a trade barrier on products crossing the Irish Sea from Britain.Unionists want Mr Johnson to tear it up, a move he has so far resisted as the Government presses for a renegotiation with Brussels.At a conference fringe event this week, DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said: “We simply cannot allow this situation to continue. And we need to see action taken by the government within weeks.”He added: “We need the government to set up, and to take action to remove this Irish Sea border, remove the barriers to trade within the United Kingdom, and fundamentally to restore Northern Ireland’s place within the UK internal market.”Triggering Article 16 “has its use in the short term”, but legislation was needed “to restore Northern Ireland’s place fully within the United Kingdom,” he said.–PA"},{"url":null,"title":"opinion poll pandemic bonus short lived for government parties","story":"National Development Plan launch: Tánaiste Leo Varadkar, Taoiseach Micheál Martin, Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath and Minister for the Environment Eamon Ryan.

Drop in supportThe sharp drops in support for Fine Gael and for its leader are the most noticeable aspects of the poll, bringing the party to its lowest levels since the last general election. It comes after a difficult period for the Government, and for Fine Gael in particular which faced sustained criticism for the now-abandoned appointment of former minister Katherine Zappone as a special envoy, and a motion of no-confidence in Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney.But the poll results also come after the launch of the National Development Plan earlier this week, which saw the Government pledge to invest €165 billion in capital projects over the next 20 years, and as the pandemic continues to recede.Hopes in the Government parties of a “Covid bounce” have come to nothing, as the political agenda has shifted from managing the pandemic to issues such as health and housing, on which the Government faces severe challenges.The result is the highest ever rating for Sinn Féin in The Ipsos MRBI series. Though the party remains strongest among younger voters and in working class communities, it has also made gains this year among older voters and wealthier voters. Party leader Mary Lou McDonald sees a marginal increase in her satisfaction rating, from 42 to 43 per cent.Fianna Fáil support remains skewed towards older voters, though the party will be happy to have recovered support in Dublin to 16 per cent, twice the level recorded earlier this year.At 7 per cent, the Green Party has recovered to the level of support it won at the last general election, though party leader Eamon Ryan sees his personal approval rating slip by a point to 25 per cent, the lowest of all the party leaders.The poll was conducted among 1,200 adults at 120 sampling points across all constituencies on October 2nd, 4th and 5th.

Photograph:  Hollie AdamsBloombergFrom a circular stage in the centre of a custom-made arena, Boris Johnson teased, cajoled and delighted his audience with a performance that was as much a victory rally and a comedy turn as it was a party conference speech.It was also a demonstration of his dominance over a Conservative Party that has reshaped itself around him and of the extraordinary political style that has driven his success. Earlier in the week Johnson’s ministers addressed the conference in a smaller auditorium with little atmosphere, often to meagre crowds. Now they looked up at their leader like courtiers around their king, grinning uneasily as he tossed a little banter towards one or other of their colleagues. Johnson doubled down on his interpretation of Britain’s fuel, food and labour shortages as a sign that the economy was recovering, telling businesses that they must increase wages to attract British workers. He promised a high-wage, high-productivity economy in place of low wages and low productivity fuelled by high immigration. The problem, as every business group and economist in the country has pointed out, is that increasing wages will not on its own increase productivity. If you pay someone more to do the same job in the same way it is more likely to drive up prices, fuelling inflation that could in turn see interest rates rising. Although Johnson blames EU membership and the free movement of people for Britain’s low-wage economy, its low productivity dates back decades and owes more to under-investment in skills and technology. Supply chainThe prime minister thinks it is up to business to fix Britain’s supply chain problems, but a YouGov poll on Wednesday found that six in 10 people think it is the government’s responsibility. Even among Conservatives, a plurality agree that it is Johnson’s job to deal with the problem. Johnson found no time in his speech to acknowledge that millions of the poorest people in Britain would on Wednesday see their incomes cut by £20 a week. The removal of the coronavirus uplift to the universal credit benefit will, according to some estimates, drive almost a million people into poverty. Within the security cordon in Manchester, Conservative activists spent the week amusing themselves and one another in the warm glow of their political success. But the atmosphere outside is getting chillier as gas prices reach record levels, wages fail to keep up with price rises and businesses struggle with shortages exacerbated by Brexit.

It filled all the jobs the British didn’t want to do. It made the economy more dynamic, and it rescued us from demographic stagnation. For the past twenty years, everyone from big business to the economic establishment to Left-leaning wonks pumping out think-tank papers lectured us on how mass immigration made no difference to wages. In fact, it made us all richer.But hold on. Now that we have left the EU and put in place some modest, normal restrictions on who can come into the country, it turns out that wages – and blue-collar wages most of all – are soaring. The immigration lie has been exposed for what it was. A deceit. And we are owed an apology.If Shell had a couple of tanker drivers for every “expert” who told us that mass, low-skilled immigration had no impact on wages then the fuel crisis would be fixed in the blink of an eye. Common sense, and the briefest acquaintance with chapter one of an economics textbook, would seem to suggest that if you increase the supply of something – in this case workers – then the price will go down. And if there is unlimited extra supply, the price will never go up.Although everyone accepts that that is true of most commodities, for some reason labour was viewed as an exception. In fairness, there are some differences. Additional people earn and spend money, so to some degree expand the economy. And often the new arrivals weren’t competing directly with native workers. Lots of oh-so-clever models were constructed to prove there was no impact. Anyone who argued otherwise was sneered at for ignoring the “evidence” and dubbed a bigot.Now that we have restricted freedom of movement from the EU, what is happening? Wages are rising rapidly. Average earnings are going up 8 per cent annually, and in trades such as transport or construction by 20 per cent.  While this has much to do with the effect of workers returning from furlough, these are still astonishing figures.The Labour Party, the main architect of unrestricted immigration, ties itself up in knots over whether to back a £15 minimum wage, deaf to the irony that most companies would kill to find someone willing to work for less than twenty quid an hour right now. If this was a lab experiment, and to some degree it is, the conclusion would be clear. Turning off the flow of workers increases salaries.With unlimited access to a young, talented workforce from Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, British companies became hooked on cheap labour. Why spend hundreds of thousands of pounds automating that supply depot when an agency in Budapest could supply plenty of guys to do the night shift at minimum wage? Who needs to spend money on complex check-in software for a hotel when you can hire a cheerful Portuguese youngster for peanuts? It was great for profits, and also pretty good for skilled professionals who didn’t compete for those jobs. But it was hardly great for productivity.Even worse, we created industries based entirely on cheap imported labour. Britain is the only major developed country where hand car washes have been available everywhere. We produce far more chicken than Germany, although it is a larger country (and not the organic, free-range kind, but the battery, force-fed stuff) using an immigrant labour force. Does that make any sense? Not really. It is tough for the owners of battery chicken factories, but it makes more sense to import birds from the EU than people.Sure, there will be some disruption. And some prices will rise, although in other cases profits will be lower instead. We are witnessing that now. The Government could have planned for the transition better, and so could business, but we need to keep a couple of points in mind. The market works through shocks and disruption. They are not usually this extreme, to put it mildly, but they are also part of the process. And it is very difficult to plan an economy. You can try, but there’s no point being surprised if it goes wrong.The important point is this. The experts and business leaders who told us immigration didn’t impact wages got it badly wrong. The result? Wages stagnated for millions of blue-collar workers for years. We won’t get an apology – but we also shouldn’t listen to them again.More from NewsThursday morning UK news briefing: Today\u0026#39s top headlines from The Joe Biden and Xi Jinping to hold virtual meeting this yearPrince Andrew\u0026#39s lawyers granted access to \u0026#39settlement agreement\u0026#39 they believe will end case against himExclusive: Navy chief Tony Radakin to be next head of the Armed ForcesSchools reintroduce face masks at the urging of ‘militant Lefty’ council health chiefsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"colonialist wisteria accusations racism control","story":"Sometimes you almost feel sorry for the do-gooders. Imagine you’re the kind of person who’s checked their privilege, passed their unconscious bias training and decolonised their bookshelf. On your day off, you take a nice trip to the botanical gardens, only to discover that you are perpetuating racism by doing so.To uproot racism, we have to start in our gardens. At least that seems to be the takeaway from Art on the Underground - a new sightseeing guide funded by Sadiq Khan’s Transport for London. It claims that south London’s green spaces are full of ‘problematic’ plant-life that needs to be decolonised. Wisteria - your gran’s favourite - has ‘colonial roots’, as it was brought to England by an East India Company tea inspector. Other plants like the kaffir lime and the Hottentot are named after racial slurs, the guide warns. Sometimes the links to the racial slurs are incredibly tenuous. For instance, the London plane tree is also problematic because it descends from an ‘Oriental plane’, and ‘Oriental’ is a bad word we don’t use anymore.If after all that, you still insist on sauntering through the racially insensitive gardens, the guide has some stern warnings about what words you shouldn\u0027t use to talk about the plants. Using the language might accidentally invoke the horrors of the colonial past, it seems. So calling plants ‘exotic’ is a big no-no, as it highlights the differences between indigineous and colonial people (yes, even when you are talking about plants). And saying certain plant species are ‘native’ or ‘invasive’ apparently conjures up ‘histories of conquest’. You may have thought you were having a pleasant stroll through the park, commenting on the pretty flowers. But you were actually reviving the trauma of colonial oppression.Astonishingly, the authors of Art on the Underground are not even the first to make the claim that gardening is racist - systemically racist, in fact. James Wong, BBC presenter and ethnobotanist, believes that ‘UK gardening culture has racism baked into its DNA’. This racism, he argued, is ‘epitomised’ by the use of words like ‘heritage’ and ‘native’ to talk about certain plant types. Elsewhere on the BBC, Countryfile presenters have claimed that the whole countryside is racist - because it is a ‘white environment’. A few years ago, Kingston University ‘decolonised’ a module from its course on rural Britain because it ‘normalised white experiences’.No doubt these anti-racist gardening ethusiasts think they are doing good, that they are challenging the hidden and ‘systemic’ racism that has weeded itself into every area of life - including horticulture. But by seeing racism everywhere, they are trivialising the wrongs of racism and the horrors of colonialism and slavery.James Wong’s ‘gardening is racist’ spiel makes this clear. Wong was invited to discuss his thesis at length on a podcast for Channel 4. In the words of the programme guide, Wong appeared ‘in the wake of the judgment of the Derek Chauvin murder trail’ - referring to the man who killed George Floyd - to talk about ‘how he thinks we need to readdress ersity within UK gardening culture’. Essentially, Wong and Channel 4 somehow managed to place the brutal police murder of a black man and microaggressions at the Chelsea Flower Show on the same spectrum of racism. Perhaps the real lesson of the George Floyd killing is that there should be more panellists of colour on Gardeners’ Question Time?But on top of all that, there is also something quite nasty and underhand about pointing at everything and calling it ‘racist’. Taking everything that brings people joy - from classic films and books to great art and even gardening - and to declare it evil, wicked and beyond the pale truly poisons the soil. More from NewsThursday morning UK news briefing: Today\u0026#39s top headlines from The Joe Biden and Xi Jinping to hold virtual meeting this yearPrince Andrew\u0026#39s lawyers granted access to \u0026#39settlement agreement\u0026#39 they believe will end case against himExclusive: Navy chief Tony Radakin to be next head of the Armed ForcesSchools reintroduce face masks at the urging of ‘militant Lefty’ council health chiefsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"exclusive navy chief tony radakin next head armed forces","story":"The First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff has been selected by the Prime Minister as the next head of the Armed Forces, The  can reveal. Admiral Sir Tony Radakin will take over from General Sir Nick Carter as Chief of the Defence Staff, making him the first military chief to come from the Navy since Admiral Sir Michael Boyce in 2001.Sources close to General Sir Patrick Sanders, who was seen as the First Sea Lord’s biggest threat to securing the role and believed to be the Ministry of Defence’s recommendation for the position, confirmed he had not been successful in the race.  They added that he was “relaxed” about the decision.Downing Street is expected on Thursday to formally announce Boris Johnson\u0027s choice of defence chief.It is understood that Vice-Admiral Sir Ben Key, who led the Afghanistan evacuation and is in charge of all overseas military operations, will be promoted to Admiral and replace Sir Tony as First Sea Lord. The contest for the new head of the Armed Forces has long been considered a two-horse race between Sir Tony, for his knowledge of the seas and Sir Patrick, owing to his deep understanding of how to integrate cyber capabilities into the Armed Forces.However, others in the mix to clinch the post included General Sir Mark Carleton-Smith, the former head of Britain’s special forces and a personal friend of Mr Johnson. Under Sir Tony, the UK has seen two new aircraft carriers brought into service.

Champagne production is down 60 per cent.However, this is less likely to affect consumers this winter as European wine is more likely to be bottled and cellared for longer than wine from the southern hemisphere.Mr Beale, who is leading a campaign for a cut to the duty on wine ahead of the budget, said: “If you can’t get a New Zealand sauvignon blanc, you would be looking to replace it with a similar product, but it’s not obvious what you replace it with.“There’s South America, but it’s not the same quality.”More from NewsThursday morning UK news briefing: Today\u0026#39s top headlines from The Joe Biden and Xi Jinping to hold virtual meeting this yearPrince Andrew\u0026#39s lawyers granted access to \u0026#39settlement agreement\u0026#39 they believe will end case against himExclusive: Navy chief Tony Radakin to be next head of the Armed ForcesSchools reintroduce face masks at the urging of ‘militant Lefty’ council health chiefsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"thursday morning uk news briefing todays top headlines telegraph","story":"Welcome to your early morning news briefing from The  - a round-up of the top stories we are covering on Thursday.

The Prime Ministeraposs speech is usually a highly-anticipated event but Mr Johnsonaposs  minute address only included one reheated policy announcement and a string of bad jokes. The speech came against a backdrop of soaring bills and shortages of fuel and food supplies - but with little detail on how the Government plans to help struggling families. The address, which was branded tone-deaf by critics, marked the pinnacle of the four-day gathering of Tory faithful in Manchester. Here are the moments from Conservative party conference that remind us who is in Government.  DWP chief has the aposTime of her Leapos while slashing benefits Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey performed an enthusiastic rendition of the  power ballad at a karaoke bash hours before she cut Universal Credit for .million Brits. She joined forces with fellow Tory minister Will Quince for the performance - which was criticised as tone deaf.Today she will oversee the end of the £-a-week Universal Credit uplt, the biggest overnight welfare cut since the Second World War. Labouraposs Jonathan Reynolds said: “The Secretary of State singing that she is having the ‘time of her le’ while making families £, a year worse off today is frankly an insult and a disgrace.Dominic Raab confuses meaning of misogyny - as Tories refuse to make it a hate crime Dominic Raab was mocked when he appeared to confuse the meaning of misogyny - defined as hatred or contempt for women.The Justice Secretary, who has previously said he isnapost a feminist, was mocked when he mistakenly said it was absolutely wrong, whether it is a man against a woman or a woman against a man. In a disastrous BBC Breakfast interview from the Tory party conference, Mr Raab had to be told the definition of misogyny by presenter Sally Nugent.  Boris Johnson rejected growing calls make misogyny a hate crime amid widespread anger over womenaposs safety in the wake of Sarah Everardaposs murder. Mr Johnson said: Rather than expanding the range of crimes we want to prosecute for, we need to prosecute the existing crimes.” He admitted that the anger over Sarah Everardaposs murder is a symptom of a wider frustration that people feel. However, he added: I think that what we should do is prosecute people for the crimes we have on the statute book.  Oliver Dowden tells civil servants to aposget off their pelotonsapos Conservative Party chairman Oliver Dowden went on a bizarre rant when he ordered civil servants to “get off their Pelotons and back to their desks”. Mr Dowden accused Whitehall officials of owning the high-end exercise bike, which costs £, plus a £-a-month subscription.Chancellor Rishi Sunak has spoken about how he owns one of the expensive spin bikes.Mr Dowden also threatened to withdraw cash from taxpayer-backed firms, warning: go too woke, risk going broke. And he said billionaires pay vast sums to dine in secret with Boris Johnson out of “civic duty”.  MP goes on bizarre rant about woke-ing from home Tory MP Jake Berry accused civil servants of being too slow toto the office - and too woke - in baffling comments to a Tory fringe. Many people - factory workers in my constituency, people working in our shops, people working in our public services - need to get back to work. And the government can give leadership here, he said. Because we absolutely have to get the civil service back into the office. Itaposs time to end the Whitehall aposwoke-ingapos from home culture - sorry, working from home culture, but it really is majority aposwoke-ingapos from home. FDA general secretary Dave Penman tweeted: You can just smell the desperation in their argument when they need to invent a culture war to justy their point.Rishi Sunak refuses to budge on Universal CreditThe Chancellor made it clear he was tightening the purse strings in his conference speech.Mr Sunak failed to mention the major cuts imposed to Universal Credit but he said people should be in work rather than reliant on benefits.He said: Is the answer to their hopes and dreams just to increase their benefits  Is the answer to tell that young family the economic system is rigged against you and the only way you stand a chance is to lean ever more on the state   He added: I believe that the only sustainable route out of poverty comes from having a good job. But critics accused him of failing to put forward a plan to helping struggling families. Mass slaughter of pigs doesnapost matter - as they would have been bacon, says PM Boris Johnson suggested that it wouldnapost matter, pigs have to be killed and dumped in skips due to shortages of abattoir staff - as they would have become bacon anyway.Pig farmers are furious that they are having to slaughter and dump animals as they donapost have enough butchers to prepare the meat to sell in shops. The PM cruelly suggested this didnapost matter, saying he had considered pointing out that is what happens to pigs in this country”. Pressed on the welfare issues, he replied: “I’m afraid they’re eaten very often in this country - I don’t know, do you have a bacon sandwich  “That is what happens. Pig farmers in... my family used to farm pigs as it happens have an extremely … look, just tell me, I’ve got to break it to you, thatyou have a bacon sandwich - have you ever had a bacon sandwich  Don’t dodge it, have you ever had a bacon sandwich ” Tax Marcus Rashford to fund football pitches, urges backbencher Tory backbencher Ben Bradley joked that Marcus Rashford should be taxed to pay for the FAaposs bid to upgrade grounds to G - which consist of synthetic turf, sand infill and rubber infill. The footballer twice shamed the Government into funding free school meals during the holidays - and riled Tory MPs by doing so.  Mr Bradley, who is also Leader of Nottinghamshire County Council, told a conference event that new taxes on the rich were not ideal. But he added: I was talking to the FA the other day about their need for more G football pitches and I thought aposyou could tax Marcus Rashford for thatapos - so maybe there are examples. Nadine Dorries blasts BBC nepotism - after paying her daughters public cash The newly-minted Culture Secretary didnapost mince her words during a Tory conference event where she blasted the BBC for being elitist. Ms Dorries, who grew up in a working class family in Liverpool, said people from her background struggled to find jobs at the BBC and in the arts.  We’re having a discussion about how the BBC can become more representative of the people who pay the licence fee, and how it can be more accessible to people from all backgrounds, not just people whose mum and dad worked there, she said. Ms Dorries neglected to mention that she had employed her daughters Phillipa, then , and Jenner, then  - in secretarial roles in her private office in . Both daughters were paid from public funds at a cost to the taxpayer of up to £,, the Mirror revealed at the time. Supermarket shortages could be an opportunity, says one MP Tory MP Chris Loder sparked a backlash when he tried to claim the shortages facing shoppers were a great opportunity. The backbencher told a fringe event that there could be benefits in seeing supermarket supply chains crumble - as farmers would be able to sell their products in village shops. He went on: “I know it might not feel like it in the immediate term. But it is in our mid and long-term interest that these logistics chains do break.  “It will mean that the farmer down the street will be able to sell their milk in the village shop like they did decades ago. It is because these commercial predators – that is the supermarkets – have wiped that out and I’d like to see that come back.” Liz Truss claims Boris Johnson is not responsible whataposs in the shops Foreign Secretary Liz Truss insisted that it wasnapost Boris Johnsonaposs fault that shelves are bare - despite him being the PM. Ms Truss, a long-time Johnson cheerleader, said it wasnapost the PMaposs responsibility to keep the shops stocked. She told a fringe event hosted by the aposs Chopperaposs Politics Podcast: I donapost believe in a command and control economy, so I donapost believe that the Prime Minister is responsible for whataposs in the shops. She added: This is why we have a free enterprise economy. Iaposm sure the goods will be delivered into our shops.

Therese Coffey jumped up and down and danced with abandon at a Tory conference karaoke party last night. The Work and Pensions Secretary sang the uplting  power ballad, made famous in the film Dirty Dancing, with fellow Tory minister Will Quince.Today she will oversee the end of the £-a-week Universal Credit uplt, the biggest overnight welfare cut since the Second World War. The -month-long Covid benefit will be removed from payments arriving between October  and November , plunging hundreds of thousands into poverty and affecting more than million children.  Mr Quince was until recently the minister responsible for Universal Credit and is now the Minister for Children and Families at the Department for Education. We asked Ms Coffey this morningshe regretted her choice of karaoke but she refused to comment. We asked the welfare chiefshe thought it was fair that she appeared to be having the time of her le while families braced for sleepless nights, worriedthey will be able to feed their children. She declined to comment. Askedshe had anything to tell claimants who have been left in impossible situations, she still declined to comment.  Landlords, mortgage lenders, debt charities, homelessness groups and Save The Children are among those opposing the benefit cut. Six former Tory Work and Pensions Secretaries have also hit out at the move, while Tory MP Nigel Mills yesterday warned: “We may end up going so far that we look cruel and harsh, leaving people in an impossible situation.”  But the Prime Minister has refused to U-turn - instead unveiling a £million hardship fund that is a tenth of the amount being cut.Cruel Mr Johnson claims “there is no alternative” other than waiting for the free market to produce higher wages - despite families facing a winter of discontent with soaring inflation and higher energy bills.The RSA think tank today warns the cut will hit “levelling-up” areas in the north and Midlands hardest.  Priority levelling-up fund areas have % more claimants than lower-priority ones, with % of those in priority areas claiming the benefit. Hannah Webster, joint head of people and place at the RSA, said: “It still isn’t too late to change course. By reconsidering the imminent cut to Universal Credit, the government will help ensure everyone has access to a system of support that allows them to meet their needs.” Labour will today unveil an ad van outside the Manchester conference demanding Boris Johnson “cancel the cut”, styled in Tory blue. Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said: “The Secretary of State singing that she is having the ‘time of her le’ while making families £, a year worse off today is frankly an insult and a disgrace. “It is not too late for the Government to reverse this disastrous decision, support struggling families and cancel this cut.”The Work and Pensions Secretary is understood to be lobbying for a cut to the ‘taper rate’ of Universal Credit in this month’s Budget.That would allow up to .million working claimants to keep p of every £ they earn from wages, rather than p as is the case now. But such a change in the taper rate would not make up for the £ cut for the vast majority of claimants. Ms Coffey is a regular on the conference karaoke scene and once sang aposDonapost Stop Me Nowapos with Matt Hancock. Read more She said at a reception earlier in the evening: Last night at conference is the best night.... I love conference. Itaposs not just about the karaoke... itaposs not just about the drinks that are there. What I love is that we genuinely get to see each other and wow, what a dference it makes to be here in person. She added: We are genuinely here to govern the country to make le changes for people in this country.Other Tories were spotted dancing last night too, with Michael Gove boogieing to ‘I wanna Dance with Somebody’.And Liz Truss was seen dancing to ‘Simply The Best’ at a gay club on the city’s Canal Street.

But after finding a miracle cure, shes got her le backGeorgie suffered from a debilitating phobia for years Image: Jam PressByAmy WaltersJessica TaylorReal le features writer:,  Oct Updated:,  Oct | commentsA mum-of-two who was terried to drink blackcurrant juice in case it killed her says sheaposs found a miracle cure for her rare phobia. Georgie Ferdinand, , developed thanatophobia, the fear of death and illness, after falling pregnant with her son Joseph, now four, in . At first, she thought her unusual fear was down to the hormones from pregnancy and the way her body changed. Initially, I thought this was something that everyone goes through and that worrying about not being there for your kids was fine - but these feelings just kept intensying over time, she said. I started to have a bizarre fear of blackcurrant juice, as I believed that I would get gravely sickI took a sip and I wouldn’t step onto a train or go out with friends out of the fear that I would lose control over the situation.For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here Georgie, who also has a two-year-old daughter called Millie, added TikTok made her fears worse. The more videos I watched of morbid illnesses and dark things, the more these videos were shown on my page. Being flooded with these videos trick your mind and it sent me to such a dark place where I was thinking and worrying about something bad happening to me non-stop. Her mental state became to bad she deleted the app - but it didnapost stop her from spiralling. The mum, from Sittingbourne, said: I would think that I had cancer and would die young, so I used to jump on Google to search for my symptoms which would get me in a panic and I wouldn’t know what to do with myself.One common thought would be that as soon as I had a small headache, that I had a brain tumour and I was dying - which I was genuinely convinced about each time. Although Georgie managed to conceal her phobia from her kids, the symptoms got so bad she stopped them from going to soft play or hanging out with other kids in case they got sick. When lockdown hit and everyone was forced to stay at home, Georgie says she actually felt more in control. But she was aware she needed to get help. She decided to contact Aaron Surtees at City Hypnosis, in the hope hypnotherapy would do the trick. At her first session with Aaron in June, she described how he sat her in an armchair and played relaxing rain sounds in the background. She said: During my session, he told me to practice holding my thumb and middle finger together and as soon as I did this, I had an intense tingling sensation flood my entire body. I was told that this was the ‘bad energy’ coming out and I had to visualise my happy place, which was being at home with my kids. Words cannot describe how I felt afterwards - it was like a weight had been lted off my shoulders and I felt like a dferent person. Both my mum and sister said I looked so relaxed and sleepy after my session and I was in such a fantastic state of mind.  And after just one session, Georgie managed to go on a night out with her friends. Since the session with Aaron, the stay-at-home mum says her condition and mental state has only improved. She said: “Hypnotherapy was the best thing I have ever done. I’m no longer car sick or get anxious about going somewhere and I even went to Wales a couple of weeks ago for a wedding - where I actually enjoyed myself. I’m living le to the full and don’t panic about something being wrong anymore. Instead, I’m enjoying being as happy as can be with my two kids and I urge anyone who’s going through something similar to consider hypnotherapy. “My two kids have noticed a huge change in me and I’m so happy to finally have my le back.Were you cured of an unusual phobia  Email jessica.taylor@reachplcComment MORE ON Hypnotism\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He has been jailed for nine yearsBenjamin Welsh has been jailed for nine years Image: GMP   SWNSByAshley PembertonChiara Fiorillo:,  Oct A dad who left his four-month-old son with catastrophic injuries after he shook him violently because he wouldnapost stop crying has been jailed for nine years. Benjamin Welsh, , grabbed hold of the tot and viciously attacked him in August last year, leaving him with le-changing injuries. The boy was initially not expected to live after suffering a catastrophic brain injury and will require constant care for le. While his carers say he is a fighter, the court heard that the baby will never be able to live a normal le due to his injuries and may have a reduced le expectancy. Welsh and the boyaposs mother Elisha Wilson, , failed to seek medical attention for the baby for  hours after the incident, Manchester Crown Court heard. Welsh, of Salford, admitted to causing grievous bodily harm with intent to the child, who cannot be named for legal reasons. He and Wilson both pleaded guilty to child cruelty. On August  last year, the couple took their baby to the Royal Bolton Hospital claiming their child had been unwell and gone floppy with Welsh performing CPR on him. Medics, however, noticed the child had multiple bruising, on his knee and ears, with a CT scan also revealing brain injuries and a ruptured liver. Mark Kellett, prosecuting, said the baby was taken to Manchester Childrenaposs Hospital and the police were called. Welsh claimed he had no idea how these injuries had occurred, saying it could have been due to CPR. Wilsonaposs phone records, however, showed she had searched online can throwing and shaking a baby cause brain damage, shaking baby cause them to go floppy and affect eyes. Chillingly, she also searched for what happens when u strangle a baby. Mr Kellett told the court Welsh then admitted he had been struggling to cope with a newborn baby. Wilson told police the baby had woken up the previous day crying and Welsh had become angry. He started shouting at him to shut up before hitting the baby near the hip, grabbing him, and slamming him to the floor with force before shaking him. At this time doctors had concluded that the babyaposs injuries were not as a result of just CRP but likely indicative of shaking with signicant force, the court heard. Judge Patrick Field QC told Welsh the baby was utterly dependent upon his parents and relied on them to protect him from harm. The judge added: You attacked him because he would not stop crying and you couldnapost cope with that. I have to say that is an inadequate and selfish explanation. Judge Field added that Welshaposs shaking of the boy caused catastrophic brain injury with extremely serious consequences. He told the court it could not be ruled out that the bruising to the baby was caused by Welshaposs CPR.  But the judge ruled this did not amount to a full explanation, saying that Welsh had struckas well as shaking him. He said: I must not lose sight of the facts that the most serious injury was to the brain and this was caused by violent shaking. You realised what you had done and tried to help your son and tried to do CPR. Whataposs plain however from your guilty plea is that your efforts to help your son went no further than that. He was gravely ill after the attack and in need of urgent help. You did nothing more for  hours to help your son and when you took him to the hospital you actively tried to mislead the doctors and nurses. You were more concerned for yourself than you were for him because you know that your violent outburst caused him serious harm. He then told Wilson: You acknowledge your guilt in failing to seek medical attention and you knew he needed to go to hospital and you failed to act in his interests and you misled doctors. Their failure to seek medical attention was described as deliberate and wilful by the judge which signicantly increased the risk of death and undoubtedly caused pain and stress for the child. Welsh was said to be a young and immature -year-old man at the time of the incident, who suffered from mental health dficulties. Judge Field added: It is plain as a new father you had limited support because of the lockdown and you were under stress but this does not excuse what you did.is not in any way responsible for your upset. Judge Field sentenced Wilson, currently pregnant with a second child, to a -month suspended jail sentence and noted she had been in an abusive relationship. He told her: You have demonstrated remorse with your guilty plea and gave signicant assistance to the prosecution. Judge Field concluded by paying tribute to the medical and non-medical staff who are responsible for the care of this gravely injured boy. A statement by a spokesman for the babyaposs current carers, read out at a previous hearing, said: We are all worried about what the future holds. He will require a high level of continuous care throughout his le. It is not yet known how his vision, and hearing will develop, or whether he will be able to smell or taste. It is expected that he will require a peg tube for feeding.This wonderful little boy, who amazes us all every day, will tragically never live a le that is anywhere near what we can consider normal.He will require a high level of continuous care throughout his le.

Fire crews rushed to the scene on the northbound carriageway between junctions  and  and worked for more than two hours to extinguish the flames.The inferno caused misery for hundreds of motorists who faced y traffic delays between Lymm and Woolston. Cheshire Police confirmed that the driver was not injured and remained at the scene to assist officers and fire investigators.  Shocking photos released by the fire service show the charred remains of packets of Birdseye potato waffles loaded on the back of the HGV. A Cheshire Fire and Rescue Service spokesman said: Firefighters are dealing with a HGV on fire on the M northbound, Thelwall viaduct between junctions  and . Crews wearing breathing apparatus are tackling the fire using three hose reels. They later added: Firefighters are continuing to shuttle water to the scene and are now tackling the fire using two hose reels. A recovery vehicle is currently at the scene waiting to remove the vehicle. Plans are being put in place to remove the contents of the lorry. A Highways England spokesperson said: There are severe delays of at least  minutes above usual journey times approaching the scene of a lorry which has caught fire at J. Cheshire Fire and Rescue Service are on scene and lead the response to this incident. Lanes  and have been closed. The fire has been extinguished and the recovery vehicle is in place to start removing the contents of the lorry. Highways England have resources at the scene assisting with traffic management and carrying out assessments regarding the necessary repair and clear up works which will be required following the vehicles successful recovery. The current lane closures are expected to remain in place throughout the day. The M northbound was fully shut for around an hour before reopening at .am while junction  remains closed as well as two lanes of the main carriageway.

With last winter disrupted by lockdown, and young people missing so much school, college, time with friends and seeing grandparents, getting the vaccine will help make sure this year is a whole lot better. Not only does the vaccine protect young people against serious illness – almost  per cent of Covid patients admitted to hospital are unvaccinated – it also means they’re less likely to spread the virus to elderly family members. No more FOMO We’ve come a long way with the vaccination programme since those dark days of last winter. The Covid- vaccine has already saved more than , lives and prevented  million infections.Jabs are now being rolled out for the - age group, and more than  per cent of --year-olds have already had theirs. And getting the jab couldn’t be easier: schools and colleges are offering it through their immunisation programmes, while older teenagers can make an appointment through the online booking service at nhs.uk covidvaccination.If you’re a parent orof a --year-old, schools will ask for your consent before they receive the vaccine, and you can help --year-olds book their dose online. Then it’s one less thing for you to worry about – and they won’t need to worry about missing out on all those good times with family and friends.Fashion and lestyle influencer Arabella Daho , , is keen to book her vaccine appointment. “I think the vaccine is a great thing for everyone to have – it’s helping to keep us safe, she says. We have loads of events coming up such as Halloween and Christmas, and we don’t want to miss them. “On my digital s I’ve interviewed a few of the doctors who worked on the vaccine, talking about how safe it is, and why it’s important for everyone to get it. It was good to talk to them – I learned a lot, soanyone wants to see those videos or do research to help them feel better about getting the vaccine, I think they should. “Young people think they’re immune to everything, but we can actually be spreading Covid, especially to older people, who are more vulnerable. So getting jabbed helps communities and families get back to normal.” ‘All my kids have had their vaccines’ We asked GP and mum-of-three Dr Dawn Harper about what the vaccine means for young people… How do you feel about your kids being offered the vaccine  All my kids are in their s and they’ve all had their vaccines. I was very keen for them to get vaccinated as soon as they were eligible. If I had a -to--year-old I’d be putting them forward for the vaccine. We’ve been able to draw on global data several countries have already been offering the vaccine to --year-olds, and we have a lot of evidence to show that it’s safe for that age group. And while young people are less likely to become seriously ill with Covid, I am in total agreement with the chief medical officers concerning the impact on their mental health and their education, and also the possibility of long Covid. And, of course, we are only enjoying the relative freedoms we have today in the UK because of the vaccine programme. Without it, we’d still be in a lockdown. We need the vaccine to protect ourselves from Covid and long Covid, and also to protect our loved ones and our community. So I’m very keen for young people to come forward and have the vaccine. Did you have to persuade your children to have the jab  They were up for it. For me, lockdown was easier: I’m  and don’t mind walking my dog on my own, but I think young people really struggled missing out on their social lives.  What are the side effects of the vaccine in young people  The main one is perhaps a bit of soreness in the arm. I had a sore arm after my first vaccine but nothing at all after my second. It’s incredibly safe. I’m still amazed at how the researchers worked to get this to market as quickly as they did, running trials simultaneously without cutting safety corners. Long Covid is a worry for many parents. Will the vaccine protect young people against it  I have patients with long Covid. It is a horrible condition and there is evidence that the vaccine protects against this. We’re still on a very steep learning curve with long Covid. It’s unpredictable. We have fit young people who have been knocked sideways by it. The things that people talk to me about is the fatigue, the brain fog – I’ve got patients who are very intelligent academics who just can’tat work. Is the vaccine suitable for vegans and people with food allergies  It’s totally vegan-friendly and not a problem for those with allergies. What about those who are scared of needles  For the -to- age group, school nurses are well experienced in managing this. If you’re nervous you can ask to lie down. You can also buy over-the-counter cream to rub into your arm  minutes beforehand. I don’t even think I felt my second vaccine going in it’s such a tiny needle. For a moment of a sharp scratch, to know that you’re protected against Covid it’s well worth the trade-off. Has the vaccine been rigorously tested on the younger age group  Yes, I feel very confident about the science behind it. There’s been a lot of debate on risk vs benefit in dferent age groups. Young people are less likely to get seriously ill, but we need to weigh that against missed education, protection from long Covid and letting kids get out and about again so that we can help them with any mental health issues. If you come from a middle-class background where you’ve all got your own computers, home schooling was much easier thanyou’re all trying to share one screen, so it’s really important that we try to even out those dferences and get people back into the classroom.Last winter’s lockdown was so tough on young people’s mental health. Does the vaccine mean that things will be better this year  That wouldbe my hope. We’ll see messages coming out about meeting outside and ventilation I still wear a mask in the supermarket we have hand sanitiser in our bags and our cars, and I think that makes sense. But expanding the vaccine programme to include these younger people will mean that hopefully they can start to get back to some kind of normality. AGED  OR  If you have a teenager who hasn’t booked their vaccine yet, you can give them a helping hand so that they don’t get left behind – and protect the rest of the family from serious illness. Jabs can now be booked online at nhs.uk covidvaccination, or you can ask your GP or go to your nearest walk-in centre. PARENT OR CARER OF A --YEAR-OLD Offering young people the vaccine is essential to prevent them missing school and help make sure they can carry on doing the things they love with their friends and family. Everyone in this age group will be offered a first dose of the Pfizer vaccine through their school’s immunisation programme, which already administers the HPV and MMR vaccines. Parents and s will be asked for their consent via a form – andyou have any questions you can discuss them with the School Age Immunisation Service."},{"url":null,"title":"lockdown loneliness left roaming house","story":":root Exclusive: Lockdown loneliness left woman, , roaming house with just the cat to talk toA lonely figure cowering in hot, tangled bedsheets, -year-old Joyce Taylor felt a pounding in her chest so painful she struggled for breaththis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video mirror-head-strong-joyce-shares-,customFields:,clearance:Site Only,source:dbbbdcd,sourceUrl:,site:Mirror,brandSafety: Sport and specialist news – passed for ad targeting,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:ffqYE,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

A lonely figure cowering in hot, tangled bedsheets, the -year-old felt a pounding in her chest so painful she struggled for breath. This sense of panic had been reoccurring every night since she began shielding at her Manchester home alone at the beginning of the pandemic, her heart beating fast, the words of that evening’s television news about hospitalisations and deaths whirring in her mind, forcing her to roam the house for hours. The retired clerical worker who suffers MS would implore her elderly cat, Amber, her only company for months: “When will this end ” But Amber could only stare mutely in response.Have you struggled with your mental health in lockdown  Email webnews@mirror to tell your story That night, Joyce thought she was having a heart attack. “It was like the walls were closing in on me,” she recalls. “I just felt so hot, I had palpitations, my heart was pounding and I had a pain in my chest.” She rang her son who rushed her to AE. Doctors diagnosed an anxiety attack. Joyce was speechless – never in her le had she suffered them before. “I have been through quite a lot of trauma, my MS diagnosis, my husband dying, my mum dying, looking after them both. So to be suffering them at this time in my le, I was surprised,” she admits. But sadly, there is little surprising about Joyce’s anxiety attacks. Older people, advised to shield when Covid- struck, and reminded repeatedly of their vulnerability, have seen a dramatic decline in their mental health.  Those like Joyce who live alone have faced often debilitating isolation, with one study showing shielders faced “markedly higher” levels of depression and anxiety, symptoms twice as common among high-risk iniduals who were isolating. Many found themselves parted from partners in care homes, or tragically grieving. The number of over-s bereaved rose by %. Now in Day Four of our HeadStrong: Better Mental Health For All campaign, we can reveal exclusive data released to the Daily Mirror from charity Independent Age shows almost half of older people say their mental health has got worse because of the pandemic. Twenty-nine percent say they feel sad, low or depressed about the future, % are still anxious about getting Covid-, and % say they will continue to feel lonely despite the end of lockdown. For many older people, the lting of restrictions has not meant the end of anxiety, or even shielding. Joyce admits, despite being double vaccinated, it was only six weeks ago she ventured out again to art and exercise classes which stopped in March . “I can’t get the bus or taxis, anywhere that’s busy I feel on edge,” she explains. “I still feel tired from living in a constant state of stress,” she admits, adding she continues to take the anti-depressant prescribed to her during the pandemic.  Data published fortnightly by the ONS reveals for the last seven-day period surveyed in mid-September, an estimated , people aged + in Great Britain did not leave their house. In that same time frame, an estimated . million older people said they did not feel comfortable leaving home due to the pandemic. “Older people are often overlooked in the discussion about mental health but they cannot be left behind,” says Deborah Alsina MBE, Chief Executive of Independent Age. “The Government must take forward learnings from COVID- and prioritise funding of mental health support.” Joyce’s story is very typical. When Covid hit, her cleaner stopped coming, and her sons could only drop her shopping off at the door. Despite being  flats in her retirement complex, the communal garden was a “ghost town”. Every night her anxiety would soar “sky high”, and the insomnia caused debilitating fatigue which worsened her MS symptoms.

Her thoughts became dominated by her own death, and a feeling she no longer wanted to carry on. “I had this fixed in my head,I catch Covid I will die,” she recalls.“I remember Boris Johnson advising older people to have a serious chat with their relatives, so I talked to my sons about the end of my le.”Desperately sadly, she recalls: “I apologised in advance for the clutter in my flat that they would have to sort out. I discussed my funeral, said I didn’t want a fuss.” She adds: “There were moments I didn’t want to carry on.”The Daily Mirror is launching our new campaign HeadStrong: Better Mental Health For All.

Thankfully, Joyce felt able to call her GP, who referred her to Age UK Manchester’s Counselling Service, and regular therapy plus medication has helped her manage her anxiety. In early  the charity’s service provided  hours of counselling a month. This has now increased to an average of  per month, sometimes nearly . Service manager Peter Ireland describes callers suffering anxiety, depression, and complicated bereavement, as well as health anxiety, stress from caring during Covid, and isolation. He describes one client with COPD living in a small bedsit for whom shielding caused claustrophobia. “We had another client whose husband died of Covid and due to her own shielding she could not attend his funeral,” he adds. “They had been married  years. Counselling helped her with her complicated grieving process and guilt.” He says: “For some of our clients there was a general fear of this invisible enemy and they became fearful of other people, of going shopping, or going out for a walk. Even though the lockdown is over for many people, the fear, anxiety and mistrust carries on for them.”  But while Joyce asked for help, many older people have not. Professor Carolyn Chew-Graham, an academic specialising in older people and mental health, who also works as a GP, explains Covid’s message of ‘Protect the NHS’ made many reluctant to bother their surgery. They were also put off by online consulting, or fearful of attending in person. She says older people often still feel a stigma around mental health, and this is exacerbated by too many GPs “normalising” mental health problems in older patients, and not asking about their mood. Referral rates to NHS psychological therapiesfor over-s are always lower than they should be. While the target for the age group is % of all referrals, pre-pandemic they made up just .%. And this actually fell, to .%, by the start of this year.  Professor Chew-Graham says: “It has always been a hidden problem, now it’s more hidden.” And she starkly explains as well as quality of le, le itself is at risk for older peopletheir mental health is not supported. “Older adults also self-harm and kill themselves,” she explains. “Nice guidance on self-harm talks about cutting and overdose, but the older adults we have spoken to say this can include binge eating, excess alcohol, maybe not taking your tablets or following your diabetes diet.” And she adds depression can also worsen physical conditions, even fatally. “One of the key things is depression can make other long term conditions worse,” she says. “It can make the outcomes poorer for diabetes or heart disease. This can result in earlier deaths.” While support has now helped Joyce venture beyond her four walls, many older people still remain inside, desperately in need.How to get help: If you are struggling or you are worried about a loved one, contact Samaritans on .

The mum, from Cornwall, has also already bought all her Christmas presents.She keeps to a strict budget, grabbing decorations throughout the year from charity shops and from Facebook Marketplace.  She said: “We adore Christmas, it’s a magical time of year - so why not start it early  My family loves it too - including my partner Derren. We’ve been putting up our Christmas tree in October for years. “My two youngest help me put up the decorations - and they have their own Christmas trees too. They love it and it’s something we do together every year - it’s such a magical time. “My dad left my mum and I when I was a baby on Christmas Eve, so my mum made sure to make Christmas special every year. She’s our superhero - and I want to carry on the same tradition.” But Tracey, who posted a photo of her tree on social media, said not everyone is appreciative of her getting into the Christmas spirit early. She said: Response is ided on social media. Lots of people say it’s taking away the magic of children for the children - but mine adore Christmas. “We have birthdays in October, November and December, so they all have a Christmas theme.  “I would say to all the Grinches out there, live and let live - you don’t have to live with ityou don’t want to! There’s too much sadness in the world, so why not make Christmas last longer! Tracey says the colour theme of her decorations changes every year - and she’s opted for purple and silver this year. She added: It took more than five hours to put up all the decorations, and there are six sets of lights on my tree. The kids held the lights and span around the tree with me - and we did it while listening to Christmas songs. “I’ve already done all my Christmas shopping, and I do Christmas Park Savings - a savings club throughout the year - to make it more affordable. “I look in charity shops for decorations - they’re amazing, and you know it’s making you happy and it’s for a good cause.

It seems to always roll around at this time of year but then, like Halloween, it’s forgotten and gone. Except for those who have mental illness – we always remember, whatever the day. Why is there so little attention paid to mental illness unless accompanied with eyes rolled heavenward  One in four people is affected that’s a pretty large chunk of the population. If it’s not you, it’s your cousin, mother or friend. If they don’t say they have it, it’s probably fear of rejection by friends, being fired at work or, worse, being pitied. Why is it that every organ in your body can go down and you’ll get a sympathy card, except the brain  When I was institutionalised, I got very few good luck cards or flowers. If I had a broken leg or a case of shingles, I’d be ­inundated. I just got a few phone calls telling me to “Perk up”. Oh, “Perk up ” I didn’t think of that! Do you agree with Ruby  Have your say in the comment section Not only do people think you’re making it up but in the end, you think you’re making it up, stigmatising yourself more than anyone  can. When you have a mental disorder, like depression, you get a big double whammy –you’re ill but you can’t tell you’re ill.Because when the very thing that makes these assessments – your brain – has gone down, it can’t give a correct reading. If you had a spare brain it would tell you, but you don’t. I had to ask my agentshe thought I was crazy and she said: “Yes”.  I just thought my old personality had been replaced by a block of cement and that depressed me even more. Maybe you don’t want to do anything about it or tell anyone because of something you get free with the package: shame. You don’t just have the few usual nagging thoughts with this illness, you get hundreds of thousands of self-critical thoughts. If the devil had Tourette’s, it would sound like that. If you go to an emergency ward and tell them you’re having a mental breakdown, good luck getting a bed or even seeing a nurse.  I’ve known people on the cusp of suicide who’ve been told there’s a waiting list of six months –they’re lucky. If you had a heart attack, you’re whipped to a hospital immediately. Something “mental” just doesn’t cut it. The word “mental” has been taken too lightly for too long. Mental wellbeing is a repulsively soft expression. What does it mean  It’s the mothership that determines your every thought and action – move, plan, dream… you name it, the brain makes it.The Daily Mirror is launching our new campaign HeadStrong: Better Mental Health For All. We’re calling for:Early Access Mental Health Hubs for under s to be rolled out across the country, with at least one for each trust. Waiting times to be cut so people actually start treatment with a professional within four weeks The Govt to fill in the gaps in care - an end of red tape which means many don’t fit the set criteria to get help plus , more mental health staffCompulsory Mental Health education lessons in schools, plus paid counsellors in schools and care homesWant to help  Write to your MP and ask them to support the current Early Day Motion  to debate mental health and the pandemic in parliament. It’s what defines who you are and really is the only thing that counts as far as your existence, so why is it always last on the list of where the money for research goes  Mental is physical and physical is mental. The body and the mind are connected – it’s like a onesie. When the mothership gets overloaded or distressed, it sends a message through the body to release cortisol. The good news is it gets you ready for flight or fight or freeze for the purpose of survival. The bad news is,the cortisol doesn’t shut off and it becomes chronic, it can eventually take down your immune system which makes you vulnerable to certain diseases: Type  diabetes, certain cancers, heart disease, obesity, infertility, premature ageing… and last, but not least, mental illness.  People in HR in business and teachers should be trained to spot depression among other illnesses. If someone looks sad or anxious, that’s not depression. If the eyes look dead for more than a few weeks, there’s a big problem.At that point the teacher or HR person should gently askthe person wants help andthey do, they should be taken to a GP for medication. These illnesses don’t go away by wishful thinking.If teachers or HR staff in companies aren’t trained for mental illness, then counsellors need to be brought in, which costs money. Where is that going to come from  Something has got to change because now it’s one in three young people affected by mental illness and the suicide rate is shocking. Let’s hope we don’t have to wait another year. Let’s do something now. Or dare I say, maybe even this week How to get help: If you are struggling or you are worried about a loved one, contact Samaritans on .

Dylan Armer, Thomas Poulson and Christopher Bowes brazenly pinched the cars after using the high-tech gizmo, which fools keyless cars into opening. The tool, reportedly worth £,, allowed the gang to target five Mitsubishi Outlanders without having to burgle any people or homes for the keys. CCTV footage released by West Yorkshire Police shows two men in hooded tops unplugging an electric car before driving away seconds later. Armer, Poulson and Bowes were arrested on July , after stealing one of the Mitsubishis from a driveway.  Police were called in after the theft was reported and the owner gave a description of their vehicle. An investigation into the theft was launched soon after, with police examining CCTV footage and mobile phone data. The Leeds District Crime Team linked the three men to the crime, recovered the gizmo from the suspects’ vehicle and acquired video footage of how it was used in Poulson’s phone. Poulson and Armer pleaded guilty to the whole string of attacks, while Bowes pleaded guilty only to being the driver for two of the offences. All three men were sentenced at Leeds Crown Court. Armer , from Scarborough, was handed a two-and-a-half year prison sentence as well as a concurrent -month term for separate burglary matters.  Poulson, , of Wakefield and Bowes,  of Clford, were each given -month sentences, and suspended for two years. Det Insp Vicky Vessey, of the Leeds District Crime Team, said the flippant tones heard in the video footage from one of the men’s phones makes apparent the “utter disregard” the gang had for their victims, whose “hard-earned vehicles were whisked away in seconds”. They were brought to justice as a result of a thorough investigation that built up a clear evidential trail linking them to the offences,” Detective Vessey said.

Gus Lee-Dolphin sat in the soapy tub with a glass of red wine as motorists lined up to fill up their motors during the fuel shortage crisis. The joker has already turned up to a forecourt on a horse, singing his catchy theme tune about not needing petrol.Gus said: The reason for the bath was because it is so abstract and didnapost make much sense just like the UK at the moment. Thats what I wanted the bath to represent.The video on TikTok has over three million views and half a million likes, in just two days.In the video, a row of cars can be seen queuing for petrol, filmed last Friday night at Shell Surbiton in Surrey. He sings his now-infamous tune queuing for petrol as he moves along the queue to the amusement of queuing drivers. He can be seen with a drink in his hand as he moves to a petrol pump station. Not giving away his secret of how he filmed the video and had the bathtub moving as an artistic representation of the state of the country. He said: It is not meant to make sense.  It is to allow the viewer to question what is going on. And obviously thataposs the representation of the petrol crisis as a whole as no one really doesnapost know whataposs going on and itaposs a mess. The fuel crisis could be here for another week, petrol retailers have warned. The military arrived on Monday to ease up supply shortages as the EG group lts £ cap on petrol.  Gus also appeared on a bike for another jokey video. His clips went viral on social media, racking up millions of views and tens of thousands of likes. Many found the video mocking the drivers hilarious. Nicole Rose said: You are the funniest geezer going. Samantha Jane added: Watch all this guys video as my new comfort videos. Another added: They are getting better. While another simply added: Legend.

Otis Graves was born too soon and weighed a tiny lb oz, but the le of his identical twin brother, Chester, hung in the balance as he was just lb oz. After six weeks Otis was discharged and now weighs lb oz, but tiny Chester has fought for his le since his birth and still now only weighs lb oz. Doting parents, Kelly Graves, , and husband, Billy, , from Benfleet, Essex, say they have no doubt that Chesteraposs miraculous fight for survival is down to the bond he shares with his identical twin, Otis.What do you think about the adorable twins  Let us know in the comments...Kelly said: Since the day my waters broke at  weeks weaposve lived in a whirlwind. We are so lucky that Chester is a fighter and despite everything he has been through, he is still fighting in order to come home and be with his parents, Otis and the rest of the family. He is still being incubated and kept on high flow oxygen since being transferred back to our local hospital in Southend. We cannot wait to finally get Chester home. We are hoping to bring him back in November.  Chesteraposs health problems first became apparent at Kellyaposs -week scan, where she was informed the babies dfered in size by  per cent - something that concerned the doctors. The dference in size between the two brothers was due to a condition called Selective Intrauterine Growth Restriction, which results in Chester not receiving the required nutrients from the placenta, halting his growth. At  weeks, she was admitted to the Kings College Hospital in London for laser surgical treatment She explained: They informed us that there was absent flow of nutrients to Chester was the reason why he wasnapost really growing.  The surgery was performed to separate the babies in the womb so thatChester hadnapost survived it would have protected Otis from dying or being left with lasting brain damage. After the surgery, Kelly and Billy were told Chester was still only growing around g a week, whereas Otis was growing roughly g a week. She added: I was being told at every scan that he may not survive which was heart-breaking. I went away and was eating around g of protein per day to help him grow and was drinking around five litres of water to try and get Chesteraposs water levels up as they were also low. This was not in any way proven to help but I tried everything I could to replenish his levels and keep him fighting.  Chesteraposs condition stabilised but at  weeks, Kellyaposs Waters broke, and she was blue lighted to go to Addenbrookeaposs Hospital in Cambridge as she was likely to deliver. She explained: At this point Chester was  grams which was close to being deemed viable, but we were told his heart rate kept dipping and that the chances of survival from the caesarean would be low. We just had to hope that he would keep fighting. A C-section was performed, and Otis was immediately ventilated, but Chester had to first be stabilised as he had become very weak during the birth. Kelly added: Otis came out first and he was put into the incubator. When Chester came out, they found a knot in his cord which also halted his growth, and the consultant was desperate to get him incubated as soon as possible to help him survive. Thankfully they were able to ventilate him and ever since he has been fighting multiple issues such as Necrotising Enterocolitis, or NEC, which is a serious condition where tissue in the bowel becomes inflamed which Chester caught after nine days. He also had a hole in his heart which was discovered afterwards which has now thankfully closed and also eye surgery. The couple are also parents to Phoebe, , Florence, eight, and Albert, five, who the couple have said all been incredibly supportive. Kelly added: The kids have been incredible, they are so young but are just as desperate to get Chester home as they havenapost been able to even really meet him yet due to covid.  Chester was able to be transferred to Southend Hospital, where Kelly visits him every day. She said: It is very bittersweet because we have Otis at home now and everyone says how nice it must be, but itaposs also horrible because we canapost feel complete until both babies are back together. The twins finally met for the first time since being born on September , which was incredibly emotional. It was everything I was waiting for, and although Otis was asleep, Chester was obsessed with him and couldnapost take his eyes away from his brother. I have no doubt that cuddles with his twin has helped him keep fighting. Chester has now tripled his birth weight, currently weighing lb oz, and Kelly and Billy are desperate to get him home. She added:He has to gain a further  grams still and will most likely be on low flow oxygen when heaposs home, but we are hoping in around a month or two he can finally meet the rest of the family.To , visit @miracletwins_plus on Instagram.

Emma Reed’s daughter Erin was born with Charge Syndrome, which means she doesn’t need a lot of sleep, and consistently needs someone with an eye on her oxygen and breathing. North Tyneside mum Emma has taken on the exhausting role of being Erinaposs full time carer, providing the specialist medical care and support the girlaposs needs day-in and day-out.Speaking toChronicle Live , the mum-of-two explained that Erin’s condition affects many parts of her body Erin is tube fed, visually and hearing impaired and isn’t able to speak.She has also had a tracheostomy fitted to allow her to breathe on her own.  “She’s just beginning to walk and although it has been challenging because she doesn’t have any balance, she loves it,” Emma said. “She loves peeking out of windows and being nosey now that she’s on the move.” Emma said that in a practical sense, this meant she had been unable to have a full night of sleep with her daughter in the house, since she was born. “During the night her oxygen needs monitoring so she needs a machine which often beeps, or I’m woken up by coughing and make sure her airways are clear,” she said. “A common symptom of Charge Syndrome is also that Erin doesn’t need a lot of sleep so often thinks it’s party time during the night.”  Every month Erin stays at St Oswald’s Hospice, based in Gosforth, for short breaks of either two or three nights. The hospice provides a home-from-home environment and specialist medical care for Erin’s complex condition. To mark Hospice Care Week,Emma has spoken out about how her whole family benefits when Erin is at the Hospice, giving Emma and her husband Steve timeout to spend quality time together with their youngest daughter Scarlett, age . “As Erin gets a bit older she is much more aware of her surroundings and has a whale of a time at the Hospice,” she said. “She has a communication booklet so she can tell staff what she wants to do or where she wants to go, which suits her well as she likes to be bossy.  “While Erin is at the Hospice we can recharge our batteries and spend time with our other daughter Scarlett, who often comes second to her sister’s complex needs.” While Emma said it was “always dficult” to leave her daughter, she said she trusted the staff implicitly. “The team are absolutely lovely, kind and caring, which helps to put me at ease. The Hospice definitely isn’t what we first imagined, it’s very dferent to a hospital and it’s really homely,” she said. Last month, Emma and her family took part in the Great North Run weekend to raise money for St Oswald’s Hospice as a way to thank the charity for their care and support.

He will be charged with three counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, said Arlington Police Department Assistant Police Chief Kevin Kolbye, CNN reports. Kolbye - who has been updating reporters on the incident - also gave additional details on the condition of three of the four victims.A male student who was rushed to surgery has now been released, Kolbye said.Another adult male is in a good position and was not operated on. The third victim is also expected to leave hospital soon.So two will remain in the hospital, which continue to make hopefully a speedy recovery, Kolbye said.Police said they found a . calibre handgun in the street close to the school, which will be taken for further testing.  Our officers have transported a weapon they located in the street, said Grand Prairie Police Department chief Daniel Scesney.We canapost confirm it is the weapon. It may be the weapon. Cops said all , Timberview high school students have been evacuated and will be reunited with their families.Kolbye warned parents about threats being made against our schools on social media. Itaposs currently unknown whether the suspect discussed the attack online.He promised to investigate - with the aid of federal law enforcement agencies - iniduals making threats. Police responded to the initial reports of a gunman opening fire on the second floor by carrying out a methodical search of the building to locate the suspect and evacuate schoolchildren. Before his arrest, the shooter was considered armed and dangerous.Earlier Kolbye said the shooter was a student who drew his weapon after getting in a fight. The shooting was not a random act of violence, Kolbye added.  This is not somebody attacking our schools. This is a student, we believe right now, preliminary, that it was a student that got into a fight and drew a weapon. Itaposs currently unknown how the weapon was brought into the school. Police were unsure whether metal detectors had been set up to search students as they enter the building.  The police operation was conducted by Arlington local cops and several other departments, as well as the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The Dallas Bureauaposs special agent in charge Jeff Boshek told reporters the agency wonapost sleep until they find out how the gunman obtained his weapon.Weaposll figure out where this inidual got this gun from.Our agents wonapost sleep, working with our partners here, to figure out how he got this weapon in his hand to come in this school and cause this tragedy today.So, I donapost have much information I can give you on the weapon. Obviously, we donapost have that yet. We havenapost been in the school to figure out the caliber of the weapon or anything like that yet, but as soon as we do, weaposll have something to get out to you guys.An additional Twitter post revealed police are setting up a reunication point for the schoolaposs parents to be reunited with their children.The kids will be transported to the location by bus, the tweet adds.

Noreen Wredberg visited the Crater of Diamonds State Park in Arkansas, US, where she found the tiny stone after searching for around  minutes with her husband. She initially didnapost know what the stone was but picked it up anyway, and despite being the size of a aposjellybeanapos, the stone turned out to be worth £,as it was a .-carat diamond. Noreen had paid just £.to search the -acre field, as it is a diamond mine that is open to the public, and was allowed to keep the precious stone for herself. What do you think about Noreenaposs find  Let us know in the comments...She said: I didn’t know it was a diamond then, but it was clean and shiny, so I picked it up. We really didn’t think we would find one, let alone something that big.Talking to the Independent, David Allen of Purely Diamonds, said: “A rough diamond of this carat weight could get anywhere between . to . carat as a polished diamond.A diamond of this size would retail at anything from k to k depending on the intensity of the yellow. The more vivid and intense the colour of yellow the more valuable it becomes.  For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newslettershere. Thousands of diamonds have been found at the park since , with the largest being a .-carat stone discovered in . Waymon Cox, from the park, said: Diamonds are somewhat heavy for their size and lack static electricity, so dirt doesn’t stick to them.

But one children’s alphabet playmat has left adults baffled, as one particular illustration used seems to be unrecognisable. In a post on Reddit, one user shared a photo of the playmat which features drawings of animals for every letter of the alphabet. And although it’s obvious to adults that O is for owl and S is for sheep, one letter has people on Reddit completely stumped – the letter U. In the picture, the letter seems to be accompanied by a blob with a smiley face drawn on, and looks more like a drawing of a germ than an animal.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. The person who posted the picture asked: “What’s the ‘U’ on this kids carpet ” After thousands of adults spent hours being baffled by the picture, the most likely answer was eventually decided to be an urchin. One person said: “Urchin, but it’s so poorly designed.” While another agreed, adding: “Urchin, as in Sea Urchin. The spiky fellas that live in the sea.” But the logical response didn’t stop people from having fun with their own humorous replies.  Someone posted: “Ugly.” And a second joked: “Underwear stain ” Before a third said: “Uranus. Don’t you see the brown star ” While someone  posted: “UV rays.” There was even more confusion over other letters of the alphabet too, as the picture for X was a fish which left others unsure what it was supposed to be depicting. One person asked: “How about wtf is X  Xpine ” But another quickly helped them out, writing: “X-ray fish, odd as it seems.” Others were baffled by the bird pictured under the letter Q before being told it was a quail, while more commenters pointed out that the wolf drawn for W looks more like a fox. There was also confusion over the newt drawn for N, the iguana for I, and the yak for Y.

A TikTok discussing the theory went viral, with more than . million views. One person disagreed, writing: You canapost tell because of this angle, maybe he did have locks.

Beijing demands ownership of Taiwan, an island  miles off China’s east coast which broke away from the communist mainland in . Taiwan has , full-time soldiers and more than a million reservists but,it fell, would become an outcrop of tyrannical Chinese government control. The US and allies such as the UK and Australia are alarmed as they could be dragged into a conflict. The US naval manoeuvres in the Indo-Pacic, which includes the UK’s aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth, have been stepped up. Taiwanese defence minister Chiu Kuo-cheng called the situation “the most severe in the  years since I’ve enlisted”. Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen warned: “If Taiwan were to fall, the consequences would be catastrophic for regional peace.” She believed it would show “authoritarianism has the upper hand over democracy.” Why is this happening now   China is desperate to expand further, having effectively taken over large parts of Vietnam, Cambodia and invested money for control all over Africa and even in Afghanistan. The US is withdrawing its military globally and its response to a Taiwan invasion is not guaranteed. China President Xi Jinping is under constant pressure to exert influence on his people through nationalism, fear and strategic gains. In its own eyes taking over Taiwan would boost the regime’s credibility, potency and global leverage. It would be a big victory over America. China believes Taiwan has to be the next target in its strategic quest for global domination. What’s the chance of attempted invasion and all-out war  As China conducted recent flights,  ships, including three aircraft carriers, from six navies –the US, Britain, Japan, the Netherlands, Canada and New Zealand – manoeuvred off Okinawa, Japanese islands north east of Taiwan. The aim was to show commitment to a “free and open Indo-Pacic”. Earlier British frigate HMS Richmond passed through the Taiwan Strait, angering China, which branded it a ­“meaningless display of presence with an ­insidious intention.”But yesterday US President Joe Biden and Mr Xi ­reiterated the Taiwan ­Agreement, which says US diplomatic ­relations with China in the future depend on Taiwan’s destiny being only determined by peaceful means.Mr Chiu claimed China is already equipped for an invasion but will be fully prepared for it in three years. He said: “It has the capacity now but it will not start a war easily.” There is a slim possibility of war in the near future but there is a much greater fear of war by . How is China exerting its global influence  In every way possible, from economic expansion, geo-political manoeuvres, money loaning, large-scale web-hacking to stealing billions of pounds of research and development and military threats. Its multi-billion dollar “belt and road” policy has built up a communications network of complex inter-linking roads, maritime trading routes and commercial ties to around  countries. Beijing deploys “debt diplomacy” like the mafia. But governments from Malaysia to Pakistan are rethinking the costs, having witnessed what happened in Sri Lanka, where the government was forced to lease a port to a Chinese company for  years after struggling to make repayments. It is believed there are eight more belt and road countries at serious risk of being unable to repay their loans and being forced to give up businesses or lease them out to China. How would the West react to an invasion of Taiwan   AUKUS, a new defence deal between the US, Australia and the UK, concentrating on the building of nuclear submarines, is good news for Taiwan. It means China would never be secure in believing it knows where all the attack subs are at any one time. They can wipe out large numbers of ships very quickly - but as a Chinese fleet set sail Aukus would need to launch an assault, probably inflicting devastating damage within  hours. Would the UK be dragged in  The UK’s carrier strike force is likely to be deployed, along with a number of attack submarines, linking to Britain’s allied forces. Its F-B fighter jets and accompanying escort warships would be a huge asset in any maritime conflict. If China did attack Taiwan, it could mean a very bloody war, evenonly locally fought. With a conventional war against China likely to cost tens of thousands of lives, China may gamble that the West will keep out of it. Butit did try and stand up for Taiwan, nuclear weapons could come into play.

The Oxford University professor who created the AstraZeneca jab has cited the statistic in an open letter demanding more doses are shared around the world. Dame Sarah Gilbert reiterated that “no-one is safe until we are all safe” as she called for urgent action from wealthier nations. She wrote: “It is more crucial than ever that we do not forget the lives that could be saved by administering first and second doses to the most vulnerable populations worldwide and the opportunity that the global distribution of vaccine provides to protect all of us by reducing the selection of further iants.”What are your thoughts on this  Let us know in the comments belowSome .% of the world’s population had received at least one dose by September, yet only .% of people in low-income countries had. The Oxford-developed AstraZeneca jab has been used most in poorer countries but limited supplies saw wealthier countries stockpile supplies. Dame Sarah said wealthier countries are about to have an “embarrassment of riches” as more doses are produced here. She warned poorer countries still do not have the infrastructure to distribute and administer widespread vaccination programmes.  She said: “Whereas constraints on the supply of a limited number of products in the initial stages of the vaccine rollout resulted in intense competition for these doses and grave inequities in their distribution, we can now imagine facing a very dferent problem in the coming months. “One in which the volume of supply exceeds the capacity to absorb and dispense vaccine in the countries with the greatest outstanding needs. “The new imperative for international relief efforts will be to support delivery at scale to ensure that recipient countries are able to reach their coverage goals quickly. “There remain signicant challenges, from transportation of a vaccine in a country - especially with vaccines that have to be kept ultra-cold - to intangibles such as the pervasiveness of vaccine hesitancy. “Ensuring that these le-saving doses reach the people in danger is one of the most urgent challenges of the next phase of this global pandemic.” Her letter is co-wrote with Dr Richard Hatchett, the chief executive of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations , and is published in the Science Translational Medicine journal. Dr Hatchett added: “While over . billion doses of these vaccines have been administered to date, equitable access to these le-saving tools remains woefully inadequate and must be urgently addressed.” Comment MORE ON AstraZeneca plcOxford UniversityCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

closed for more than three years is set to finally reopen next year, sport chiefs have confirmed.Northfield pool – which is operated by public body Sport Aberdeen # closed in March  following a plant failure.The council-owned facility’sto full service has been long-awaited by the community, with residents forced to travel to other parts of the city.Since it has been closed the pool has also become a target for vandalism and anti-social behaviour, with a number of incidents in the last three years.However, work to bring it back to le finally began earlier this year after a £. million contract was awarded.And now Sport Aberdeen’s managing director Alistair Robertson has confirmed the pool is due to open next summer.“I would anticipate completion by summer next year,” he told Aberdeen City Council’s strategic commissioning committee.“I think the weather and the winter period will determine how close we are to our estimated period of May or June, but that is our hope.”SNP councillor Neil Copland praised the progress with the project and said it would be “much-used” once it is completed.When it reopens the facility will also include a -station gym and “wellness hub”.Mr Robertson added Sport Aberdeen is committed to increasing opportunities to participate in physical activity in what the council describes as “regeneration areas” – a category which includes Northfield – to improve the health of those living in the community.“It’s something which is being pushed hard at a Scottish Government level,” he said.“Something we have all recognised is the importance of health and physical activity has never been higher.”Council leader Jenny Laing said the pool would be a “signicant piece of infrastructure for Northfield and the surrounding area”.She called for “pressure to be put on at a national level” to ensure similar projects are delivered in other regeneration areas of the city.Shop boss slammed after claiming Post Office closures #best decision for many years#\"

I#ve not seen it back but it looks asit was the right decision.#I thought we got our press right and looked energetic considering we had only thrown these guys together the day before.#We looked like we were going to be dangerous and I believed we were going to do well in the game. It was a huge mountain to climb when it was young boys against experienced players and down to ten men.#I thought we stuck at it and tried to hang in the game until the last  or  minutes.

Academics agree that a sustainable level of material use, which would still allow for a high quality of le, is about eight tonnes per person per year.Zero Waste Scotland is advocating for mindful shopping, encouraging Scots to buy smarter and adopt reuse, repair and renting behaviours as well as embracing second-hand shopping.When finished with an item, it is calling on people to dispose of items responsibly by donating, reselling or recycling.With global climate change discussions at an all-time high and COP coming to Glasgow this November, the topic of responsible consumption in relation to the climate crisis has never been more timely.Everything we buy has a carbon cost and we are urging Scots to think dferently about what we buy and how we consume.Changing our own consumption habits is the single biggest thing we can all do to play our part in tackling climate change.Now is the time for action and we want people to bin less and buy better, seeking out items which will last longer.Responsible consumption isn’t on the COP agenda so we wanted to ensure it is top of the consumer agenda.To learn more about the campaign, please visit www.howtowasteless for further details.Iain Gulland, chief executive, Zero Waste Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters does genetic tolerance aid wild swimmers","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowWild swimming has become increasingly popular during lockdown, but in general people are ided into those who love swimming in cold water and those who think that it’s complete madness.Now scientists have found a possible explanation for this ision related to a muscle protein called alpha-actinin- .We have two types of muscle fibres # type  and type .Type  fibres provide fatigue resistance important for prolonged, submaximal activity like marathon running, while type  fibres produce a rapid and powerful force for short-burst, vigorous activities such as sprinting.The two types of fibres respond dferently to cold exposure # type  fibres produce an involuntary, low-intensity, continuous increase in muscle tone, while type  fibres give bursts of high-intensity activity causing overt shivering.ACTN is only active in type  muscle fibres, and deficiency of this protein is caused by a non-ing ACTN gene.This occurs in - per cent of the world’s population, around . billion people, and is most common in Europe and Asia.These people lack type  muscle fibre activity and although this is compensated by having larger type  fibres, it adversely affects muscle , impacting on athletic performance, particularly in sprint and power activities.Now scientists have investigated the role of ACTN in cold tolerance .Male participants,  with ing and  with non-ing ACTN, were immersed in water at °C for -minute periods interspersed with -minute rest periods at room temperature .The ordeal ended either after a maximum of six immersions or when participants’ body temperature dropped to .°C.The scientists found improved cold tolerance in those with non-ing ACTN, some  per cent of whom maintained body temperature above .°C compared to  per cent of those with al ACTN.So those lacking al type  fibres had better cold tolerance, suggesting that cold-induced increased muscle tone is more efficient at generating heat than overt shivering.Improved cold tolerance probably gave our ancestors an evolutionary survival advantage after their migration from Africa to colder climes in Eurasia, so explaining the high frequency of non-ing ACTN in today’s northern populations.It would be interesting to investigate how many Scottish wild swimmers carry this genetic iant.

The P  team drew six tries-all and the P- team won by six tries to four.Next they played Kintyre with the P s losing by five tries to two and the P s winning again four tries to three.The last game for both teams came against Oban and this time the P  team won by three tries to one and the superb P  team won by five tries to three to complete a clean sweep on the day.Lee Buckley of Mid Argyll RFC said: #The coaches at Mid Argyll would like to thank two under- players, Donald Self and William Wilson, who came along on the day and refereed all the games.#I think the boys were surprised by the quality of the rugby and the speed of some of the mini players, as they tried to keep up with them.#During the day Argyll and Bute rugby development officer Andrew Johnston took all the girl players aside to record a good luck message for the Scotland women#s national team who took on Spain the following day in a crucial world cup qualying match.The message must have done the trick as Scotland ran out  #  victors to keep their world cup dream alive.If any young people would like to play rugby either as a ing player or a complete novice, training sessions for all primary age children and S- high school girls is at pm on Tuesdays on the rugby pitch at the joint campus in Lochgilphead.High School training for S- boys and girls is held on Thursdays at pm at the joint campus.For any ing ex-players or novice adults, men and women who want to give rugby a try for the first time, have a look on Mid Argyll Rugby Club#s Facebook page for details of when the #old-timers# touch rugby sessions are being held.This week#s Dalriada festival on September  is being hosted by Oban Lorne RFC.Players should arrive at Oban Rugby Club no later than .am for a noon start.PICS:Mid Argyll P  team. no_a_RugbyMidArgyllMid Argyll P  team. no_a_RugbyMidArgyllDonald and William refereed the games. no_a_RugbyMidArgyllThe girls had a great day # and even recorded a good luck message for the Scotland women#s national team. no_a_RugbyMidArgyllAction from the P  match between Mid Argyll and Etive Vikings, which Mid Argyll won by six tries to four.

When they got there Jesus asked them: #What were you arguing about along the way #They couldn#t answer, for they had been arguing about which of them was the greatest.

We were delighted to welcome them to Argyll for their first performance as a quartet and for three of the four performers this was the first time they had performed in more than a year.The quartet # Andrew, Dean, Jack and Richard # introduced each piece, giving background to both the role of the saxophone and the composer, with many of the pieces arranged by the group themselves.Purcell’s #Festival Rondeau# was the dramatic opening, a work well-known across all age groups, so a perfect start to the concert.Following this was a work composed specically for a saxophone quartet in  by Jean-Baptiste Singelée, a friend of Adolph Sax who invented the saxophone. We were treated to the traditional Andante before moving onto the exciting Allegro.The third selection of pieces were all by Debussy. This was a surprising choice as the saxophone is not really associated with the Impressionist period, however, it showed the versatility of both the saxophones and performers. #Arabesque No.# was followed by #The Little Shepherd# which was delightful, calm and serene with only the sound of the river flowing through the trees and birds singing along. The jaunty #Cakewalk# completed this ied section.#Air on a G String# by Bach and known to many as a TV advert was the next offering. The opening descending bass line showed the depth and quality of the baritone saxophone in much more than just a supporting role. This music predates the invention of the saxophone by more than  years.Gershwin and a selection of show tunes from the swing era were just what we needed after the relaxing #Air#. The four musical songs, all showcasing dferent styles, certainly had the audience smiling, toe-tapping and singing along. In the final piece #I Got Rhythm# we were all moving to the music, including the quartet. Closing your eyes, you could imagine you were relaxing in a jazz club anywhere in the world.The next piece, #L’Arlesienne Exhibition#, is a collection of highlights for the saxophone in an orchestral situation. The music was composed by Hiroki Takahashi, with many familiar themes from film and TV # including The Apprentice # all thoroughly enjoyable.Gershwin’s #An American in Paris# portrays the many sights and sounds that Gershwin experienced there in the s. While it was composed for an orchestra which included saxophones and car horns, the music played by the quartet didn’t include any car horns # just skilled and imaginative saxophonists.A change of pace to enjoy some relaxed, laid-back music from West Africa followed with Will Gregory’s #High Le#. The repeated rhythms with the peace of Kilmory, the cooling air and the gentle river flowing was almost hypnotic and brought the concert to a finish.The audience cheered, clapped and blew their cars horns to ensure the quartet provided an encore. #Witch Hunt# by Ulrich Schultheiss was the encore # a dramatic and fiery work challenging all the performers and bringing a fantastic concert to a close.The quartet members themselves didn#t feel the cars were a barrier and said they #had a blast at a unique and special event#.MAAA thank the th Argyll Scoutsfor helping with the car parking.

especially when it comes to the impact of proposed sites on traditional fishing grounds # poor site maintenance and monitoring which can lead to instances of vessel entanglement and also the environmental impact of the sites on both commercial and non-commercial species.The group believes that while the sector has made many advances over the past decade, increased transparency and oversight are needed to ensure the aquaculture sector can better co-exist with the fishing industry.The initial aim of the group would be to ensure that there is a proper analysis of localised fishing and follow up with clear and sensible communication between the two sectors to ensure that with expansion does not come conflict.It is a timeous idea, which will hopefully reassure fishermen that they will not simply be displaced by fish farming but will be respected for their own produce.The group will cement a policy to assist the fishing industry deal realistically with the fish farming industry and the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation.Simon Macdonald, chair RIFG Aquaculture Work GroupSir,NFU Scotland is calling on the UK Government to address the nation’s growing labour crisis, which is undermining all parts of the food and drink supply chain, leading to signicant losses on some Scottish farms and resulting in a growing number of empty shop shelves.Last week#s #BackBritishFarmingDay on September  came as a UK Government announcement of a free trade #agreement in principle# between the UK and New Zealand is believed to be imminent.Having agreed in June to provide unfettered access in the future to Australia, the cumulative impact of another deal with a major exporting nation has huge signicance for Scottish farmers and crofters.With so much to celebrate about the quality and standards of our food and drink, #BackBritishFarmingDay was a fantastic opportunity to thank the nation for their incredible support throughout Brexit and Covid-.NFU Scotland, both independently and in conjunction with the Scottish food and drink industry, has written several times to UK Government calling for measures that address the shortfall in both seasonal and permanent staff.Should it fail to do so, I have absolutely no doubt that the situation will deteriorate further.It is galling to hear that the UK Government is on the verge of signing up to another free trade deal that will permit a growing level of imports while delivering very little to our food and drink sector in .The blunt fact is that neither deal has been afforded any kind of proper parliamentary scrutiny as the government’s promised Statutory Trade and Agriculture Commission has yet to be established.Safeguards against market disruption are also promised, but the cumulative impact of these deals will be profound for UK farming.If handled badly, these may make it impossible for some of our family farming businesses to continue to compete with high levels of low-cost imports produced to standards that would not be allowed here.Martin Kennedy, president, NFU ScotlandSir,National audits of diabetic services have shown that only around  per cent of people with type one or two diabetes have nine key annual checks to help prevent long-term diabetic complications.The pandemic has made this situation dficult because many routine checks and face-to-face appointments have not been available.The InDependent Diabetes Trusthas published a free new booklet which explains the nine key tests.It helps people look after their health by ensuring that they know what checks they need from health professionals.Get your copy of Diabetes care #

Try and get evergreens planted by the end of the month.Dormant roses are now available at local nurseries and garden centres and are very good value for money.You can easily create a rose garden for the coming year that will provide beautul flowers and fragrance from early summer through to autumn. Before planting, mix in some good quality compost and make sure the plants are watered well once planted.It#s an excellent time to plant coners as well. Coners are cone-bearing seed plants and include cedars, cypresses, firs, junipers, larches, pines, spruces, and yews.While being practical and useful, coners are also visually stunning and can transform a garden into something quite magnicent.They are a wonderful way of adding colour and shape to your outdoor space, particularly as many coners change colour throughout the year.With several hundred ieties available in the UK, there is one to suit every type of garden, and they are easy to look after.They need good drainage and water to get them established, but once growing will need little attention as they are pretty disease resistant and maintenance free.In addition to coners, another way to bring colour to the garden at this time of year is with autumn bedding plants.One of the most exciting group of plants to brighten up any part of the garden is Heuchera.Native to north America, Heuchera were originally grown for their flowers # dainty spikes of red, pink and white bells.They carry their plume like flowers high above their crowns of leaves, but gardeners are now mainly interested in their foliage which comes in a iety of colours.Heucheras grow in full or partial sun, in well composted soil and are fairly pest resistant.They can be established as ground cover in many garden situations like under trees where grass could struggle.October is often a time spent clearing up after the summer and preparing for the winter and wpring ahead so here are some top tips for jobs this month from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"glendaruel hosts tighnabruaich open","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowGlendaruel and Colintraive Gun Club hosted the Tighnabruaich Open on September , the first club competition to be held since March .The High Gun of the day, after a three-way shoot off, was Ted Blakeway.In second was Alan Brown third, Paul Chalmers and fourth equal were Martin Young,  Gordon Grfiths and Eric McAllister.The ladies prize went to Jessica Young.

Yet we often treat them in a dismissive way.Let#s think about some insects.Take the bluebottle. How often has it outwitted us with its amazing flight paths, ducking and ing to avoid our threatening gestures.While we have developed some of the most sophisticated flying machines the world has known, none can match the bluebottle in its agility.We have mentioned pollination. What insect is more important than the bee as it goes about its business from flower to flower ensuring that the plants will produce seed for another year and giving us honey as a product of its labours.How beautul too are its colours and the structure of its body – a remarkable little insect.Then there is the humble moth and its gravity-defying antics walking across ceilings. It has a very fragile body but in its short le can nevertheless act out its own acrobatic skill in an amazing performance.Or we may think of the spider and the beauty of its web, perhaps seen on a frosty winter morning. A true work of art woven with such delicacy.In the bible we read this: #Go watch the ants, you lazy person. Watch what they do and be wise. Ants have no commander, no leader or ruler, but they store up food in the summer and gather their supplies at harvest.# From this we can learn four things helpful to living: be diligent and hard-working have an #I can do it# attitude plan ahead remember teamwork is important."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader october 1 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowIt#s a strange one, the fuel situation.There seems to be no one reason for it but, for whatever reason, a sort of mass hysteria seems to have taken hold where in the UK.

ious European engagements.In , Cope was promoted to lieutenant-general and, just before the  Rising, he was appointed military commander in Scotland.After Prince Charles and his men had landed at Eriskay, Cope withdrew to Inverness, leaving Edinburgh exposed.The Prince lost no time before he entered the Capital in triumph with his army of Highlanders, rough types who were capable of anything.After Cope had loaded his troops onto ships at Aberdeen and sailed for Dunbar, the two armies met at Prestonpans on September , .Many of Copersquos troops were inexperienced recruits and his officers were a feeble lot.Early the following morning, when the Highlanders charged, Copersquos dragoons fled in panic, leaving the infantry exposed.Had the humane Prince and his officers not interceded, a bloodbath might well have have ensued, with no prisoners taken.The craven Cope fled to Berwick-upon-Tweed with some of his officers and a rabble of surviving soldiers.He faced a court martial but was exonerated, the cowardly conduct of the soldiers being blamed for everything.He obtained another appointment as Governor of Limerick but never held an independent field command again.There was an early rumour among the Scottish victors that Sir John Cope had overslept on the morning of the battle although it inspired the rousing bagpipe tune Hey, Johnnie Cope, Are Ye Waking Yet , that version of events is not true.Then there was a story that although Prince Charles had spent the night before the battle on duty with his men, Cope had slept at comfortable quarters in Cockenzie.This tale was reported by the Edinburgh historian Robert Chambers as early as , although Copersquos  biographer Sir Robert Cadell found it yet another calumny: in spite of the assertions of Chambers and others, Cope had slept with his troops on the battlefield, as veried by the Culloden Papers and the Proceedings of Copersquos court martial.In his  biography of Prince Charles, the mischievous W. Drummond Norie lsquoimprovedrsquo the old legend further, claiming that Cope had been spending the night at a comfortable house in Cockenzie, nowadays referred to as the lsquoInk Bottlersquo and pictured in his book. This story was widely believed at the time.On June , , The Scotsman newspaper wrote that: ldquoIn Cockenzie several properties have been medically condemned and after a long allowance of time these have been closed amongst others portions of the historic Ink Bottle [Copersquos House].But the old house survived this crisis, however, being featured and photographed in the Edinburgh Evening News of August , , as a curious reminder of the hapless English generalrsquos efforts in the Battle of Prestonpans.The Cockenzie and Port Seton chronicler Dr R. Turner, writing in , rightly puts the curiously shaped old Ink Bottle house in or near Cope Lane in Port Seton, not far from the Old Parish Church Manse, adding that it had recently been demolished.I have been snooping round these parts to very this fact: the Ink Bottle is no longer standing, having fallen victim to the vandals of the s.Some historical revisionists from south of the Border have belatedly tried to save Sir John Copersquos reputation: the expedition to Inverness was caused by the bad advice he was given by some Scottish renegade noblemen, and the defeat at Prestonpans was wholly due to the poor quality of the soldiery.As we know, the story of him deserting his troops the morning of the battle is not true, but he did leave his military chest containing his papers and pound, for soldierrsquos pay under a staircase at Cockenzie House, where it was gleefully seized by the Prince and his men.It had been Copersquos decision to leave Edinburgh exposed, and it had been his responsibility to make sure the troops were properly trained and ably officered.The headlong flight to Berwick-upon-Tweed does not inspire confidence either, since it had been his duty to try his utmost to rally the troops, even at the cost of his own le.As a result of Sir John Cope being recalled, the Auld Enemy made sure that more canny officers, and tougher soldiers recalled from the Continent, were brought to Scotland to suppress the Rising: this target was achieved, just as planned, by lsquoButcherrsquo Cumberland at Culloden in ."},{"url":null,"title":"charity-golf-day-musselburgh-golf-club-raises-1-000-maggies","story":"Each year, players gather at Musselburgh Golf Club at Monktonhall to play for the Norrie Hosie Friday Cup.The tournament has grown from small beginnings, when local man NormanHosie Senior, from Stoneybank, began playing with friends back in the s.He donated a trophy for the match, the organisation of which has been taken over by his son Norrie Junior, from Wallyford, who has attracted sponsors for the event, which raises hundreds of pounds for charity each year, including Alzheimer Scotland, Royal Hospital for Children  Young People, and Changes, a Musselburgh-based community health project.This year, Mr Hosie Jnr decided to donate the money to Maggiersquos Edinburgh at the Western General Hospital, which helped him and his we Shirley after her breast cancer diagnosis last November.About  golfers took part in the recent competition, which was won by Alister Gray and raised pound for the charity.

The card had superior artistic merit and I wanted to make use of it in the book, which was to include a number of old cards by the celebrated North Berwick postcard artist Reginald Phillimore.The problem, however, was that no information was forthcoming where this obscure cottage had been or how it had earnt sufficient fame to be depicted by Phillimore.The book was published in  without lsquoCleikum Tollrsquo being featured.The purchase of another Edwardian postcard belatedly solved the mystery in August : it turned out that the careless Phillimore had got the name wrong, since it was not lsquoCleikum Tollrsquo but lsquoCleikimin Tollrsquo!And indeed, inquiries demonstrated that this turnpike and tollhouse had been standing at the cross between the road from Dunbar to Spott and the road from Broxburn to Belton. It is likely there were two turnpikes, one on each road. The tollhouse was said to be very old, quite possibly constructed in the first half of the th century.In early Victorian times, the tollgate system kept flourishing all over Britain. In rural west Wales, there were full-scale riots in  after a number of novel turnpikes had been erected, something the locals disapproved of. Men dressed as women attacked the turnpikes and beat up the tollkeepers, and it was only with dficulty they could be pacied.Cleikimin Toll was spared such indignities, however: it was still operational at the time of the Ordnance Survey of -. The name-book of this survey [OS    ] refers to it as a ldquoA Toll Bar at a junction of roads situated about half a mile south of the town of Dunbar.A note explains Cleikimin as a name usually applied to a cheap public house, where a Cleik [Scottish for fish-hook] was supposed to have been made use of to pull the customers inside.The arrival of the railways did much damage to the old tollgate system all over Britain: as a result, the road toll revenue plummeted and the tollkeepers grumbled incessantly.The Scottish municipal authorities realised the old-fashioned turnpikes were on the way out, and by  they were all gone.The tollhouse at Cleikimin Toll stood well into Edwardian times, being admired as a quaint relic of olden days. It survived the Great War but was destroyed not long after in a scheme for widening the A.

to Scottish Ministers to see the plans given the green light.Rosie Leven, the reporter appointed by the Scottish Ministers, gave the planned three-storey building at  High Street and land to the north the go ahead.Neighbours overlooking the proposed three-bedroom house had objected to the planned property, which measures just over four metres wide and  metres long, on the grounds of privacy.Mrs Leven attached a condition to the approval that a balustrade should be included on the roof terrace.She said: ldquoI consider that the proposed first floor kitchen doors and roof terrace are part of the main living space of the proposed house and are likely to be more regularly used, during a larger proportion of the day, than the bedroom windows.ldquoI consider that it is from those first floor windows spaces that there is the greatest potential for an adverse effect on neighbouring residential amenity.ldquoIn this respect, the appellant has suggested that a condition could be placed on the consent to require a . metre balustrade around the three open sides of the roof terrace.ldquoIn the circumstances, I find that such a balustrade would help to reduce the ability for overlooking, both from the roof terrace itself and from the double doors to the kitchen.ldquoTaking this into account, I accept that there may be some overlooking from and to the proposed bedroom window, but with the addition of a balustrade, I consider that the overall impact on the amenity of the neighbouring properties would not be signicantly adverse.Concerns had also been raised about whether the proposed building was in keeping with the character of the town centre.The Reporter noted that traditional buildings ldquodominate the area but added ldquothere are dferent heights and styles of building.She said there was ldquono consistent building line on Forth Street and the character is one of buildings offset from each other, providing interesting views and angles.The proposals originally went

There was year upon year of company re-investment of profits, a workforce willing to forgo todays wage boost for ldquojam tomorrow. What Mr Johnson is invoking is high inflation, stoked by shortages of goods and staff. With the UK heading back to the joys of the s, this makes Mr Johnson not Tony Benn, but James Callaghan, another populist, out-of-his-depth leader. ldquoCrisis, what crisis GR Weir, Ochiltree.ALISTER JACK OUT OF STEPIT is great that the Prime Minister now wishes to push forward towards a high-wage, high-skill, high-productivity and yes, low-tax economy. However I cannot be the only person in Scotland who wonders why this cant be reconciled with a real living wage in the proposed green ports in Scotland. The Secretary of State for Scotland has said that these high wages would make them uncompetitive .Possibly the PM should have a word with him Foster Evans, Renfrew.DANGER IN THE ELECTIONS BILLJILL Stephensonis to be commended for her directness in insisting that in the event of another referendum the Union side should have the advantage of question wording. However, her justication that ldquoYes had the advantage in practice stands up to little scrutiny, as the question used was the one recommended by the Electoral Commission. Moreover, having mentioned that a Remain  Leave question was shown by Professors Ford, Johns and Garry to advantage ldquoNo, Ms Stephenson concludes: ldquoAs a matter of balance, in any future referendum, the question should be \"Should Scotland remain in the UK  Yes or No\". I think we can draw our own conclusions from that.However, more important is Ms Stephensonrsquos focus on the Electoral Commission, whose aim is to ensure ldquoUK elections remain secure, fair, modern, inclusive and transparent. However, there are proposals in the Elections Bill, for a Strategy and Policy Statement for the Electoral Commission, which will set out the Governmentrsquos priorities on electoral matters and principles under which the commission will be expected to operate. While this must be approved by Parliament, it will be prepared by the Secretary of State, currently Michael Gove. The commission itself has said the proposals will ldquoplace a fetter on the commission which would limit its activity.Thus, the organisation charged with ensuring that any question for a second referendum is fair and not misleading will be under the control of one of the parties in the referendum debate. Perhaps Ms Stephenson will even get her way with the question for the next referendum, eventhrough the unfair, prejudicial, and undemocratic means contained in the Elections Bill.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.THE ONLY HONEST QUESTIONTHERE is endless quibbling about how the simple answers \"yes\" or \"no\" might give advantage or disadvantage to those voting in a referendum .There are important decisions made every day by governments, management boards and committees on the basis of votes cast for a motion or against it. No one ever suggests that there is bias in favour of the supporters.If we ignore the bias implied by such inaccurate phrases as \"secession\", \"separatism\" or \"leaving the UK\", the only honest and historically justiable question for a referendum would be \"Should Scotland become an independent nation again \"Peter Dryburgh, Edinburgh.* A NUMBER of your correspondents have discussed the nature of the question to be put in any putative future Indyref.However, it has been clear since  that the only referendum result that nationalists will accept is one in favour of secession from the UK. Therefore their preferred format for a future referendum ballot paper would surely be ldquoDo you agree that Scotland must leave the UK whatever the cost And a box marked ldquoYes.And thatrsquos all.Peter A Russell, Glasgow.THE PRICE OF POVERTYBRIAN Wilson tells us that poverty matters . Indeed poverty does matter. The \"rape clause\" and the bedroom tax would not have been visited on Scotlands poorest familiesit had not been for Westminster rule by a Government rejected by the Scottish electorate.These, and other reactionary \"hostile\" measures such as racist immigration laws, are no doubt regretted by some supporters of the Union but the huge cost to our poorest families is, it would seem, a price that wealthy Union supporters are willing for the most vulnerable to pay.Brian Dempsey, Lecturer, School of Law, University of Dundee.COVID HANDLED BETTER HEREADAM Tomkinswill be disappointed to learn that on Tuesday, the Welsh Senedd also agreed to introduce vaccine passports and this is commonplace throughout Europe, as it is seen as a vital tool in encouraging the uptake of vaccines and to protect those who frequent crowded nightclubs and large sporting events.Nicola Sturgeonrsquos far superior handling of the health crisis in Scotland has resulted in Scotland having lower cases and deaths per head of population plus a greater number of jags administered compared to England, thanks to our much-better-performing NHS.It could be argued that the Scottish position would be even betterwe had had control of our borders and the fiscal powers required to introduce an earlier lockdown, rather than relying on Boris Johnsonrsquos fatal dithering that trashed our economy and resulted in the UK having the worst death rate and the highest number of cases per head of population in Europe, when as an island we should have had the lowest rates.Tories continually fail to recognise the four dferent health services in the UK, and on June  a House of Lords committee found that Mr Johnsons use of the Union Flag as a backdrop for coronavirus briefings caused \"unacceptable and unnecessary\" confusion, which is amplied by BBC Scotland allowing opposition politicians to immediately undermine the Scottish Governmentrsquos health briefings ndash a practice that is not followed by the BBC where in the UK.Mary Thomas, Edinburgh.THERE IS NO IDENTITY CRISISI WISH to commend Willie Macleanrsquos stunningly clear analysis of the Scottish British national identity . When it comes to football , I am Scottish. When it comes to world war, I am British. That analysis could provide the basis of a rational, flags absent, debate over what happens in the grey area between these two positions.My Scottish identity, for example, prevails in many issues other than football and includes our legal system, our education system, our sense of humour and many others.Michael Sheridan, Glasgow.A POLITICAL MISMATCHPRIOR to reading todays Herald , my eyes were drawn to the front page, just above your main headline. \"Ross v Sturgeon\" it read, promoting an article within the pages.My immediate instincts were to imagine a sporting comparison.

The gas is to stun animals for slaughter and in packaging to prolong shelf le.CF produces around % of the UKs CO supply, which is why the closure of the sites had prompted fears that shoppers could start noticing shortages in poultry, pork and bakery products within days.A fire at Britainrsquos main electricity subsea cable with France last month has further prompted concerns over electricity supplies this winter. The fire will reduce imports from France until the end of March , the National Grid has admitted.Prices of natural gas, which had already been at record highs in the previous weeks soared more than  per cent at the news.Gas production has also been  per cent lower in the UK so far this year because companies have been carrying out maintenance that was delayed due to the pandemic.The turbulance in the energy market has also been compounded by some of the lowest wind speeds since the s, which has dramatically cut output from the UKs , wind turbines. And there have been outages at some of Britainrsquos nuclear plants.Speaking ahead of the publication today of the National Grids official winter outlooks Mr Pettigrew told the FT: ldquoAs always you need to monitor those things because things can happen during the winter.\" That included including unforeseen power station closures and liquefied natural gas deliveries being erted to other parts of the world.He has said that Britain had multiple potential sources of gas, including imports from Norway as well as domestic supply from the North Sea.But he acknowledged that it would have to compete on price with other parts for the world, in particular Asia, for other sources such as liquefied natural gas.From this month, the three in four customers on default tarf customers paying by direct debit will see an increase of pound from pound, to pound,, while the rest who are on prepayment meters will see a rise of pound from pound, to pound,.Analysts at energy consultancy Cornwall Insight have predicted the next cap will mean the typical household will rise by a further pound to pound, and the impact of the crisis could be felt into .\"The explosion of choice and innovation seen in the sector in the last decade has been fundamentally altered in a matter of months, and while all eyes will inevitably be on this winter, the need for an enduring solution to ensure that the gains experienced by almost three decades of competition are not lost,\" said its senior consultant, Craig Lowrey.Earlier on Wednesday, the UK gas price traded as high as p a therm. The trading price was p a therm at the start of the year.Jonathan Brearley, the boss of Ofgem, has warned that the cost of protecting customers from failing energy providers could lead to higher bills."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : pmChristmas shopping is set to get a whole lot easier for one lucky person, as The Orcadian’s Loves Local Loyalty Card competition makes a grand .

Proposals also include “active travel” routes, e-bike chargers and welcome facilities, alongside coach permits and charging at some car parks.The programme is being funded with joint investment of up to £. million from the Scottish Government and UK Government, as part of the Islands Growth Deal — a ten-year investment programme jointly funded by the UK and Scottish governments, the three island councils and their partners from the public, academic and business sectors.During the in-person sessions, due to take place next Tuesday and Wednesday, attendees will be guided through proposals with representatives from project partners.OIC leader, Councillor James Stockan, said: “The Islands Deal commitment we have from the Scottish and UK Governments to support the Orkney Gateway is hugely gratying and reflects the position our World Heritage Site holds as one of the jewels in Scotland’s and indeed the UK’s tourism crown — not to mention the global archaeological signicance of the site.“But we must remember that at the core of this is a landscape and series of monuments which for many Orcadians is a direct, mysterious and powerful link to their past. And we know equally they are held very dear by people who’ve moved into these islands over the years.“So, as partners, we are all very clear that we want to gather local people’s views on the range of options that we could bid for through our final Islands Deal business case.”The consultation events are scheduled for Tuesday, October , at Maeshowe Visitor Centre, Stenness, from pm to pm, and Wednesday, October , at St Magnus Centre, Kirkwall, from pm until pm.If you’re unable to attend these events, further information is available at www.orkney.gov.uk orkneygateway.

Safety is paramount and although the vehicle used will be capable of driving itself, a driver will be present at all times to take controlrequired.Widespread use of self-driving vehicles is expected by next decade and the findings of the project will be used to determine how countries across Europe can effectively implement them # including considering how they fit in with green transport and spatial planning strategies, as well as likely socio-economic impacts.Representatives from the project partners will be in attendance including HITRANS , More Work Less Carbon — a company based in Utrecht, Netherlands, who will supply the AVs — and Robert Gordon University.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This includes Memorandums of Understanding with Orkney Harbour Authority and Scrabster Harbour Trust to enhance port infrastructure and position the area more competitively to support offshore wind projects in the future.The announcement of this bid comes after the completion of the leasing round of Scotwind, a programme which will lease areas of the seabed around Scotland for wind farm developments.The Scottish Government hopes that as much as ten gigawatts of new generating capacity will be built over the next decade.Stephen Kerr, project director of the West of Orkney Windfarm, said: “While ScotWind has created the opportunity for a global industry to tap into Europe’s best wind resource, our consortium believes that success will be driven by targeted proposals built upon strong local relationships.”We have designed our bid specically around this location and brought together a unique combination of stakeholders to maximise the opportunities for the region.“In particular, the upcoming round of offshore wind projects are a terric opportunity for ports in Caithness and Orkney to win signicant long-term contracts in the installation and operational phase of these major infrastructure schemes.“Our agreements with Scrabster Harbour Trust and Orkney Harbour Authority will enable us to work together with a clear focus on long term delivery. Each port has its own specic capabilities and attributes, and on successful site award we have committed to fund collaborative design and supply studies and to invest where appropriate in improving each harbour’s infrastructure.“We will apply a similar collaborative approach across the supply chain, working closely with Scottish and UK suppliers to deliver on climate targets and enhance local economies.”The consortium has undertaken extensive site investigations, including birds, marine mammals and near-shore geophysical surveys, and has finalised a grid connection agreement with National Grid that will enable the project to commence generation in .Jim Buck, harbourmaster for Orkney Harbour Authority, said that Scapa Flow # the second largest natural harbour in the world # offers an environment like no other and said that the £million masterplan to develop ports around Orkney is key in attracting new business to the islands. “Our Masterplan embraces decarbonisation and a transition away from fossil fuels,” said Mr Buck.“It includes a range of infrastructure enhancements across key locations around the Orkney mainland, including a new deep-water facility in Scapa Flow, which will be crucial to us realising our ambition to deliver social and economic benefit from offshore wind energy.“The West of Orkney Windfarm is ideally positioned to make signicant use of these future facilities and this collaboration represents another key step on our journey to position Orkney as a base for innovation and a major contributor in delivering a carbon-free future for the islands.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But were it not for Murdo Dan’s job as a joiner and Chrissie Mary doing a few shts as a carer, their economic ‘situation’ would be very dficult indeed.To supplement their income, they have decided to use their meagre savings, borrow a not insignicant sum from their local bank, and apply to stick a couple of pods on the croft.Meanwhile, Nigel and Pippa saw a croft for sale in the Sunday Times Property Section for what they thought was a snip at £k and decided to use part of a trust fund to purchase it as a commercial investment.They thought that they could also capitalise on the local tourist ‘boom’ and have applied to turn the derelict croft house into a vegan cafe and craft shop and also to stick several pods on their newly acquired croft to offer a ‘holistic getaway’ for their jet-set pals.Do you, and I certainly don’t mean to pre-judge anyone who reads this paperthink that their ‘cases’ should be treated any dferently by the local planning authorities If the answer is “yes”, then think again.Too dficult a scenario to judge Try this one.Should an application to build a couple of pods on a croft, which is basically  per cent bog, in the middle of Ranish and has no view of anywhere except adjacent croft bog, be given any additional merit over a similar application in beautul Scaristavore or Ardroil where ‘breathtaking scenery’ will be the selling tagline Wrong again.As a member of the local planning board here in the Western Isles, I’m more than well aware of what my responsibilities are and it’s certainly not to pre-judge any applications based on my own preconceptions, or prejudicesof what should or shouldn’t be allowed.I’ve to stick to the guidelines and the training I’ve been given, understand what’s expected of meand to base my decision without emotion or bias. across the front pages of this paper and others, on social media and the television news, can influence any of my our decisions.The capitalist playground which crofting tenure has now become, and the seismic change in the scale of speculation on ‘marketable’ properties available, is in danger of knocking the fragile socio-economic balance of the west of Scotland even further off its already very shoogly axis.Crofts have now become the equivalent of crypto-currency the ‘Bitcoins’ which can provide financial security for those fortunate enough to be sitting on ‘gold’.What’s being done to stabilise and bring a dose of reality to a market which threatens to get completely out of control How can single iniduals be able to own several crofts with not an intention to ‘work’ or develop any single one of them I believe that a crofting historian once said that this form of land tenure has become ‘the single biggest impediment to sustainable development in Western Scotland and the Highlands and Islands’.That wasn’t yesterday.‘Things’ are already well out of control.But who should intervene I’m not the only one who keeps asking the question.Apparently ‘we’ should legislate to address.We need, it has been suggested, to become Jersey or Guernsey.That people shouldn’t be allowed to buy homes here unless they intend to be used as a primary residence .Second homes taxation needs to increase signicantly and the additional income be used to support tourism infrastructure.From the Butt to Bodmin there have been ious proposals as to how to legislate to prevent the worst effects of tourism from destroying fragile local economies.Have any worked, andso, could they be implemented here to make any dference Let me be very clear.Tourism is hugely important to our rural economy.More so since Brexit and Covid.But I’ll say this again, at the risk of boring you all: it needs to be carefully nurtured and sustainably developed.We cannot survivewe turn our villages into ‘ghost-towns’#yes, I know…..for the winter months.We need a balance, we need the ‘tools’ with which to legislate properly and we need those charged with ‘oversight’ to take better ownership.We need, and I’ve yet to see any evidence of this, these same people to begin to take this seriously.For our future generations.They are the ones who will be impacted mostwe don’t sit up and pay attention.Now."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CATTLE-SALES-SEP-21-2-scaled.jpg","title":"remember your roots skye plan is urged to recognise","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThose were the comments of Roddy Murray, former Western Isles councillor and now the grazings clerk for Tarskavaig in Sleat, who this week voiced his concern that there was no mention of crofting at all in the ‘Skye and Raasay Future’ plan published in August with the full backing of all four local councillors.He told the Free Press: “There are  projects listed in the plan but not a single mention of crofting. Crofting is the basis for so many of the settlements on Skye outwith Portree, Broadford and Kyleakin and this should have been acknowledged.“There is quite a signicant impact from crofting on the economic and social well-being of Skye and Raasay. You only have to look at the , high quality calves sold for high prices last week in Portree to see that.”In terms of infrastructure improvements to support crofting, Mr Murray said the auction mart in Portree must be redeveloped to improve parking and animal welfare, and an abattoir facility must be provided so that livestock does not have to be driven to Dingwall.He added: “We are being told by the Scottish Crofting Federation that there is a huge demand for new crofts.#To meet that demand we either have to encourage landowners to make this happen or there has to be acquisition of an estate.“If we want to keep our young people in our communities we need to address the availability of crofts.”The Scottish Government are guilty of an “abject failure” when it comes to creating new crofts on publicly-owned land, Mr Murray added.Stung by the criticism, the council said they hoped to “discuss the plan further with organisations like the Crofting Commission” and would be keen to hear from any other interested parties.A spokeswoman said: “Skye and Raasay Future has been prepared with and by wider representatives of the community across the area.#It reflects people’s vision and priorities for the future, following feedback gathered through workshops and online consultations held throughout the year.“In workshop discussions, the important role that crofting plays in the identity and culture of Skye and Raasay communities has been clearly referenced..#Skye councillor John Finlayson said all stakeholders should be involved in “shaping, evaluating and changing” the plan’s priorities and he acknowledged the importance of crofting “in all its guises” across Skye and Raasay.He added: “Crofting is still a central part of le on Skye and while it is part of our history and culture it will also I hope continue to be a key part of our future and it is an important element of SARF.#As those who took part in the engagement to create the initial plan agreed, it is important that representatives from the crofting community are fully engaged in the continued development and implementation of the plan and I am confident this will happen.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1632989885154.jpg--top_tips_for_safe_student_accommodation.jpg?1632989893000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20210930newstop tips for safe student accommodation","story":"With freshers week around the corner and thousands of young people in Northern Ireland set to start University or new career paths, many will be on the hunt for rented accommodation. Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.

Basic banking services is something the Post Office provides for all banks in Northern Ireland. Alternatively customers could consider switching their bank account.” Further advice and support is available on the Consumers Council’s website , including a branch closure factsheet, a personal banking guide, a guide to switching banks and a current account comparison table.

He is the chair of the UK Accommodation Group , which he set up with fellow investors to restructure Signature Living#s operations last September.Mr Kearney had said that UKAG had “mobilised the vast majority of unsecured investors in supporting Lawrence Kenwright and have worked diligently on a recovery plan”, and said that “crucially Lawrence has handed over control” of operations.Mr Kenwright had admitted he was “ceding controland giving them final say in decisions”. He added: “We have faced a unique set of circumstances in trying to finish the George Best Hotel and I am extremely grateful for this support.”Signature Living did not respond to a request for comment by time of going to press on Wednesday night..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadReunication of Ireland is close, says top economist PosenSDLP MLA Cara Hunter: My living hell with brain tumour at Mark Goddard, disgraced PSNI officer, is officially kicked out of the forceShould I call in twice  BBC’s Nolan criticised by ‘Damian from Londonderry’ over Derry policyNI high street voucher: , applications blockedTop Videos Blank owners, Jonny and Christina Taylor, with new general manager, Alex Daley, and head chef, Niall Duffy\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dcc .ece AUTOCROP wh nch%of%Blank%Team%.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dcc .ece AUTOCROP wh nch%of%Blank%Team%.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   Blank owners, Jonny and Christina Taylor, with new general manager, Alex Daley, and head chef, Niall Duffy\"PlayVideo: New Belfast restaurant opens but there#s no menuPlayVideo: Will Belfast spend the high street voucher wisely PlayVideo: Cave surfer unearths a stunningly beautul hidden gem in KerryLatest Northern IrelandStormont Executive meets to consider Covid- rule changesUlster Unionists must improve its gender imbalance, says leader Doug BeattieSDLP MLA Cara Hunter thankful for support after speaking out about brain tumourChildren affected by immigration rules and at poverty risk, commissioner warnsIrish FA won’t reveal how many Northern Ireland players have been vaccinatedLatestEnergy bills forecast to rise by % in Daniel Craig honoured with star on the Hollywood Walk Of FameWhat the papers say – October Judge orders Texas to suspend new law banning most abortionsQueen to launch baton relay for Commonwealth Games,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

You might be for it, you might be against it. I was neither. I just wanted to get back to normality as soon as I could.“Some might call me a wee bit silly or naive but I’ve got it and I’ve had no issues with it.”McGinn added he took the vaccine as it was “just about being safe”.Baraclough said he will be taking the booster jab as soon as possible.“For me, it makes me feel better about things but also opens up travel in the world,” said the Northern Ireland boss. “Covid passports are going to be a thing for us all in the near future.”At least five members of the England squad have reportedly refused the jab despite organisers of next year’s Qatar World Cup planning to ban all unvaccinated players.Republic of Ireland boss Stephen Kenny said any plans on banning unvaccinated players from international duty was “too radical”.According to the manager, who is doubly vaccinated, the number of players without the first or second dose in his -man squad to face Azerbaijan on Saturday is in single figures.“It would be quite a radical viewpoint to just say, ‘Whoever is not vaccinated is not being selected in the future’,” said Kenny.“I’m not aware of anybody who has done this in any sport at the moment.“It would be a radical decision to exclude people based on not having the vaccine and exclude them from the international team.“That would be a very strong and complex stand to take.”Ireland and West Brom striker Callum Robinson has so far declined the opportunity to take the vaccine.The -year-old missed games for his country after testing positive in November  and again in August.“It’s obviously annoying that I’ve caught it twice but I haven#t been vaccinated,” said Robinson. “Further down the line I could change my mind and want to do it.”England manager Gareth Southgate said he “didn’t know” what the vaccination rate was within his squad but believed it wasn#t going to affect the players as they remain in a bubble..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Related topicsNorthern Ireland Football TeamIan BaracloughMore On Northern Ireland Football TeamJonny Evans concerns mount for Northern Ireland as brother Corry joins list of withdrawals ahead of Switzerland and Bulgaria ties PremiumDaniel Ballard can become a Premier League star when he goes back to Arsenal, says Northern Ireland team-mate Craig CathcartBailey Peacock-Farrell has answered ‘fairly harsh’ Northern Ireland critics, says Jonny Tuffey PremiumIan Baraclough’s new contract can fire Northern Ireland towards major goals: Craig CathcartConor Bradley tipped for top future by Northern Ireland captain Steven Davis after big Liverpool debutMost ReadReunication of Ireland is close, says top economist PosenSDLP MLA Cara Hunter: My living hell with brain tumour at Mark Goddard, disgraced PSNI officer, is officially kicked out of the forceShould I call in twice  BBC’s Nolan criticised by ‘Damian from Londonderry’ over Derry policyNI high street voucher: , applications blockedTop Videos Blank owners, Jonny and Christina Taylor, with new general manager, Alex Daley, and head chef, Niall Duffy\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dcc .ece AUTOCROP wh nch%of%Blank%Team%.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dcc .ece AUTOCROP wh nch%of%Blank%Team%.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   Blank owners, Jonny and Christina Taylor, with new general manager, Alex Daley, and head chef, Niall Duffy\"PlayVideo: New Belfast restaurant opens but there#s no menuPlayVideo: Will Belfast spend the high street voucher wisely PlayExplainer: What is the Northern Ireland Protocol Latest Northern IrelandStormont Executive meets to consider Covid- rule changesFamily won’t allow George Best’s name to be used for hotelUlster Unionists must improve its gender imbalance, says leader Doug BeattieSDLP MLA Cara Hunter thankful for support after speaking out about brain tumourChildren affected by immigration rules and at poverty risk, commissioner warnsLatestEnergy bills forecast to rise by % in Daniel Craig honoured with star on the Hollywood Walk Of FameWhat the papers say – October Judge orders Texas to suspend new law banning most abortionsQueen to launch baton relay for Commonwealth Games,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Five of the complaints were upheld, with three officers dismissed and two jailed.Yesterday, a senior officer said the PSNI is currently investigating six cases of a sexual nature and seven domestic violence cases involving serving police officers.Deputy Chief Constable Mark Hamilton told Radio Ulster’s Talkback that since the Freedom of Information request revealed the figures, a third officer has been dismissed from his role, convicted in court and sentenced to prison for misconduct in public office, where he “abused his position for sexual gain”.We have an officer in prison for two years who was sentenced this summer we have also an officer who was sentenced to prison for possession of indecent images,” he told the programme.Read More PSNI officers quizzed over sexual misconduct claims in last five years‘Cop who used me for sex after arrest deserves jail’Among the  officers investigated, the type of sexual misconduct reported included voyeurism, possession of child pornography, rape and purchasing sexual services.When askedthe  allegations over five years seemed “high” considering the size of the PSNI as a police force, Mr Hamilton said it is “broadly similar” to other forces.He added: We have six cases of a sexual nature and about seven domestic violence cases ongoing at the moment as well. Some of the cases overlap between domestic abuse and sexual offences as well.“I don’t think it is disproportionately high, but I don’t accept that any of it should be happening at all.” People Before Profit MLA Gerry Carroll described the figures as deeply disturbing. He asked Justice Minister Naomi Long for her reaction yesterday at Stormont. Mrs Long said it was important that serious offenders were removed from their post.At Stormont, People Before Profit MLA Gerry Carroll asked the minister: I would like to ask for your assessment on the deeply disturbing news that at least  police officers have been subject to internal investigation over allegations of sexual misconduct in the last five years Mrs Long referred to heightened public concern following the conviction of politan Police officer Wayne Couzens for the murder of Sarah Everard. She said: I think like everyone in the chamber, we have all been touched by what happened in the case of Sarah Everard.Read MorePSNI working on strategy to tackle violence against women and girls in light of Sarah Everard’s murderIt has brought home a reality for many women in our society that even those who appear to be figures of trust are often predators, and that fear that lies with every woman who is alone, who is trying to go about their daily business, that they may be preyed upon by someone. I think it is all the more acute at this time.”The minster added  she is “aware that there are a number of people who have been dismissed from their post and I believe that in cases of serious offending, that is important, because we need to know that when we turn to a police officer in a moment of distress that we are safe and that we are confident we will remain safe in doing so”..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadReunication of Ireland is close, says top economist PosenSDLP MLA Cara Hunter: My living hell with brain tumour at Mark Goddard, disgraced PSNI officer, is officially kicked out of the forceShould I call in twice  BBC’s Nolan criticised by ‘Damian from Londonderry’ over Derry policyNI high street voucher: , applications blockedTop Videos Blank owners, Jonny and Christina Taylor, with new general manager, Alex Daley, and head chef, Niall Duffy\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dcc .ece AUTOCROP wh nch%of%Blank%Team%.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dcc .ece AUTOCROP wh nch%of%Blank%Team%.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   Blank owners, Jonny and Christina Taylor, with new general manager, Alex Daley, and head chef, Niall Duffy\"PlayVideo: New Belfast restaurant opens but there#s no menuPlayVideo: Will Belfast spend the high street voucher wisely PlayVideo: Cave surfer unearths a stunningly beautul hidden gem in KerryLatest Northern IrelandStormont Executive meets to consider Covid- rule changesFamily won’t allow George Best’s name to be used for hotelUlster Unionists must improve its gender imbalance, says leader Doug BeattieSDLP MLA Cara Hunter thankful for support after speaking out about brain tumourChildren affected by immigration rules and at poverty risk, commissioner warnsLatestEnergy bills forecast to rise by % in Daniel Craig honoured with star on the Hollywood Walk Of FameWhat the papers say – October Judge orders Texas to suspend new law banning most abortionsQueen to launch baton relay for Commonwealth Games,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This incident will raise questions for many organisations, not just Facebook.”For a brief moment in time, we were thrust into history. Perhaps  years from now, we’ll be watching a streaming service documentary, a television company making one of those back-in-time programmes. Living in the s. No social media. How did we all cope Perhaps, once a year, we should have an enforced social media holiday. A bank holiday style arrangement where the networks cease for  hours, a little reminder of what’s important in le. A little social contact for real, a visit to a friend for a chat and a coffee, a switch off from the bombardment of bullies, opinions and what other people had for dinner at that posh restaurant we can’t afford to go to.The business community might not agree. Millions of pounds could be lost, such has the importance of social media become.There seems no happy medium in the social media world. Either people cry out for help, or hit us with all that’s good in their lives, making us feel ever so slightly inadequate in our own existence.Perhaps, away from that quagmire, we can simply be content with our own lives for a bit  The reliance on internet facilities, though, means the days of a simpler live those of a certain age remember are no longer with us for more than the time it takes for the technical boffins to find a fix for a system failure,You can bet the first thing most teenagers did was go on to Twitter to complain about Facebook and WhatsApp not working, stare pleadingly at phone screens, tap the screen to seethat helped and try the old favourite, switch off and on to seethat helped. But maybe a step back into real le was the way to go to see how that fitted  Here’s five things we could have done.... Put the phone down and read a book instead.... Took a breath, relaxed and enjoyed the moments of freedom. Gone out, met a friend, or at least made a phone call rather than sending a message. It’s good to talk! Maybe even a newspaper!. Teenagers could have appeared from the undergrowth, back out in the open, away from the lairs of their rooms. Likely coming down the stairs to complain their phone wasn’t working, but at least there could have been interaction.. Offered to make someone a consoling cup of tea.

In circumstances like this, cash is king, but when you continue to stockpile cash long after you’ve reached your emergency fund number, that’s when it begins to hurt you financially.Excess savings sitting in accounts earning negative s mean the purchasing power of those savings are going down in value, and whilst that may not hurt your finances much in the short term, it’s the opportunity lost in not investing in accounts that are producing much better s that will.The opportunity cost for one client of mine who had €, sitting in a deposit account, that had no reason to be there, was €, over just one year.         I had a zoom call with her back in February and she told me she had savings of c. €, sitting in a deposit account earning .%. But when you factor in DIRT tax and inflation, her actualwas -.%.Anyway, she knew she was cash heavy, but was unsure how much of the €, she should ide up and what number should be assigned to her emergency fund and what could be set aside for investment and so on.So, what I suggested to her was very similar to what is primarily used when it comes to pension planning in retirement, and it’s known as The Bucket Strategy. I thought the concept is such a great one, it should be adapted and used when it comes to iding up the amounts people have accumulated in cash.The solution is iding up the amount you have in savings into three dferent accounts, and the amount you deposit into each account is based on:n When you need the moneyn How long you want it to last for, andn How much you need or can set asideWhen we applied this logic, the strategy for her looked something like this:Bucket Number  – Emergency FundAccount Type: CashRisk: ZeroPurpose: Covers emergency expenses for  monthsOptimum Balance in Account: €,We looked at what deficit would existthere was a loss of income, and we focused on the cost of funding those priority expenses that must be covered and paid. And we discovered that monthly cost was €,.We were happy that having  months of those expenses in an account dedicated for this eventuality was enough.So, she set up a separate account, called it her emergency fund and transferred €, into it. Next up was,Bucket Number  – Short Medium Term ExpensesAccount Type: Cash Fixed TermRisk: ZeroPurpose: Known, once off expenses, incurred in the next   monthsOptimum Balance in Account: €,This is an account you set funds aside for large once off expenses you know you’re going to incur in the next  months.The women I met was planning on changing her car next year and whilst she didn’t know exactly what car she was going to buy, €, was a good number to ring fence from her savings.But rather than leaving this amount sitting in a deposit account, she moved it to a fixed notice account for  months, earning .%. It’s still a terriblebut at least it was  times better than leaving it where it was.Bucket Number  – InvestmentAccount Type: EquityRisk: MediumPurpose: Make money beat inflationOptimum Balance in Account: €,Now more than ever, you need to be invested in equity-based accounts, you just have to.We set up this type of account up for the woman I met back in February where she deposited €, into it. And theon the account since then, has been +.%. The same account had s of +.% over  year and +.% over  years.Contrast them to the .% she was making by holding excess savings in cash.It meant her €, was going down in value by € every year.But had she set aside €, a year ago in an equity account, it would have gone up by €,.And eventhe equity s dropped in value by c. % from what they made last year, they’d still be % more than what she’d getshe left her money languishing in a deposit account.Whatever way you want to present it, the dference is staggering, and the reason I said from the outset, why holding too much cash is bad for your finances.One of the long-term financial effects, Covid could leave on people, is a fear that something like this could happen again, so people begin to hoard money and whilst there isn’t anything wrong with that, it’s where they leave this money accrue that’s the problem. And that’s in cash accounts that are earning nothing. Let me repeat again, those accounts are fine for your emergency fund, but once you’ve past that amount, you really need to consider other accounts that will yield higher s.And perhaps not everyone will have enough in savings to fill three buckets.They may not have enough to fill even one, and that’s okay as well becauseyou follow this very simple strategy, it will prevent you from using money that’s being invested but should really be assigned to your emergency fund or leaving money in an emergency fund that should be set aside for investment.So, you really need to know your numbers and the dficulty I find with people, is that they have one, maybe two accounts and the amount they’ve accumulated is used for everything i.e. emergency fund, investment and once off expenses.And this is one of the reasons people are not optimising their finances. They may have spare cash that could be used towards investment, but it’s getting lumped in with emergency funds and once off expenses and it stays there and earns nothing.Having a dedicated amount for specic purposes makes things much easier because you know, you have the optimum amount in place for each purpose and you know you’re not affecting other areas, either.And using the Bucket Strategy will help. It’s not time consuming to set up, but I assure you, it will be time well spent.Liam Croke is MD of Harmonics Financial Ltd, based in Plassey.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny.     The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  An artists impression of the planned Clanmil Housing Association development on Victoria Street.

Donna McLenaghan, who lives in Smiths Falls, Ontario, is hoping to find out more about the family of her great great grandparents who left County Derry for Perth, Canada in the s. googletag.cmd.push Charles McLenaghan and his we Annboth lived in the Dungiven area prior to emigrating.  “My ancestors were originally from Derry, Ireland. They lived around Dungiven before emigrating to Canada,” explained Donna. “The family name is McLenaghan and my great great grandmother who married into the family was an Osbourne and the Osbournes owned an estate called Altmover.” Donna says, according to parish records, the McLenaghans lived in a tract known as Boveva on lands they leased from a family named Carey. They lived there for many generations, which is proved by a lease from Captain Arthur Carey, dated , to Robert McLenaghan of Ballycargan, of the whole townland of Ballycargan Manor of Pellipan for  years. Records also show that many of the McLenaghan clan were schoolmasters and generally were people of superior education. The Osbourne family, whom were also prominent in the district, were originally English, coming from Leeds.  Their estate in County Derry was called Altmover and they were squires and landlords of the neighbourhood. Altmover remained in their possession until the twentieth century, the estate being broken up in .     Ann Osbourne, who was a daughter of the family and heiress to the estate, married Charles McLenaghan. They went on to have a son, named Nathaniel, who married a woman called Jane Morris from County Wexford.  The family then emigrated to Canada. Donna says another of her ancestors, Mary McLenaghanalso emigrated to Canada with their five sons. One of her sons was called Robert Meighan, who married the sister of George Stephen, the first president of Canadian Pacic Railway. She says Robert worked with his brother-in-law to negotiate rail lines between Perth, Ontario and Toronto.  He was also involved in other business and went on to buy a renaissance mansion from his brother-in-law which was called George Stephen House, also referred to as Mount Stephen Club. It has been used by ious Hollywood stars for shooting period films. Donna is now keen to piece together her family tree and hopes to reconnect with others in the area who may have connections to her ancestors. “I decided to trace my family roots out of a very keen desire to find out more about my family roots and possibly connect with relatives that may still be living in the area. “Im also very interested in my great great grandmother Ann Osbournes family as theres mention of it being the same name as the Dukes of Leeds and I wondershe was related to them.” Donna says she hopes to travel to Ireland soon and intends to make a visit to County Derry to visit the area where her ancestors were born. “I havent visited the area although I was hoping to while on a trip to England in  and have had the desire to for many years and hope to do so in the very near future. I feel such a closeness to Ireland as well as the UK since this is the region that my ancestors are from.”  Consultation to be opened on County Derry Park and Ride  Minister for Infrastructure Nichola Mallon has announced the move.

Donna McLenaghan, who lives in Smiths Falls, Ontario, is hoping to find out more about the family of her great great grandparents who left County Derry for Perth, Canada in the s. googletag.cmd.push Charles McLenaghan and his we Annboth lived in the Dungiven area prior to emigrating.  “My ancestors were originally from Derry, Ireland. They lived around Dungiven before emigrating to Canada,” explained Donna. “The family name is McLenaghan and my great great grandmother who married into the family was an Osbourne and the Osbournes owned an estate called Altmover.” Donna says, according to parish records, the McLenaghans lived in a tract known as Boveva on lands they leased from a family named Carey. They lived there for many generations, which is proved by a lease from Captain Arthur Carey, dated , to Robert McLenaghan of Ballycargan, of the whole townland of Ballycargan Manor of Pellipan for  years. Records also show that many of the McLenaghan clan were schoolmasters and generally were people of superior education. The Osbourne family, whom were also prominent in the district, were originally English, coming from Leeds.  Their estate in County Derry was called Altmover and they were squires and landlords of the neighbourhood. Altmover remained in their possession until the twentieth century, the estate being broken up in .     Ann Osbourne, who was a daughter of the family and heiress to the estate, married Charles McLenaghan. They went on to have a son, named Nathaniel, who married a woman called Jane Morris from County Wexford.  The family then emigrated to Canada. Donna says another of her ancestors, Mary McLenaghanalso emigrated to Canada with their five sons. One of her sons was called Robert Meighan, who married the sister of George Stephen, the first president of Canadian Pacic Railway. She says Robert worked with his brother-in-law to negotiate rail lines between Perth, Ontario and Toronto.  He was also involved in other business and went on to buy a renaissance mansion from his brother-in-law which was called George Stephen House, also referred to as Mount Stephen Club. It has been used by ious Hollywood stars for shooting period films. Donna is now keen to piece together her family tree and hopes to reconnect with others in the area who may have connections to her ancestors. “I decided to trace my family roots out of a very keen desire to find out more about my family roots and possibly connect with relatives that may still be living in the area. “Im also very interested in my great great grandmother Ann Osbournes family as theres mention of it being the same name as the Dukes of Leeds and I wondershe was related to them.” Donna says she hopes to travel to Ireland soon and intends to make a visit to County Derry to visit the area where her ancestors were born. “I havent visited the area although I was hoping to while on a trip to England in  and have had the desire to for many years and hope to do so in the very near future. I feel such a closeness to Ireland as well as the UK since this is the region that my ancestors are from.”  Consultation to be opened on County Derry Park and Ride  Minister for Infrastructure Nichola Mallon has announced the move.

Reporter: Michael McMullan Oct   addthis, In this weekends intermediate championship schedule, its all about getting eight teams down to four ahead of the quarter-finals later this month. Limavady v BallymaguiganThursday- OwenbegReferee: Kieran OConnor The first game of this this weekends action is a repeat of last years clash at the same stage when Limavady were convincing winners to knock Ballymaguigan out of the championship.When the sides met in last months group stages, it was a gripping contest won by Sheagh McLaughlins late thunderbolt to the top corner of the Quigan net, as a Cormac Quigley inspired Limavady came out winners again.Ballymaguigan lost out to Lissan and played second fiddle to Steelstowns blue wave in their final game.Daniel Bradley should be back this weekend after missing the game with illness.Michael Spiers made himself an outlet in attack and Shea Bradley battled well at midfield, but they will need another big performance this week.Limavady should have Oran Hartin back between the posts this weekend after John Deighans cameo in the last round. Karl Diamond and Fabian Muldoon will hope that Conor Boyd is fully fit to start after his substitute appearance against Lissan. His bravery, use of the ball and positional sense will bring stability to their defence. Not to mention his experience.Theyll have to keep an eye on Paudie Martin in attack after his three goals in as many games. It will be interesting to seeCiaran McIvor and Darren Conway are included from the start, or kept in reserve for when the game opens up.Limavady won the sweeper battle, with Kieran McGlinchey imposing himself on their counter-attacking game, with Tomaacutes Brady overworked and being the third marker Cormac Quigley went through on the night.Thursday will be about whoever can make the wide open spaces their friend and the Wolfhounds may be better equipped and their goal threat could see them into the last eight.VERDICT: Limavady googletag.cmd.push Glenullin v SlaughtmanusFriday- Celtic ParkReferee: Gregory McWilliams Glenullins inconsistent season arrives at the final fork in the road on Friday night at Owenbeg as Liam Bradleys side put their championship cards of the table. There are no more chances. This is championship as we know it and standing in their way is a Slaughtmanus side they defeatedfive weeks ago in the group stages.The Glens narrow defeat at the hands of Castledawson was followed by a disappointing performance at Faughanvale, a game they never got to grips with.In the absence of Eoin Bradley, their young guns of Fearghal Close and Michael Oacuteg McKeown asked a lot of Castledawsons defence, with Neil McNicholl also a welcome . They will be without Skinner who will be on duty with Coleraine.The Glen have found an excellent keeper in Sean McKinney, behind a defence backboned by the OKanes. Ronan Close, Traglach Bradley and Brian Mullan will provide their midfield spine.Slaughtmanus could again be without Conor McGee, Gavin McShane and Eoghan Cassidy, but the have still been able to create chances. All they need is a day when their threat clicks and the net is bulging rather than another day of regrets and head scratching. Their clash with the Vale wouldve been oh so dferent had they taken even one of their goal chances when they trailed - to -.Goalkeeper Conor Thornton has , but theyll nee to maximise their output from Caolan Hargan and Killian Thornton up front, with Kyle Gallagher pulling the pieces together.A tight game in prospect, with Bakers side to come through.VERDICT: Glenullin Lissan v GlackSaturday– GlenReferee: Dan Mullan Two years ago, Glack were in flying form on their way to the junior title, but have since lost their mojo and have trudged their way though the season in Division .Lissan, while playing in a higher ision, failed to win a game, but they gave plenty of teams trouble. Their one-point defeat early in the season to eventual champions Drumsurn showed the promise they have.Former Derry minor captain Iarlaith Donaghy has been their consisitent cog all season and he kicked four points in their defeat at the hands of Limavady.They will take confidence from their win over Ballymaguigan into Saturdays trip to Glen.Glack have good performances from Ryan OKane, Martin McGonigle, Ryan Morgan and Adam OKane for much of the season. Adrian McGilligans side had the league win over Ballerin, in which they denied the Sarsfields the title, as a sign of they can do. But with too much reliance on Niall McGOwan for scores, it leaves Lissan with a target – stop him and they could repeat their  season and nip a spot in the Quarter-FinalsVERDICT: Lissan     Castledawson v Doire TrasnaSaturday– DungivenReferee: TBCA team we know much about and will be contenders for the biggest prize on offer next month against Doire Trasna who havent got going. Literally.Their two concessions against Greenlough and Drumsurn raised a few eyebrows across the county. Covid, players away at college and injuries combined into their reasoning for not fielding. It leaves them totally undercooked for a game theyd have been facing an uphill battle with even their full compliment of players.Eoghan Quigg, Micheaacutel McNaught and Colin Murray have been their key men in attack in recent times, with Tomaacutes McCrossan their anchor in defence and Paul Quigley at midfield.In recent times their management duo have had to get the boots on and their lack of collective training doesnt bode well ahead or Saturdays encounter.Dawson manager Niall Jackman admits to using the league to blood new players, with the view of drawing up a side later in the season. Players like Niall Rafferty in their defence. And that time is now.They can count themselves unlucky not to get something out of their group game against the Vale at home and they dug deep to see off Glenullin.Theof Niall Keenan has been a welcome addition and Niall McNicholl is in the form of his le, having got himself into great nick.

The financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here are two examples of how companies have been helped, and what support is available. googletag.cmd.push NORTHERN IRELAND IN NUMBERS , jobs furloughed through the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme up to May  , claims amounting to pound million through the Self- Employment Income Support Scheme up to May  Across the whole UK  per cent of those eligible for SEISS made a claim. The average value of a claim is pound, Source: Her Majesty’s Treasury CASE STUDY  SHNUGGLE  Planning, forward-thinking and invaluable help from the UK Government has enabled a Northern Ireland firm to ersy and remain solvent. When Covid- struck, Newtownards baby product manufacturer Shnuggle’s owners Sinead and Adam Murphy were prepared thanks to advice from their export colleagues in China. Sinead said: “We reduced our out-goings, put on pause our marketing spend in the business. We just tried to protect the cash that we had. “The first impact was our customers that we sell to in Asia. They all went into lockdown so our orders and sales to them stopped. But also a lot of our production happens out in Asia so our factories went into lockdown. “Luckily we had bought a lot of stock beforehand. We were so relieved that we had, at least we could carry on trading with our UK and European customers.” With around half of the company’s sales in the UK and Ireland and half in the export business, Shnuggle had to rely on their local retail-base. Sinead continued: “Baby items were classed as essential goods which was a huge relief to us. This meant as long as we could socially distance within the warehouse we could continue trading and selling online. All of our business is supplying other retailers like John Lewis, Mamas and Papas, Amazon. But our online sales actually grew because everyone was at home and maybe an element of panic buying.”      CASH HELP: The Shnuggle team Shnuggle took advantage of the furlough and Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Schemeschemes. Sinead said: “We furloughed five out of our  team, and were able to access the Business Interruption loan through Ulster Bank. “We were relieved to get the money in quickly, so we weren’t worrying about paying wages or our biggest overhead was our suppliers in China who were calling in all of their debts. “That was our biggest headache and stress, we owed signicant amounts of money to them and we didn’t have the cash as we needed time to sell our products.” Shnuggle also received a pound, Small Business Grant. Adam said: “Furloughing was brilliant, and the CBILS was the one that was the best for us because it meant that we could keep all our suppliers happy. “So even though we had a temporary dip in our sales, and obviously the inventory was sitting there ready to sell, it just kept us solvent and the cash flow moving. It’s really going to help us trade out of it, andall goes well, we should be able to get back into a reasonably strong cash position within the next six to  months. The loans coming in helped us to sleep at night.” The Government schemes also gave Sinead and Adam the freedom to ersy into the PPE market and the development of HeroShield Ltd, enabling local firms to unite to develop a protective face covering for key workers. This non-profit company designs, produces and distributes reusable visors.   ‘It’s surprisingly easy and money arrives quickly’ CASE STUDY  Q-MASS An unprecedented package of UK Government financial support has helped firms like Q-Mass in East Kilbride weather the coronavirus crisis. Director Ronnie Robertson said lockdown hit his company’s order book, but the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been vital to help them hang on to their valued staff. Ronnie said: “Before this, we had quite a good order book, with three to four months of work planned, so we were pretty worried where it was going to take us.” At first, he was worried how he would keep Q-Mass’  staff on the payroll, but then the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme was announced. It offers UK Government support to pay  per cent of staff’s wages up to pound, a month, and the scheme has now been extended until the end of October. Q-Mass manufactures bespoke parts for the oil, gas and defence industry so staff training is important. Ronnie said: “Our staff are very highly skilled. We’ve gathered a bunch of people here and trained them up and taken on apprentices. We do a lot of training, we’ve got good people, we train them a lot and we want to hang on to them.” He found applying for the furlough scheme quick and straightforward. He said: “It was surprisingly easy and we were surprised that the money came through relatively quickly.” Now staff at the firm who’ve been furloughed are gradually ing to work, with strict safety measures in place. Ronnie said: “We’ve put a day sht back on and we’ve still got a few office people working at home, with quite a few still on furlough.  ‘SURPRISINGLY EASY’: Q-Mass director Ronnie Robertson praises the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme “We’re just ticking over. We’re trying to cover our costs every month, trying to break even, to stay still. We’re looking at it thatwe can stay still we’re doing very well.” And because of the size of the building, maintaining a two-metre distance hasn’t been a problem for ing staff. Ronnie said: “It’s been really easy. We’ve got a big workshop with wide corridors and we’ve got a lot of the doors propped open internally so no-one has to touch doors or handles. We’ve got a few toilet areas with restrictions on them and a couple of one-way corridors, but the offices are open plan, so there’s no real need for people to be near each other. The workshop’s a big, wide-open space and we have to keep cleaning things like photocopiers and touch screens, but it’s been quite straightforward.” Now Ronnie’s looking forward to a brighter future. He said: “I feel like we’re on the side of the valley and we’re looking across to the other side and it looks absolutely fantastic.” Money for business and staff Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers. middot The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has enabled businesses to put employees on a period of temporary leaveand apply for a UK Government grant to cover  per cent of those workers’ usual monthly wage costs, up to pound, a month. middot The Self-Employment Income Support Scheme will allow eligible self-employed iniduals to claim a taxable grant of  per cent of their average monthly profits, up to pound,. middot UK VAT-registered firms have been given the option to defer VAT payments until the end of June.

Draperstown Rural College was opened almost  years ago by then Minister for Agriculture and the Economy in Northern Ireland, Baroness Denton of Wakefield. googletag.cmd.push The th century manor house at Derrynoid Lodge had been repurposed as a centre for corporate events including conferences, seminars, presentations, training, team building and conventions.  A gym, library and IT suite were also available on site, as well as accommodation, as the facility was launched with Department of Agriculture and International Fund for Irelandfunding in . The building has been dormant since its sudden closure in March , with this year marking the th year of a -year lease taken by current tenants Workspace Ltd. Strangford MLA Kellie Armstrong tabled a question on September  to Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots, asking why the site was not being used, and how much money was being spent on its upkeep. Alliance MLA for Strangford, Kellie Armstrong. A Department response on September  indicated they took no responsibility for costs relating to the former Rural College. “The buildings you refer to at Derrynoid forest near Draperstown are the subject of a  year lease with Workspace Ltd which commenced in ,” they said. “Under this lease the buildings were in use as a Rural College until its closure in .     “The buildings have been vacant since , and from then Workspace has explored numerous options to secure a future use for the buildings. “Despite their best efforts, to date this has proved to be unsuccessful. “While the current lease with Workspace Ltd remains in place, they continue to have full responsibility, in line with the lease obligations, for all ongoing costs associated with the buildings.” The buildings interior is currently fenced off since its closure in . When contacted by the County Derry Post, Ms Armstrong said she was astounded that the building was not in use. “My question to the Department sought to clary the situation. The Department has confirmed the buildings are indeed sitting empty.” she said. “I am aware of many rural businesses, community organisations and interim asylum accommodation needs that this space could provide. “I am very disappointed such a great venue is sitting not being used and there appears to be no plans by DAERA or the current leaseholder to utilise the resource.” The premises were opened in  by Baroness Denton of Wakefield. A number of attempts have been made by Workspace Ltd to find a licensee or operator for the premises since its closure a decade ago. An open day event was held in February , which the social enterprises website says was attended by hundreds, but no serious interest was forthcoming. Further attempts to find an occupant for the building were also made. In September , a Business Opportunity document again sought a licensee or operator. It outlined facilities available in Derrynoid, including  en-suite bedrooms in accommodation blocks, a multimedia centre, eight fully equipped training rooms and a small leisure suite. A restaurant and five offices were also detailed in the document, which suggests accommodation, conference facilities, healthcare, outdoor activity and commercial uses would be available. An aerial shot of the site in Derrynoid Forest. Mid Ulster MLA Emma Sheerin said any plans to repurpose the centre needed to be sustainable. “The rural college site is maintained by Workspace and all costs are managed by them,” she said. “I know that work is ongoing around plans for a purpose for the centre, and of course these have to be sustainable so that this resource is used in a way that maximises its potential. “We support Workspace in their efforts and hope to see the Rural College being used again in the near future.” The County Derry Post contacted Workspace Ltd for comment on the future of the premises and the associated costs, but no response was available at the time of going to press.

Ballymoney-based Dowds Group are organising a K run and walk in memory of their late colleague, Gary McSorley. The dad-of-two, who lived in Gortnaghey, passed away on April  following a battle with lung cancer. googletag.cmd.push The K run and walk will take place on Saturday, October  in Garvagh Forest and is open to people of all ages. Aideen McMichael, of Dowds Group, said the company wanted to pay tribute to Gary, an experienced electrician, who she described as a real character who is sorely missed by all. “In his memory we have started a fundraising campaign and his we and two daughters have nominated the ‘Cancer Fund for Children’ as their chosen charity. Cancer Fund for Children offer support to children and young people diagnosed with cancer, or living with a parent diagnosed with cancer, whether in their home, community, on the hospital ward or at their residential centre, so that no family has to face cancer alone,” said Aideen. “Family was very important to Gary and we would like to raise as much money as possible to ensure that other families going through cancer can avail of the support and care they need.” Gerry McCrystal was one of Garys close colleagues and friends at Dowds Group and he has encouraged everyone to support the event. “Gary was a dedicated worker and a very close work mate to many of us working on sites. He never failed to complete any task he was asked to do and he always treated everyone on the site in the same way,” said Gerry. “I first got to know Gary when he was working on an electrical job in Monaghan and a few years later Dowds Group were starting to put in place the electrical installation at the new Omagh hospital complex.     Material was arriving to site on fully-laden forty foot long lorries and I asked Paul Molloy for someone to help put all the material into containers for storage. Paul said leave it with me, I know the man for the job. The next morning, help arrived in the form of Gary himself and he did not stop until he had the containers packed tight. Gary also helped out in stores at busy times as well as keeping material cleared up on site.” Following a stint working in Scotland and London for Dowds, Gary ed to the North to work at the beginning of . Gerry said he travelled to Belfast by bus every morning to work on the new Ulster University building. Gerry fondly recalls their walks back to the Europa bus depot every evening. “In the evening time we had to walk  minutes to the bus station to get home again. Sometimes we would be walking up through the city and Id look around and there was Gary stopped to chat to or have banter with someone he knew. “One evening we were walking up Royal Avenue and Gary says hows Jimmy to a guy standing looking up at the front of a building. He then said to me do you know that boy  I looked behind us and said I didnt know the chap only to be told by Gary thats Jimmy Nesbitt,” laughed Gerry. On Saturday, partipants are asked to assemble at Garvagh Forest at am for .am start. Registration costs pound per adult, pound per childwhile under fives go free. Goodie bags will be available for the children afterwards. Limited parking will be available at the entry to the forest but free parking is available at the nearby Bridge Street car park. All proceeds from the event will go to Northern Ireland Cancer Fund for Children and a donation will be made to Garys family.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  An artists impression of the planned Clanmil Housing Association development on Victoria Street.

A report laying out the proposed dates for next years meetings was brought before the Corporate Policy and Resources Committee last week. DUP councillor Aaron Callan proposed the summer recess be extended for July and August, with the exception of the Planning Committee, as in recent years, the agenda had been light. googletag.cmd.push “Given the amount of people who werent at the meetings in August, I was wonderingwe could look at having the recess over August as well,” he said. “A lot of people take holidays in July and August, and Ive noticed this year there was very little business in August. “There wasnt much processed during those meetings and a lot of members were away, so Im wonderingwe should consider extending the recess through August as well.” Sinn Feacuteins Kathleen McGurk Cllr Kathleen McGurk said she would be concerned urgent business may not be dealt withthe recess was extended. “The only concern I would have is thatthere is any urgent business, that would be two months where it couldnt be signed off,” said the Sinn Feacutein representative. “We might need to have some consultation with senior management on whether it would have an impact on urgent business. “Maybe we could have a full council meeting solely for urgent business.” Cllr Darryl Wilson said that although the agenda tended to be light, there should be a minimum of a full council meeting in August.     “Consultation is important here, because we sit in here for a few hours, but the staff have to take the decisions away and work on them for weeks,” he told the Committee. After listening to the debate, Cllr Callan adapted his proposal to have a full council meeting and a Planning Committee meeting in August and the meeting schedule was approved by the Committee.

He said: “I know it sounds cliche that I was always interested in Art, but it’s true. What really interested me and got me thinking about studying Fashion in particular, is the conceptual aspect of collections and the future of fashion, in regard to heightening the human experience. “I never really considered art and design as a viable career path until I finished my A-Levels and started my Foundation Diploma at NWRC.

Being allowed to dabble in a range of specialisms and work out where my strengths lay was paramount in deciding what I was going to do next. “Ive just recently graduated and Im currently on the hunt for a menswear design role. Interning at McQueen really cemented my love for menswear and aspiration to work in such a fast-paced environment.     “This showcase, I hope, will be the next step on my career ladder and I would love for as many people as possible to show their support and vote.” You can view Conor’s Portfolio and vote for his work here.

Mary OKane, who lived and worked with a childrens charity as a volunteer inHaitifor a year, says she is so heartbroken by the consequences of the latest earthquake on August  . googletag.cmd.push The . magnitude earthquake that struck southern Haiti killed more than , and left , homeless. In a bid to help some of those affected, Mary has set up a GoFundMe page online called There is goodness inHaitieveryday. “One hundred per cent of any monies raised are going to the team on the ground there I worked with. This is important because many of us do not want to donate thinking that the funds go to administration, explained Mary. I am paying the administration fees for this appeal myself. The funds will be used to buy timber for simple wooden home structures and zinc sheets for roofs. These are all critical as after the hurricane, which damaged roads, bridges and peoples’ homes they had floods causing more damage and swept away homes, schools, hospitals and livelihoods. Many peopleare still living without shelter under heavy rain and cold nights under the sky.” Mary added: “I am appealing for any help people feel they can give during these times.Haitianpeople crave dignity and well-being and strive daily in a country with poor sanitation, little fresh water, hunger and barbaric violence.     This help is practical. It restores some dignity when we can rest in our own home as is their wish also. “When our loved ones are safe and secure, to the very best of our abilities, we believe it is good, and so it is.” To make a donation, visit https:gofundme dfda.

The farm allows small groups of people with a learning disability from the Mid Ulster area tolook after deer, pigs, geese, chickens hens, goats, rabbits, guinea pigs and a pony. They spend their day doing food preparation, feeding the animals, animal care and ground maintenance in a safe and enjoyable working environment. googletag.cmd.push Eamon Regan and Ioana ONeil and Dr Oliver and Amanda Shanks Mid Ulster Sanctuary official Opening. The farm is a joint initiative developed between Kilcreggan Homes and the Northern Health and Social Care Trust. Damian Cassidy, Chief Executive Officer of Kilcreggan Homes said: “Kilcreggan Homes are delighted to develop our services in this geographical area of the Northern Health and Social Care Trust, but especially with this specic type of therapeutic farming that we have championed over the past fteen years. We have witnessed the signicant positive impact this model has had on the lives of the service users and their families carers. “I would like to thank Mr Eamon Regan who has had a letime of interest in vulnerable groups for donating thisbeautully manicured site.  The sanctuary is open seven days a week and we are grateful to the local volunteers who provide their time throughout the week. Damian Cassidy and Eamon Regan Mid Ulster Sanctuary official Opening. “Interim findings from research carried out by Dr Laurence Taggart from Ulster University confirm further evidence of the benefits of therapeutic farming and we hope to use his findings in the development and design of future services.”     Jenner Welsh, Chief Executive of the Northern Trust said: “The therapeutic benefits of open space and small animal care, have been highlighted by our psychological services as very positive and important contributors to meeting the needs of those adults with learning dficulties. This new sanctuary offers our service users much needed le-enhancing opportunities through developing communication skills, self-esteem, self-care and helping to build relationships. The new service very much complements the opportunities provided to service users attending Trust adult day centres in the Mid Ulster area. Eamon Regan and Ioana ONeill Mid Ulster Sanctuary official Opening. But this particular model of delivery for day opportunities presents a new and innovative approach that enables community and voluntary sectors to invest in employment opportunities. It offers service users an important alternative to traditional buildings-based day care and supports the integration of service users into the community. This is fundamentally important to improving their quality of le and reducing social inequalities.” One service user who attends Mid Ulster Sanctuary said: “I love all the animals, I like gathering the eggs,I could live on the farm” A family carer said of their son’s placement: “He talks about these jobs that he does in the farm like he’s completed a day’s work. He will tell everybody about this work on a Wednesday for the full week, so to me,I think he does feel a sense of achievement, and he is so happy now.” Kilcreggan Homes is a registered charity that specialises in social housing, day opportunities and social enterprises for adults with learning disabilities, autism and acquired brain injury. In Carrickfergus they have developed a unique urban farm that provides therapeutic farming and horticulture, for these client groups with very positive outcomes for service users.

Rail lobby group, Into The West, say the site,built, will halt rail expansion from DerryReporter: Matthew Leslie Oct Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, Campaign group, Into The West, have warned it will be game over for rail expansion from Derrythe Clanmil housing development on Victoria Street goes ahead. Earlier this year, Clanmil had successfully appealed the decision by Derry City  Strabane District Council not to grant them permission to build on the Victoria Street site. googletag.cmd.push That green-light to Clanmil came to the dismay of Into The West who saw the prospect of the dry rail line on the site being dug up to make way for the planned new flats thereby putting a spanner in the works of the rail lobby groups hopes of having passenger trains run from Derry to the south and west of Ireland. Steven Bradley met with the Councils Governance  Strategic Planning Committee to discuss rail expansion from Derry. Cllr Sean Mooneyraised the following point to him. He said: “There seems to a pressing matter that could prevent any progress on this is the one of Clanmil and the possible development on the Victoria Road.” He proceeded to ask Mr Bradley: “In your view,that goes ahead and is built, is that game over for any future prospects of a rail review. Because when you look at the map, Derry is the end of the rail line when it comes in from Belfast. How  would you address a rail line going from Derry to Donegal or Strabane ”     Mr Bradley replied: “Personally speaking, I suspect it will . “If you start with the principle of a single, central station for the city – the Waterside – andyou accept that you cant cross north of the river over the Craigavon Bridge, because the space and angles arent there, the only way youre going to get rail south to Tyrone and then west to Donegal, is to pass through the Clanmil site. “So the other options involve putting s over the River Foyle, Bearing in mind that rail is heavy, youll be getting into big engineering solutions that are very costly. The economic viability of doing this will be blown out of the water. “Thats why I cant see it being viableClanmil build their structure. “Weve met with Clanmil and had discussions with the DfI . “Everything is in Clanmils court. The have planning permission to build that structure. They could start work on it tomorrow and nothing could be done to strip them unless the will is there to compulsory purchase it – which isnt there from the DfI and I suspect is not there from the Council either. “What were trying to do is to negotiate a solution whereby one of two alternatives happen. Either Clanmil can re-design their building and leave a strip clear between that building and the river so that rail in the future could run along there. “The second alternative were pushing for is for Clanmil to find an alternative site that they could transfer their ambitions onto and wed be very keen for the Council to assist them in that. “Otherwise I cannot see how youre going to get rail going south from Waterside towards Tyrone, Fermanagh and Donegal without going through that Clanmil site.” Clonmil Housing have been approached for comment. Earlier in the meeting, Mr Bradley outlined the inequalities of the current rail network in Northern Ireland by illustrating how everything appears to be geared in favour towards rail stations east of the River Bann.  How the rail network west and south from Derry might look in the future  He said: “We have fty-four railway stations in Northern Ireland of which only three are west of the River Bann. Belfast in greatly rich in rail provision compared to what we have here. “An all-Ireland map of the rail network never fails to shock. Its like someone took a pair of scissors and cut out the railways of a very important corner of the island – the North West. We are lobbying to see that situation changed. “Theres a very clear east-west disparity in terms of rail provisions. We have a six to fix list and so far only one of those has been fixed – the option to buy a ticket online from Derry that will get you to a station in Dublin without having to buy two separate tickets and having to pay extra for that. “It used to be that every station east of Coleraine could do that but we in Derry couldnt. That was fixed in Spring of last year so were grateful for that. “However, were still in the situation whereby Northern Irelands second biggest city – Derry – has only one train that gets people to Belfast before nine am in the morning. “Whether it be for studying or working, there is only one train – leaving at twelve minutes past six in the morning – that will get you in on time. “Coleraine on the other hand, has four trains that get you to Belfast before nine am. Even Portrush, a seaside villagehas two services that do that – one more than Derry. “When you look at peak hours, between four and six pm, theres a half-hourly service that runs from Belfast all the way to Coleraine and then stops there. We in Derry only have hourly services compared to all stations east of Coleraine. “Another fix is the Saturday night service. If you want to go to a concert or an evening out in Belfast, you have to leave before nine o clock at night because the last train that will get you back to Derry on a Saturday evening leaves at ten past nine. “Which means you will have to leave your dinner table or get out of the gig around half past eight in order to catch the train on time. “However,you lived in Coleraine, your last train back from Belfast leaves at twenty to eleven which is plenty of time to fully enjoy at night out in Belfast. “Sundays are a particular bug-bear. There are only six trains on a Sunday between Derry and Belfast – thats one every two hours. If you miss one, youre snookered and have to wait two hours for the next train. “Whereas every other station from Coleraine and eastwards, has a train going to Belfast every hour and has thirteen services in total. “Theres no rationale to have a dferent quality of service on a Sunday because people still need to go and visit people, still need to go to university in Coleraine, Derry or Belfast and people need to catch flights – all things that are done on a Sunday. “Even with the network we currently have, Derry is very much the second-class relation in terms of rail provision.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  An artists impression of the planned Clanmil Housing Association development on Victoria Street.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.         Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

The Formentor’s design inside and out is something quite dferent to what we have seen before, and brings with it a new dimension in style and sophistication. Being part of the Volkswagen Group means that Cupra has access to cutting-edge mechanicals and technology, and this has enabled the new Formentor compact SUV to hit the ground running, so to speak.  googletag.cmd.push   There is a lot of money and confidence behind the Cupra brand, and that is evident in the bold product plan promised by the company.Engine  Trim OptionsThe Formentor sits on the familiar MQB set of chassis components that also underpins other crossovers such as the Seat Ateca and VW Tiguan. Petrol engine options in the Formentor consist of a .-litre TSI with bhp and a .-litre TSI unit with a choice of ,  or bhp. The . TSI engine is available as a -speed manual or -speed DSG , while the . TSI comes with a DSG transmission as standard, with Cupra’s Drivesystem standard in bhp guise. A . TDIEVO engine is available with bhp and can be mated to a -speed manual or -speed DSG transmission, with the latter coming with Drive as standard.     Additionally, a .-litre e-Hybrid powertrain is available with a choice of bhp or bhp, both of which are mated to a -speed DSG transmission with promised fuel consumption as low as .l km on a combined WLTP driving cycle.There is a choice of two trim levels in CUPRA’s new compact SUV — Formentor and Formentor VZ — with the latter being the Cupra Formentor’s most powerful trim, named in reference to the Spanish word ‘Veloz’, meaning ‘fast’.The Formentor VZ trim offers high-performance powertrain options. Coming with ” alloy wheels, a ” Navigation system, autonomous assistance technology and performance bucket seats as standard.         Test CarMy test car was a Cupra Formentor . TSiDSGwhich was finished in stylish Graphene Grey Premium metallic paint with optional ” Exclusive Aero Black and Copper alloy wheels for an added dose of visual drama. Producing bhp and Nm of torque, the ,cc engine propels the Formentor from a standing start to km h in just .-seconds, on its way to a top speed of km h .Key standard features include full LED headlamps and Daytime Running Lights, rear ‘coast to coast’ light with welcome ceremony, front fog lamps with cornering , heat-insulated and tinted rear windows, leather-wrapped multi- heated sports steering wheel, dark aluminium glossy interior package, textile sport seats, keyless unlocking and ignition system, .” Digital Cockpit, ” Media System with DAB radio, Connect Online infotainment , rain and light sensor, heated front seats, adaptive cruise control, park assist, rear view camera, Drive Profile Selection, and auto high-beam assist, along with a suite of advanced safety systems.Optional extras fitted to my test car included premium metallic paint, black leather bucket seats, ” alloy wheels, hands-free electric tailgate, Dynamic Chassis Control, and Safe  Drive “L” . The sweet-revving petrol engine in my test car produces bhp and Nm of torque, enabling the car to sprint from -km h in .-seconds, with claimed fuel consumption as low as .-l km .As in other VW Group models, the .-litre engine is commendably quick to drop onto two cylinders to save fuel when cruising, and the process of cutting out and back in again is hard to detect. Composed and predictable handling is admirable, as is the Formentor’s ability to soak up road imperfections with ease.Impressive Sporty InteriorTake a seat behind the wheel of the CUPRA Formentor and you could be forgiven for thinking that you are in a hatchback rather than a compact SUV. The seating position is low, as is the base of the windscreen, so you feel like you sit much closer to the road — as you would in a performance-focused car.Selectable driving modes in the Formentor consist of Comfort, Sport, Cupra and Inidual, with each mode bringing a greater degree of aggression and engine noise that gets pumped through the cars speakers.Cabin space in the Formentor is excellent, with adults over six foot tall still able to sit comfortably in the rear seats. You could even sit three abreast thanks to the shallow transmission tunnel. The use of quality materials, with a grainy metal finish in the middle of the fascia, makes the cabin of the Formentor a pleasant and comfortable place to be, while bronze Cupra highlights on the air vents add a sense of occasion to every journey. The boot capacity of -litres in the Formentor . TSI can be expanded by dropping the rear seatbacks, allowing for even greater practicality when called upon.The Formentor scored a full five star rating in its Euro NCAP crash test, thanks in part to standard safety systems such as lane-keep assist, forward collision warning, predictive cruise control and driver alert warning.The new Cupra Formentor offers a more exclusive, contemporary vision of sportiness, which is instilled into an exquisitely sleek and bold design.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.     Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.         Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

When asked for a reason for his stance, Robinson said: “I wouldn’t force people to do it, it’s your choice and your body.” googletag.cmd.push Ireland manager Stephen Kenny has defended his decision to pick the striker to play in Saturdays game saying it would be extremely radical to punish players with international exclusion for refusing to be vaccinated. I think for inidual associations to just come together to decide not to select any player that hasn’t got it would create as many problems,” added Kenny. “They’re problems we don’t need to have.” Joe Duffy opened the conversation on his show Liveline today which seemed to snowball into an argument between pro and anti vaxxers, with some callers slamming Joe for bullying the  year old Robinson. Shocking stuff from @joeliveline beretating Callum Robinson for not taking a covid vaccine. The HSE clearly state the longterm effects information are limited. No one should be hounded in to taking any medication-especially a still on trial one! #liveline — Karen Luby October ,     While others felt that Robinson shouldnt be allowed to play in Saturdays game. If you are not vaccinated you shouldn’t be playing for Ireland, unless you have proper medical reasons. #liveline — Cllr Declan Meenagh ️♿ #StayHomeSaveLives October ,     Commenters on Twitter were also quick to point out that since Callum Robinson has had Covid twice, he would surely have stronger immunity towards the virus. Joe is a dummy .. imagine covering this topic and not knowing that the player is recovered from covid and has more protection now than somebody vaccinated . Luke O Neill should be interviewed on the show to shut up those who don’t follow the science of natural immunity #Liveline          — samryan October ,     The FAI has since released the following statement: The Football Association of Ireland can confirm that all players and staff are tested for COVID- before reporting for international duty with Republic of Ireland teams and are tested repeatedly in camp in line with FAI and UEFA protocols. We have encouraged all our players at all levels of the game to be vaccinated but we respect and must accept the right of all iniduals to make a personal choice on COVID- vaccination. The Association will continue to exercise the highest standards for the safety of all our stakeholders.

When asked for a reason for his stance, Robinson said: “I wouldn’t force people to do it, it’s your choice and your body.” googletag.cmd.push Ireland manager Stephen Kenny has defended his decision to pick the striker to play in Saturdays game saying it would be extremely radical to punish players with international exclusion for refusing to be vaccinated. I think for inidual associations to just come together to decide not to select any player that hasn’t got it would create as many problems,” added Kenny. “They’re problems we don’t need to have.” Joe Duffy opened the conversation on his show Liveline today which seemed to snowball into an argument between pro and anti vaxxers, with some callers slamming Joe for bullying the  year old Robinson. Shocking stuff from @joeliveline beretating Callum Robinson for not taking a covid vaccine. The HSE clearly state the longterm effects information are limited. No one should be hounded in to taking any medication-especially a still on trial one! #liveline — Karen Luby October ,     While others felt that Robinson shouldnt be allowed to play in Saturdays game. If you are not vaccinated you shouldn’t be playing for Ireland, unless you have proper medical reasons. #liveline — Cllr Declan Meenagh ️♿ #StayHomeSaveLives October ,     Commenters on Twitter were also quick to point out that since Callum Robinson has had Covid twice, he would surely have stronger immunity towards the virus. Joe is a dummy .. imagine covering this topic and not knowing that the player is recovered from covid and has more protection now than somebody vaccinated . Luke O Neill should be interviewed on the show to shut up those who don’t follow the science of natural immunity #Liveline          — samryan October ,     The FAI has since released the following statement: The Football Association of Ireland can confirm that all players and staff are tested for COVID- before reporting for international duty with Republic of Ireland teams and are tested repeatedly in camp in line with FAI and UEFA protocols. We have encouraged all our players at all levels of the game to be vaccinated but we respect and must accept the right of all iniduals to make a personal choice on COVID- vaccination. The Association will continue to exercise the highest standards for the safety of all our stakeholders. Our COVID- testing protocols for all players and staff on international duty strictly follow UEFA protocolsand are compliant with all Irish Government guidelines. The FAI reconfirms our support for all Government, UEFA and FIFA protocols during the COVID- pandemic. We thank all our stakeholders for their ongoing exemplary compliance with Government guidelines over the last  months.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.”     For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  An artists impression of the planned Clanmil Housing Association development on Victoria Street.

The news that the Dundalk man has signed a pre-contract agreement with his home town club, after  years away, has been met with great excitement by Derry City fans, with the -year-old agreeing a four-year deal at the Brandywell. googletag.cmd.push Now that excitement is being shared by McEleney, who has also agreed tohome next year, meaning he will reunite with his long-time friend and team mate in red and white. “He’s obviously an amazing player,” he said. “I’ve played with him now for six or seven seasons I think and I know what he’s capable of. It’s an amazing signing for Derry. A lot of credit has to go to Derry and to Ruaidhriand Philipfor getting it over the line. He has been the best probably in the league for two or three years running so hopefully he can continue that form.” The two Derry men have done it all at Dundalk in recent years, but McEleney admits that the two soon-to-be Derry City players have often wondered what it would be like to achieve similar success with the team they grew up with. “We have spoken about it before,” he admitted. “Down there I think we’ve won three league titles and FAI Cups and we’ve been in the Europa League and we’ve always said ‘Imagine doing it for Derry’. I think Mickey has said that it is what he wants to do. “We are Derry men and obviously supporters of the club. I used to go to the Brandywell to watch Derry and I had a season ticket for six years on the run. It won’t be weird, we’re just excited by it and really looking forward to it.”     These are exciting times for Derry City with Ruaidhri Higgins determined to bring success back to the Brandywell, and McEleney is adamant that he wants to be a part of it. “Ruaidhri was a big pull,” he added. “I’ve played long with him and he was my assistant at Dundalk and I know what he’s about. I’m just really looking forward to coming back. Mickey is one of my best mates so we speak about kit all the time and he’s the exact same. We just want to do really well and bring trophies back. We’re not coming up to put our feet up, we’re coming up to win trophies.”  ‘Better team won Meanwhile, City boss Ruaidhri Higgins has admitted that the better team won after watching his team fall to their first defeat in  league games with the - loss at Shamrock Rovers on Friday. City took an early lead through Danny Lafferty, but the champions hit back through goals from lee Grace and Danny Mandriou to claim the three points. “The best team won,” he said. “We got ourselves in front with a really good goal early on, but Rovers got a foothold in the game. We were probably a minute away from getting in at half time and regrouping but they have punished us. “Our players have been brilliant. They have had a lot of praise and pats on the back and rightly so but I think we didn’t reach the levels that we can get to. In key moments in the game we lacked a wee bit of belief and I think we showed naivety and we got punished for it. “We lost our composure and our first pass when we won the ball back let us down. We’ve had a couple of half chances Alan Mannus has made an unbelievable save from Ronan Boyce to stop us going - up, but I can’t have any complaints about the result.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  An artists impression of the planned Clanmil Housing Association development on Victoria Street.

Ciara is bidding to be part of the Northern Ireland ladies squad who have been formed to attempt to qualy for the tournament which will be played in a unique three against three format. googletag.cmd.push Four years ago the Queens Psychology graduate, who is now studying for a Counselling and Therapeutic Communication Masters at UU Jordanstown, was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. Although she admits it was shocking news to receive, she was determined to make the best of the le changing news. My condition wont improve but there is work I can do to manage it and give myself the best quality of le, she explained. The lockdown restrictions made my situation more challenging, my treatment means I am considered high riskI contracted Covid and not being able to use the gym meant I lost a lot of fitness. My strength was so low after lockdown that I couldnt even do a press-up but through the Steps to Health Programme with Derry City and Strabane District Council GP Referral Co-ordinator Colleen Brown I have made signicant progress since I have come back.  Ciara is bidding to be part of the Northern Ireland ladies squad.  She has tailored my training for the skills required to play the game such as strength exercises that will aid ball throwing.     The Steps to Health programme is an eight week course where candidates are guided through a tailored training regime to improve their overall wellbeing and fitness. Ciara is an ideal candidate for the programme, she is very enthusiastic and always wants to push herself to reach the next level, explained Colleen. In her initial consultation we discussed ways that she could improve her overall fitness and strength and improve her confidence. The programme is about being smart so that you can take the gradual, slow steps towards better health. Some clients have slower progress than others but the most important thing is that they are developing consistency and improving at a pace that is right for them. Ciara intends to continue her gym work by herself when the programme ends and she had no hesitation in recommending it to others. I worked one on one with Colleen in the first four weeks and then I was able to do some of the sessions by myself to get confident in continuing my improvement when it ends, she continued. Ive seen a signicant change in my strength and overall fitness over the weeks of the programme, I think its important to always take the positives from situations and to believe in yourself. I couldnt recommend the programme highly enough, no matter what your condition we all have a potential that we can fulfil and its about giving yourself the best possible chance to do that. I have days when I get up and I dont want to leave the house but I get into the gym and get the workout done early and I feel good for the rest of the day. There are other days when I cant get off the sofa and I dont beat myself up about that, sometimes its your bodys way of telling you that you need a rest. My friends and family have noticed a change in my overall mood over the last  weeks and it has inspired many of my friends to get more active as well. Opportunities There are  wheelchair basketball clubs in Northern Ireland that provide opportunities to play both recreationally and competitively. Ciara was keen to stress that able bodied people can also take part in the sport. I always thought the sport was exclusively for people who were wheelchair bound but anyone can get into a chair and play. Its a growing sport in Northern Ireland and a great, fast moving activity to get involved in so Id encourage anyone interest to get involved through their local club.

Ciara is bidding to be part of the Northern Ireland ladies squad who have been formed to attempt to qualy for the tournament which will be played in a unique three against three format. googletag.cmd.push Four years ago the Queens Psychology graduate, who is now studying for a Counselling and Therapeutic Communication Masters at UU Jordanstown, was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. Although she admits it was shocking news to receive, she was determined to make the best of the le changing news. My condition wont improve but there is work I can do to manage it and give myself the best quality of le, she explained. The lockdown restrictions made my situation more challenging, my treatment means I am considered high riskI contracted Covid and not being able to use the gym meant I lost a lot of fitness. My strength was so low after lockdown that I couldnt even do a press-up but through the Steps to Health Programme with Derry City and Strabane District Council GP Referral Co-ordinator Colleen Brown I have made signicant progress since I have come back.  Ciara is bidding to be part of the Northern Ireland ladies squad.  She has tailored my training for the skills required to play the game such as strength exercises that will aid ball throwing.     The Steps to Health programme is an eight week course where candidates are guided through a tailored training regime to improve their overall wellbeing and fitness. Ciara is an ideal candidate for the programme, she is very enthusiastic and always wants to push herself to reach the next level, explained Colleen. In her initial consultation we discussed ways that she could improve her overall fitness and strength and improve her confidence. The programme is about being smart so that you can take the gradual, slow steps towards better health. Some clients have slower progress than others but the most important thing is that they are developing consistency and improving at a pace that is right for them. Ciara intends to continue her gym work by herself when the programme ends and she had no hesitation in recommending it to others. I worked one on one with Colleen in the first four weeks and then I was able to do some of the sessions by myself to get confident in continuing my improvement when it ends, she continued. Ive seen a signicant change in my strength and overall fitness over the weeks of the programme, I think its important to always take the positives from situations and to believe in yourself. I couldnt recommend the programme highly enough, no matter what your condition we all have a potential that we can fulfil and its about giving yourself the best possible chance to do that. I have days when I get up and I dont want to leave the house but I get into the gym and get the workout done early and I feel good for the rest of the day. There are other days when I cant get off the sofa and I dont beat myself up about that, sometimes its your bodys way of telling you that you need a rest. My friends and family have noticed a change in my overall mood over the last  weeks and it has inspired many of my friends to get more active as well. Opportunities There are  wheelchair basketball clubs in Northern Ireland that provide opportunities to play both recreationally and competitively. Ciara was keen to stress that able bodied people can also take part in the sport. I always thought the sport was exclusively for people who were wheelchair bound but anyone can get into a chair and play. Its a growing sport in Northern Ireland and a great, fast moving activity to get involved in so Id encourage anyone interest to get involved through their local club.

He is currently renovating a studio on his family land in Donegal, Ireland. He exhibits nationally and internationally, showing at the Dublin Castle, The London Art Fair and the Saatchi Gallery with Cynthia Corbett and the Young Masters Art Prize, the Victoria, and Albert Museum “What is Luxury” with Unknown Fields Division and Toby Smith. Other shows include “GLOBALE: Infosphere” ZKM Museum, Karlsruhe, Germany and Van Abbe-museum, Eindhoven. He was selected to represent Ireland in The Ceramic Context Biennale in Bornholm Art Museum in  He collaborated with Dublin architect Peter Carroll from A architects at The European Culture Centre in Venice May-Nov , participated in the Landmark series with Sky Arts representing Scotland, commissioned by Sky Arts to produce a piece of sculpture in  days. He also has a solo show in Dec-Jan at Stallan-Brand Gallery in Glasgow  Kevin completed a residency at The Irish Culture Centre in Paris in August . Are We Here , a site-based, .-meter-tall sculpture by Kevin Callaghan commissioned by Sky Arts on the occasion of the new series Landmark, explores the notion of utopia and our proximity to it      With an ongoing interest in geometry and the potential for multiple realities, Callaghan invites viewers into a future-minded meditation on hope and potentiality via Are We Here. “Are we here ” It’s a question that suggests we are on a journey, and, in addition to hunger for our destination, conjures hope—hope for real freedom and space to realize our multitude of potentialities. If “here” is not yet utopia, it is at least a space where we might imagine, hope for, and build our future. What local music are you into  “Jonny Delaney, Ryan Vail, Orla, And I got a listen To Kwa Daniels’ new radio show on my way to Belfast airport flying back to Glasgow” Inna Rhythm Apart from the obvious, how have you spent lockdown  “When lockdown started my plans to be in Paris on a residency had clearly changed so I began to work extensively on my brand Condie, so that kept me busy for the first lockdown, The second lockdown was crazy busy, after sky arts asked me to apply for the series Landmark, I was one of  in the UK and Ireland commissioned by them, I set about designing the piece Are We Here with my designer. The built-up to the making of the piece in April was intense, then the piece was made in  days from start to finish with the help of the fabricators Sculpture and Design in Glasgow. there was a slower period in May and June then I was finally off to Paris in July”. What groups or services have helped you  “I have had dferent support over the years, the arts council of Ireland, Business to Arts in Dublin, The Crafts Council of Ireland, The National Sculpture Factory in Cork, Donegal Council, and enterprise board to name a few. Its away a nice feeling to support locally”. How do you feel things will change for musicians in the coming year  “It’s been a really tough time for musicians the last  months. I think it’s still going to be a bit slow for artists to get their regular gigs coming back, but I would hope there will be some great new material coming out, from the complex time you all have just had. And I hope that the younger generation of musicians continue to make and put music out and dont get disheartened by the pandemic”. What are your long-term plans  “My long-term plans are to continue making work for exhibitions and larger commission work. I have been doing it since my time studying in Derry  and I dont intend to stop any time soon. I still like to do a residency somewhere every year, I really want to do one again in China, however, le is pretty busy. I am currently renovating a sheep shed in Barnesmore, Donegal in a new studio on the family land and we plan to develop a Bothy style Glamping site on the land in the near future”.

That being said, it is no wonder that our rural communities may feel isolated from our bigger towns and cities, where investment and opportunities are more obvious.Rural isolation is closer to all of us than we realise exploring this topic brought to light my own childhood memories of growing up in the countryside.While I loved my upbringing, I hadnrsquot considered how it was impacted by the fact that I grew up in a rural area. It was through exploring the topic of rural isolation that I realised the social effects it can have on our youth.My own children are growing up in the countryside as well and I can now see how this may impact them socially they are not playing with friends in the evenings like many would in housing developments and built up areas.They are playing with each other in their own garden, similar to my own experience. While I donrsquot think this is a negative thing for my children, due to the volume of social groups and clubs that they participate in, I am now consciously taking opportunities to expose them to a wider iety of social situations, so they do not feel the potential effects of rural isolation.It is clear to see the effects of rural isolation when just recently at a meeting with Translink, the cutting of rural bus routes and services was brought to light. This is another slap in the face to those living in rural areas without access to their own vehicle, especially when considering the climate crisis.I and my fellow councillors and party colleagues are encouraging constituents to use active travel and public transport.Meanwhile, those exact services are being cut removing the option for active travel. This is not good enough.I have conducted a range of investigative meetings to see how groups and organisations within South Down in particular are taking action to prevent rural isolation.I recently met with Nicholas McCrickard, manager of Co Down Rural Community Network, an organisation crucial in combatting rural isolation in South Down as itrsquos an umbrella body set up and managed by community groups in the area for more than  years.The aim of the organisation is to create an inclusive future where all citizens actively participate in local le which stimulates a vibrant society.Nicholas and his team, with the support of community groups, ensure regular outreach to all of the citizens in the area so that they can enhance their own lives through participation with ious organisations. This stimulation is a sure-fire way to combat rural isolation, but the resources need to be available to ensure no one is left behind.I recently visited the offices of Good Morning Down in Downpatrick mdash another vital service many in our community rely on. It is an organisation which regularly makes telephone calls to those facing isolation for a iety of reasons. These calls are a method of friendship building between volunteers and residents of a wide iety of ages.The youngest volunteer in Good Morning Down is in their late s, while the eldest is in their late s. Nearly  years worth of knowledge and experience will be exchanged through these conversations and I walked away from this meeting, feeling truly touched by the dedication of the staff and volunteers.In addition, having met with Womenrsquos Aid in recent days, fresh in my mind are the stories of the impact that living in a rural setting has on many women who are isolated from much of society.Not having that friendly neighbour close by can impact the severity of abusive relationships. Thankfully, we have organisations such as Womenrsquos Aid who recognise this and work every day with women in these situations, but funding, resourcing and legislation is always an issue.These are only a few of the fantastic initiatives that offer support to those in rural communities, however, there are many who are unaware of their operation.I would like to raise awareness of the services available to our rural constituents, to promote inclusivity and encourage a positive approach to mental health and wellbeing. It is extremely important to raise awareness and encourage our rural communities to stop and think about their mental health and to consider how rural isolation may affect them.I would encourage our rural communities to take time out to improve their mental health, normalise discussion around issues of isolation and avail of local mental health services.It is time that Newry, Mourne and Down Council took responsibility and recognise the vital work local groups within our community do for the residents of our district and remember that ratepayers donrsquot just live in our major towns like Downpatrick, but also in rural areas such as the wider Lecale countryside.There needs to be a serious refocusing on service provision in rural areas and a renewed approach to capital investment. We need to stand up for the safety of our rural communities, and protect them from the effects of isolation. Rural communities cannot continue to be left behind..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29September2021-Horse.jpg","title":"Horse show fundraiser for Uganda  ","story":"THE organisers of Saintfield Horse Show handed over a cheque for pound, at a reception at Temple Golf and Country Club last Thursday evening.The money was raised at the show which was held at Danescroft Equestrian Centre, near Lisburn, on Saturday, August .Last year money raised from the horse show and the Saintfield Christmas Charity Ride provided a borehole for a village in Uganda, giving the community fresh, clean water.Show director Joan Cunningham said: ldquoNow wersquore committed to continue making a massive dference by providing a maize milling machine which will enable the farmers to process their crops for food.

champions Kilcoo managed to successfully overcome neighbours Clonduff and progress to the quarter-finals.Mickey Moranrsquos men will concede they were off the pace at Paacuteirc Esler, but with a number of regular starters set toin time for the next round, the Magpies will surely be a dreaded draw for anyone in the competition.Meanwhile, Aidan Robinsonrsquos Downpatrick dark horses made it two wins from two after defeating Longstone by eight points on Saturday.Downpatrick have made a resounding impact in this yearrsquos Senior Championship thus far after dispatching last yearrsquos runners-up Carryduff in their opener, before following that up with their latest scalp at the weekend.Longstone were entering the tie on a high after defeating Warrenpoint in the first round, who many had claimed would push Kilcoo all the way.Both of Downpatrickrsquos previous opponents, Carryduff and Longstone, will now meet in the third round of the competition where one will progress to the quarters and the other will see their championship title hopes shattered.Carryduff managed to bounce back from their opening round loss with a good win against newly promoted Saul.Last yearrsquos intermediate football champions could be excused for their back-to-back defeats in this seasonrsquos top flight campaign after they were drawn the vastly experienced Burren followed by the Carryduff side.However, Saul now enter the relegation battle and face the possibility of ing to the intermediate ranks that they fought so valiantly to climb out of last year.Joining them in the fight for survival will be Loughinisland who, similarly to their opening round, could not maintain their lead for the full duration of the match as they lost to Mayobridge.The Bridge now face Bredagh in their third round tie, after the Belfast side defeated Castlewellan in their opener but failed to beat Ballyholland to progress to the quarters.Castlewellan will be relieved that their one point victory over Rostrevor at the weekend kept their Championship dreams alive, but they will face stf opposition against Glenn in the qualying round.Also in the depths of relegation are Bryansford, who lost out to Glenn in their opener before they were defeated by Warrenpoint in the second round.In the intermediate action, Liatroim made it two consecutive wins to progress to the quarters after they defeated Darragh Cross by five points.The Cross will now meet Newry Shamrocks via the back door route with nothing other than a win requiredthey are to keep their promotion to the Senior Championship alive.Whereas it was a bitter pill to swallow for Dromara, Bright and St Johnrsquos who all tasted defeat for the second game in a row and now face the dreaded relegation battle.Despite Dromara losing to Saval in their second round, they will feel more disappointed at their opening performance where they should have secured the win over Clann na Banna after leading for long durations of the contest.Simarly, Bright will also be kicking themselves after they blew a nine point lead in their opener against Tullylish before they lost out to St Paulrsquos.St Johnrsquos also had their promotion hopes dashed in heartbreaking fashion after they lost their must-win game against Newry Shamrocks by just one point.In the Junior Championship, Kilclief ensured Teconnaught would remain in the competition for another year after a three point win progressed the red and green side to the next round.Teconnaught lost out to Aughlisnafin in their opener whilst this was Kilcliefrsquos first taste of championship action after they received a bye in the first round.Elsewhere, Ardglass bounced back from their opening round lost to Dundrum with a fantastic win over Aghaderg.All of the

described as an ldquounfortunate increase in bigotry and said it is beyond him why ldquosomeone would be so stupid.The graffiti was daubed on a section of the Moneycarragh bridge mdash also known locally as Bennettrsquos bridge mdash with Cllr Lewis saying what happened was ldquoidiotic and void of reason and that defacing the historic bridge demonstrated ldquoovert sectarianism.Cllr Lewis said while police may not be able to identy those responsible, he was told that neighbours can.ldquoThe aspiring republican artists should be thoroughly embarrassed by their actions and I only hope that their parents are reading this article, he declared.ldquoThis part of rural South Down suffered heavily as a direct result of IRA terrorism.

Now is the time to step up and support them by making it local. I would strongly encourage people from within the district to avail of the voucher and shop locally.Downpatrick businessman Darren Kearney, who is the owner of Oakley Fayre, said the business is pleased to be open to near full capacity again, which has only been made possible with the support of staff and loyal customers.ldquoThis has been a dficult time for many industries and the hospitality industry has been hit very hard, so we welcome any incentive or investment scheme that will help bring people onto their local high street, he said.Mr Kearney added: ldquoSupporting local gives back to the small, family-run businesses that are the foundation of the Northern Ireland economy.Stormont Economy Minister Gordon Lyons is encouraging local businesses to support the initiative.He said the ldquounprecedented scheme, which closes on November , is designed to boost businesses across the retail, hospitality and service sectors following the impact of the Covid- pandemic.He is urging all businesses to show their support to help maximise the benefits of the Spend Local cards and to use them wisely, supporting the local economy and communities as a ldquolittle spend can have a big effect.Retail NI chief executive Glyn Roberts said the scheme comes on the back of a very challenging period for retailers right across Northern Ireland.ldquoThe High Street Support Scheme is a welcome step in the long road to recovery for Northern Irelandrsquos retailers and I would encourage everyone in our industry to think hard about how they can encourage people to use their pound spend local card with their business, he said.ldquoIt should be remembered that p in every pound spent in an independent retailer is recycled around the local economy.

This would help ensure that the centre of Strangford does not become a car park which happens regularly.Cllr Enright thanked residents for their support on the traffic issue in Strangford and confirmed that the Stormont department has accepted the traffic tailbacks causes problems and that the issue needs to be addressed.He said officials have allocated a small budget to employ additional staff to ensure that the dedicated ferry queuing area is utilised at peak periods to reduce congestion in the centre of the village.Cllr Boyle agrees that a permanent solution is required to address the queuing issue in Strangford.He continued: ldquoWe must promote tourism to its fullest potential on both sides of Strangford Lough. That means that we need structures in place that maintain a steady flow of traffic through both Strangford and Portaferry.ldquoWe simply cannot continue with Strangford village regularly coming to a standstill, with residents being seriously affected, creating a negative rather than positive impact on local businesses and le in general due to ferry traffic.Cllr Boyle said Strangford and Portaferry had much to gain from tourism, provided there were proper structures in place to deal with vehicles wishing to board vessels on either side of the lough.He said he has discussed the problem with Cllr Enright and they believe there is a simple, cost-effective solution to addressing the problem.Cllr Boyle said it is important that visitors and tourists have a positive, not negative experience of both villages, confirming that both politicians plan to progress the issue with senior Department for Infrastructure officials.He said they also hope to contact with Stormont Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Wheelchair beach access plan  ","story":"THE possibility of trialling floating wheelchairs at beaches across the district is being considered by Newry, Mourne and Down Council.The move comes after the local authority was asked to address the lack of access to beaches for those with mobility problems and officers asked to look at potential solutions.A number of politicians say they recognise the need to do more to ensure beaches can be accessed by a wide range of people by providing floating wheelchairs and special matting to allow them to travel over sand to make it to the water.The issue was discussed at last weekrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee with officers agreeing to bring back a report for discussion next month.Initially, officials will examine access to Newcastle beach before focusing on others across the district.Local councillors Patrick Brown and Alan Lewis are spearheading the drive to provide improved beach access, especially as there a number of local facilities which have been awarded prestigious blue flag status which recognises their quality.In a report presented to members of the council committee last week, officers said they were currently investigating several options and a further report will be tabled in October.She also issued a reminder of ongoing consultation on so-called changing places provision which is designed to meet the needs of people with a range of mobility issues.Cllr Harte said not everyone in a wheelchair was mobile and would need a hoist. Therefore there wouldnrsquot be much point providing floating wheelchairsthe council did not have the facilities for these people to get into or access these wheelchairs.Independent councillor Jarlath Tinnelly said that the beach access issue had been raised with him throughout the summer and he called for other beaches to be included in the pilot.He said his only concern with the motion would be thata pilot project was being proposed, the councilrsquos blue flag beaches at Tyrella and Cranfield should be considered.ldquoThe experience of wheelchair users to get on to the beach and enjoy that same thrill is a priority and we should be doing whatever we can to facilitate that, he said.ldquoThese floating wheelchairs can be taken into the water and allow people to enjoy the same experiences as everybody , things that are taken for granted.The motion to improve beach access was initially tabled in August and was inspired by the campaigning work of local activist, Naomi Herron, who approached all her local councillors askingsomething could be done to give her better access to the beach.At the time, Cllr Brown said he understood that while a small scale trial of the idea has operated in Cranfield in the past, it was important that this was expanded out into other parts of the district and that he could ldquothink of no better place than Newcastle given the large number of visitors it gets every year.He continued: ldquoAs a council, it is important that we ensure all facilities are open and accessible to all residents. It is right that we look at the issue of beach access, with a view to providing provisions for wheelchair-bound residents and visitors who wish to also enjoy our wonderful coastline.ldquo I donrsquot want this issue to go around in circles with reports, meetings and investigations. It is my hope that from this motion we see action, movement toward making the necessary access points needed to facilitate this initiative. Disabled beach access is a reality in other towns within these islands why not Newcastle.Cllr Lewis said work was needed to ensure the entire district is disabled access friendly, from changing to toilet facilities.He added: ldquoIncreased footfall to Newcastle during the good weather has brought many of these issues to the fore.

Please try again later.Submitting...The DUP’s firm position of recent days contrasts with a turbulent period earlier this year, in which it talked tough on the Irish Sea border but seemed to do little about it beyond adopting supposedly strong, but confusing, positions against implementing the internal UK frontier and north-south work.Now it has, belatedly but rightly, taken a real stand against north-south continuing as normal while east-west is trashed.Unfortunately though, we are still grappling with the legacy of two badly flawed DUP decisions.The first was agreeing to an Irish language act, albeit concealed by its description as cultural protection, and so rewarding Sinn Fein blackmail of collapsing Stormont for three years. Stormont crises should never again be met with negotiation. Such negotiations lead to a slight gain for republican demands which, over time, accumulate to become large.You can bet that republican strategists are thinking of the next demands that they can use to topple Stormont.Asthe New Decade New Approach deal was not bad enough, SF threatened not to nominate a deputy first minister when the DUP changed leader. Edwin Poots and Brandon Lewis came up with a scheme to get republicans their cherished Irish language dream of a commissioner, who will be used to impose Irish in Northern Ireland, including in places where it is not wanted.The idea of legislating via Westminster to placate the SF nomination threat has, as Jim Allister says, left a “disastrous legacy” and set an appalling precedent.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Photo: PacemakerThe proposed bill includes the creation of Irish and Ulster Scots commissioners, and the establishment of an Office for Identity and Cultural Expression.Jim Allister described the agreement reached between the DUP and Sinn Fein in June as “the disastrous legacy of the DUP’s year of chaos”.He said: “There should be no question of unionists accepting such a state of affairs. No unionist should be legislating for Irish language promotion. No unionist should be in office on the basis of a deal which, on a nod and a wink, sees London pass such legislation.”Mr Allister added: “Official recognition of the status of Irish will be enforced through an Irish Language Commissioner with statutory powers to ‘promote and facilitate’ the use of Irish throughout the public sector.“This zealot will set standards that every public body must meet in the use of Irish in the delivery of its services. Such will bring obvious recruitment advantage to Irish speakers across the public service.“If public bodies are required to promote and deliver their services in Irish, then, clearly staff fluent in the language will be required and preferred.”“There is no conceivable basis on which to warrant further endless squander on Irish for the sake of paying the Sinn Fein ransom to get a failed Stormont back”.The NIO had declined to comment at time of going to press.

There has also been over , new cases in the last two weeks.Previous mathmatical modelling led by Professor Neil Ferguson, a member of the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergenciesfrom Imperial College London, has been highly influential in shaping the UK’s response to the pandemic - with this Queen’s research set to do the same. The study also estimates that it takes an average of . days for an exposed person to develop symptoms and become infectious to others, meaning that a symptomatic patient could spread the disease for nine days.Dr Gabor Kiss explains: “The modelling suggests that the outbreak could have entered the country undetected as it took some time for people to become infectious and develop symptoms.”“This research provides in depth data on how exactly COVID- spread in Northern Ireland and this will help to develop public health-driven strategies, not just in NI, but across the globe.”Dr Kiss added: “It lays the foundation for a decision-making support tool which could assess the state of an outbreak and help to advise on optimal interventions in the early phases of any re-emerging high consequence infectious diseases which are vaccine-preventable.”The experts also looked in detail at the first lockdown and found that the number of infectious people decreased rapdily after coronavirus restrictions were introduced by Government, such as social distancing and wearing masks. The expert team at Queen’s is now working on incorporating other aspects of the outbreak into their models, such as the geographical journey of the disease in Northern Ireland. This will give further information on the impact of localised lockdowns throughout the pandemic.The research was published in the Open Journal of Modelling and Simulation, find it here https:www.scirp.org journal paperinformation.aspx paperid"},{"url":"http://www.penarthtimes.co.uk/news/resources/images/13075958.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

There can also be pus and some may have the condition for weeks or even months.What are chilblains and how does this dfer from Covid toes Chilblains are small, itchy, red patches that can appear after you have been in the cold.Chilblains usually appear a few hours after you have been in the cold and you mostly get them on your fingers and toes, but can also get them on your face and legs.They usually clear up on their own in two to three weeks, but you may need to see a GPthey do not go away.What causes Covid toes A new study - published in the British Journal of Dermatology - has found that Covid toes could be a side effect of the immune systemrsquos response to coronavirusResearchers behind the study examined  participants with Covid toes and  with similar chilblains lesions that arose before the pandemic.The study found that one mechanism behind both types of the condition involved the body generating an immune response with high levels of certain autoantibodies, which mistakenly target and react with a personrsquos own cells and tissues as well as the invading virus.     Researchers also found an overlap with type I interferon, which is a key protein in the antiviral response.Cells lining blood vessels which supply the affected areas also appeared to play a critical role in the development of Covid toes and chilblains.Senior author of the study, Dr Charles Cassius, said the research provided a deeper understanding of the condition.He said: ldquoThe epidemiology and clinical features of chilblain-like lesions have been extensively studied and published, however, little is known about the pathophysiology involved.ldquoOur study provides new insights. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"Comments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.

SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said: “Adam has proven himself as an outstanding local representative since being elected to Fermanagh and Omagh District Council. He’s shown real passion to improve the lives of people in his local community and across the council area. “As a science teacher he understands the reform that’s needed in our education system. He also recognises the dire need for immediate action to tackle the climate crisis to safeguard this place for future generations. “Adam is part of an ambitious SDLP team in Fermanagh and South Tyrone delivering for local people. People want to see action to address waiting lists for housing and healthcare, but they won’t get it from the status quo. We need people to choose change and vote for candidates like Adam Gannon to build a better future for everyone across the North. Mr Gannon said: “It has been a real honour to represent my local community as a councillor over the past few years and I’m delighted to have been endorsed by the SDLP as our candidate for Fermanagh and South Tyrone in the Assembly election. Since being elected I have worked to help people on a wide range of issues, both big and small, and would love the opportunity to bring the voice of local people into the Assembly chamber. “I’ve lived in this area all my le and am proud to call it home. Unfortunately, local people have been badly let down by their politicians in recent years. We have seen businesses close, the decimation of our town centres and the abandonment of our rural communities. We deserve so much better than this. “The SDLP has a strategy to transform the North and I want to be part of it. The politics of ision may suit the DUP and Sinn Feacutein but it has delivered nothing for people here. We need real action to ensure that everyone can get the medical treatment they need without having to wait years for it, that everyone has a home that meets their needs, a radical overhaul of our crumbling education system and a real commitment to tackling the climate crisis. We can’t afford to do nothing, people have had enough and it’s time for change.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_eeeeabbbeecafe   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_efbfedbcebddca   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
