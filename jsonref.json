It also includes people who the service has been able to contact but who refused to hand over details of their contacts. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that people had a \u0027civic duty\u0027 to work with the NHS Test and Trace system, describing it as the \u0027radar\u0027 for tracking coronavirus.At the Downing Street press conference on Thursday he said the system would continue to improve and he was \u0027confident it will be world class\u0027.Mr Hancock said: \u0027Testing for the virus and tracing how it spreads is critical for containing it locally, so that we can ease the national lockdown.\u0027It\u0027s by isolating the virus that we can control it and we can stop it spreading through our communities.\u0027In this plan to lift lockdown, test and trace is our radar, if you like, it helps us identify where the virus is and trace how it is spreading through the community.\u0027 Contact tracers try 10 times to reach someone in the first 24 hours after they have been referred to the service, attempting to get through to them by email, phone and text. Of those people who were reached and asked to provide information about their contacts, just over three-quarters (79 per cent) were contacted within 24 hours of their case being transferred to the Test and Trace system. Some 14 per cent were contacted between 24 and 48 hours, three per cent between 48 and 72 hours, and four per cent were contacted after 72 hours. Finding people fast is vital for the system to work because the plan is for it to find potentially-infected people before they start to show symptoms and pass the virus on to other people.Jonathan Ashworth, Labour\u0027s Shadow Health Secretary, said: \u0027Tracing is vital to the safe easing of lockdown. \u0027Though this is early data, Matt Hancock needs to explain why a third of people don’t appear to have been contacted and what action they will take to rectify this.\u0027Professor Keith Neal, an epidemiologist at the University of Nottingham, said: \u0027Being unable to contact 33 per cent of diagnosed cases is a concern particularly as a mobile number is involved in requesting the test. \u0027Some of these are part of other investigations including those related to care facilities – this data should be obtainable and identifiable. Nearly 80 per cent of those reached were contacted in a timely manner.\u0027An absolutely crucial part of the test and trace system is the public committing to it – the system can not work without the public’s involvement.\u0027Baroness Harding — who was chief executive of TalkTalk when it was rocked by a huge cyber attack in 2015 — admitted the system was not yet where she wanted it to be. She said: \u0027We are not at the gold standard yet that we want to be, of isolating all contacts within 48 hours of someone requesting a test. But you can absolutely see the path of how we are going to get there.\u0027News, sport and opinion from the Guardian\u0027s UK edition | The Guardian"},{"url":null,"title":"Grumpy looking blue tit scowling peers bird box Lincolnshire","story":"Share this article While blue tits typically come in many colours, this specimen seems to be mostly yellow with distinctive brown shading around the eyes.The birds are known to join up in large flocks during winter to search for food, though they are seen all year round. A garden that has four or five blue tits at a feeder could be feeding more than 20 of the birds, according to the RSPB.  They mainly eat insects, caterpillars, seeds and nuts.A blue tit weighs around 11g with a wing of just 18cm.   "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90fd539c026ea7a33d9c768cbf3a8546d340a62a/0_1417_7086_4252/master/7086.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c522aed9e502e4d34460bc5d956bd96e","title":"the big picture a beach of her own lagos 2006","story":"In a city of nearly 20 million people, Akinbode Akinbiyi captures a moment of calmness amid the frenzyAkinbode Akinbiyi has lived and taken photographs in many cities. He was born in Oxford in 1946, went to university in Ibadan, Nigeria, is based in Berlin and has spent long periods in Khartoum, Bamako, Cairo and Dakar. He has suggested that the cities choose him: “They call out my name, and if I am fully awake, I hear the call and gradually wend my way toward them.”\u0026nbspHe took this picture at Bar Beach on Victoria Island in Lagos in 2006. The woman in her white Sunday robes stands in curious relation to the three deck chairs. In other pictures in an ongoing series from the beach – Sea Never Dry – white tourists sit in similar chairs watching the procession of workers and schoolchildren pass by on the sand. Here the chairs are empty, and the woman expresses a quiet gesture of expectation or supplication, almost lost against the pale greys of sea and sky. The picture sets the tone of a retrospective of Akinbiyi’s work in Berlin entitled Six Songs, Swirling Gracefully in the Taut Air. Lagos is a city of nearly 20 million people, yet in among the frenzy of street scenes, Akinbiyi’s camera invariably locates little moments of stillness, like cool alleyways of time.\u0026nbspAkinbiyi studied literature before he became a photographer and his model has always been Langston Hughes, the great poet of the Harlem renaissance. In particular he has been drawn to Hughes’s philosophy, encapsulated in the title of his autobiography, I Wonder As I Wander. Like Hughes, Akinbiyi is a walking artist, part of the scene he describes, waiting for images to make sense around him. When he was interviewed about his Berlin show, and asked about his photographic technique, he preferred to talk of conscious breathing, of finding the mental space in the midst of frantic urban busyness to see what might actually be going on.\u0026nbspAkinbode Akinbiyi: Six Songs, Swirling Gracefully in the Taut Air is at Gropius Bau, Berlin, until 19 July"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46ee1252232101b3ad892d05ac8432ac19fcd71b/0_0_2399_1440/master/2399.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79b7797d29ee03a402acf5f76ef3d044","title":"the uks government coronavirus strategy shoddy by design","story":"Are the haphazard, confusing and ‘strikingly ugly’ visuals of the government’s Covid-19 messaging a cunning attempt to connect with ‘real’ people or just one more measure of its incompetence?“It looks like a brochure for a very bad wellness clinic,” says Simon Esterson, designer and co-owner of the graphics magazine Eye. He’s describing the announcements made by the chancellor on social media, in the middle of the gravest economic and health crisis of most people’s lifetimes, to impart matters of vital importance to the public. CORONAVIRUS JOB RETENTION SCHEME EXTENDED, says one, all caps, sandwiched between the words WE STAND TOGETHER. Underneath, like a celebrity endorsement, is Rishi Sunak’s signature.\u0026nbspAnother, announcing the Treasury’s bounce-back loan scheme, randomly extends a horizontal off one “B” and the vertical off another such that they randomly cross over each other. “It looks to me more likely done by someone who’s got a degree in economics than design,” says Esterson. “It can only have been done by someone who’s in a graphic timewarp, unless it’s a very sophisticated parody.”\u0026nbspThe colours, font and layout of the different announcements vary wildly, and are at odds with the usual sober graphics of government departments. They are part of a more general haphazardness in the government’s visual imagery, such as the “stay homestay alert” virus messages (designed by the MullenLowe marketing agency), which Eliza Williams, of Creative Review, calls “strikingly ugly” and “very confusing”.\u0026nbspOr the five-level “alert system”, which was rapidly compared to Nando’s “peri-ometer”, for measuring the spiciness of chicken.\u0026nbspA 3D example is Boris Johnson’s delivery of a crucial speech from behind a back-to-front desk wedged into a Downing Street doorframe. Sometimes there’s the pomp of symmetrical union flags and oak doors sometimes the ad hoc informality of Dominic Cummings sitting behind a cheap-looking table in Number 10’s rose garden while sitting on an incongruous maroon and gold chair. As was pointed out on Twitter, he looked like he was selling raffle tickets at a village fete. Johnson, in his doorway, looked like he was welcoming visitors to a stately home.\u0026nbspWhich, very possibly, is the point. If this government likes to define itself as the opposite of the metropolitan centrism of Tony Blair, then it follows that it rejects New Labour’s embrace of contemporary design. If Blair got Terence Conran to furnish the setting for an international conference (“I’ve seen the fuchsia and it works”, wrote the witty  columnist Boris Johnson), then it’s unsurprising that the current government looks as if it has bought its furniture from a Cotswolds charity shop. Uncool Britannia, you could call it.The guffaws of experts, in this reading, are what the government wants. “Who cares,” as Cummings said in a slightly different context, “about good looks?” Such disdain for consistency and elegance would be of a piece with Cummings’s famous trackie and beanie fashion sense. It would also follow on from the Conservatives’ “get Brexit done” election campaign, in which the party drew contempt for its use of the much-derided Comic Sans typeface and for its appropriation of club culture.\u0026nbspThe negative reaction was intended: not only did it get their messages retweeted, but it also portrayed the Tories – as Creative Review put it – as “‘real’ people, just as terrible at graphic design as the next normal person and in no way part of the London creative elite”. The campaign was credited to the creative agency Topham Guerin, which had previously helped Scott Morrison win re-election as prime minister of Australia with what it called “boomer memes”. These, as an anonymous insider put it, were “really basic and deliberately lame”.Esterson is himself at pains to stress the relative unimportance of design at this moment. “It’s much more useful to be a shelf-stacker in a supermarket than a graphic designer,” he says. But looks still matter to this extent: if it’s essential to deliver clear messages about the pandemic, then the clarity of their visual presentation is also important. Esterson argues that the overuse of capitals makes it harder to take in information. Williams says that the “stay alert” signs’ use of green – a colour denoting “go” – obscures the order to stay (mostly) still.\u0026nbspThe Sunak messages, she says, “lack seriousness”. She compares the current use of visuals unfavourably both to the memorable public information posters of the second world war and to the New Zealand government’s “well thought-out” campaign in the current crisis. This uses simple and ordered visuals, together with popular icons such as the Eden Park rugby ground, both to deliver information and promote a sense of national togetherness.\u0026nbsp“If they think it’s what the person in the street wants it’s a failure,” says Esterson of the British government’s efforts. “The person in the street is being patronised.” He does, however, note that the “stay alert” posters have at least achieved at least one kind of success. Like the “Keep Calm and Carry On” poster (which was conceived during the war but not widely used at the time), it lends itself to endless parody. They lodge in the brain, even if their messages don’t.\u0026nbspAs often with this government, it’s unclear whether we’re dealing with bumbling fools or tactical masterminds. Perhaps the Sunak signature is a brilliant way to connect with the general public. Perhaps it is simply a symptom of rivalry between numbers 11 and 10 Downing Street, with the chancellor wanting to imitate Donald Trump’s signing of US coronavirus relief cheques before Johnson got the idea for himself. A Treasury spokesman was unable to tell me who designed Sunak’s announcements nor was he aware of any Whitehall masterplan to impose consistently inconsistent graphics on the nation.\u0026nbspThe most likely explanation, given what else we know about the handling of the pandemic, is offered by Williams: “If the design looks a bit shoddy, you think what’s going on is a bit shoddy.” In which case, whoever is behind the government’s visual imagery, they speak more truth than they realise."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e30dad83beabdf98dd82088b3808826d0ef79e03/184_136_2218_2767/master/2218.jpg?width=465\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=f047d6ce2d3b45a4b76efe372af1df61 930w","title":"britain can no longer ignore its darkest chapters we must teach black history","story":"As they take to the streets and tear down statues, younger generations who have educated themselves are exposing how whitewashed the national curriculum isWhat was invisible yesterday is today suddenly clear and obvious. In the space of just two weeks, forms of structural racism that black people and their allies had, for years, struggled to draw attention to or even get acknowledged have become seemingly irrefutable. If the toppling of the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol was the most unexpected and astonishing event of recent days, perhaps second has been the sheer scale of the online discussions about racism and black history that have begun to take shape across the world.\u0026nbspBooks on both of those subjects have by now largely sold out online. Today printing presses across the country are whirring away, busily printing new copies of books on black topics written by black authors. This great surge in interest and engagement has, like much else in our culture, been boosted by the power of celebrity. Actors and singers\u0026nbsphave shared lists of the books they are reading as they grapple with the ideas and chapters of the past that have been brought to the surface by the global Black Lives Matter protests. British Vogue, perhaps in part because its editor-in-chief Edward Enninful is of African heritage, issued its own list of recommended books. Given the fashion industry’s recent record on race (remember Gucci’s “blackface” turtleneck sweater and Prada’s “minstrel” figurines) this feels like a particularly significant intervention. Meanwhile, lockdown and social distancing means that more people have more time than ever to read and expand their understanding of an issue they might previously have cared about but never found the time to properly investigate or engage with.The pandemic has demonstrated that social problems, such as street homelessness, which, only yesterday, were (conveniently) regarded as intractable can be addressed if the will is there. And this great wave of demonstrations has achieved something comparable when it comes to race and racism. It has created, or perhaps uncovered, a previously unknown willingness on the part of millions to at least try to better understand the issues and engage in a process of self-education.Organisations as well as iniduals are undergoing this transition. Institutions that had dismissed notions of structural racism or rejected forms of black protest suddenly recognise them as legitimate. Since 2016, the US National Football League had refused to allow black players to protest against police brutality and endemic racism in the US by taking a knee. A simple, peaceful act of protest and solidarity. Then, at the end of last week, the league reversed its policy. The reason given for this by NFL commissioner Roger Goodell is as significant as the decision itself. “We were wrong” he admitted, “for not listening to NFL players earlier”.\u0026nbspAt the heart of this astonishing moment is a newfound capacity of both iniduals and institutions to engage in these two key activities: listening and learning. Both are on the minds of the mainly young Black Lives Matter protesters who are taking to the streets here in the UK. While more people than ever are willing to listen to their message, we in Britain will have a harder time when it comes to the learning part. This is because we start from such a low base as our education system has, for decades, rejected pleas and requests made by two generations of black British people for black history to be made a core part of the national curriculum. As a result it is a national blind spot, a gap in our collective knowledge that affects us all – black and white.I went to school in the 70s and the 80s, and the last thing I expected of my schools back then was that they would be the places in which I would be taught about black history. In my school, racism was ubiquitous and unrelenting, and not just from the pupils. For a year I was terrorised by one of my teachers. A man who drank his tea from a mug emblazoned with one of the National Front’s slogans. A man who, one night on a camping trip, beat and punched me, when no one was looking, leaving me too fearful to tell anyone, even my mother, for months. A teacher who entertained my classmates by calling me “wog” in the playground. The idea that this environment was one in which I might be gifted with knowledge of a history that would make sense of my identity as a black British person was, under the circumstances, preposterous. My expectations of my school were as low as they could be. Appropriate, given that my teachers, with one blessed exception, had dismally low expectations of me and presumed I would get nowhere in life.Since I began presenting programmes about black history my life has become a constant impromptu focus group.\u0026nbspI am stopped in the street by people who want to talk about the histories those documentaries explore. Most of those people are young, and a great many, but not all, are black or mixed race. This is the generation who have led the Black Lives Matter protests and they, quite rightly, expect more from their schools than I did from mine.\u0026nbspThey are frustrated at the absence of lessons on black history and, critically, they have sources of information that my generation did not. As well as the internet they have books by writers such as Akala, Afua Hirsch and Reni Eddo-Lodge. They read and research, and then compare and contrast what they learn with what they are offered by the national curriculum. Consequently, they are acutely aware of what they are not being taught, what is being missed out. In my experience this is a generation with a low tolerance for half-truths and half-stories. What they tell me is that they know they are being taught a whitewashed, sanitised version of the British past. One in which their stories, those that make sense of who they are and how they and their families came to be here and how they came to be British, have been largely omitted.\u0026nbspThe lucky ones have teachers who, like the many I have met, either face to face or online, go out of their way to change the paradigm and better serve the children in their care. Such teachers do the best they can to teach the black history modules that now do exist within the national curriculum. But the problem is that these modules are optional rather than compulsory, meaning teachers have to find the time to teach them with limited resources and in a packed timetable. Some teachers dedicated to this cause have created their own teaching resources and bought text books with their own money. They come together online to offer support to one another and to ask for help from black British historians. But there aren’t enough of them.There have long been calls for the national curriculum to properly incorporate black British history. The latest come from an initiative called the Black Curriculum, which was begun in 2019 by Lavinya Stennett, a graduate of the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London. This week she launched a new campaign in which members of the public are being asked to sign an open letter to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, requesting that black history be made compulsory, in order to help “build a sense of identity in every young person in the UK”, Stennett says. Williamson has been asked to reply to the letter by the symbolically significant date of 22 June Windrush Day.\u0026nbspIn some circles what happened on Sunday in Bristol is being discussed solely as a public order issue, yet the events of the weekend are intimately connected to issues of education, self-education and the failures of the national curriculum. Some have denounced the toppling of the Edward Colston statue as wanton destruction. Unquestionably it was a destructive act, but if this was simply an outpouring of incoherent rage, why did the crowd of young protesters, people of all races, specifically target the memorial to a 17th-century slave trader. Why not attack and loot the nearby shops?\u0026nbspIf, as we are told from some quarters, the protesters were mere “thugs” – a term dripping in dog-whistle tabloid racism – then how do we account for the lucid, fluent and persuasive interviews that many of them gave to the local news and online platforms? Listen to them. Hear how much they know about Colston, the Royal African Company, the Triangular Trade, the Middle Passage and the rest of it.\u0026nbspLittle about the actions of the young people who pulled Colston from his pedestal and those who cheered him on his descent to the bottom of Bristol harbour, was random. Much of it was emblematic of a generation of young black Britons and their white friends and classmates who have educated themselves on the realities of the slave trade and slavery just as they have on the structural nature of racism.\u0026nbspThey know that they cannot rely on the national curriculum to provide the history that we all need, no matter our race or ethnicity. They know how urgently we need a new curriculum that makes sense of our history, with all its dark chapters included. It is those stories, the ones we find uncomfortable as well as the ones we celebrate, that have created the nation we have become. This, along with much else, is what has to change.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cae6e7ff4d0d003889c73f5c89bedf73c859c753/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f43747c6fa0d37620cdb07b7b1f19249","title":"are you returning to work in a non essential shop in england","story":"We would like to hear from those who will be going back to work in retail shops that have been closed during lockdownAll non-essential shops in England will be able to reopen on Monday as announced by the business secretary, Alok Sharma.

Has the prospect of wind-powered cargo finally landed?The French schooner De Gallant docked in Falmouth harbour at the end of May, three months after leaving the port of Santa Marta in Colombia laden with tonnes of sustainably sourced coffee beans.This wind-powered sail cargo of carbon-neutral coffee was worth the wait, according to Yallah Coffee, a single-origin coffee roastery only a few miles away in the Cornish port town.Yallah’s special Colombian coffee grounds and beans are finding their way into coffee shops and restaurants across the country. Using a sailboat to import the beans into the UK made the first leg of their voyage almost entirely carbon neutral.For Richard Blake, the owner of Yallah Coffee, the delivery was the culmination of almost five years developing the idea for a sustainably sourced coffee without the huge carbon footprint of most imported beans.\u0026nbspBy using a traditional sailboat, the 7,500-nautical mile trip has a carbon footprint close to zero. A traditional shipping container might have emitted two tonnes of carbon. A plane would expend 178 tonnes of CO2.\u0026nbsp“It has been quite a long road for us to get to this point,” Blake said. “The idea is great, but when you’re running a business it’s so much easier to go down the well-trodden path and buy coffee through traditional routes.“There is a toss-up between the ideal and trying to make the product affordable. We have realised that it is possible – it just might take a little longer. So we changed how we look at stock levels, and where we need things when, so the extra transit time didn’t matter – it just needed a little extra planning,” he said.The realisation that sail cargoes can make sense from a business perspective is slowly percolating through ethically minded firms, giving rise to new supply-chain practices and shipping ventures.“Whilst the shipping cost was higher than if it had gone on a big tanker, we worked with the right people and were able to produce a reasonably priced product. There are savings in the fact that we are cutting out the middle men and buying directly from our partners in Colombia. The price the farmers received for this coffee was way higher than the ‘fair trade’ price, by quite some margin,” Blake says.The price for consumers, although far from cheap, is a fair one too, says Blake. Yallah is selling its sail cargo coffee at £9.30 for a 250g bag, in line with its other imported coffees and on a par with other specialty coffee companies, including Caravan and Monmouth Coffee.Sail cargoes are likely to remain limited by their logistical challenges there are only a relatively small number of vessels on offer, which undertake a limited number of runs and only at certain times of the year. But wind-powered cargo shippers note a growing interest in a carbon-neutral alternative to traditional fossil fuel-powered tankers and planes.Alex Geldenhuys, the owner of New Dawn Traders, which shipped Yallah’s first carbon-neutral coffee cargo, says inquiries for sailboat shipping have been on the rise in recent years.“In general the public awareness around the impact that a product’s supply chain can have on the environment is growing,” Geldenhuys says. “The volumes in sail cargoes are still really tiny, but the trend is there. It will play a part in a multi-faceted attack on the way we trade today.”New Dawn delivered its first cargo in 2013: a barrel of fine rum from the Dominican Republic, which was blended and bottled in Falmouth as New Dawn Rum. Today olive oil makes up the largest proportion of New Dawn’s cargoes transported throughout Europe alongside wine, almonds, olives and specialty honey.Today New Dawn’s Voyage Co-Op project allows buyers to pre-order cargo ranging from a single bottle to several tonnes of goods and fetch it from the ship. The company is one of more than 70 shippers that are part of the International Windship Association set up to help the sector collaborate on initiatives which can help to make wind-powered shipping more economic.Beyond the carbon emission savings, the mission of many in the burgeoning sector is to shorten supply chains to allow more transparency for customers, and fairer prices for farmers and consumers.The beginnings of this trend are already apparent in the rising number of consumers opting to buy locally sourced goods which rely on more sustainable practices and reduce their “food miles”.“I hope that evolves into thinking about the whole system,” says Geldenhuys. “Sometimes long-distance transport is necessary for a balanced and sustainable supply chain, so sail cargoes have a role to play in that.“Twenty years ago, buying organic was seen to be a bit ‘hippy’, but that has gone mainstream now along with buying fair trade and recycling. Understanding the impact of transporting goods is the next frontier.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68d3b5251051f6bacd2156bf400a3e3dcabb457f/424_894_2266_1360/master/2266.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=36ced84a7cd68d1e24e8df8c6fd5e320","title":"bp expects covid 19 to have enduring impact on global economy","story":"Oil and gas company could take hit of up to $17.5bn from write-offsBP has told shareholders that it could write down the value of its assets by up to $17.5bn (£14bn) as it reduced its long-term forecast for oil prices and warned that the Covid-19 pandemic would have a lasting impact on the global economy.The energy giant slashed its forecast for Brent crude oil prices to $55 a barrel from $75 a barrel and said the coronavirus crisis would speed up the shift to a lower-carbon economy.In an unscheduled update, Bernard Looney, BP’s chief executive, said: “In February we set out to become a net zero company by 2050 or sooner. Since then we have been in action, developing our strategy to become a more ersified, resilient and lower-carbon company. As part of that process, we have been reviewing our price assumptions over a longer horizon. That work has been informed by the Covid-19 pandemic, which increasingly looks as if it will have an enduring economic impact.”BP said the aftermath of the pandemic will accelerate the pace of transition to a lower-carbon economy and energy system, as countries seek to make their economies more resilient in the future.The coronavirus lockdown has virtually halted international travel and tourism, hitting airlines and other travel companies, aerospace and auto manufacturers and oil companies hard.As these businesses adjust to dramatically reduced revenue projections, job losses are starting to mount alarmingly.

The company is removing three layers of management, with more than half of the job losses falling on leadership roles, including half its 40-strong senior team.Heathrow AirportVoluntary redundancy has been offered to all of its 7,000 direct employees after coronavirus wiped out its passenger traffic.Referring to the 2015 Paris climate agreement, Looney said: “We have reset our price outlook to reflect that impact and the likelihood of greater efforts to ‘build back better’ towards a Paris-consistent world. We are also reviewing our development plans.“All that will result in a significant charge in our upcoming results but I am confident that these difficult decisions – rooted in our net zero ambition and reaffirmed by the pandemic – will better enable us to compete through the energy transition.”The company estimates that this will result in write-offs of $13bn to $17.5bn, which will drag down its financial results in the second quarter. It is also reviewing whether to develop some of its potential oilfields.Looney said that since BP pledged in February to become a net zero carbon company by 2050 or sooner, it had been working on its strategy and reviewed its price assumptions over a longer period. That work has been informed by the coronavirus pandemic, which brought economies around the world to a standstill and has sharply reduced demand for oil and gas."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb4dc73a1dc8dc5ab331ffe78654595094a554e8/0_117_3538_2125/master/3538.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51e5fbe8fe9d209e975fc53c1424e8dd","title":"uk economy to shrink 8 percent in 2020 with coronavirus recovery not until 2023 forecasters say","story":"EY Item Club further downgrades UK economic prospects with full recovery unlikely until 2023Mark Gregory, EY UK’s chief economist, said: “This is an undoubtedly challenging environment for businesses and forecasting is extremely difficult.

It also pledges to have a “deforestation-free” supply chain within three years, and to harness emerging digital technologies – such as satellite monitoring and geolocation tracking – to increase traceability and transparency.Jope has warned that the company would sell off brands that could not meet its own sustainability targets. It was no longer enough for consumer goods companies to sell washing powders that made shirts whiter or shampoos that make hair shinier, because consumers wanted brands that had a “purpose” too, he said.Last week, the FTSE 100-listed company announced that it had picked London as its home in an about-face on the company’s 2018 decision to opt for Rotterdam, which was abandoned after a revolt by British shareholders.

Currently, it’s the latter. The urban toll from coronavirus – worse than the blitz, by some measures – comes after a decade of riots, terrorism, knife crime, air pollution, homelessness, a wider housing crisis and the deepest austerity cuts. British cities are often seen by the rest of the country as privileged, but since 2010 they have often felt cursed.They have also lost power. At the last four general elections, and in the Brexit referendum, most of urban Britain didn’t get what it voted for. Instead, a nationalistic Tory government has a big majority built on England’s towns and countryside – the places that frequently still dominate Britain’s sense of itself. As coronavirus threatens to make urban life much harder for the foreseeable future, alongside articles about moving to the country, newspapers are full of predictions that the crowded, hyperactive modern city may be doomed.But for anyone fearing – or hoping – that’s the case, it’s worth remembering that the fortunes of urban Britain usually go in phases. And those phases say a lot about the sort of society that Britain – like it or not, one of the world’s most urbanised countries – wants to be.Not long ago, cities were widely seen as the answer to many of the country’s problems. “Cities can be the most beautiful and joyful manifestations of civilisation,” said the architect Richard Rogers, an important influence on the New Labour governments, in a characteristic 2002 speech. He argued that good urban design and planning could channel the “dynamism” of cities, “to tackle social problems and achieve social inclusion”. In practice, this meant better public transport, new public spaces and cultural centres, and more flats and cafes. The more bustling and cosmopolitan our cities became – the more like the best cities of our EU partners – the happier and more successful it was believed they would be. That urban density and mobility might facilitate a pandemic was not anticipated.Most cities acquired new landmarks: from the handsome Baltic art gallery in Gateshead to the futuristic Birmingham Selfridges. And the proportion of urban Britons continued to grow.But so did anti-urban feelings. In 2014, shortly before Ukip won that year’s European elections, Nigel Farage said that British cities were becoming “a foreign land”. He was talking about immigration, but was also feeding off a more general resentment, which mistakes millions of ordinary urban Britons for an alien elite.The history of postwar British pop culture famously demonstrates that struggling cities can be vibrant. Cities in crisis can sometimes provide more physical or mental space. In my part of east London during lockdown, there have been glimpses of a different city emerging: traffic lanes annexed for pedestrians and new pavement and front garden social rituals, which are loosening old hang-ups about the difference between private and public space. If you love cities, there’s something quite moving about these small attempts to get one going again.But it will be hard. Living in a city is often about sharing, proximity to strangers, and not worrying too much about hygiene – about who previously sat in your bus seat. With “non-essential” shops reopening today, with all their new rules, we’ll realise how far from the usual spontaneity urban life remains.Yet the alternatives to city living have their own drawbacks. Not least for the planet: London’s per capita carbon emissions are a third lower than the UK average. Will our cities recover? If they don’t, we will all be in trouble."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a17ae72b90fccce9bb030ab3dd41349a8751f0f9/0_177_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e4366bc667de9fc109be322e89d2f93","title":"christies withdraws allegedly looted greek and roman treasures","story":"Four antiquities pulled from auction after claims they came from illicit excavations Christie’s has quietly withdrawn four Greek and Roman antiquities from auction this month amid allegations that they had been looted from illicit excavations.The items were in the original brochure catalogue but later removed from the online site with no explanation.Prof Christos Tsirogiannis, a leading archaeologist who spotted their removal from the auction, said he had evidence that linked the four items – a Roman marble hare, a bronze Roman eagle and two Attic vases – to convicted traffickers in stolen artefacts.He is outraged that leading auction houses and dealers are repeatedly failing to make adequate checks with the authorities about whether certain antiquities were taken illegally from their country of origin.Tsirogiannis said: “It’s amazing. It’s the same pattern. These companies advertise due diligence and transparency – and in practice it’s exactly the opposite. As an archaeologist, my first responsibility is to let people know about my research and findings.”Tsirogiannis, a former senior field archaeologist at Cambridge University, is associate professor at the Institute of Advanced Studies at the University of Aarhus in Denmark. Because his academic research has focused on antiquities and trafficking networks, Greek and Italian authorities gave him official access in the early 2000s to tens of thousands of images and other archival material seized in police raids from iniduals involved in the illicit trade.Included in that were photographs and documents seized by the police from Gianfranco Becchina, who was convicted in Greece for illegally dealing in antiquities.Tsirogiannis was shocked to discover apparent links to Becchina in the four antiquities offered in a three-part Christie’s auction that ends on 16 June. He downloaded the original printed catalogue, but later discovered that those four objects were subsequently removed from the online site with no explanation.The Roman marble hare, for example, originally appeared as lot 49, dated to the second to third century AD with an estimate of $20,000 (£15,900) to $30,000. Now lot 48 simply jumps to lot 50.Tsirogiannis said: “The hare is depicted in the Becchina archive with its ears broken, but at least one of them is depicted lying in front of the sculpture. It was obviously restored later to its original position.“According to a Becchina document, the hare was bought for 13,000 Italian lire, from a looter called ‘Tullio’ in 1987, which predates the ‘provenance’ given by Christie’s. Tullio sold several other – also unrestored – antiquities to Becchina at the same time.”Tsirogiannis also recognised the bronze Roman eagle, from around the second to the third century AD and originally lot 25 in the Christie’s sale, from the Becchina archive.He also had no doubt that the former lot 121, an Attic red-figured pelike dated around 430-420 BC, was “definitely the same piece as the Becchina one,” and that lot 113, an Attic black-figured band cup, from around 540-530 BC, was almost certainly the same as one in the Becchina archive. He said: “Its Polaroid is stuck on an A4 page together with other Polaroids depicting other wonderful antiquities, also pre-restoration, that were supplied to Becchina by Raffaele Monticelli, a convicted middleman and one of the main suppliers of Becchina of illicit antiquities from south Italy.” Monticelli was sentenced in 2002 to four years in prison for trafficking illicit antiquities.Over 15 years, Tsirogiannis has identified about 1,100 looted artefacts within auction houses, commercial galleries, private collections and museums. In alerting Interpol and other police authorities, he has played a significant role in securing the repatriation of many antiquities.A Christie’s spokeswoman said: “Christie’s can confirm that lots 25, 49, 113 and 121 were withdrawn from the auctions following the provision of new information by the appropriate authorities from archives currently still unavailable to our researchers. We take our research very seriously. We always act appropriately on additional information when provided, particularly where we don’t have access to helpful archives, and the number of lots affected by such situations remains very few.”But Tsirogiannis believes auction houses have a responsibility to make effective checks with the archives. He said he had repeatedly told them that it was possible to send photographs of any antiquity to the Italian or Greek authorities to be checked. If they had done this, he said, “they would have found these objects depicted in those archives before they compiled the catalogue”.Among other antiquities identified by Tsirogiannis is an ancient Greek bronze horse, which Sotheby’s New York had planned to sell in 2018 until he notified Interpol and the US authorities of its links to the disgraced British antiquities dealer Robin Symes. Last week, Sotheby’s lost its legal challenge and Greece’s culture minister hailed the court’s ruling as a significant victory for countries fighting to reclaim antiquities."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7621830b87003585e894d48efdb78fdc0fe4c7d3/0_168_5129_3075/master/5129.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=5ab71fa08c9027da2a30b9bd522300f8","title":"its what students look for the dutch university thats only hiring women","story":"As a female computer scientist, Alexia Athanasopoulou is used to being in the minority. “People have asked me: ‘you’re a girl, why are you doing this?’”. But it was when she moved to the Netherlands to start her PhD that she noticed a big difference. “The ratio of men to women in my engineering department was very high, and this had consequences for the working culture,” she says.TUE has also introduced a new Irène Curie fellowship, which is specifically targeted at filling senior Stem roles (though it is available across disciplines) and comes with a €100,000 (£90,000) research fund and social support network. Through this scheme, Athanasopoulou is now an assistant professor in information systems at TUE.But the road to equality does not run smooth. Last month, TUE was taken to the European Court of Human Rights over claims their women-first initiative was discriminatory. A decision is expected in July, and if found in breach of fair recruitment laws, TUE’s leaders will have to rethink their strategy. TUE is by no means the first university to opt for radical measures in addressing institutional inequality. In 2017, Essex University undertook what was believed to be a UK first in boosting the salaries of all its senior women, effectively eradicating the institution’s gender pay gap where it was widest. \u0026nbsp“This is a really tricky issue and there are long-term challenges with no single solution,” she admits. “We took significant action to ensure men and women get equal pay for work of equal value, but there is a second dimension that comes down to cultural change.”“That teachers and lecturers should represent a erse range of people is something students are increasingly aware of,” says Sara Conejo Cervantes, chair of the feminist and gender equality society at Bath University. She says student campaigners work increasingly with academic staff to promote fairer hiring processes, equal pay and erse teaching content.There is a growing body of research to support the idea that teaching and learning are improved by a ersity of perspectives. Staff from historically marginalised backgrounds are more likely to integrate ersity issues\u0026nbspinto their curriculums, employ more inclusive approaches to learning and act as powerful role models.Some ersity experts are sceptical of “quick fix” initiatives like those trialled at Essex and Eindhoven. “I would much prefer to see the systemic problems in higher education being fixed, rather than cohorts being appointed as if by grace and favour.\u0026nbspWho wants to be told, years later, that they only made the grade ‘because they were a woman’, not because of their innate brilliance?” asks Athene Donald, master of Churchill College, Cambridge.Would TUE’s latest hires have applied for an Irene Curie fellowship had the scheme not been targeted at women? “I would have applied regardless,” says Michelle Chong, an assistant professor in Eindhoven’s department of mechanical engineering and Irene Curie fellow. “In traditionally male-dominant disciplines, I believe that hiring faculty not solely because they are women, but because they are solid scientists in their own right, is beneficial in addressing the gender gap.”Deniz Ikiz Kaya, an assistant professor in heritage and sustainability, agrees. “I had already met all the required and almost all of the suggested criteria listed in the job description. So I thought I was a very good match for the position, and considered the targeting of women candidates as a bonus point.”The security of the scheme’s tenure track position is also a draw. “One of the scheme’s biggest benefits is that it provides a full starter package that supports women across all levels,” Kaya adds. TUE promises flexible work schedules, a career opportunity programme to support accompanying partners, on-campus daycare for children and access to campus sports facilities.Kaya believes the fellowship could influence other universities. “TUE might contribute to setting high targets and standards for others. I think this policy has already acted as a catalyst for positive change.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8188eaab0998673fd51d79d9eb9e6a927f15cb9/0_272_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7faec9c628684058bab9b9496984f413","title":"emissions from 13 dairy firms match those of entire uk says report","story":"Exclusive: Milk giants’ climate impact rising and production caps needed, say researchersThe biggest dairy companies in the world have the same combined greenhouse gas emissions as the UK, the sixth biggest economy in the world, according to a new report.The report, by the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy (IATP) in the US, also says the growth of giant dairy companies has helped force milk prices below the cost of production for the last decade, causing a crisis in rural livelihoods and requiring taxpayer subsidies to keep farmers afloat. The researchers say caps on production should be reintroduced to protect both the climate and small farmers.“Unlike growing public scrutiny on fossil fuel companies, little public pressure exists to hold global meat and dairy corporations accountable for their emissions,” said Shefali Sharma, European director at IATP and report author. “Few of these companies are even reporting their emissions.”“As governments ratchet up their climate goals, the rise of large-scale dairy and public incentives that further increase corporate dairy power, production and emissions must be stopped,” she said. “Rural livelihoods and our planet’s future depend on it.”Dairy industry representatives said the report did not reflect the reality of the dairy sector. In a joint statement, Judith Bryans, president of the International Dairy Federation, and Donald Moore, executive director of the Global Dairy Platform, said: “The dairy sector is committed to producing nutritious foods in environmentally sound and responsible ways.”“It’s very easy to put out a report that criticises and tries to paint a simple picture of a sector which doesn’t contain all of the nuances or realities of how the global dairy sector nourishes the world with nutrient-rich, safe foods and does so in a manner that strives for continued environmental improvements while providing livelihoods to a large percentage of the world’s population,” said Bryans and Moore.A 2019 joint report by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and Global Dairy Platform said: “In order to limit temperature rise, the dairy sector must reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and work towards a low-carbon future … There is a clear case for immediate and more ambitious action.”The IATP report used the UN FAO’s global livestock environmental assessment model to assign emission levels to dairy produced in different regions. These were then applied to the companies’ production quantities as calculated by the IFCN dairy research network.The IATP report found emissions from the big companies rose from 306m tonnes of CO2-equivalent in 2015 to 338m tonnes in 2017. The UK’s annual emissions are 350m tonnes a year.“There is growing support for supply management, a crucial policy that could address dairy’s twin crises. It prevents overproduction, balances supply and demand and stabilises prices,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2bd0f8c8ad6dc0fc914eaed1badf2904b916db9/0_231_3620_2172/master/3620.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71645e56bd5b93082f950d77fb2933e4","title":"hopes dashed that resurgent pine martens can save uks red squirrel","story":"Belfast study finds pine martens don’t venture into urban areas, where invasive grey squirrels thriveHopes that the resurgent predatory pine marten might “biologically control” grey squirrels and benefit the UK’s native red squirrels have been dashed by a new study, which found pine martens avoided urban areas.Researchers from Queen’s University, Belfast, suggested that even if greys were driven out of rural areas, their populations would be constantly replenished from cities, where they thrived.The lead author of the research, Joshua Twining, of Queen’s University Belfast, said: “As the pine marten does not occupy urban areas anywhere within its European range, it is not likely to be the sole solution to the invasive grey squirrel. If action is not taken to support the pine marten in the long run, we may see a reversal of their current success and doom our native red squirrels.”Earlier studies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland discovered that the pine marten created “a landscape of fear” for the grey squirrel, and drove away populations. Although pine martens, which almost became extinct during the 20th century, will also kill red squirrels, the smaller native squirrel has evolved and adapted to survive alongside the marten for thousands of years.Grey squirrels were introduced into Britain and then Ireland in the 19th century from North America. The larger, heavier animals outcompete reds but also carry and spread squirrelpox, which does not affect greys but is rapidly fatal to reds.The Belfast study used camera traps operated by citizen scientists at 332 sites across Northern Ireland in both urban and rural areas to measure pine martens and red and grey squirrels. Models were then used to predict the future distribution of the three species.The results revealed that pine martens were deciduous woodland specialists, less numerous in non-native coniferous plantations, and displayed a strong aversion to busy urban areas. The study, published in the Journal of Applied Ecology, expected grey squirrels to persist in parkland areas of towns and cities.Twining said: “The ability of the pine marten to control the grey squirrel and help red squirrel recovery in Ireland and Britain is limited by three things: its ongoing recovery, the lack of forest cover on the islands and the presence of urban refugia.”The researchers warn that these “refuges” are likely to buy the grey squirrel population enough time to develop novel genotypes which will allow it more successfully to evade the pine marten with anti-predator behaviours. Other studies have found that species can develop anti-predator responses to novel predators within a few generations.The study found this could enable grey squirrels to recolonise woodland landscapes dominated by the pine marten in parts of Ireland and Scotland and continue to displace red squirrels, and drive them to the brink of extinction.The study argued that control of urban grey squirrels was required alongside native woodland afforestation, which would increase marten populations and their ability to control greys and help reds recover. Ireland and Britain are among the least forested countries in Europe."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b9e5e2b2832255d01a8cf5590b8deb7ac946918/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2260330fd95c3723b06b9f3d81227270","title":"leading uk charities urge pm seek green recovery covid 19","story":"Group of 57 organisations says bailouts must be on condition of firms reducing carbon footprintThe chiefs of some of Britain’s leading charities have written to the prime minister to demand a “green recovery” from the coronavirus crisis, urging him to use economic rescue packages to build low-carbon infrastructure and spur the creation of long-term green jobs.The group of 57 charities representing 22 million members called for any bailouts to be subject to strict conditions so that companies receiving state help in the Covid-19 crisis would have to meet low-carbon targets, and for all elements of any economic recovery package to be subject to a test to ensure they were in line with the UK’s target of reaching net zero emissions by 2050.They also want ministers to cancel, rather than suspend, the debts of developing countries struggling with the impact of Covid-19 and the climate crisis.Charities including the Women’s Institute, the National Trust, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), Oxfam and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) signed the letter, which comes after weeks in which ministers have made references to the need for a sustainable recovery, but without providing policy details.“We know a green recovery makes economic sense, and is supported here in the UK and overseas by leading businesses, academics, ministers and health representatives,” said Tanya Steele, the chief executive of WWF UK, one of the organisers of the letter. “What we urgently need to see now, and post-pandemic, is commitments from government on turning this into action.”The campaigners said investing in a green recovery could support at least 210,000 green jobs and bring benefits of £90bn a year, from economic rejuvenation and better health.The charities include poverty campaigners and faith groups, as well as green pressure groups. Melissa Green, the general secretary of the Women’s Institute (WI), said: “WI members are clear that post-Covid-19 economic packages need to incorporate robust and ambitious green policies in order to get on track for net zero emissions by 2050 or sooner.”The charities join an increasing number of economists, health professionals, leading climate experts, developing countries and the government’s own statutory advisers, who are all calling for a green recovery to lift countries out of recession and on to a low-carbon pathway.Fossil fuel companies and high emitters such as airlines and carmakers have already benefited from billions in public finance from the recovery package, without green strings attached.Carbon dioxide emissions, which plunged when  lockdowns took effect, had since begun to rebound sharply, research found last week. Experts fear that without strong government interventions, the UK will return to business as usual with high carbon emissions, or that emissions could rise to levels above pre-lockdown levels, if people desert public transport in favour of driving their cars.The UK is widely seen internationally as holding a particular responsibility for leading the world into a green recovery because the government will host the next vital UN climate summit. Called Cop26, and now postponed by a year to take place in Glasgow in November 2021, the conference is seen as the last chance for nations to get back on track to meet the goals of the Paris agreement and avoid catastrophic climate breakdown.“As host of Cop26, the UK government has an immense responsibility to lead the world to a green and just recovery,” said Clara Goldsmith, the campaigns director for the Climate Coalition. “This is the only way to build a resilient economic recovery which ensures we keep global heating to no more than 1.5C and supports the most vulnerable. We have one chance and we must not waste it.”Campaigners have been frustrated by the government’s lack of any policy detail on the possibility of a green recovery, and the lack of any clear agenda for Cop26.The charities laid out a seven-point plan, similar in content to the advice given by economic experts and the Committee on Climate Change, the statutory body that advises ministers on meeting the UK’s carbon targets. Their demands include: new public investment in energy efficiency, renewable energy and zero-carbon transport setting up a climate infrastructure bank trade deals that support British farming, to ensure greater protection for nature ending fossil fuel finance, in the UK and overseas helping to halt the decline of bioersity around the world.They also called for a new government committee, led by a minister, to work with civil society groups on delivering a green recovery."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/415edef2931ede625df5c8e3e0ad356b6c66612f/207_321_2339_1404/master/2339.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55d3fe04461de29c0d220ef2a2eedad9","title":"the classic film ive never seen halloween","story":"John Carpenter’s 1978 original slasher film isn’t scary at all – it’s too clunky for thatI’m a wimp when it comes to horror films, as anyone who has ever sat next to me in a cinema while I’ve been yelping my head off will tell you.

It may terrify teenagers at a sleepover, but watching it in broad daylight in middle-age brings a sort of patronising respect for the plucky low-budget film-makers who managed to get 90 minutes out of a handful of actors, two clapboard houses and a wisp of plot.You might admire Carpenter’s insistent 54 piano theme, the early twist that a homicidal maniac is actually a six-year-old boy, and the grownup Michael Myers’ gymnastic escape from an asylum on a dark and stormy night. You might appreciate the way the Steadicam prowls through a grid of all-American suburban streets, as if searching for victims. As for the victims, the only bearable one is Jamie Lee Curtis’s studious Laurie, a spiritual cousin of Sandy from Grease, which came out the same year. On that note, why do the main characters include Laurie, Loomis, Lynda, Lyndsey, Lonnie and Lester? What the L is going on?What surprised me most about Halloween was how little it has to do with the 31 October Halloween. Carpenter scatters around a few references to pumpkins and trick-or-treaters, just as the set decorator scatters around a few brown leaves. (The film was shot in May, which explains why the neighbourhood’s trees are so lush and green.) But no one gets drowned while bobbing for apples, and the masked serial killer doesn’t hide among crowds of revellers in fancy dress. It could have been set on any night of the year. (An early draft of the script, I’ve since learned, had a more appropriate but less iconic title: The Babysitter Murders.)The other big surprise was how ineffectual Myers is. His doctor (Donald Pleasence) keeps saying that he is evil incarnate. Dr Loomis made his diagnosis while the boy sat silently in a cell for 15 years, so he must be quite some psychiatrist. But the so-called figure of The Shape totters along so slowly that he would lose a race with any of George A Romero’s zombies in Night of the Living Dead. And he should have cut wider eyeholes in his mask, because he repeatedly fails to stab Laurie at point-blank range. She, on the other hand, stabs him with a knitting needle, a coat hanger and a kitchen knife, so Carpenter and Hill missed a trick – or a treat – by not making her the villain in Halloween II.Her stabbings don’t draw blood, though. The film is remarkably short of gore by today’s standards. And it’s light on sex and swearing. Perhaps it’s because we are living in a horror movie at the moment, but Halloween now seems sweetly innocent: a glimpse of a peaceful, naive America where a slowcoach in a boilersuit was the most frightening thing around."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb05c1ed4ee6c18596befe5f189356fd270525d0/0_103_1354_812/master/1354.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1366546603072ee655ed844016c22095","title":"the point animation film ringo starr","story":"The latest in a series of writers highlighting underappreciated films available to stream is a recommendation for a trippy early-70s animationThe glorious thing about streaming, at this point in its history, is the sense that eventually everything that was lost will be eventually found somewhere, on some platform, at some point, as long as the rights holders can be traced. That is basically the idea of this series, about streaming gems, right? It’s like we’re pointing out for you, dear reader, the pretty fish and brightly coloured bits of flotsam that are swirling by in the mighty, ever-swelling, almost menacingly vast river of online content that’s gushing by our feet, threatening to pull us in, drowning us in the oblivion of inexhaustible narrative noise.Perhaps that overwhelmed feeling we have when facing this onslaught of content is what draws us to familiar tokens from childhood, shonky old stories and celluloid-scratched images that set the hippocampus tingling. Animated feature The Point from 1971, a trippy parable about a round-headed boy born into in a world where everyone else has a pointy noggin, is an instant stimulus to the semi-conscious nostalgia centres for Americans of my generation. Anyone born Stateside in the 1960s may dimly remember this as an early evening bedtime TV treat.Fittingly, given its spooky self-referentiality, the film’s own framing device posits a father reading a bedtime story to his son, who would initially rather watch TV on the chubby little set in his bedroom. I’m not entirely sure if The Point was on at bedtime, come to think of it, but that might explain why its first 30 minutes are so vivid in the memory, and the rest more gauzy, as if remembered through a haze of sleepiness. Or that might just because the best bits are in first 30 minutes.Much like Yellow Submarine three years prior, which takes up a contiguous portion of my primordial memory bank, The Point evolved out of a musical project, in this case a concept album of the same name written, narrated and performed by Harry Nilsson. These days, Nilsson is probably best known for his cover of the power ballad Without You, which was itself later covered by Mariah Carey, as well as his rendition of Everybody’s Talkin’, a tune featured in Midnight Cowboy, oddly both of them songs he didn’t write himself.But Nilsson was a prolific songwriter as well as a melodious tenor, and a major figure in the hipster-ocracy in Los Angeles’ Laurel Canyon neighbourhood in the late 1960searly 70s where he palled around with the Beatles and the Monkees, Frank Zappa and Timothy Leary, among many others. Reportedly, like so many goofy ideas that ended up getting marketed at children in those days, The Point was inspired by an acid trip in the middle of the night.“I was on acid and I looked at the trees and I realized that they all came to points,” Nilsson recalled later of the walk near his house. “And the little branches came to points, and the houses came to point. I thought, ‘Oh! Everything has a point, and if it doesn’t, then there’s a point to it.’”OK, that doesn’t make much sense, and to be honest neither does much of the story, but somehow it all was transmuted into a little fable about intolerance and prejudice (it’s against those things, naturally) for the jolly Nilsson-narrated album, and then the film itself. The movie, made for TV, was directed by noted animation director-producer gun for hire Fred Wolf, who collaborated with animator Jimmy T Murakami to make some of the best-known trash kid TV of the 1960s to the 80s, from The Flintstones to the original version of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Like the world seen on hallucinogens or cannabis, everything is connected when it comes to The Point. The voice cast alone is a microcosmic cross-section of 1960s and 70s talent: Dustin Hoffman voiced the fathernarrator in the very first broadcast, but was replaced eventually, for the versions now available, by Ringo Starr, while Mike Lookinland, wee Bobby from the Brady Bunch, voiced Oblio, and Paul Frees, a legendary voice actor with an endless line of credits, from Some Like it Hot to The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle, voiced most of the other characters.All scratchy black lines filled in with watercolour washes, the visual style of The Point, along with its limited animation, is one of the things that makes it so evocatively 1971-ish – literally sketchy, clumsy, insistently handmade in a way that’s so refreshingly different from the computer-generated, hyper-rendered surfaces in most animation these days. If you show this film to a child today raised on digital entertainment, you may also have to explain why the opening credits have such crackly scratches on them, a legacy of the fact that this version was generated off an old 16mm print because the film’s negative has been lost.The lines and forms flow and wiggle as we hear the story of Oblio, the story’s kid protagonist whose best friend is his dog Arrow, the sung-about object of love in what is the movie’s best-known song, Me and My Arrow. At first, Oblio’s round head in a world where everyone else has a cone-shaped dome is not so much of a social stigma, but when he and Arrow beat the local Count’s son at the sport of triangle toss, then Oblio ends up being banished from the kingdom and sent to out to the dreaded Pointless Forest. There he meets all manner of peculiar folk, including a drawling, laid-back, clearly stoned out of his mind Rock Man, a three-headed trickster character, and a wise talking tree who helps Oblio see the point of it all.Or something like that. It doesn’t really matter because any moral message is, ironically, not really the point at all here. Indeed, this is actually, although it doesn’t seem to know it, a celebration of playful aimless wandering, noodling and pootling along as Nilsson plays with rhythms and rhymes, recurrent piano chords and puns aplenty. The narrative is nothing but a tangle of frayed threads that pull at murky concepts not quite developed, barely seen. The whole thing feels infused by stoned mysticism, about everything and nothing, that’s deliriously of its time, charming and just plain batshit. And given how crisp, algorithmically precise and micro-targeted so much of the product that’s coming down the stream is these days, that messy carelessness, scuffed-up handmade quality is exactly the point of The Point."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b2e9c79e8796dad0a73dd256f7a5acd1322ed38/0_56_4678_2807/master/4678.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=978ed551804525c3c7f899d457c806f2","title":"premier league restart preview no 15 sheffield united","story":"European qualification is a glorious possibility and Chris Wilder’s side have a FA Cup quarter-final to look forward toWhat\u0026nbspwas the situation like when the league was suspended on 13 March? Supposed certainties for relegation, Chris Wilder’s team were the most heartening story of the season until the pause, seventh in the table with the knowledge that winning their game in hand would lift them to fifth. European qualification is a distinct and glorious possibility and they also have a FA Cup quarter-final at home against Arsenal, whom they have already beaten at Bramall Lane in the league this season.The Blades have a whole armoury of players who are thriving to an extent not seen at their previous clubs and their collective power within Wilder’s inventive system is reflected in the fact that they have the second meanest defence in the league, an extraordinary achievement for a team contesting their first season after promotion. They have sustained their strong form throughout the campaign, with their only defeats in their last 13 matches before the lockdown being to Liverpool and Manchester City.What about now? The squad is injury-free and Wilder may have welcomed the unexpected mid-season break insofar as it enabled him to rest a team that seldom changes (four of the back five have played every match of the season, while John Egan has missed only one). There were more good news at the weekend as the club reached a deal in principle with Manchester United for the goalkeeper Dean Henderson to stay beyond 30 June.What needs to be done to have a successful end to the season? Although the Blades’ tightness is due to much more than a fine goalkeeper, keeping Henderson is important. United could do with more sharpness up front. They are certainly not a negative team – no side can be sensibly called that when their centre-backs regularly raid\u0026nbspdown the wings – but they have mustered fewer shots than anyone else in the league, so there is a heavy onus to take the few chances they forge. That is not just down to their forwards, whose contributions to the team dynamic involve much more than\u0026nbspscoring. But with canny midfielder John Fleck their joint-leading scorer in the league with five goals, an increased strike rate from Lys Mousset (also on five goals), Oli McBurnie (four) or David McGoldrick (tantalisingly close to above zero) would be a boost.Have the players and staff behaved during lockdown? Yes.Any unsungcommunity heroes? In addition to joining his teammates in contributing to the Players Together fundraising scheme, Enda Stevens, formerly of Shamrock Rovers, donated to a fund set up in his home country for League of Ireland players left in financial hardship by the lockdown. Stoke’s James McClean and Burnley’s Kevin Long, both of whom also started their careers in the League of Ireland, did likewise.Key player in the run-in? Ollie Norwood. Sheffield United being the Premier League’s best example of the power of a perfectly calibrated and populated system, it is difficult to identify one player who is more important than the others. Henderson obviously performs a unique role but plenty of others also have critical specialities. Norwood is a vital cog in the heart of midfield, an ever-present whose ability to knit play together explains why he has completed more passes than any other player in the side this season while also winning more tackles than any of his midfield teammates.End-of-season-prediction\u0026nbspSeventh in the league and a Wembley appearance in the FA Cup.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4756028f71badf46f0eb047d28786431f3f387e0/0_131_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85d6b5a78a2ead168e4e2fb7ecd6d521","title":"premier league returns but at newcastle everything has stopped","story":"With the takeover in limbo and backroom staff on furlough, will Steve Bruce and his squad be able to concentrate on football?In Samuel Beckett’s play Waiting for Godot the supposedly central figure never actually turns up. As time passes, one character reassures another that Godot’s eventual arrival will bring salvation but, still, nothing happens and no one appears.Newcastle fans know the feeling. They have been sitting by the phone that never rings and standing with their noses pressed against the windowpane, staring at a stubbornly empty street, for far too long now.By the time of football’s restart this week St James’ Park was supposed to be home to England’s wealthiest club and Tyneside a magnet to the world’s most talented players. Instead Mike Ashley remains Newcastle’s extremely reluctant owner and the club’s £300m takeover by a largely Saudi Arabian-funded consortium still awaits Premier League approval.Given that it was all supposed to be rubber-stamped weeks ago, many Newcastle supporters, already fed up of 13 years of Ashley’s largely dismal regime, are close to despair. Newcastle’s opening “restart” game at home against Sheffield United on Sunday had been hyped as the Riyadh derby but it seems only the visitors will be under Saudi control.As the Premier League ponders the takeover – something it has been doing for almost three months – Steve Bruce’s team are in limbo. Many of the club’s backroom staff, ticket-office personnel included, remain furloughed after Ashley apparently left the determination of their futures to the prospective new owners.Tynesiders concerned about the kingdom’s appalling human rights record and Jamal Khashoggi’s murder have been offered no window into PIF’s world because of the opaque nature of Saudi business and society. Their attention has instead turned to the £80m donation the Reuben Foundation made to Oxford University last week and the slow-burn soap opera of Staveley’s £1.6bn high-court battle with Barclays.Such distractions aside, Newcastle fans are becoming increasingly anxious about more modest sums. Among the assorted consequences of the takeover‑induced hiatus is the club’s position as the only member of football’s top tier not to have pledged to refund season-ticket holders unable to attend the 2019‑20 campaign’s outstanding home fixtures now games are behind closed doors.It is a shabby way to operate and depressingly emblematic of Ashley’s tenure but, even though the Premier League is set to make a welcome intervention to resolve the problem, the current paralysis is not entirely the retail tycoon’s fault.Lee Charnley, Newcastle’s chief executive, had expected to have departed St James’ Park by now but, instead, he remains tasked with helming one of the most prolonged “handovers” in the game’s history. Although a spirit of cordial co-operation exists between Charnley, Staveley and co, certain decisions are complicated by the need for consultation between all parties.Last month Bruce appeared so confident the takeover was imminent that he spoke publicly of welcoming the new owners before backing himself to see off potential managerial rivals including Rafael Benítez and Mauricio Pochettino.Now, though, the feeling that it might all fall through permeates the air at Newcastle’s suburban training ground. Supporters suddenly fear the team’s current 35-point tally may not be sufficient to stave off relegation. The first three league fixtures – at home against Sheffield United, Aston Villa and away at Bournemouth – look freighted with worry.Should Bruce continue the experiment with the more expansive 4-2-3-1 system he road-tested before lockdown, or revert to Benítez’s old safety-first 3-4-3? The excitement that once surrounded a looming FA Cup quarter-final at home against Manchester City has diminished considerably.With the sale’s completion seemingly stuck Ashley, who has exchanged contracts and collected a £17m non-refundable deposit, will demand clarification from the Premier League this week. Numerous jobs in his high-street chains could hinge on the answer but it appears he did not bargain for being drawn into the ongoing proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Qatar.Given the narrow parameters of its owners’ and directors’ test, the Premier League’s biggest resultant headache is broadcast piracy. With Saudi Arabia accused of illicitly streaming transmissions from Qatar’s beIN Sports via the illegal beoutQ platform, the league’s intellectual property lawyers and forensic accountants must decide whether there is a legal separation between the Saudi government and PIF. Significantly, Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince, is PIF’s chairman.Moreover beIN has a three-year £500m overseas rights deal with the Premier League, running until 2022. A World Trade Organisation report on the piracy issue expected to be highly critical of Saudi Arabia is due for publication on Tuesday.Although the WTO traditionally sidesteps geopolitical conflict, the Premier League chief executive, Richard Masters, cannot. While Qatar and its slick PR machine has inundated his organisation with a barrage of deeply concerning documentation about Ashley’s proposed successor, the UK has strong business, diplomatic and intelligence ties with Saudi.Although careful to appear detached, the British government has made encouraging noises about the takeover, telling human rights groups there are grounds for cautious optimism regarding social reform and modernisation in the kingdom.The Premier League’s delay in the decision making feels increasingly cruel to Newcastle and their supporters."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c0c2239ec31ab5d2a803872a3fc71183e4bd600/0_380_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f62d7373173c739db43fe9fbee2955d5","title":"brands fans and influencers why social media for small business is about more than sales","story":"Standing out online can transform a business, but it takes focus and strategy. Here, three stars of social share what they’ve learnedMost businesses these days will have some form of social media presence, but many may not be making the most of the opportunities it provides. Not only does it open up a huge potential customer base – half the world’s population is now on social media – it also gives companies the perfect opportunity to build and retain loyalty among existing customers.Like all aspects of technology, social media is constantly evolving. So while a small business may have set up a Facebook or a Twitter account a few years back and thought that was a case of “job done”, new social media platforms such as TiKTok have been developed since then, while Instagram and YouTube have become vital parts of a holistic social media ecosystem.\u0026nbspBeyond the platforms themselves, trends have also changed in terms of what users want, how they interact with brands and what’s important to them. Customers have now become fans, emotional ties to brands are a thing and thought-leadership can make you an influencer. Content is still king, and shareability is vital.\u0026nbspBut as well as all this modern stuff – the basics are still important too.\u0026nbsp“On the high street you wouldn’t have a shopfront with a broken window, peeling paint, rubbish everywhere and goods randomly thrown on displays, and expect to thrive,” says PR and social media expert Mike Crutchley.As someone who helps businesses improve and overhaul their social media strategies, he says first impressions count.\u0026nbsp“Social media channels must be up to date with everything from posts to contact details and opening hours,” he says. “High-quality images and videos, as well as good grammar and spelling are as vital as creating engaging posts.”The tools that allow businesses to make this happen have never been more accessible, and there is now an opportunity to try some of them out free of charge. Customers of the website builder GoDaddy are currently receiving a complimentary 90-day premium subscription to the mobile app Over, which gives them access to simple templates for creating sleek and effective social media content.Sometimes the things that work best on social media are the simplest. You can have all the metrics and dashboards in the world, but if people don’t engage and share your original posts then you’re missing a huge potential source of customers.\u0026nbspWhen Dutch-born Londoner Annemarie Plas saw people in countries throughout Europe clapping for their healthcare workers she was inspired to help set up something similar in her adopted home, and so created clapforourcarers with GoDaddy.Scaling up quickly could well have proved a challenge, but with the astute use of social media things have gone from strength to strength.\u0026nbsp“I just put together a small image and posted it on my socials such as Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter, and sent it to all my UK friends by WhatsApp, I also made a small website and an Insta page,” says Plas.\u0026nbspHer efforts to spread the word were given a huge boost when her campaign was picked up by influencers such as the Beckhams and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who shared it to their followers.\u0026nbspThe first clap happened on Thursday 26 March at 8pm and became a weekly event, being covered by the national media and circulated widely on social media too, right up to the final clap on 28 May.Although Plas has a background working for media agencies, she had neither the time nor staff support that other organisations might be able to draw upon. So she decided to keep things simple and made shareability a big part of her strategy.\u0026nbsp“I understood the importance of having simple and engaging messaging. I used a hashtag and made the image easy to share on any social channels.”Her simple and consistent messaging has resulted in the #clapforourcarers hashtag being shared more than 139,000 times on Instagram alone.\u0026nbsp“Some influencers get a bad reputation,” says Masha Zvereva, founder of Coding Blonde. She set up her blog back in 2015, when she was trying to learn some coding skills to make her more employable. She originally registered it with GoDaddy, which she then also used as a hosting provider.Through that blog, as well as Instagram and YouTube, Zvereva has amassed a loyal following and is now regarded as an influencer in the field of women in tech, entrepreneurship and personal growth.\u0026nbsp“Influencers can be perceived as fake, superficial, salesy etc, but what people don’t see is the hard work that goes behind being able to make a living off of this business model and growing your business,” she says.Quality content is paramount according to Zvereva. Whether you’re filming a video for YouTube or writing a thought leadership piece, it has to add value beyond simply advertising your skills to the wider world.\u0026nbsp“Anyone can become an influencer if they want to, but I’d recommend approaching it from the standpoint of adding value to an audience,” she says.\u0026nbsp“What’s the purpose behind your blog? How will you be impacting people’s lives and who is your target audience? And finally, why should it be you?”Many people might still associate social media in a business context purely with selling, but its importance when it comes to building a brand can’t be overstated.\u0026nbspThis is something Zaffrin and Brian O’Sullivan, co-founders of the vegan skincare company Five Dot Botanics set out to do well before their company launched.Establishing it on Instagram even before they had products to sell, they were able to develop a loyal audience.\u0026nbsp“Social media has allowed small brands like mine to build a brand. Historically it would not have been possible to launch a beauty brand without millions of pounds to acquire customers through marketing,” says Zaffrin.\u0026nbspBefore setting up those social channels though, their first move was to register a domain name and get a URL through GoDaddy. Then it was time to get the ball rolling with social media.\u0026nbspThe stories the O’Sullivans shared weren’t all about success, but about the challenges they were facing. This honesty helped create a situation where people were rooting for them. The couple were also able to get 600 people signed up to their newsletter email list so there was already an eager customer base waiting for when the products were ready.Once the social channels were up and running, the O’Sullivans set up an internet landing page using GoDaddy’s services – and they were in business.Social continues to be at the heart of their marketing. As well as using Instagram for brand-building, Zaffrin posts to Pinterest and Facebook, although she says the latter works best for business if you’re willing to put money behind it – paying for targeted ads, for example. Otherwise the other platforms can be effective without budget, simply by skilful use. Zaffrin uses LinkedIn to raise her business profile and publish articles, and is curious about TikTok, saying it is “one to watch”.\u0026nbsp“Our audience are our fans,” she says. “They root for our success, and our customers on social tell us every day what they think and what they want. We are constantly listening to them, whether they’re letting us know how they are using our products or coming up with ideas for new ones.”GoDaddy launched the #OpenWeStand initiative offering a number of free tools, widgets, resources and blogposts at OpenWeStand.org to help small businesses keep their digital doors open while their physical doors are closed.

This week: a pine on a protected beach in TurkeyBrian Harrison and his wife, Sue, love visiting Turkey every year. During their trips, they always find time to visit Iztuzu beach, near the south-western coastal town of Dalyan. It’s not just the breathtaking mountains, the clear blue sea and the great food that keep them coming back. Each time, they return to see a contorted Mediterranean pine tree on the beach.“It’s reassuring it’s always there,” says Brian, 71. “It must take a battering every winter, but it always seems to survive and hang on in there. It hasn’t been blown away, it’s stuck into the sand and it has become something we come to every year.”Iztuzu beach is five kilometres long and the tree is at the southern end. “The weather is warm, mild and incredibly welcoming, but the tree reminds me that in winter the conditions are very different,” says Brian. There are not many other trees on the beach. Sadly, it’s not a great spot to rest under as the pine is surrounded by “gravelly” sand and “an undergrowth of wiry, stiff and prickly grass”. The sparse leaves do not provide any shade from the sun.\u0026nbspThe retired teacher and university administrator from Bushey, Hertfordshire, chose this particular picture because it highlights the tree’s distinctive shape. He remains fascinated by its untold story. “What makes this tree stand out for me is how it’s been battered and permanently distorted by the wind,” he says. “It’s clearly got a history, but we don’t know what actually happened to make the tree the shape it is.”\u0026nbspThe entire beach is an environmentally protected breeding area for loggerhead sea turtles. Close to the tree is a therapy and rehabilitation centre to care for turtles injured by fishing lines or collisions with boats. “The turtles tend to come out at night when the beach is closed,” Brian says. “That leaves the whole area free for the turtles to use as they like.” They mainly come ashore to lay their eggs, and when the centre is aware there are eggs buried in the sand, it protects them from being moved or disturbed by human visitors.\u0026nbspBrian has arranged to visit Turkey in September with Sue and some friends, but they are unsure whether the trip will go ahead because of the coronavirus pandemic. “We hope to get back there some time soon to see if the tree is still there.”• Tell us about your favourite tree by filling in this form."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d8d7b9e94d07d02cf1002e7d4b38ff53594b651/27_7_5311_3186/master/5311.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6586a4c7d2ef2e7d39db90cfdc578db0","title":"can you get a mortgage on a house being sold below market value","story":"A friend has the chance to buy a £400,000 house in Brighton for £215,000 Q A close friend of a friend of mine has offered to sell him a house in Brighton for £215,000 even though its market value is £400,000.My friend, who is self-employed and 55 years old, is a first-time buyer renting in London.\u0026nbspHe currently has a mortgage offer of £215,000 on a one-bedroom flat – also in Brighton – which is in place until the end of June. Obviously, the house is a much better proposition but his mortgage adviser has told him he would not be able to get a mortgage on a property that is not being sold at its market value. Is this true? Buying the house so cheaply seems too good an opportunity to pass up.\u0026nbspCFA No it’s not true. According to Pete Mugleston of onlinemortgageadviser, it is perfectly possible to get a mortgage on a property sold at below market value. He says: “There is an urban myth that to purchase (or sell) a property well below its actual worth may be unethical – or even illegal – in some way. But buying a house well below market value, with or without a mortgage, is generally a perfectly acceptable practice.”However, not all lenders are prepared to lend to people buying property at less than market value. So, as with all niche mortgage requirements, it pays to get bespoke advice from a whole-of-market mortgage adviser with the right expertise and who knows which mortgage lender will be able to help you. So, in your friend’s case, he may want to switch from an adviser who tells him he won’t be able to get a mortgage on the house to one who will be able to find a suitable lender. However, if he has already paid his mortgage adviser a fee for arranging the mortgage on the flat in Brighton, your friend may want to have a think about whether he is prepared to take the financial hit of not getting that money back. A lot also depends on where he is in the property-buying process. If he has already exchanged contracts on the flat, deciding to buy the house instead would mean losing the deposit money that would have been paid on exchange.Perhaps the most sensible course of action would be for your friend to explore the possibility of getting a mortgage on the house with another adviser before making a decision about pulling out of the deal on the flat.• Want expert help finding your new mortgage?

Thirteen years later, with the mystery still unsolved, German police revealed they had a new prime suspect. Is there now a conclusion in sight?Last week, prosecutors in Germany held a press conference to update the media on a story that has gripped the world for over a decade. There was a new lead in the search for the missing British girl Madeleine McCann, who disappeared at the age of three in the Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz.  reporters Esther Addley and Sandra Laville have covered the story for 13 years, through the false leads, wrongly named suspects and a maelstrom of wild rumours, many focused on the girl’s devastated parents. They tell Rachel Humphreys what it was about this case that made it a national obsession – and what a resolution would mean.

He said the work “should not be used in arguments about how much greater the infection risk is at 1-metre minimum distance as opposed to 2 metres”.Doubts about the study emerged as Boris Johnson announced a formal review of the 2-metre physical distancing rule, which is expected to report by 4 July, the earliest date pubs and restaurants may reopen in England. In recent weeks, Johnson has come under intense pressure from Conservative MPs to relax the advice to help businesses, particularly in the hospitality sector.Led by researchers at McMaster University in Ontario, the report pooled data from previously published studies to estimate the risk of becoming infected with coronavirus at different distances. It also considered how face masks and eye protection might help prevent the spread of disease.But in the analysis the authors assume the proportional impact on risk of moving from 2 metres to 1 metre is the same as moving from 1 metre to zero. “They are forcing the proportional fit to be the same,” Spiegelhalter told the .McConway believes there is a more fundamental problem in the way the risks of infection at different distances are compared in the study. He said: “The method of comparing the different distances in the paper is inappropriate for telling you exactly how the risk at 2-metre minimum distance compares to a 1 metre minimum distance. It does not support, and should not be used in, arguments about how much greater the risk is with a 1 metre limit versus a 2-metre limit.”Another scientist, Prof Ben Cowling at the WHO Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Control at the University of Hong Kong, flagged further issues with the work. He tweeted that he was “not taking the whole paper very seriously” because it looked only at distance and not how long a person was exposed for.McConway said he had raised questions about the analysis with the authors and was waiting to hear back. He believed peer review by the Lancet and the WHO should have spotted the problems. “I think they did it in such a rush – the authors, possibly the WHO, and the Lancet peer reviewers – that important things were missed,” he said.“Everyone believes that the risk of infection at 1-metre is higher than at 2-metre and we need to know how much higher because there’s a trade-off between the increased risk and the gains from moving to 1-metre. But if you don’t know how the risks at 1 metre and 2 metres compare, how do you know how to trade it off? It’s finger in the air stuff,” McConway said.The most recent public Sage document on physical distancing, updated on 2 May, makes clear that multiple streams of evidence are used to advise on safe distancing, including how long people are together, ventilation and room size, and that the 2-metre advice is no more than a ballpark guide for face-to-face meetings.In a statement, the WHO said it recommends keeping a distance of 1 metre or more.“The evidence used to inform this guidance was based on a systematic review of all available, relevant observational studies concerning protective measures to prevent transmission of the coronaviruses that cause Sars, Mers and Covid-19. After checking for relevance, 44 comparative studies done in health-care and non-health-care settings were included.“The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis support physical distancing of 1 metre or more, which is in line with the existing WHO recommendation that people should physically distance at least 1 metre,” the statement said.The Lancet and the authors of the study have been contacted for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4828b13b11fd6eb67496dea322531c7f9a47f365/0_1611_4912_2947/master/4912.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d2e90fdd2fd2c30b28acfa5368fb2c7","title":"can you solve it domino dancing","story":"A riddle about rectanglesIt’s a sin! Yes, I used a picture of the Pet Shop Boys to entrap you into reading my puzzle column. What did you do to deserve it?Today’s poser (no, not him) concerns the playful positioning of domino-shaped tiles on a chessboard.Is it possible to cover an 8x8 chessboard with 32 dominos (which are each a 1x2 block) in such a way that any line parallel to a side of the chessboard always passes through the interior of at least one of the dominoes?If it is possible, draw an example. If it isn’t, prove it.(Each domino is a 1x2 rectangle, which means that each domino will cover two adjacent squares perfectly. The dominoes must cover the board completely, which means lie flat on the squares leaving no gaps nor overlaps.)You might want to begin by trying to tile a 4x4 board with 8 dominos according to the constraints of the question, that is, such that any line parallel to a side always passes through the interior of at least one of the dominoes. Is this possible? Next, try with a 6x6 board and 18 dominoes.

Not one.But next summer Alice Dearing, a 23-year-old from Birmingham who is Britain’s best open-water swimmer, intends to flip 125 years of history on its head in Tokyo – the small matter of a global pandemic permitting. And, as becomes clear over a thought-provoking and nuanced conversation, that is only the start of her ambitions.“Being a poster girl for black swimming is exciting, because genuinely I love the sport and I want to see as many people doing it as possible,” Dearing says. “But it’s also terrifying because there’s a lot of pressure. I have rationalised it – if not me, then who? And I want this to happen as soon as possible, to break that barrier.”Part of the problem, she explains, is also cultural. “A lot of black people think they never learned how to swim and turned out fine so they don’t need to teach their children. Obviously there are a lot of flaws with that argument, but if that’s being repeated to a whole generation – that swimming is not for you – then obviously it’s going to trickle down.”Dearing has also recently partnered with the specialist swimming brand Soul Cap, which makes swimming hats designed especially for afro hair. As she explains, swimming can be more damaging to afro hair because of the sodium hypochlorite in pools, which can discourage those from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds.Meanwhile Dearing’s skin colour meant that when she started swimming aged seven or eight she stood out – not that she always realised. “My mum’s the black parent. She’d be the one taking me training and to competitions, and she would literally be one of two black people at the pool along with me – people would see us together and just stare. My mum was like: ‘It must be because you are so small and then you swim so well.’ But maybe we were being naive.”While most in the sport have been encouraging, Dearing says there have been exceptions – including the time she found out from a friend that a coach used the N-word regarding her when she was 17. “If that’s the way someone sees me then it’s their issue and they need to learn to deal with it. I’m tired of educating people around these issues. That said, it is really exciting to see how many people in the last few weeks genuinely want to change things.“Typically I have been sceptical about these movements because they happen maybe once every two years and then fizzle out. But the more the days have gone on, and I’ve seen how determined everyone is to make change happen, the more I have become hopeful.”Dearing’s mum, who is from Accra in Ghana, is the keen swimmer of her parents. Her dad, who is white and from Hull, cannot swim at all. And it was her mum who encouraged her to stick at the sport until, because of a combination of a growth spurt and a switch to long distances, she suddenly moved into elite class.“When I was 16 I made my first GB team in the 400m freestyle – that made me realise I could achieve something because I was quite small and had always doubted myself. That same year I was invited for an open-water trial for the European juniors. I didn’t realise that it was over 10km. And to make matters worse it was only 14C, tipping down, and I didn’t have a wetsuit. But despite it being my first time in open water I somehow managed to finish in 2hr 20m. Off the back of that I went to European juniors and ended up winning. After that I just kind of rolled with it.” And then some. At 19 Dearing was crowned world junior open-water champion. Before the lockdown she was in the best phase of training in her career, having finished in the top 10 at a World Cup event in Doha in February, and was relishing a shot at the Olympic podium.Dearing could only train on her boyfriend’s parents’ exercise bike during the early stages of the pandemic but is now back in the swing of getting up at 4.30am to train in the pool. Somehow she combines this with studying for a Masters at Loughborough University and being on the Women’s Sport Trust’s Unlocked programme, which seeks to help women sports stars become voices for their generation.How does she fit it in? “I like to think about everything I do as influencing my younger self. Would it be enough to inspire somebody to be a woman of colour swimming for the national team – or could I take it a step further by reaching out to the community?”It’s working, too. “I am seeing way more black swimmers poolside than I used to. I watch them swim – and I am always their biggest fan in my head. To be honest I don’t want to always be referred to as the black swimmer from Britain. I want to be known for my achievements. But perhaps it is necessary if it helps inspire another child to get in the pool, aged eight, and to just give it a go.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1295cd8695b0e08c791f0992a24bd944a41ba992/0_107_2032_1219/master/2032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ecf3fa0c803dbb3652b863cc06dddb6","title":"feliciano lopez if we dont play the atp is not going to survive","story":"The Queen’s Club champion shares how players must accept cuts to prize money for tennis to withstand having no fans presentTennis is fighting for survival, according to Feliciano López on the first anniversary of his triumph at Queen’s Club, and the veteran Spaniard says players, rich and struggling, will have to accept “significant” cuts in prize money to save their sport. López has also warned that the ATP may not survive the coronavirus crisis.While the west London host of the ATP 500 tournament idles along with the rest of tennis (apart from glorified exhibitions), López paints a grim picture as the industry wrestles with the impact of Covid-19. Still keen to resume playing at 38, the arch survivor, who has played at a record 72 grand slams in a row, is also the Madrid Open’s director and offers a unique perspective on what might happen next.“I’m talking as a player now – but I’m also a tournament director and I am able to see the reality, to see how tough it is to survive in this crisis. It is hitting everyone. It’s tough to break even. This is what the players need to understand. It is really urgent that everybody plays. But, if we don’t have tournaments, it’s possible the ATP is not going to survive either. We need to stay together. It is the only way to survive.”Bringing players together in a global sport during a pandemic is a problem, he agrees, but he said: “I think in two weeks or so, the borders and the airports are going to start opening up, and we’re going to be able to travel freely – I hope. We have to consider that there are different restrictions in Europe. For example, it is not the same in Austria as in Germany. We’re working on that.”The bigger problem is in South America and the US, where there have been fresh outbreaks of coronavirus, as well as strong reservations by leading players including the world No 1, Novak Djokovic – who broke down in tears after beating Alexander Zverev 4-0, 1-4, 4-2, in front of a crowd of 4,000 people at his own tournament in Belgrade on Sunday – Rafael Nadal, and the world No 2 on the WTA Tour, Simona Halep.López respects Djokovic’s reluctance to travel to the US Open with only one member of his entourage, but said: “Is it a sacrifice? Yes. But you will have the physios on site and you will have maybe your team waiting for you at the hotel. It is a small sacrifice.”López thinks the US Open, still pencilled in for 24 August, will get a green light when officials confer in New York on Monday. If not the Tour is more likely to resume on clay in Europe – beginning with Madrid in September, then Rome and leading on to Roland Garros.One player keen to go to New York is Andy Murray, with whom López won the doubles at Queen’s Club last year but who has not played since November. “We are in touch every two weeks or so,” said López.“We text each other. Two days ago I was talking to him, and he was really pumped about the US Open. He was starting to practise again. I asked about the hip, how it was feeling, and he was positive. He might be able to compete again. I’m crossing my fingers to see Andy playing again, of course. It would be great for everybody, especially for him.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89821c796463265799d7a067237043a4cc39d068/0_0_689_413/master/689.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5dbc9ed7fc0b7aacf0c734bfc6842345","title":"facebook blocks bans users sharing guardian article showing aboriginal men in chains","story":"Social media site incorrectly removed historical photo on grounds of nudity, then for three days blocked and even banned users who posted link to articleFacebook has blocked and in some cases banned users who tried to share a  article about the site incorrectly blocking an image of Aboriginal men in chains.On Saturday,  Australia reported that Facebook had apologised for incorrectly preventing an Australian user from sharing the photo from the 1890s.The post was made in the context of the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, claiming there was no slavery in Australia, before he backed down on those comments a day later.The post was removed by Facebook and the man had his account restricted, with Facebook claiming the photo contained nudity and was in breach of the social media site’s community standards.The post was restored after  Australia asked Facebook whether the photo had been flagged in error. Facebook apologised to the user late on Friday and restored the post.A spokeswoman for Facebook said the photo was removed by the automated system in error.“We apologise for this mistake,” she said.However, dozens of  readers have since reported that when they tried to post a link to the article on their profiles they received message that the post violated the same community standards.The man who first posted the image to his profile was among those unable to share the news article.Several readers were even banned from posting on Facebook for up to 30 days for attempting to share the article.After further inquiries from  Australia Facebook appeared to allow the article to be posted on Monday afternoon.Facebook typically allows users to request a review of any takedowns. Between January and March it restored 613,000 pieces of content after 2.1m requests for review.Several people pointed out the disparity between Facebook quickly (and incorrectly) censoring content it believed to contain nudity and its reluctance to take action against Donald Trump’s inflammatory posts.The journalist and activist Cory Doctorow said on Twitter the incident showed Facebook could not moderate at scale, and that automated moderating was not evenly distributed, with some minority groups more likely to have their discussions censored.Doctorow argued Facebook should not be given additional duties in censoring content, as some have called for in recent weeks over Trump’s posts on Twitter and Facebook. Instead, he said, Facebook should be cut down to a “size, to a scale where communities can set and enforce norms”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43d97a0a725b676c14f126b062828022b2e5dc46/0_0_5242_3146/master/5242.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7ea2c3a39015e9d77145e525fb1f398","title":"uk children reliable broadband coronavirus lockdown education","story":"Coronavirus lockdown has ‘exposed digital ide’ with 700,000 unable to complete schoolwork The government must urgently ensure that more than 1 million children have reliable internet access at home or risk irreparable harm to their education, a cross-party group of MPs and former ministers has said.Tony Blair is among a number of prominent figures, including a Tory grandee, to back calls to equip 1.3 million children eligible for free school meals with a broadband connection and devices.A bill that will be presented to parliament this week says the coronavirus lockdown had “exposed the digital ide”, with about 700,000 children unable to complete any schoolwork because of a lack of internet at home.Siobhain McDonagh, the Labour MP behind the bill, said: “Those children who can’t access the same resources as their classmates will find themselves even further behind when they finally return. Some may never catch up.“This policy isn’t a silver bullet and can’t replace months of missed education. But it would make an immediate, tangible difference to families right across our country.”The proposal has won the support of more than 40 leading voices on education including Sir Michael Wilshaw, the former head of Ofsted, Robert Halfon, the Conservative chair of the Commons education select committee, and Philip Harris, a multimillionaire Tory grandee and sponsor of 13 academies.Voluntary groups in some of Britain’s most deprived areas have said that households without regular internet access were struggling to carry out essential tasks like pay bills, submit job applications and make universal credit inquiries since community centres and libraries closed in March.Among those hardest hit, the charities said, were about 700,000 children unable to complete schoolwork, and scores of elderly and disabled people who had been self-isolating – sometimes without any social contact – for more than three months.More than 5 million adults in the UK have either never used the internet or not used it in the past three months, equivalent to one in 10 of all adults in the country. While most non-internet users are of retirement age, 773,000 adults – equivalent to the population of Leeds – are under the age of 65.Polly Neate, chief executive of the homeless charity Shelter, has described the digital ide as “fast becoming a defining social justice issue of this crisis”.On Monday, Jangala, a charity that specialises in providing the internet to humanitarian disaster zones, is shifting its focus to the UK with a trial to connect about 60 people at a homeless shelter in Brighton.The charity, which was founded five years ago to work in the so-called Calais “Jungle” camp, said it was shifting its attention to Britain after being alerted to a huge need since the lockdown began in March.Rich Thanki, Jangala’s founder, said its UK trial would expand to other homeless shelters, schools and community centres around the country if successful. Its technology has been used in refugee camps across Europe and Africa, including in Calais where it was reputedly used by about 4,000 refugees a week, and the huge Kakuma camp in north-west Kenya, as well as in schools in Afghanistan and health clinics in Tanzania.Thanki said it was depressing that charities were having to step in to connect people in Britain, the world’s sixth-biggest economy. Nick Gardham, the chief executive of the Community Organisers charity, said some single-parent families were having to “choose between data and food” so their children could complete schoolwork online. He welcomed the lifting of broadband data caps, in a deal struck by the government and telecoms firms, but said that would only help people “in the club” and not those who could not afford a monthly tariff.His charity is urging the government to open up the broadband infrastructure provided by BT Openzone and Virgin so hotspots can be used free of charge during the pandemic. Its Operation Wifi campaign has been backed by several charities including Shelter and AgeUK."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f34dc2c38c0b88044a27e657902ee77a4d73d38e/0_36_1440_864/master/1440.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de8011fe7bdd92049c3151a4f632b2e4","title":"wetting yourself as an adult is the stuff of nightmares jenny eclair on bladder weakness","story":"The author and comedian lets loose on a wee problem many women are still too shy to talk about: accidental leakageThere are many reasons why you might wet yourself, but the best is laughter. I remember laughing so much at school that I frequently had to clutch my front bottom to stop the wee coming out. This was once triggered by the girl standing next to me farting very loudly during assembly – seriously, she let off as loudly as a trumpet at the precise moment we’d all finished singing a hymn. I still call this state of helpless incontinent hilarity “school assembly” laughter, and when I’m gigging, this is the Richter-scale level of laughter I’m after. I want to see every woman in the audience crossing her legs and clutching her front bottom.In real life, of course, wetting yourself as an adult is the stuff of nightmares, immediately you are the primary school pant wetter, the girl who had to borrow a pair of knickers from the lost property box, oh the shame of it.The fact is, losing control of your bladder can happen for all kinds of reasons, from simple timing issues, ie finding yourself locked out of the house and not being able to find your front door key, to suffering from various medical conditions that affect bladder control.For some reason, adult female incontinence still tends to be a taboo subject, although there probably isn’t a female comic who hasn’t gone through motherhood without making an “every time I cough, I wet my pants” stress-incontinence gag. A few years ago, during a Grumpy Old Women Live show, I performed some menopausal material about having a go on a kids’ trampoline: “Thirty seconds later, I’d pissed myself, broken both my ankles and one tit had escaped its moorings,” I joshed. And judging by the reaction of the audience, a great many of them had been there, done that and had to go home to change their underwear.In my experience, as long as we women are in control of the joke then we can laugh about it. It’s when other people (often younger and frequently male) take ownership of our physical frailties that it becomes embarrassing and somehow more shameful.For many women over 50, a little bit of leaking now and then is a fact of life – many of us haven’t got the toned pelvic floors we once had, thanks mostly to having big headed babies, and while some of us will never need to use pads, others feel safer with some protection, “just in case”.As a woman who has spent more than her fair share of time on the motorway sharing cars with other female performers, it has always surprised me how some women need to stop at a service station to use the loo every 20 minutes, while others manage a good five hundred miles without needing a wee.The fact is that all bladders are different, some resemble oversized leather footballs, while others, like my friend Nina’s (I’ve changed her name) are thimble sized and made from gossamer. Nina has never managed to make it to the interval of any show without climbing over everyone’s laps to get to the ladies.For a number of women, bladder training can be incredibly useful. A friend of mine swears blind that Princess Anne once informed her that “when one urinates, one must always sit for another 30 seconds after you think you’ve finished, as you inevitably haven’t, there’s usually a few drops more”. This is singly the best tip for anyone suffering from post-micturition dribble. Basically, slow down and give yourself time to do the job properly. Then “give your lettuce a good shake” as the old saying goes and remember to wipe from front to back, because we don’t want a yeast infection on top of everything else.Lord knows, women are born with complicated plumbing and as we get older some of our pipework can start to drip now and then, but you know what? Unless you’re wearing a gusset of galvanised steel, there’s no reason why anyone should know.Of course in the olden days women would rather die of shame than talk to anyone about bladder weakness, but one of the great things about being a 21st-century woman is that we know this kind of thing is common.So remember girls, incontinence is not a moral weakness, it’s not laziness, it’s a fact of life for millions, so whatever you do, keep laughing and don’t let a little bit of wee spoil your fun.As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

You may have heard of a motley bunch called the Windsors, but how about King Steve and Queen Sheila of Piel Island?This 50-acre island off Barrow-in-Furness in north-west England has it all: a castle, a pub and a monarchy. Piel has been ruled peacefully for more than 500 years, with ine sovereignty automatically bestowed on whoever’s running the Ship Inn. Each year, a new Knight of the Realm is chosen. This title is not acquired, as some believe, by simply having a pint poured over your head and getting a round in. According to Queen Sheila, “myself, the king and a few princesses select whoever’s done something outstanding for our community. The last person we knighted rescued 10 people from drowning. One year it was Harry H Corbett of Steptoe and Son fame: he was a frequent visitor and created great treasure hunts for the kids.”Six miles off the SuffolkEssex coast lies Sealand, formerly Roughs Tower, one of many sea forts built during the second world war and abandoned. In 1966, it was “claimed” by former pirate radio operator Roy Bates. He declared his new home an independent principality, with himself as Prince Roy and his wife Princess Joan. Three nautical miles outside England’s legally controlled waters, Sealand was answerable to no laws except its own. Soon it had its own flag, postage stamps and currency, all bearing the image of Princess Joan’s head.Over the decades Sealand has faced a major fire and an attempted coup, after which a German lawyer and Sealand passport holder was convicted of treason and given a life sentence. (They pardoned him after seven weeks.) In 1987, in accordance with new international laws, Britain extended its territorial waters to 12 nautical miles, drawing Sealand back into British waters. In response, Prince Roy extended Sealand’s territory by the same distance. If Britain owns Sealand, it in turn now owns Felixstowe, Harwich and the nice parts of Clacton-on-Sea. An unspoken stalemate remains.Visitors wishing to meet Piel Island’s royals will have to wait until 2021, when ferries are expected to restart and its medieval castle and pub reopen. Sealand remains rather impenetrable, isolated in the North Sea, and can only be visited by direct invitation. Its monarchy, however, is less selective than Piel’s in bestowing titles on its subjects. For a modest £29.99, “official” documents signed by current reigning monarch Prince Regent Michael guarantee instant ennoblement as Lord, Lady, Baron or Baroness of Sealand."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c07cbefffd251e04205afc72bc0888b74a85d88f/241_179_2098_1259/master/2098.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e0c03410b144ccdf52d6d6bfca3233a","title":"beyonce breonna taylor kentucky attorney general letter","story":"Message to Daniel Cameron highlights fact that officers involved in African American woman’s death are still employedBeyoncé has written to the attorney general of Kentucky to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old African American woman killed by plainclothes police officers while asleep in her Louisville home in the early hours of 13 March.The letter, posted on the recording artist’s website on Sunday afternoon, emphasizes the fact that the officers involved in the shooting are still employed and no arrests have been made.Taylor’s case has gained international prominence, amid global demonstrations against police brutality and systemic racism in the US.Public scrutiny of the case has led Louisville to ban the type of no-knock search warrant police used to enter Taylor’s home while she was sleeping and prompted the FBI to investigate. Activists are nonetheless determined to have the officers involved held responsible for Taylor’s death.The raid on Taylor’s apartment was part of a narcotics investigation. No drugs were found and Taylor was not a suspect in the case.Police opened fire after Taylor’s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, fired a shot because he believed he was witnessing a home invasion. The licensed gun owner hit an officer in the leg. Police responded by firing more than 20 times, killing Taylor.“Their incident report states that Ms Taylor suffered no injuries – yet we know she was shot at least eight times,” Beyoncé wrote.“The LMPD officers claim they announced themselves before forcing their way into Ms Taylor’s apartment – but her boyfriend who was with her, as well as several neighbors, all say that this is untrue.”Beyoncé also highlighted the toll the case has taken on Taylor’s family.“Ms Taylor’s family has not been able to take time to process and grieve,” she wrote. “Instead, they have been working tirelessly to rally the support of friends, their community, and the country to obtain justice for Breonna.”Beyoncé’s letter ended with three specific requests: charges against the three officers who opened fire (who have since been placed on administrative assignment) a commitment to transparency in the investigation and prosecution of the officers and an investigation into the Louisville police department response to the shooting.Beyoncé addressed racist violence against black and brown people last week, during a virtual commencement ceremony for 2020 graduates.“The killings of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and so many others have left us all broken,” she said.“It has left the entire country searching for answers. We’ve seen that our collective hearts, when put to positive action, could start the wheels of change. Real change has started with you, this new generation of high school and college graduates who we celebrate today.”The singer and mogul has long been a public advocate for the Black Lives Matter movement.In 2016, following the police shootings of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, she posted a stark message in all capital letters on her website and called on her legions of fans to demand action on police brutality.“We are sick and tired of the killings of young men and women in our communities,” she wrote then. “It is up to us to take a stand and demand that they ‘stop killing us’.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e1165a8aa0742cbd63f9aebc932cf1756167a26/0_70_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e3e83fd2cb9da75ba023e783b1590cd1","title":"coronavirus corona queens ny virus shook neighborhood","story":"The toll the coronavirus has taken on the Queens neighborhood in NYC tells a story of race, poverty and inequality in Americaby  Amanda Holpuch in New YorkEach morning, when Cathy Rojas logs in to teach her students in Corona, Queens, she faces a crowd of students more worried about their next meal than their US history homework.\u0026nbspRojas gives lectures about century-old race riots and labor movements to teenagers who have watched their families step out to work in a pandemic when most everyone else has been told to stay home.\u0026nbspTheir families have little choice.\u0026nbspCovid-19 hit Corona, a district in the borough of Queens New York, hard. The first, deadly, wave is over but the economic and health consequences will likely shake the neighborhood for years to come. The toll the coronavirus has taken on the coincidentally-named Corona tells a story of race, poverty and inequality in modern America.“What we have seen is that some students who were high flyers, who were excellent students throughout the school year, have actually stopped handing in work or have been handing in minimal work,” Rojas said.\u0026nbspThe high school is on the border of Corona, home to the New York City zip code which has seen the highest number of deaths in the city, 392 , and the highest number of identified coronavirus cases: 4,014. Roughly 10 miles from whiter and wealthier Manhattan neighborhoods where there were almost no deaths from the illness, Corona sits at the crux of the economic and health toll Covid-19 has had on undocumented, Latino immigrant communities across the US.Nationally, Latinos are overrepresented among people who have caught the virus in 43 of the 44 states that provide information on the group, according to research by demographer Rogelio Sáenz for Latino Decisions.\u0026nbspDemocratic representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who represents the district, said Covid-19 “poured gasoline” on the neighborhood’s existing problems. And under the most openly anti-immigrant president in modern history, government negligence have left people struggling to get food and financial aid in a pandemic which has killed more than 110,000 Americans.\u0026nbspCommunity groups are filling in the gaps as best they can on tight budgets.And teachers like Rojas have seen their jobs shift to also include linking students and their families with food and rent assistance, while exploring the minutiae of government policy. On calls about grades, Rojas asks parents if they know how to access healthcare depending on their immigration status. “Because that’s what my students need more than a history lesson,” she said.\u0026nbspThe daughter of Colombian immigrants, Rojas was raised in Queens. The 28-year-old is housing relatives who rented rooms in apartments with people who had Covid-19. “For all of April, every day I was saying rest in peace to somebody,” she said.\u0026nbspCorona is often grouped together with Elmhurst, its demographically similar neighbor to its west. The main hospital for both areas is Elmhurst hospital – which saw an “apocalyptic” surge in coronavirus patients in March. On a hazy, hot weekday in early June, the streets winding through the neighborhood were filled with small groups of runners and multi-generation families walking dogs and pushing strollers along the neighborhood’s grand, green tree-lined streets. The constant sound of sirens in the preceding months had finally been exchanged for a soundtrack of chirping birds.\u0026nbspBut coronavirus still casts its shadow over the neighborhood. For more than a half mile along 57th Avenue people lined up for Covid-19 testing, some had brought out chairs and sun umbrellas to endure the long wait. Similar lines are evident at food donation centers in the neighborhood, with one stretching more than 20 blocks.\u0026nbspThe economic crisis from Covid-19 has put hunger centre stage for residents, whose homes are also some of the most crowded in the city. When New York closed down, it was essential workers from neighborhoods such as Corona who kept things running. “Family members may have remained at home this entire time, but if they have even just one person in the household that needs to work, that one person can bring back the virus,” Albrecht said.Another worrying factor for the long-term is that Corona has the most cases of uncontrolled diabetes in the city and people with diabetes have higher rates of serious complications and death from Covid-19.\u0026nbsp“The fact of that matter is the neighborhood, especially of Corona, is quite limited in terms of the resources,” Albrecht said. “Whether or not it looks bad now, the point is because of the limited resources in these neighborhoods, they are going to be experiencing a disproportionate number of deaths from here on and forward in the future, especially if there are no resources deployed to these neighborhoods to help minimize the impact of Covid.”\u0026nbspAlbrecht, an assistant professor at the Columbia Mailman School of Public Health, said the early Covid-19 narrative was that it is “an equal opportunity virus and will impact all populations”. She said resources did not seem to be deployed with the special conditions in low-income or immigrant communities in mind.César has lived undocumented in the US since 1996 and learned a long time ago how to operate without the state’s support.  is withholding his last name because of his immigration status.\u0026nbspCésar said what his community needs most is clear communication and leadership from the government. Without it, he, his close friends and family have created their own support network.\u0026nbspIn weekly phone calls, or socially-distanced in-person conversations, he checks in to see what people need, then figures out how to get it.\u0026nbsp“Some places they have food, so what I do, is I share it in our community,” César said. “I call them, ‘what are you doing, what do you need?’ We try to help everyone.”\u0026nbspCovid-19 has impacted each facet of his life, he said. The 42-year-old hasn’t worked since 15 March, when the restaurant he worked at closed. His wife also lost her job and they have been draining their savings to help support their two daughters. “We have no money to pay the bills,” he said.\u0026nbspCésar said his inability to pay rent hasn’t been a problem yet because the building owner has been understanding.Legally, the owner doesn’t have a choice – New York City has a rent moratorium. But even before the pandemic, some landlords used tenants’ undocumented status to threaten them.Despite the myriad challenges, César was optimistic. “No matter what happened before or now, it is never too late to start again,” César said. “You gotta do what you gotta do.”Diana Moreno, worker rights director at the not-for-profit New Immigrant Community Empowerment (Nice), said many of their members were anxious to return to work, in part because of the international flow of people’s paychecks.\u0026nbspBefore the pandemic, Nice was focused on fighting worker exploitation and the lack of access to things such as affordable housing for members primarily in Corona, Elmhurst and Jackson Heights.\u0026nbspNow, it and other community groups have been thrust into the role of disaster relief agency. Volunteers described how they have scrambled to get food to hungry families and to navigate funeral arrangements for people born outside the US.\u0026nbsp“I didn’t think we would have to be in contact with the Mexican consulate to talk about repatriation of people’s remains,” Moreno said. “That is something that is now part of our jobs. ”\u0026nbspMoreno said the disaster-relief work she’s been doing eroded the progressive, immigrant-friendly reputation of New York City. “That has really for me, and I think a lot of people, lifted the veil of how the longstanding inequity is absolutely hitting our communities regardless of the particular reputation of a city or state,” Moreno said.\u0026nbspThat longstanding inequity is why the community group Centro Corona describes its current aid relief operations as a political movement, not charity. “It is building with people and letting them know their needs are valuable,” said Mauricio Piratova, a Centro Corona volunteer.\u0026nbspEarly on, Piratova said they realized an on-call doctor would be needed because so many people they work with don’t have health insurance. They’ve introduced activities like weekly, virtual movie nights for children and have moved their homework help programs to phone or video chat. They provide direct cash assistance for people facing eviction. And like at Nice, they are helping people transport remains from one country to another.\u0026nbsp“The city abandoned people of color and immigrant communities,” said Piratova. “And it shouldn’t be that non-profit organizations, little organizations with no funds, have to start doing things. It shouldn’t be the reality we are living. What we need is basically essentials, we need food available for everyone. If you’re telling people they can’t go out, they can’t go to work, just give them food.”Even with these efforts to help, people are slipping through the cracks.\u0026nbspHundreds of indigenous and minority languages are spoken in Corona and an analysis by the Endangered Language Alliance found the city’s most multilingual communities have been most affected by the virus.\u0026nbspCorona is one of the most linguistically erse parts of the city – in part because a wave of migration from Mexico, Guatemala, Ecuador and Peru to New York City in the 1990s included a substantial Indigenous population.\u0026nbspA study ELA published with the city health department in 2019 found that while indigenous Latin American communities were substantial and growing, they “often remain dispersed, invisible, and without access to services”.Don, a 51-year-old undocumented immigrant, like César is from an indigenous community in Pueblo, Mexico, and speaks Spanish as well as Nahuatl, which was spoken by the Aztecs.He said he’d heard about food assistance programs but the demand was so high that his family was not expecting any help soon.\u0026nbspHe has lived in Corona for about eight years and shares an apartment there with his three brothers and four young nieces and nephews. With each adult in the family’s hours cut or work shut down all together, the family is struggling to get food. “It is difficult because we can’t tell our kids if we are not going to eat or if we are going to eat,” Don said, through a translator.\u0026nbspThough he’s worried about getting sick, all he wants is more work.\u0026nbsp“Rent is not going to wait for us,” Don said. “That’s what’s more worrying for us.”\u0026nbspCuomo said in early May that there would be no additional Covid-19 assistance for undocumented immigrants without federal funding after California established its own $125m fund to aid undocumented people in the state. New York state’s department of health said it had opened two testing sites in Corona and other low-income, minority neighborhoods hard hit by the virus. It has also given $25m to food pantries and provides services at no cost in multiple languages. The pandemic has not halted the Trump administration’s attack on immigrant communities.\u0026nbspUndocumented people don’t qualify for unemployment aid or the federal stimulus checks and because of their status, their US citizen spouses are also denied the assistance. It took a month for authorities to clarify that immigrants seeking permanent residence wouldn’t be penalized if they sought treatment and testing for Covid-19. The government has ignored public health warnings to take people out of immigration detention, where they are held on civil immigration violations, not criminal charges. The spread of coronavirus in Guatemala has been directly tied to US deportation flights.This oppression isn’t lost on the students in Rojas’s US history class, who ended the school year learning about the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s.\u0026nbspRojas said one standout essay this semester drew parallels between the century-old Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire – which claimed the lives of 146 workers, mostly young women who had recently immigrated from Eastern Europe –\u0026nbspand the lack of PPE made available to essential workers. Another student connected race riots which followed the first world war to the New York Police Department’s over-policing of communities of color to enforce social distancing guidelines.Students managed this work from crowded apartments and while caring for younger brothers, sisters and cousins. Some had only just got internet access at the end of May. Rojas hopes in-person classes return in the fall, so she knows students have access to two meals per day and a safe learning environment.\u0026nbspRojas said: “Even as a historian, I did not expect this amount of neglect”\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7335c8af40c0db99992784384dc252fd2f9082d/0_422_4803_2884/master/4803.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=50db62e825dbc7ee4dc2f3b949b35efd","title":"tell us how has coronavirus affected people living in the north east","story":"We’d like to hear from people in the north-east and Yorkshire about the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreakWe would like to find out about the impact of coronavirus on you and your community.We’d like to hear from people in north-east England including the county of Yorkshire and we’re particularly interested finding out how the pandemic has affected your work and the local economy.

On Friday evening, an Indigenous man was shot dead by the RCMP in New Brunswick.But amid the growing anger, a number of prominent Canadians – premiers, columnists and the head of the RCMP – have cast doubt on the idea that racism is entrenched in the country’s institutions.“Thank God we’re different than the United States and we don’t have the systemic, deep roots they’ve had for years,” said the Ontario premier, Doug Ford, a view echoed by neighbouring the Quebec premier, François Legault.The RCMP commissioner, Brenda Lucki, told the Globe and Mail on Wednesday: “I think that if systemic racism is meaning that racism is entrenched in our policies and procedures, I would say that we don’t have systemic racism.” On Friday, Lucki clarified her position in a statement. “I did acknowledge that we, like others, have racism in our organization, but I did not say definitively that systemic racism exists in the RCMP. I should have.” Hours later, Rodney Levi of the Metepenagiag Mi’kmaq Nation was shot dead by RCMP officers.Activists and historians argue that before change can come, Canadians must first accept a tarnished history and the persistent structural inequities that it has bequeathed the nation.The numbers are clear: black and Indigenous peoples in Canada are disproportionately overrepresented in prisons and jails across the country. As students, they face harsher discipline in schools and are suspended at a higher rate than white students. In Toronto, the country’s largest city, black residents are 20 times more likely to be shot by police.On Thursday, Justin Trudeau contradicted the RCMP chief’s comments, saying it was clear systemic racism was present in the country’s federal police force.“As much as we admire and support the RCMP, we know we need to do better. It is not just the inidual examples we have seen, it’s the issues faced by Canadians of erse backgrounds over years, decades and generations,” the prime minister said.On Friday, Lucki clarified her position, saying: “I did acknowledge that we, like others, have racism in our organization, but I did not say definitively that systemic racism exists in the RCMP. I should have.”Some argue that Canada’s national police force is itself emblematic of racism.“The RCMP was not created to protect Indigenous people. It was created to protect white settlers from Indigenous folks – while suppressing our ceremonies and implementing laws that sought to decimate us,” said Brooks Arcand-Paul, a Cree lawyer and executive on the Indigenous Bar Association.“Even today, the police will always look at Indigenous people and Black folks in our territories as potentially requiring some kind of suppression.”Protesters have highlighted the case of Chantel Moore, 26, who was fatally shot last month by officers during a mental health “wellness check” and Regis Korchinski-Paquet, who fell to her death after police responded to a mental health emergency. But Arcand-Paul said her death was only the latest in a litany of cases where Indigenous lives are lost and families denied justice. He points to the case of Gerald Stanley, a white farmer who shot Colten Boushie, an indigenous man, in the head – but was acquitted by an all-white jury.“When we talk about systemic racism, we’re not just trying to lay the blame on the RCMP. It’s the entire structure that is causing continued violence against black and Indigenous bodies in this country,” said Arcand-Paul.Some police forces, including in Canada’s largest city, have acknowledged systemic racism exists and pledged to make change. Last week, Toronto’s police chief, Mark Saunders, knelt with protesters.But such actions have also raised skepticism among activists.“Police in Canada are trying to escape this moment of criticism by casting themselves compassionate forces that care about these issues. However, once you actually dig into the data, it shows this is not necessarily the case,” said Bashir Mohamed, a researcher and amateur historian whose work has highlighted the often-forgotten racist history of western Canada.“I think it’s by design that police forces want this information hidden, because then it makes them less responsible for actually acknowledging this is a problem.”Mohamed points to the practice of “carding” – Canada’s version of stop-and-frisk – in which police conduct street checks of residents with little or no cause. While agencies have defended the practice in the past, the limited available data shows the policy disproportionately affects racialized communities.Ford, the Ontario premier, quickly walked back his remarks, suggesting his comments had been taken out of context. “Of course there’s systemic racism in Ontario, there’s systemic racism across this country,” Ford said the next day.Quebec’s Legault also suggested there was “no system in place that discriminates” in the province – and said the province had not experienced slavery.But political leaders’ resistance to the idea that systemic racism exists within state institutions often comes from a poor understanding of the country’s past, says educator and historian Natasha Henry, president of the Ontario Black History Society.“It’s part of the Canadian national narrative of positioning ourselves in juxtaposition to the United States. That’s how we get this ‘exceptional Canada’ of being welcoming and warm – and not paying attention to our own parallel history of racial exclusion and the dispossession.”In addition to being factually inaccurate, this popular view speaks to a “refusal to take responsibility” for two centuries of slavery within the country’s history, says Henry.For generations, Canadian history has concentrated on the country’s position as the last stop on the Underground Railroad – a place which meant freedom for those who escaped slavery in the US. But the same narrative omits the experiences of thousands of enslaved people within Canada, says Henry.According to Henry’s research, the earliest record of African enslavement in colonial Canada was the sale of a young boy, named Olivier LeJeune in 1629.Slavery was formally ended in the British empire in 1834, including British North America, but legislation was repeatedly passed that would weaken anti-slavery laws in the years leading up to abolition.After emancipation, black people in Canada still faced segregation, and the looming threat of hate groups like the Ku Klux Klan.“You have to decide – are you going to accept all of Canada or none of Canada?” said Henry. “Because you can’t parcel out what you want. That’s not how history works.”Indigenous peoples were also enslaved by colonial powers – a reality often forgotten in the country’s school textbooks. And by the end of the 1700s, as many as 2,000 black people were enslaved in the Maritimes region. About 300 more people were enslaved in the area known as Lower Canada (what is now the province of Quebec) and as many as 700 in Upper Canada (Ontario).Others argue that Canada needs a more comprehensive history.“It’s important to incorporate anti-black racism into curricula, but also black history. Not just civil rights heroes, but also black artists,” said Mohamed. “This shows that my people existed in Canada. It shows that we have a long history of slavery over 200 years, but also have a long history of black arts and black culture.”Only in recent years has Canada grappled with the legacy of its residential schools – where many Indigenous students were sent against their will and experienced verbal, physical and sexual abuse – a period which schools have now started to teach.“At the end of the day, there’s going to be some difficult conversations. Because it’s important to acknowledge that our experiences aren’t just a fabricated story. They are lived realities,” said Arcand-Paul, who has been pulled over and questioned on multiple occasions by police.“And we’re not going to be able to achieve true understanding until, at last, we’re able to share our stories – frankly and candidly – to a receptive audience.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3fe7393b4c8e6b51169a898e6cc03f14cee48aea/0_327_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26855730ab144074d41b881ffe9d1e72","title":"hong kong activists urge uk to spell out extended visa offer","story":"NGO demands more details on Boris Johnson’s ‘vague and imprecise’ commitmentHong Kong democracy campaigners are pressing the Foreign Office to spell out how Boris Johnson’s “vague and imprecise commitment” will give a path to British citizenship to millions of residents.It came as Johnson wrote to seven former UK foreign secretaries saying he is trying to build a global groundswell of opposition to Chinese plans to impose a new security law in Hong Kong. Johnson said he is “working with a host of international grouping from the G7 and beyond to impress on them the gravity of the situation”. However, he said Britain could provide a lead without needing to form an international contact group, similar to that established during the Balkans crisis in the 1990s, as the seven former foreign secretaries had suggested.A fortnight ago Johnson responded to China’s plans by saying he was prepared to give extendable visas to millions of Hong Kong citizens entitled to hold a British national (overseas) passport. It is thought there are 350,000 BNO passport holders but a further 2 million are eligible to apply. BNO status is not available to those born after 1 July 1997, the point of Hong Kong’s handover to China. In the most explicit aspect of the offer, the government said those eligible for BNO status will have their visa-free entry period for the UK extended from six to 12 months. This might provide a pathway to citizenship, it added. They will have the ability to apply to work and study.But some Hong Kong campaigners are becoming alarmed at the lack of detail, fearing Johnson may be willing to give only the impression of a generous offer partly to deter China from pressing ahead with its security crackdown. China has angrily objected to the offer, seeing it as interference in another country’s internal affairs.A briefing for Hong Kong Watch, a UK NGO that promotes human rights in the territory, prepared by immigration lawyers, expressed concern the UK offer may be severely circumscribed, and what has been offered so far is “vague and imprecise”.The briefing said: “It is important now that proper attention is paid to the details so that the proposed changes to the immigration rules provide the lifeline that BNOs, and Hongkongers, need.”The briefing expressed concerns the Home Office could severely limit the offer by placing stringent financial requirements on those seeking entrance, or by limiting BNO passport holders access to public funds. There is also doubt as to whether BNO passport holders seeking to continue in higher education will have to pay international student fees, rather than the much lower home students fee.The briefing also points out that the government has not been clear on the rights of dependants. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has simply told the shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, in a written answer that he will consider the issue of BNO passport holders’ dependants.Alistair Carmichael, the Liberal Democrats foreign affairs spokesperson and chair of the all-party parliamentary group on Hong Kong, said: “We need to hear in detail, and with urgency, exactly what the government mean when they say that they will provide a ‘pathway to citizenship’ for British national (overseas) passport holders.“Will the government guarantee swift, easy passage for Hongkongers in need of a lifeline? What will the measures mean for young people born after 1997, vulnerable to a crackdown from Beijing? Clarity is urgently needed.”The report also asks how long BNO status holders will have to be continuously resident in the UK before being eligible to apply for indefinite leave to remain. Currently, for example, if a BNO status holder is in the UK as a student under tier 4, there is no direct route to ILR, and the BNO status holder student would require 10 years’ continuous residence before one might be eligible for ILR.There is also concern that the proposals exclude young people, specifically those born after 1997, even though they are more likely than any group to be the target of Chinese government repression since they have been most active in the demonstrations against Chinese rule.Carmichael said: “We need to hear in detail, and with urgency, exactly what the Government mean when they say that they will provide a “pathway to citizenship” for British national (overseas) passport holders.“Will the government guarantee swift, easy passage for Hongkongers in need of a lifeline? What will the measures mean for young people born after 1997, vulnerable to a crackdown from Beijing? Clarity is urgently needed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2f992d8b6c28b4a945117323b005ae4b645c7d6/0_5_6048_3630/master/6048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18b71752fc1133d96c55aee9d9cd3009","title":"who cautions against further lifting lockdown england","story":"Exclusive: senior official says contact tracing should be more effective before measures easedEngland’s coronavirus lockdown should not be further lifted until the government’s contact-tracing system has proven to be “robust and effective”, the World Health Organization has said after widespread criticism of the first results of the new tracking operation.As shops across England prepared to reopen, and people were encouraged by the government to come out of their homes and on to the high street, Dr Hans Kluge, the WHO’s director for Europe, cautioned that the UK remained in a “very active phase of the pandemic”.His remarks came as ministers confirmed a review of the 2-metre distancing rule, with the government coming under pressure from business leaders, Tory backbenchers and rightwing media to further ease the lockdown. Boris Johnson said on Sunday that the falling numbers of coronavirus cases has given the government “more margin for manoeuvre” in easing the 2-metre physical distancing rule.In response to data showing the government had failed to trace the contacts of a third of those testing positive in the first week of the new system, Kluge warned in an interview with the  against rushing into reopening the economy.The WHO official said the tracking in England of about 31,000 contacts of 8,000 infected people was encouraging and a cause for congratulations. But he added that Downing Street needed to be convinced it could “aggressively” track infections as the prime minister looks to reopen the economy.As of Saturday there were 41,662 deaths in the UK – a daily increase of 1,425 confirmed cases and 181 deaths.Governments who locked down early in the pandemic, in the face of public criticism, had recorded fewer deaths during the pandemic, Kluge said, but European leaders would now be judged on their management of their exit from the restrictions.“We know that early lockdowns saved lives and bought some time for the health system to be ready,” Kluge said when asked about the British government’s record. “But I would rather than instead of looking to the past, jump to the future and say that the question of lifting the lockdown is as important as going to the lockdown. The key words here are to do it gradually. Do it carefully.On Thursday, Dido Harding, the chair of the NHS test-and-trace service, admitted that the UK’s scheme – billed as “world-beating” by Boris Johnson – would need to improve.Of the 8,117 positive cases referred to contact tracers, 5,407 had been willing to hand over the names and phone numbers of people they had met in the previous two days. Despite the stumbling start and the lack of a promised coronavirus app slated for launch by the end of May, Johnson is under growing pressure from Conservative backbenchers to push on with lifting the lockdown amid grim forecasts of mass unemployment.“We know that the situation in the UK is still being taken very seriously,” Kluge said. “But we also know that it is a balance between three factors: population health, economic and social, and the third is the wellbeing of the people. So whatever the country decides: be ready. It is not over. And whatever decision you make, please make sure it is based on public health and epidemiological observations.”Kluge said international comparisons were difficult but that the pandemic had shown the importance of governments being able to communicate effectively with the public to convince them of the necessity of respecting the unprecedented nature of the requests being made.Noting that Downing Street had delayed going into lockdown in early March for fear that the population would fail to follow the rules with rigour as the restrictions dragged on, Kluge said: “What is the lesson there? Keep people engaged.”Kluge said he could understand the government’s caution despite calls from senior Conservatives, including the former leader, Iain Duncan Smith, for a rethink on the 2-metre guidance. Johnson has ordered a review of the policy to be completed by July.“Every country has their own context, based on a risk assessment. In the UK I would say this is a very active phase in the pandemic so, more let’s say, careful,” he said. “There is no right or wrong. Of course, ideally, it would be everywhere the same but countries are doing this based on their own risk assessment …“Whether it’s one or two metre is less important than the fact that people will adhere to the measures, to the physical distancing, to the handwashing, to the respiratory hygiene, and that they understand that it’s not over. This is the key issue.”With Europeans eyeing up the potential of summer holidays, Kluge said Europe as a whole could not be complacent, with infection rates increasing in the past fortnight in Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and North Macedonia. The Europe region within Kluge’s remit is made up of 53 countries: the UK, the member states of the EU, and the countries of central and eastern Europe including Turkey and Russia.The reopening of schools had led to some local flare-ups in Europe that were swiftly contained, Kluge said, and the continent could face a deadly combination of a second wave of coronavirus and an influenza pandemic in the autumn.“We call it when ‘Covid will meet the flu’,” Kluge said. “The issue is that several epidemics can go together and how do you have policies in place? We put an expert group together to look at that because no one has the ideal answer.”Kluge said it would be crucial for governments to distribute the influenza vaccine among the groups most vulnerable to Covid-19: older people, men, and generally people with underlying conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and renal disease.There are 135 potential vaccine candidates for Covid-19, of which 10 are in clinical trial. Kluge said it “may well take a year, a year and a half now” before a vaccine could be ready. “My understanding is that it’s still a bit early in the day. Of course one thing is efficacy, but then the other one is safety … We are hopeful and there’s a lot of effort. But, until that moment, let’s implement what we know works.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8914dbaaf1a13e319fc85c5a4665a27f9ad9eb01/0_100_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1d0f675e7244c3693cfb574d28daccb","title":"france turning page as schools borders and workplaces reopen emmanuel macron coronavirus","story":"President announces mandatory return to class and plans for economic recoveryEmmanuel Macron has announced that France is open and back in business.In his fourth televised address to the nation since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, the French president said the country was “turning the page on the first act of the crisis that we have gone through”.“The fight against the epidemic is not over, but I am happy that we have won this first battle against the virus,” he said.Macron opened by saying the whole of France, except for the overseas departments of Mayotte and French Guiana, were “turning green”, meaning restaurants, bars and cafes in the Paris area can now fully open, and that all schoolchildren except for those in lycées (upper high schools) will be expected to return to class from next Monday.With the academic year due to end for the two-month summer holiday at the beginning of July, the announcement that the return to class is obligatory has come as a surprise to many parents and headteachers in areas where secondary school classes are currently closed.Macron also announced France’s Schengen borders would be open as from Monday and its non-EU borders from 1 July.“We can be proud of what we have done in our country. Of course this challenge has also revealed weaknesses, fragilities, our dependence on other continents to procure certain products, our cumbersome organisation, our social and territorial inequalities … I would like us to learn all the lessons from what we have been through,” Macron said during the 20-minute address.He said the country was facing an economic crisis, but stated while coronavirus easing measures had cost the country €500bn, there would be no tax rises. He suggested plans for France’s economic reconstruction would include encouraging firms to relocate back to France and plans for economic “independence” that he would announce next month.At EU level, the president called for the consolidation of an “economically independent Europe” to take on the US and China.Macron made no direct reference to the widespread but largely peaceful anti-racism and anti-police violence protests in France at the weekend, sparked by the police killing of George Floyd in America, but said “racism, anti-semitism and discrimination are unacceptable”.However, he warned there would be no rewriting of French history.“I will be very clear tonight, compatriots. The republic will not erase any name, any trace of its history. It will forget none of its artworks. It will tear down no statues,” Macron said.He also issued a clear message of support for the police forces, saying they “take daily risks and deserve the support of those in power and the gratitude of the nation”.The address received a mixed response in the French media. Libération’s front page headline read: “Macron congratulates Macron”, while Le Monde similarly accused Macron of giving himself a “certificate of satisfaction over his handling of the crisis”. The centre-right paper Le Figaro chose to lead on Macron calling the French to return “fully” to work."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d455f76e94b5afdf84f28b663a40f26ba3a0d4d/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33ab1732fd4f11e937edc417e19e1934","title":"monday briefing coronavirus flares up in beijing","story":"Flare-up centres on big Xinfadi food market … trailblazing Philippines editor guilty of ‘cyber-libel’… and helping children live their gender identity Hello, Warren Murray popping up on your screen with the news this Monday morning.A coronavirus lockdown is being reimposed across parts of Beijing because of a “cluster” centred on the large Xinfadi food market that has resulted in dozens of cases. “Beijing has entered an extraordinary period,” city spokesman Xu Hejian told a news conference. Authorities have said today that “multiple cases” were also found at the Yuquandong market in the Beijing district of Haidian, all linked to the Xinfadi market. Ten residential communities nearby have been closed while residents were put under home quarantine and ordered to be tested. At least 10 Chinese cities have urged residents not to travel to the capital and report to authorities if they have done so recently.In Britain, retailers are appealing to customers to support their local shops as thousands of stores reopen in England today. The lockdown has cost non-food retailers £1.7bn a week in lost sales, according to the Office for National Statistics. “It’s really important people go back to using their high street,” said Gary Grant, owner of toy chain The Entertainer. “We employ local people in local towns and if I want to hold on to my staff I need turnover.”For the latest updates your best bet is to monitor our global live blog.There’s more in our Coronavirus Extra section further down … and here’s where you can find all our coverage of the outbreak – from breaking news to factchecks and advice.Ressa guilty of ‘cyber-libel’ – A Philippines court has convicted of libel Maria Ressa, a journalist who has scrutinised the extrajudicial killings and abuses of President Rodrigo Duterte’s administration. The verdict could lead to seven years in prison and is likely to be viewed as a major setback for democratic rights in the country. Rappler, one of the Philippines’ most influential news websites, its editor Ressa, and former researcher and writer Reynaldo Santos Jr were accused of cyber-libel in 2017 over a five-year-old story about a businessman.The case is widely seen as an attempt to muzzle the media in the Philippines – Duterte stated in 2016: “Just because you’re a journalist, you are not exempted from assassination.” Journalists have been targeted through judicial harassment, online campaigns waged by pro-Duterte troll armies, and violence.Johnson ‘victimisation’ remark jars – Boris Johnson has responded to Black Lives Matter protests by announcing a government commission on racial inequalities. But he immediately prompted criticism over his choice of language by saying he wanted to end “the sense of victimisation”. Priti Patel has been urged to impose an emergency ban on all protests following the “mindless hooliganism” and “utterly shocking” violence of far-right activists against police in London. Ken Marsh, chair of the politan Police Federation, said: “We’re in the middle of a Covid-19 pandemic. It is unlawful what is taking place under the Covid legislation. Ban them.” Patel said police would need to apply for a ban – she repeated that the protests “are illegal and are putting the public at risk” and people should not attend.Croatian border brutality – EU officials have been accused of an “outrageous cover-up” after withholding evidence of a failure by Croatia’s government to supervise police accused of robbing, abusing and humiliating migrants at its borders. European commission emails seen by the  reveal officials were fearful of a backlash when deciding against full disclosure of Croatia’s lack of commitment to EU-funded monitoring. Supervision of border officers was a condition for a larger grant of EU funds to Croatia. There have been multiple allegations of violent pushbacks of migrants and refugees, including an incident in which a migrant was shot. Croatia is seeking to enter the EU’s passport-free Schengen zone – a move that requires compliance with European human rights standards at borders.Murder the US military would forget – US prosecutors have failed to include one of WikiLeaks’ most shocking video revelations in the indictment against Julian Assange, a move that has brought accusations the US doesn’t want its “war crimes” exposed in public.Former Reuters journalist Dean Yates was in charge of the bureau in Baghdad when his Iraqi colleagues Namir Noor-Eldeen and Saeed Chmagh were machine-gunned by a US Apache helicopter gunship. A WikiLeaks video called Collateral Murder later showed how it all unfolded. Yates tells his side of the story to Paul Daley.Payout to drone arrest couple – Paul and Elaine Gait, who were detained during the Gatwick airport drone chaos in December 2018, are to be paid £200,000 in compensation and legal costs by Sussex police. Drone sightings near the runways over three days of the Christmas period forced the airport to close for 30 hours, disrupting 1,000 flights and more than 140,000 passengers. The Gaits were arrested in an armed police raid and held for 36 hours before being released without charge. They sued for wrongful arrest. The investigation of the drone incidents has cost £790,000. No one has ever been charged.Employers across Britain face a deadline this week to make job cuts as the furlough scheme is gradually wound down from August. The all-party Treasury select committee says large numbers of people have not benefited from schemes to help salaried employees and the self-employed. They are calling on Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, to address the gaps in the coronavirus job retention and self-employment support schemes through which people including the newly employed or newly self-employed and freelancers have fallen.China has beaten the US in the battle for world opinion over the handling of coronavirus, according to new polling, with only three countries – Taiwan, the US and South Korea – believing the United States has dealt with the pandemic better than its superpower rival.Laura Barton has always known that she wanted to have children.

On the other are the vast majority of mental health professionals who study gender dysphoria insisting that affirming a child in whatever way they express their gender is beneficial to their mental health.At the centre are the lives of trans and gender-variant kids who need a safe family home and a supportive school environment – regardless of what others think. In New York, the Gender and Family Project advises parents how to support their children’s gender expression.Tennis is fighting for survival, according to Feliciano López, and the veteran Spaniard says players, rich and struggling, will have to accept “significant” cuts in prize money to save their sport. An emotional Novak Djokovic broke down in tears in front of a 4,000-strong crowd at his own tennis tournament after his win against Alexander Zverev sent a fellow Serb, Filip Krajinovic, into the final. Gary Neville has warned football still needs to take a giant leap forward to tackle “the distress and discrimination that we don’t see” – and urged the game to deliver real structural change and not just lofty words and campaigns against racism.Alice Dearing, Britain’s best open water swimmer, has told the  of her experiences of racism and how she is breaking barriers for black people to take up the sport.

The conference is likely to be a rallying point for pro-democracy activists as China and the US enter an ever more explicit ideological contest.The 53-country survey of 120,000 people by the German polling firm Dalia Research and the Alliance of Democracies Foundation, an organisation headed by the former Nato secretary general Anders Fogh Rasmussen, reveals deep dissatisfaction with US leadership.EU foreign ministers will meet on Monday to discuss how far to take a more sceptical approach to China. There is a reluctance to enlist in an all-out trade war, and concern that the US is due to implement a law that will require companies to certify that their entire global supply chain – not just the part of the business that sells to the US government – is devoid of equipment from Huawei, the telecoms company ZTE corps, and other Chinese companies.Rasmussen, a former Danish prime minister, said: “Covid-19 is also a litmus test for democracy. Democracy is still alive in the hearts and minds of people across the world, but this study highlights a disconnect between citizens and their governments. It should act as a wake-up call to democratic leaders that people want more democracy and freedom after Covid-19.”Half of Americans and just over half of French, Italians and Belgians say their country is democratic. Every country surveyed shows a “democratic deficit” – a gap between the percentage who feel democracy is important and those who feel they live in a democratic countryThe Alliance of Democracies Foundation has previously conducted research on the extent of election meddling by authoritarian countries making recommendations on how social media companies could do more to shut down bots run by foreign governments.The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, on Sunday ruled out a transatlantic alliance against China a day before talks with Pompeo, and called for a “big, positive agenda for EU-China cooperation”.The meeting between Pompeo and EU foreign ministers is expected to focus on China and “disinformation”, and will be followed in a week’s time by the first EU-China summit under the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and European council president, Charles Michel. The two EU chiefs will meet the Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, with the discussions expected to focus on market access.Borrell said the EU would not pick a side in the US-China conflict. “Amid US-China tensions as the main axis of global politics, the pressure to ‘choose sides’ is increasing,” he said. “We as Europeans have to do it ‘my way’, with all the challenges this brings.”He also admitted there were internal isions within the EU with some wishing to follow a policy of equidistance between China and Europe, and others urging Europe to align with the US.He said the transatlantic relationship remained vital for Europe – “the values we share form its bedrock” – but that it was strained by the Trump administration taking “unilateral decisions with which we do not always agree”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e995f2ab2e635127181319e0817f0b43b8eddd6a/513_1529_2644_1587/master/2644.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=990e6bad8c163a7e3b2bdb6908166613","title":"color is not a new york black lives matter street art in pictures","story":"Across the US, artists have responded to the death of George Floyd and the ensuing protests with impactful and urgent work.

I’m Andrew Sparrow, joining the blog for the day.Here is the agenda with what’s coming up.12.30pm: The Scottish and Welsh governments are due to hold their daily coronavirus briefings.1.30pm: Boris Johnson holds a video meeting with Ursula von der Leyen, the European commission president, to discuss the Brexit talks.2.30pm: The permanent secretaries at housing, business, the Treasury and the Cabinet Office give evidence to the Commons public accounts committee about the government’s response to coronavirus.2.30pm: Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, takes questions in the Commons.3pm: Prof Sir John Bell, regius professor of medicine at Oxfford University, is among the academics and medical professionals giving evidence to the Lords science and technology committee on the immunology and pathophysiology of coronavirus.3pm: The Rev Jesse Jackson addresses a Black Lives Matter webinar organised by the National Education Union.4pm: Local government and Joint Biosecurity Centre officials give evidence to the Commons communities committee on track and trace.Long queues have been seen outside - of course - Primark stores across England, as people queued for essential items such as £1.50 hoop earrings and Friends-branded PJs which they have been desperate for during lockdown. (This pic taken by Elle May Rice in Liverpool for the Liverpool Echo)There were lines of dozens of people at branches of the budget clothes store in Birmingham, Derby, Liverpool and Nottingham.The shadow justice secretary, David Lammy, eviscerated Boris Johnson’s decision to set up a commission on race and ethnic disparities on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme this morning. He accused the government of writing its commission on race and ethnic disparities “on the back of a fag packet” to “assuage the Black Lives Matter protest”.You can understand why it feels like, yet again in the UK, we want figures, data - but we don’t want action.Black people aren’t playing victim, as Boris indicates, they are protesting precisely because the time for review is over and the time for action is now.Lammy slammed Johnson’s decision to announce the commission in the Daily , which is behind a paywall. I don’t know why he’s announced a commission behind a paywall, in the , buried in the middle of yet another article about Churchill.If he was serious, why are there no details about how it will be staffed, its remit, its terms of reference, its timetable? That’s the question.It’s because this was written on the back of a fag packet yesterday to assuage the Black Lives Matter protest. Get on with the action, legislate, move - you’re in government, do something.BP has told shareholders that it could write down the value of its assets by up to $17.5bn (£14bn) as it reduced its long-term forecast for oil prices and warned that the Covid-19 pandemic would have a lasting impact on the global economy.The energy giant slashed its forecast for Brent crude oil prices to $55 a barrel from $75 a barrel and said the coronavirus crisis would speed up the shift to a lower-carbon economy.The company estimates that this will result in write-offs of $13bn to $17.5bn, which will drag down its financial results in the second quarter. It is also reviewing whether to develop some of its potential oilfields.Read the full story here:The District Councils’ Network has put out guidance, urging the public to take extra care when visiting high streets and town centres to avoid a second spike in coronavirus infection.The government recently announced £20m for district councils to lead the local effort to safeguarding high streets following the pandemic, and councils are urging the public to follow safety guidance.They say they are trying to make things safer by:• Helping marshal movements with floor markings and signage.• Carrying out more frequent street cleaning, providing hand-sanitiser posts, adapting public seating and conveniences.• Creating more pedestrianised spaces and streets.• Adapting indoor and outdoor market spaces to allow traders to trade safely.• Deploying council staff or volunteers to provide help and advice.They say councils are planning how to save the high street, looking at measures including reshaping a mixed offer of retail, culture, entertainment and housing.Cllr Mark Crane, DCN lead member for stronger economies, said:We will be delighted to see visitors return to our high streets, which we’re working hard to reshape so that shops and businesses get the boost they desperately need, but without compromising public health.But we need members of the public to respect these efforts, and take extra care when visiting their local high streets and town centres during this challenging period.Small business minister Paul Scully has encouraged people to go to the shops as many reopen for the first time since the start of lockdown.Speaking to BBC Breakfast on Monday, he said: The high street is going to be a different place to what it was before, with the one-way systems, with the hand sanitisers, and with people not trying clothes on in the same way.But, nonetheless, it is safe to shop. I would encourage people to be sensible, work with the people in the shop but do go out and shop, and start opening our economy gradually and carefully.”He added the government would keep the two-metre rule “under review”.Scully was asked how the government would respond to footballer Marcus Rashford’s plea to extend the current food voucher scheme for children normally reliant on school meals throughout the summer holidays. Scully described Manchester United player Rashford, 22, who has raised £20m for vulnerable children in the UK with the charity FareShare since the start of lockdown, as an “inspirational figure”.What we’ve done is put £9m into summer activities, which clearly if people with children are at these activities they will get fed within that as well.We’re also bringing in £63m worth of support to local authorities, for hardship funds, to make sure that people who do struggle can actually get access to a decent meal.The Chartered Institute of Marketing has warned that the UK is entering into an extremely challenging time for business and calls for customers to give brands “the benefit of the doubt”.Chris Daly, CEO, Chartered Institute of Marketing said:Every business is having to think extremely carefully about how it uses its marketing budget in the coming weeks and months balancing efforts to promote sales and footfall, with keeping customers safe and well informed. Importantly, communicating to customers over the coming weeks is going to require businesses to strike a very fine balance and not everyone is going to get it right. Some businesses have been vilified in recent weeks, especially at the start of the Covid-19 crisis, and we hope that government and consumers will be more understanding as businesses face up to this difficult situation. We will not defend irresponsible or unprofessional marketing, but it is important that as well as celebrating the success stories, we give businesses the benefit of the doubt as they seek to bring back their customers and restart the British economy.This letter from Manchester United footballer Marcus Rashford is incredibly powerful. Today is the first day that it will be mandatory for people travelling on public transport in England to wear a face covering over their nose and mouth for the entirety of any journeys made. The mayor of London is asking all Londoners to wear a face covering where they can’t keep a safe distance (2 metres) from others.

Don’t even think about it and just accept that it will be mixed. Photograph: Frank MillerThe  In the weeks ahead, Irish people will be holidaying at home in greater numbers than at any point since the 1970s when shorts were short and hair was permed. As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and the shutting of borders and the grounding of virtually all flights in and out of Ireland, people with plans to travel overseas have had to look closer to home. With that in mind we thought it might be useful to try and conjure up some useful tips for holidaying at home for those people who might not have done it in decades.1. Why does it always rain on me?: Irish people tend to be just a little obsessed by the weather. We talk about it with enthusiasm and flair and worry about it endlessly. Who amongst us hasn’t spent hours on a grey summer’s day staring at impenetrable clouds wondering if that is a break in the gloom we can see and a sliver of blue sky far, far away. Bad weather and the fear of it is one of the main reasons we started leaving this country in our droves in the 1980s and 1990s when overseas travel became the norm rather than the exception. But we need to recalibrate our national psyche and change our mindset this year if we are to get the best out of whatever the gods throw at us. We need to be more like the Germans and the French and the Americans who come here and love the weather.So, don’t waste your holiday and the run-up praying for good weather. Don’t even think about it and just accept that it will be mixed. It won’t be horrendous, there are not that that many days in the summer when it rains non-stop, but nor will it be amazing. Whatever it is you will still be able to make the best of it.2. Appy talk: Staying with the weather, the days of staring at the sky wondering if the end is nigh for the rain have long since been confined to the dustbin of history. The weather app on your phone will be your friend this summer. It will give you real-time hour by hour information on the weather wherever you are in the country. Treat it like your bible. If it tells you that between 2pm and 4pm, the sun will shine or at least the clouds will part briefly, plan your time at the beach or in the great outdoors around that. If your phone tells you it will be nicer in the morning than in the evening, get up earlier and if it is due to be nicer in the evening than in the morning allowing yourself a lie in. And yes, we do appreciate that this makes it sound very much like we are obsessing about the weather. Old habits and all that.3. Wet, wet wet: When Pricewatch were a lad, beach days were all about weirdly tight and uncomfortable nylon action mad speedos and luridly coloured windbreakers to shield our sandwiches from the savage bite of the swirling sands. It doesn’t have to be like that and you can have a day of fun at the beach and in the water without wishing you were far away. Will the water be lovely and warm? Probably not. Will you spend hours playing in the sea? Not without getting hypothermia. Is a bracing dip in the wild Atlantic waves a wonderfully invigorating way to spend a bitesize portions of your summer? It absolutely is. And Ireland has come a long way since the 70s. Today we have wet suits. You can pick up cheap ones in supermarkets – we understand that Aldi will be selling them in the weeks ahead – and in dedicated outdoorsy shops. While spending €300 on four for an average sized family may seem like a lot, if they allow you to defy the weather gods and frolic in the waves for hours over the course of a fortnight’s holiday it will be money well spent.4. Indoor amusements: Before you leave do all the research you need into the indoor fun you can have wherever you are going. While the indoor options are somewhat limited this year for obvious reasons, there are things you will be able to do if you have to deal with a miserable day. There will be museums, libraries and heritage centres to visit. There might even be the odd play centre open too. The trick is to work out your options before you leave home so you can have a few things to hand when you wake up to sheets of rain hammering the roof of your caravan or hotel room. By being a bit organised in the days before you leave you will help you to avoid the “Jaysus, what on earth are we going to do now,” moment.5. Play schools: Don’t just pack the car with clothes and beachy stuff. Bring board games, jig saws and playing cards. If you were on holidays overseas you would most likely not be watching the telly of an evening so there is absolutely no reason to do so while on holidays at home. If you have children over eight and have yet to teach them the joys of poker, Blackjack or 25, then now is the time. They will thank you for it when they are older and winning money off their friends at late night poker schools or taking the bank to the cleaners in Vegas.6. Streams of gold: Okay, so, we know we said that a summer holiday was no time to be watching the television, but that does not mean you have to spend your staycation living like an Amish. Decide on maybe 10 movies that you would be happy to watch over the course of your holiday. Bring a laptop or tablet, hook it up to the TV wherever you are staying and then watch them at your leisure. You might want to download them if you are concerned that the quality of the broadband wherever you end up is not up to scratch. Carefully chosen movies are better than mindlessly watching repeats of Reeling in the Years. And we love Reeling in the years.7. Make rules: There is absolutely no point in banning children from using their devices while they are on their holiday, particularly if you are not prepared to live under the same rules. But do set limits on how and when devices can be used. And then stick to them. This is good for both adults and for children. Just because you are on holiday at home does not mean that you have to be checking your phone every five minutes or answering work emails. There will be times while you are on leave that you might not feel like you are on leave given the familiarity of the surroundings but your are, so take the time off.8. Drive: There was nothing that would fill the child Pricewatch’s heart with dread more than an adult uttering the phrase “Let’s go for a drive”. In this scenario, the adults would sit in the front of the car – usually chain smoking with the window’s rolled up against the rain – while the children would rattle around the back with not so much as a single seat belt between them. It was as foul smelling as it was boring. However, we have it on very good account from a colleague who routinely goes on summer holidays in Ireland that drives are fun things to do with children. “Just never describe it to them as a ‘drive’,” this colleague warned us. “It’s a trip to some alluring destination, a mysterious beach, the best ice cream parlour in the west.” That sounds like a fine idea to us.9. Eat: Take advantage of where you are by exploring all the best food the region has to offer. It might be something simple like new potatoes or strawberries bought off the side of the road in Wexford or lobster pushed straight from the coastal waters off the coast of Sligo. The key thing is to treat yourself this year and, if you can, spend more than you might while at home. You are on holiday at home but that does not mean you have to shop in Aldi or Lidl. By eating the nicest of food you can find from local suppliers you will not only be rewarding yourself, you will be making life a little bit easier for local retailers and food producers who have been absolutely hammered by the pandemic. And while we are on the topic of food, make picnics and include crisps in every sandwich. It is cheap and it is fun.10. Wear sunblock: The routine for a sun holiday tends to involve lathering everyone in sun cream before the day gets going. But we tend to be a bit more relaxed about it when holidaying at home for obvious reasons. But the sun that burns us when we are on a beach on the Costa Brave is the same sun that can burn us while we are on a beach in Connemara. And we have said this before and we will say it again, there is no need to get hung up on fancy brands of sun cream either. Most supermarkets stock their own creams and oils for a fraction of the price you’ll pay elsewhere and according to consumer magazine Which? – they’re just as good as all the rest.11. Crosstown traffic: When the sun shines in Ireland many of us will decide to take a spontaneous trip to the beach. That is all fine and dandy until you find yourself watching the day pass you by while you are stuck in traffic. So, no matter what part of the country you find yourself in the weeks ahead, before you race off to the beach, take a moment to look at Google Maps. You won’t be looking for directions – you will probably be able to make your way to the local beaches unaided – but what you are looking for is traffic congestion. The software uses some class of sorcery to establish how bad the traffic is on whatever route you fancy in real time. A 90 second look may save you spending two hours of a rare sunny day stuck in traffic jams swearing at fellow drivers and shouting at your children.12. The tide is high, or is it?: Oh, and in case you forget – like Pricewatch has done far too often – unlike the Mediterranean, the waters around Ireland are tidal and can be dramatically so. So before you race off to the beach for a bracing dip, check where the water’s edge is likely to be. The Irish Tides and Tidal Ireland apps will be able to help you out.13. Keep it fun: “Are we there yet?” “I’m thirsty.” “I need to go to the toilet.” “Juliette scratched me.” “I can’t find my Elsa doll.” Kids are brilliant but cross-country journeys can be long and trying. If you’re taking a road trip with smallies plan some games in advance so you’re not left thinking up things on the fly. Here are three that might work. There is I Spy (obvs) - top tip: ban things that were outside the car for half a second as you sped along a motorway. Road Trip Bingo is always a winner but it takes prep. Print out bespoke bingo cards and give each player a pencil. When they see something on their card, they scratch it out. The more items you have on the card the less time they have to fight. With I’m Going on a Picnic, the first player says, “I’m going on a picnic and I’m bringing . . . an apple” or something else that begins with A. The second player repeats what the first person said, but adds something that begins with B. And on it goes. Make the prizes substantial to keep interest levels high.14. Book smarts: If you can’t think of any games to play or if the level of interest is low, download some audio books and everything will be golden. A David Walliams book read by the author himself or a Harry Potter read by Stephen Fry will see many journeys fly by. If you have older people in a car and want something hilarious to listen to, we couldn’t recommend the books of David Sedaris highly enough.15. Chipper chips: Do a bit of research and find the best chipper wherever you are going. Chipper chips, bread, butter and a cup of tea is a summer meal sorted. If you are really fancy you can throw in some mushy peas some battered cod and maybe even a pint of stout. You won’t get the like of it anywhere but home."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Irish Wind Energy Association: policy decisions key to pricingHomeowners want to radically improve their homes, says Tipperary Energy AgencyStudents would only be able to attend one or two days a week if rule not changed, says Minister"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Avian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climateTime to restore meadows once full of insects and nectar in summer and spires of seeds in winterA new report shows no let-up in the loss of wildlife in Northern Ireland"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: iStockA “large increase” in rats leaving the sewers and infesting city streets and suburbs has emerged during the coronavirus pandemic as pest control teams have been curtailed, Dublin City Council has said.Rats, described by one councillor as big enough to “put a saddle on”, are eating through brickwork and circumventing traps to infest homes, gardens and even cars.Recent warm weather, fewer people on the streets and increased illegal dumping had encouraged more rats into the open, the council said. However its ability to tackle infestations had been reduced as the Health Service Executive (HSE)pest control services were restricted during the pandemic.Sinn Féin councillor Daniel Céitinn said south inner city residential areas around York Street, Montague Court and Bishop Street were becoming overrun with rats.“They are nesting in broken drains and seem to be becoming more aggressive in their search for food. They’re also getting into cars and ruining the engines,” he said. “I understand resources are scare at the moment , but not dealing with this is creating another health emergency.”SuburbsInfestations were multiplying in the suburbs too. Fianna Fáil’s Racheal Batten said there were particular problems in estates around Beaumont. Reduced activity during Covid-19 restrictions “seems to have given them a better chance to breed”, she said.Independent councillor Noeleen Reilly said there were similar problems in Ballymun. “I’ve never seen illegal dumping as bad, and that is definitely leading to an increase in rats.”The council said there had been “a large increase in the number of rats coming up from the pipe networks and onto the streets” and “we had instances where rats had eaten through brickwork in manholes and somehow managed to get by trap gullies on the roadways”.PoisonsControlling the rat populations was becoming increasingly problematic because of stricter regulation of poisons and because rat “enforcement action” was a matter for the HSE.“During the Covid-19 crisis, the HSE did not carry out pest control in our flat complexes, as they did prior to the pandemic. In the absence of the HSE, Dublin City Council continued to provide this service, which placed additional strain on our resources.”The HSE said it had been restricted on entering homes during the pandemic, but had continued to provide external “rodent control”. It would recommence entering properties from June 15th.Suggestions that could change Dublin for the better"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4278984.1592204757!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"shopping centres reopen today and nursing home visits resume","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDundrum Shopping Centre: Some outlets, such as supermarkets, opticians and pharmacies, are already open, but now fashion and other shops can reopen.  Photograph: Eric LukeShopping centres are to reopen on Monday, and people can resume visiting loved ones in nursing homes and residential care facilities as the restrictions aimed at suppressing the coronavirus continue to ease.“We’re expecting queues outside some retailers and we’ll be monitoring footfall in the centre overall,” a spokeswoman for Dundrum Shopping Centre in south Dublin said.If it is felt there are too many people in the centre, then people will be asked to queue outside. “But we’re hoping it won’t come to that.”People entering the shopping centre will be asked to walk in using a “one-way system” and will be encouraged to wear face masks.Like many other shopping centres, some of Dundrum’s outlets, such as supermarkets, opticians and pharmacies, were already open, but now fashion outlets and other shops will be reopening.Restaurants will not be providing “dining in” services and cinemas in the centre will remain closed.The National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) has published a Shopping Centre Recovery and Protection Guide which says that centres should put in place measures that would limit the number of shoppers at any one time, and consider adjusting their opening hours so as to guard against over-crowding.Face masksIt says signs should be put up to encourage the wearing of face masks, that non-essential facilities, such as playgrounds, should either be closed or controlled, and public wifi should be switched off to discourage people coming into the centres.The Government had originally not envisaged reopening shopping centres until August 10th.A phased introduction of visits to nursing homes and residential care facilities is also starting from Monday. Non-essential visits have been banned since early March.“Families and friends across the country are counting down the minutes until they can visit and see, in person, their loved ones in nursing homes and residential care facilities,” said a spokesman for Sage Advocacy, which campaigns for vulnerable people and patients.People are being advised to contact the facilities they want to visit, prior to doing so. Visits to facilities where there is a Covid-19 outbreak are not being allowed.People who have any symptoms of Covid-19 infection or are feeling unwell, and people who have been told they are a close contact of someone confirmed as having Covid-19, should not visit residential facilities.Visit conditionsThe advice is that each resident should have only two named visitors, with only one of those people visiting at any one time, each visit being for a maximum of 30 minutes, one visit per person per week being allowed, and children under 16 years not being allowed visit.It is also advised that the residential facilities ensure that each facility sets a limit on the number of visitors that can be in the facility at any one time.“Visitors are required to wear a surgical mask if they are not able to maintain social distancing during the visit. “This surgical mask will be provided by the facility and its disposal will be monitored.”The bringing of food and drinks to the facilities is being prohibited and the use of the bathroom facilities in the centres is being discouraged.The EU’s home affairs commissioner, Ylva Johansson, last week suggested that member states might begin to reopen their borders from as early as this week. But the advice for people in the State continues to be that they should avoid unnecessary travel.“We are still advising you should stay within your county, or 20km of home,” a spokesman for the Department of Health said.People, including Irish citizens, who enter the State from outside Ireland, are still expected to self-isolate for 14 days.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"HSE rat-control services have been curtailed during the coronavirus pandemicMan was struck by car which failed to stop at the scene of the accidentFianna F\u0026aacuteil says its imprint on document \u0026lsquoevident\u0026rsquo in areas of health care and reformAround 86 million Europeans including 19 million living in povertyGarda\u0026iacute discovered a man aged in his 40s with a stab wound at Ballybane on SundayDrinks industry charity Drinkaware expresses alarm about excess alcoholInitial results expected in late August to measure prevalence of virus in populationStrict protocols apply to retail outlet customers and visitors to residential facilitiesThe three party leaders remain locked in tense negotiations on final details of coalition dealFormer master Peter Boylan has written to board seeking objection put on agenda\u0026lsquoIf people are too ill to provide details, we find out who they are and who needs to be contacted\u0026rsquoPassport office drastically curtailed services as staff erted to pandemic tasksBiggest increase in incarceration in decade as more being jailed for not paying fines\u0026lsquoYou could in all probability say it\u0026rsquos down to the Covid diet,\u0026rsquo says Carlow dentistNBRU calls for a night time commission to facilitate socially distanced 24-hour societyBelongTo survey reports high levels of suicide ideation, self-harm and lonelinessSeveral outstanding issues remain unresolved after meeting between party leadersIncident took place on Saturday night on N5 at Belleek, CastlebarThree party leaders to meet on Monday morning to formally sign off on documentAgreement includes changes in housing, transport, direct provision and other areasStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4278848.1592142738!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"more than 30 000 passport applications to be processed","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTens of thousands of passports would normally be processed each month in the run-up to the summer.There are more than 30,000 passport applications waiting to be processed by officials working within the Department of Foreign Affairs but the Passport Service has expressed confidence the backlog will be cleared within weeks.The service processed 12,000 passports last week alone and while there are still 32,000 applications in the system, a spokeswoman said most of them would be issued by early next month. The passport office drastically curtailed its normal services from the middle of March as hundreds of its staff were erted to work in other departments including Covid-19 contact tracing within the HSE and manning information lines for the Department of Social Protection. It did not, however, completely stop issuing passports and, alongside emergency travel documents which had to be issued, the office also processed thousands of adult renewal applications received online which required minimum staff intervention.“Once the potential impact of Covid-19 became obvious, contingency planning commenced to minimise the impact of restrictions on the delivery of passport services,” a spokeswoman for the Passport Service said. “In particular, plans were put in place to ensure that the Passport Service continued to provide an emergency service for the issuance of passports in cases of serious illness or death abroad.” She said that while staff were on-site processing urgent applications, they had also produced about 6,000 additional passports. However, tens of thousands of passports would normally be processed each month in the run-up to the summer, and the lockdown and the ersion of resources to other areas has led to the significant backlog. Full operationThe spokeswoman said it was “at an advanced stage of planning for the return to full operation” and she said that in phase two of the Government plans which started last Monday, the processing of non-essential online applications started to ramp up. “There are currently 32,000 passport applications in the system to be processed,” she said. “The Passport Service has a great deal of experience in dealing with peaks in demand and we believe that we are well placed to ensure the online service will be meeting its usual turnaround times of approximately two weeks for simple applications by phase three” which is now set to start at the end of this month.

Photograph: National Library of IrelandFlickr CommonsThe end, for Victoria, wasn’t particularly dignified.“As I watched, another workman appeared, clambering over her head, gripping her sometimes by the nose and occasionally sticking a finger into her disdainful eye. Perhaps it was just the effect of the glistening rain on the bright, green copper, but it seemed to me that the old lady - never exactly pleasant-looking at the best of times - was glaring about with loathing and disgust.”So reads an account in The  of the removal of the controversial statue of Britain’s Queen Victoria that stood for more than 40 years at Leinster House.The scenes are described in the Irishman’s Diary of the following day, July 23rd, 1948. She’s depicted on the front page, too - suspended by machinery as people look on. “Ministers, ex-Ministers and Dáil deputies stood around in the rain, waiting. There were crowds on the steps of the Museum and the Library and there were cameras everywhere. Meanwhile the workmen worked away with that maddeningly measured, deliberate air of men who know that they hold stage.“Several times we thought the big moment had come - once she did lurch from her pedestal for a second or two and creak back again - but just as everything was adjusted it would start to pour and everyone would have to rush for shelter.”In the end, Quidnunc missed the finale. “For a while longer I watched the men adjust and readjust the girths around Victoria’s middle then I had to go up to the Leinster Bowling Club to see the South African match. When I returned, Victoria was missing from her pedestal.” The statue was later moved to Kilmainham.The piece - comical, yet dry and straightforward - unflatteringly describes an audience and spectacle much different to that on the day the statue was erected.‘Mutilated’Searching for references to Dublin’s statue of Queen Victoria throws up a couple of parallels in the archive of The . There’s the statue of Victoria erected in 1939 in Menton, France pushed into the sea when the Italians came during the second World War and later replaced. Further back, in November 1908, there was the “outrage” at the public gardens in the Indian city of Nagpur, where a statue of the queen was “mutilated the face daubed with tar and the nose and fingers broken.”In the years between Victoria’s visit to Ireland in 1900 and the unveiling of John Hughes’s statue in 1908, mentions of a public fund set up for its commission are plentiful. In the days before the unveiling, tickets for the ceremony were advertised - the price of admittance was one shilling, payable at the front hall of Leinster House. The aim, said one report, was to thin the anticipated crowd.The day she was unveiled - February 15th, 1908 - was, like the day she came down, punctuated by rain. “The ceremony was made the occasion of an imposing military display, but the lustre of the pageant was to some extent marred by a somewhat heavy shower which fell shortly before the formal part of the proceedings commenced,” reported The .Detachments of soldiers began to arrive from 2pm, for the unveiling at 3pm. “About 1,000 troops were on parade and as the various battalions, dressed in review order, with their bands, arrived on the scene they took up their allotted positions with bayonets fixed, forming a wide circle round the greensward, in the centre of which stood the memorial, with the beauty of its magnificently formed bronze figures as yet unrevealed.”‘A noble addition’The string would be pulled, the Lord Lieutenant’s speech made and the applause would ring out - as far as the report goes. The  hailed the statue as “a noble addition” to Dublin’s monuments, praising the sculptor John Hughes.As the years wore on, the lauded aesthetics of the piece would be repeatedly called into question. As Randolph Churchill wrote in an article published on the front page in November, 1945: “The largest and ugliest statue in Dublin is outside the Dáil, and is of Queen Victoria - denounced throughout Ireland in the last century as the famine queen.”The statue and the merit of keeping it in situ quickly became a topic of debate. In line with the struggle for Irish independence and rejection of imperialist Britain, the controversy crept into news coverage - particularly following the conclusion of the War of Independence and signing of the Anglo Irish Treaty in 1921. The arguments for and against removing the statue will be familiar.On the latter point, a letter writer in 1933 - when the statue was 25 years old - said: “At one time a new dynasty arose in Egypt, and, defacing all the monuments of an earlier age, earned the universal condemnation of all historians. It is to be hoped that we are more enlightened.” Another - a decade later - pondered whether it would be better to keep it in place, owing to its potential as a tourist attraction.In the latter part of 1943, the issue again hit the pages of The  when the Dublin Corporation passed a resolution requesting the government to remove the statue. The story was carried on the front page the next morning, on September 7th.Proposing the resolution, Councillor Micheál Ó Maoláin said it was odd that “the effigy of a lady whose name stank in the nostrils of past generations of Irishmen” should stand in front of Ireland’s Parliament House, while Lord Edward Fitzgerald had been forgotten. Every generation, he warned, would rise and revolt at the sight of it.On the same day, the leader in The  took a more moderate view compared to “the heat of Mr Ó Maoláin’s feelings”, yet gave the councillor credit on two counts. “Firstly the city would not be any poorer for a monument to Lord Edward, who was a patriot in a sense which is hardly understood nowadays. Secondly, if the Old Queen must be removed, Mr Ó Maoláin will have it done by law and not by dynamite.” The piece mentioned the explosion at Stephen’s Green in 1937 that brought a large statue of George II and his horse to the ground.NeglectThe article also suggested it would be better to remove the statue than allow it to endure further neglect. “If it is true that the statue has never been cleaned since the signing of the Treaty - and certainly its musty green hue gives credit to the story - the joke is rather a poor one and reflects more discredit upon the House of Windsor.”The same “green hue” would catch the eye of Myles na gCopaleen (Brian O’NolanFlann O’Brien) the following month - albeit, he had a much different take. Over all, the writer was not overly bothered with its removal - her statutes were more harmful than her statues, as he put it. “Besides, look at it this way,” he wrote on October 2nd. “Time has given the mere Irish their revenge. The fact is that Victoria has turned green. Of hue she approaches our decent Irish letterbox. And it is the price of her.”In the days after the resolution was passed, cold water was thrown over the project. A story on the front page on September 8th reported that Victoria would be removed, just not yet. Costs were blamed.On November 1st, members of Ailtirí na hAiséirghe - a minor fascist party described then as a Gaelic revival organisation - crashed a Dublin Corporation meeting and shouted from the public galleries: “Get rid of all the symbols of slavery in the streets.” The episode made the front page of the paper and was reported in the British press.It would take until July 22nd, 1948, before the statue came down.

Photograph: Getty ImagesTwo-thirds of men have been drinking to cope with the lockdown, new research reveals.The DrinkawareBehaviour \u0026amp Attitudes reported a sharp increase of men drinking to cope with life. A total of 66 per cent in 2020 are drinking to cope in comparison with 56 per cent in 2018.The study, which focused on the 30-day period prior to April 24th 2020 during the peak of the lockdown found that two-thirds of men reported drinking to cope for reasons including loneliness, anxiety and boredom.Drinkaware is a national charity funded by the drinks industry. The survey was commissioned by Drinkaware and conducted online in April 2020 by Behaviour \u0026amp Attitudes with 1,015 adults (18+) in Ireland.The aim was to assess national attitudes, behaviours and motivational drivers regarding alcohol consumption during Covid-19 restrictions when the majority of people were confined to within just two kilometres of their home.The findings, released at the start of Men’s Health Week, show a disproportionate increase in frequency and volume consumed among men in Ireland when compared with women and the overall population.Men are more likely to report drinking to cope (66 per cent) than women (55 per cent).Men are also more than twice as likely to report binge drinking four or more times in those 30 days (21 per cent), compared to 10 per cent of women and 15 percent national average.However, men are significantly more likely to try and change their drinking habits as a result of the lockdown. Some 35 per cent made small positive changes to their drinking habits during lockdown, compared to 27 per cent of female drinkers and 31 per cent .Commenting on the research, Drinkaware chief executive Sheena Horgan said: “The data tells the story of stark gender ide regarding alcohol consumption in Ireland.“Irish men are clearly using alcohol as a way to cope with the anxiety, loneliness and boredom of Covid-19. Men already fared worse in terms of frequency and volume of drinking. Now they are exhibiting consistently hazardous and potentially harmful drinking habits.“Men’s Health Week gives us the chance to put the focus on men’s wellbeing, and to support each other and renew our collective efforts to spark an open dialogue about men’s physical and mental wellbeing.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4279317.1592208812!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"no rise in pension age this year under government programme","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin, with his  negotiation team (left to right) Anne Rabbitte, Darragh O Brien, Thomas Byrne, Jack Chmabers, Darragh Calleary abd Michael McGrath  during talks at Government Buildings, Dublin on Sunday.

There is a need for additional capacity and the pre-Covid situation of one million people on waiting lists was not acceptable. “We need to tackle that.”It made sense to use the additional capacity in the private sector to get treatment, said Mr McGrath.There would be a need to kick start economic activity in line with public health advice, he added.When asked if Mr Martin would be the first taoiseach of the new government, Mr McGrath said that the issue of taoiseach will be decided shortly, but that he expected his party leader would be taoiseach.Party meetings Leaving Government Buildings late on Sunday night, Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe said talks would continue on Monday.It is believed Fine Gael was holding out for a commitment in the document to tax cuts in the future if resources allow.The draft programme is expected to be approved by the three parliamentary parties on Monday if the leaders can reach agreement, and will then be put to the members of the three parties for ratification.The programme for government commits the next government to reducing Ireland’s emissions of greenhouse gases by an average of 7 per cent annually.The Greens’ priorities are also reflected in the increase in spending on transport infrastructure. All future capital spending on transport infrastructure will be split 2:1, favouring public transport over roads, and €360 million will be spent every year on cycling and walking infrastructure.There will be a ban on the further exploration for gas in the waters off Ireland and a ban on the importation of fracked gas, which will halt the construction of the Shannon LNG project and other facilities.The direct provision system will be abolished within the government’s term and replaced “with a new international protection accommodation policy centred on a not-for-profit approach”.A number of referendums are also promised within the lifetime of the next government, including one on the right to housing.There will be commissions on housing, tax and social welfare and on the future of the Defence Forces, and a permanent pay review body for the Defence Forces will also be established.Carbon tax will rise to €100 per tonne by 2030 rather than €80 per tonne as is planned now, with the resources being re-invested in increased social welfare payments and investment in climate change policies.A new economic stimulus plan for the retail and tourism sectors is expected in July, with a wider national recovery plan following in October.The Land Development Agency will develop cost rental housing, as well as affordable purchase homes, affordable rental homes and social housing on State-owned land.The document also commits that 50,000 social homes will be provided over the next five years, with an emphasis on new builds."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4279295.1592203557!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"strongly green influenced programme for government drawn up","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTánaiste Simon Coveney, Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe and Green Party leader Eamon Ryan meet for talks on Government formation at Government Buildings.

Leaving Government Buildings late on Sunday night, Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe said talks would continue on Monday. It is believed Fine Gael was holding out for a commitment in the document to tax cuts in the future if resources allow. Earlier, the negotiating teams signed off on a draft programme for government after almost six weeks of protracted and often difficult negotiations, leaving the final issues for the party leaders to resolve. The document, which was widely leaked on Sunday night, is expected to be approved by the three parliamentary parties on Monday if the leaders can reach agreement, and will then be put to the members of the three parties for ratification.Internal debatesThere will be particular focus on the Green Party, in which there is expected to be significant opposition to the deal, and where a two-thirds majority is required if the party is to join the coalition. The position of deputy leader Catherine Martin, who was previously opposed to negotiations but led the Green Party team in the talks process, is expected to be pivotal in the party’s internal debates. But several Green TDs were enthusiastic about the deal, pointing to a range of policy wins for the party in the document.Crucially, the programme for government commits the next government to reducing Ireland’s emissions of greenhouse gases by an average of 7 per cent annually.The Greens’ priorities are also reflected in the increase in spending on transport infrastructure.

Photograph: EPAOlivier HosletLife seemed to pause in February, and this seems to have affected the perception of time. Incredibly, half of 2020 is gone: and that means just six months remain before goods sold into Britain will be subject to border checks, customs declarations, and possibly tariffs.These onerous changes will come into force no matter what deal is agreed between London and Brussels, and indeed if no deal is agreed at all. They are expected to have a heavy impact on companies in the Republic, and any businesses across the EU dependent on exports to Britain. Firms have been asked to prepare as a matter of urgency.The British government has said, definitively, that it will not extend the transition period. Instead, it proposes to introduce the border requirements in stages. Checks on live animals will come into force right away in January. Pre-notification and health certification for meat, dairy, and other animal products will come into force from April. Full checks and declarations will be in place from July. For the first half of the year, companies will have a grace period to make customs declarations for their goods and pay whatever tariffs are required.Since February, talks between Britain and the European Union have continued over video calls to try to hash out a deal that avoids the harshest outcome of an automatic shift to World Trade Organisation trade terms on January 1st. The state of the talks now could be described as nil-all at half time. Both teams have played defensively and sat deep on the pitch neither has conceded, no one has scored.The second half British prime minister Boris Johnson will join a video conference on Monday with the presidents of the three European institutions of the commission, council, and parliament: Ursula von der Leyen, Charles Michel, and David Sassoli. Earlier this year, Britain was warning that it could use this moment to dramatically walk away from talks and declare it would spend all its energy on preparing for World Trade Organisation terms. It has shifted away from this approach, instead pushing the EU to enter intensive talks next month.A timetable for the second half has been set out: six rounds of negotiations are to take place between June 29th and August 21st. Negotiators will alternate between physical meetings in Brussels and London as long as national health guidance allows it, but talks could shift online again.What the EU is seeking in the talks was decided by the 27 remaining members of the EU and given to chief negotiator Michel Barnier in a 46-page mandate in February.He has updated the member states and the European institutions throughout the talks, as any shift or concession by the EU side can only be given with consensus agreement.No change to the mandate is needed to get an agreement, he told the European Parliament last week. “We can find the necessary compromises, on the condition that the UK changes its approach,” the Frenchman said.Areas of disagreementThere are four stubborn areas of disagreement. One is the so-called level playing field: the EU’s ambition to ensure fair competition between British and EU countries. Brussels will not grant British companies free access to EU markets if they can undercut local businesses it will only do so if they are required to follow equivalent standards on, for example, labour and the environment. This is anathema to Britain, as it sounds like signing back up to the kind of regulatory restrictions it left the EU to escape.Too bad, Brussels responds: no free access for your businesses to the single market then.Another issue is fisheries. In a nutshell: Britain wants to take back exclusive rights over its territorial waters. These would give it far more fish than the British could eat. Want to sell fish to the EU? Fine, says Brussels, but only if EU fishing boats can have access to British waters. The EU side wants to stick to the existing quota system for this Britain wants to introduce yearly access talks.On policing and judicial cooperation, Britain does not want to continue to follow EU data protection standards, and shies away from an agreement with the EU on human rights, which it says has no place in a trade deal. The final issue is governance: ie, how disputes could be mediated. Britain does not want the ultimate authority to be the European Court of Justice the EU insists this is the only body that can rule on matters of EU law.British negotiators can sound somewhat indignant at the EU’s insistence on written and legal guarantees on matters such as standards and human rights, insisting that Britain has high standards, and should be trusted, rather than treated as a potential violator.No compromiseThe EU accuses Britain of continuing to not accept that negative consequences are inevitable from Brexit, and of demanding privileges that are only available to member states. The British negotiators accuse the EU of failing to accept its sovereignty, and of asking for things that go far beyond previous trade deals with countries like Japan or Canada. Brussels rejects this comparison,\u0026nbsp explaining that Japan and Canada are far away, so don’t have the ability to undercut the EU that Britain could have.Brussels believes it has the upper hand, because if Britain chooses not to compromise and to go for World Trade Organization terms, the same EU negotiating mandate will await them if they return for talks to ease the tariffs. There is some flexibility on details, but the principles will not shift. “The United Kingdom chose to become a third country. It cannot have the best of both worlds!” Barnier put it to parliament. “We want a very ambitious economic partnership, but it must reflect the long-term economic and political interests of the EU. This is not a dogmatic or technocratic position,” he added. “Simply: we will never compromise on our European values or on our economic and trade interests, to the benefit of the British economy.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

In November 1871 he found the sick explorer and greeted him with the words : Dr Livingstone, I presume?But Bishop Gregory Cameron, bishop of St Asaph, has written to the city council asking for the removal of the monument to Stanley from its place near the River Elwy and signed a petition calling for the removal of a statue from nearby Denbigh town centre.He said: Exactly what do we commemorate in the life of Henry Morton Stanley, born John Rowlands? He was an adventurer, who had little respect for the natives of Africa, and who shared in management of one of the most atrocious and exploitative colonial endeavours ever in that vast continent, the enslaving of an entire population to service the wealth creation of King Leopold II of the Belgians through the production of rubber.He repudiated his Welsh upbringing and paid scant regard to the communities of St Asaph and Denbigh which had nurtured him. So why exactly is there a statue of him in Denbigh\u0027s main square, and another monument at the bottom of St Asaph\u0027s High Street?Henry Morton Stanley was born in 1841 as John Rowlands in Denbigh. He was abandoned by his mother as a young baby and his father died a few weeks after his birth. He spent some time in the St Asaph Workhouse before emigrating to America and subsequently travelling to Africa.Dispatched by the New York Herald to find David Livingstone, a Scottish missionary who had gone missing in Africa, Stanley set off in 1871 on an eight-month, 7,000-mile trip accompanied by 200 porters. The goal was accomplished, but not without cost – deserters were flogged and a contemporary, Sir Richard Francis Burton, claimed: “Stanley shoots Africans as if they were monkeys.”On a second trip in 1874, Stanley, in partnership with The Daily , traced the course of the River Congo to the sea. In 1876 he made a deal with King Leopold II to travel back to the Congo, and as a result became associated with the Belgium king’s brutal regime, a link he spent years defending.In 2011, Bishop Gregory expressed dismay that St Asaph city council had elected to commemorate a man well known for his imperialist career, his brutality towards the indigenous African population, and for his collaboration with King Leopold in the subjugation, exploitation and maltreatment of the Congolese people.In a new letter to the city council, the bishop said : Current affairs amply demonstrate the anger and distress caused by the celebration of racist and colonialist pioneers, I would like to suggest to you that the time has come to remove the offence of this monument.I would like to feel that St Asaph city council would be willing to identify with the Black Lives Matter campaign by making the highly symbolic gesture of putting this monument out of sight, and taking a stand for equality and ersity.St Asaph Cathedral contains a small plaque to Stanley and discussions are taking place as to whether it should be removed or a further panel added to provide interpretation. The Dean of St Asaph Cathedral, the Very Revd Nigel Williams said: The plaque is not prominent and does not draw attention to itself. It does not honour Stanley as a statue. Additional information alongside could provide the opportunity for visitors to properly consider the issues but it\u0027s right that we think carefully about its place here in the cathedral.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"black lives matter hero grandfather said just did had do","story":"The peaceful Black Lives Matter hero, who was photographed carrying an injured white protester away from danger, has described how he was compelled to act because he feared the man was about to be killed.The image of Patrick Hutchinson, a grandfather and personal trainer from Wimbledon, south west London, carrying the man on his shoulder through the rioting crowd went viral as a symbol of hope and unity amid the chaos of Saturday’s disorder.Yesterday Mr Hutchinson, who is an athletics coach, dismissed suggestions he was a “national hero” insisting he simply acted on instinct to protect the man.The security consultant and martial arts expert said he and a group of friends had decided to attend the Black Lives Matter protests in London on Saturday to prevent young black demonstrators from getting into trouble.“I had no plans to go up there. I was at home looking after my grandchildren - and my friend said we’ve gotta go and protect the women and the children and stop these young guys from getting in any trouble,” he explained.But as they approached Waterloo station, trouble flared with a large group of far right protesters and running battles broke out with the police caught in the middle.It is not clear whether the man who was hurt had been part of the demonstrations or whether he was simply caught up in the chaos of the violence.Mr Hutchinson said he spotted him lying on the ground and quickly realised that if he did not act, the man was in danger of being crushed or even beaten to death.He told Channel 4 News: “It was pretty hectic. It was almost like a stampede. There were lots of people. There were people trying to protect him, but unsuccessfully.”He explained that his friends, also realising the danger, attempted to put a cordon around the man, in order to prevent him coming to any more harm.“His life was under threat. I thought well if he stays here he’s not going to make it, so I just went under, scooped him up, put him on my shoulders and sort of started marching towards the police with him, whilst all the guys were surrounding me and protecting me and the guy I had on my shoulder. “I could actually feel strikes and hits as I was carrying him so some of the guys were probably taking some of that themselves on their person”Asked if it was scary, he said: “Yes it was, but you don’t think about that at the time. You just do what you have got to do.”Mr Hutchinson said: “It’s not black versus white, it is everyone versus the racists. We had each other’s back and protected those who needed us.”He went on: “If the other three police officers that were there standing around when George Floyd was murdered had thought about intervening and stopping their colleague from doing what he was doing, like what we did, George Floyd would be alive today still.”Mr Hutchinson said he hoped the image of him helping the man would help spread the message of peace and unity.“I just want equality for all of us. At the moment the scales are unfairly balanced and I just want things to be fair for my children and my grandchildren,” he explained.But Jamaine Facey, another personal trainer, who was also among the group who helped save the man, said he had acted to prevent a further backlash against the black community.He said: “For me, I wasn’t protecting him, I was protecting our kids. I was protecting their future. Because I know the judge would not have seen what happened before. I was saving our kids’ future.”Friends and clients of Mr Hutchinson last night praised his quick thinking and decisive actions.One wrote on social media: “This is what I want to see. A truly incredible man. Nothing but respect.”Another added: “Saw this photo and felt so much pride and power and humanity through what you guys did,  big respect.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"keep quiet two metre rule sage experts told","story":"Scientists advising the Government about the coronavirus crisis have been warned not to give their personal opinion about the two-metre rule, amid growing controversy over whether it should be enforced in pubs, restaurants and schools.Experts on the sub-committees that feed into the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies had publicly questioned the validity of the research which led to the social-distancing diktat, with some suggesting that remaining one metre apart would be sufficient to reduce the spread of infection.In papers released by Sage’s environmental and modelling group last Friday, advisers also told ministers that the two-metre rule could be abandoned by businesses if they introduce other measures to stop the spread of Covid-19, such as getting workers to take regular breaks and sit next to each other.However, the  has learned that a message from a Government figure was passed down through SAGE last week that other than publishing papers, advisers should keep their thoughts on the matter private, as it grapples with whether or not to alter its official guidance to the public.A source said: “It has come through SAGE channels as an official request from elsewhere in Government. There is concern that there should only be one public message about the science. But there isn’t such a thing as ‘the science’. There are lots of different sciences.”The Government has denied it was an official edict. A spokesperson said: “There is no ban on scientists who provide advice to the government speaking to anyone about their own areas of expertise and academic work.“We are committed to thorough and transparent debate of all the evidence presented to SAGE and its sub-committees.”The Official’s apparent attempt to curb what scientists say in public comes as the Government faces mounting pressure to revise the two metre rule, amid concerns that businesses and schools will not be able to fully reopen whilst it is in place.The Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on May 27th that he had asked SAGE to look again at the guidance, but Downing Street said later that it believed the rule should stay in place and that it would remain under review. It is expected to be scrapped in time for the new school year to start in September.However, there is growing dissent amongst experts on SAGE sub-committees over whether the research which led to the guidance in the first place is good enough.A mathematical modelling paper produced by Sage in April, and based on past experiments carried out in other countries, concluded that the risk of exposure to the coronavirus “could be 10-30 times higher at one metre compared to two metres.Several members have raised objections to the two-metre rule, amid concerns that modelling done by SAGE was based on inadequate data.Last week, an analysis published in the Lancet found the risk of catching the coronavirus whilst standing one metre apart was only around twice that of standing two metres apart - a 2.6 per cent chance compared to 1.3 per cent.But the new SAGE research, prepared by its environmental and modelling group and published last week, says that this does not consider the positioning of the person – meaning the way they are facing – or how the virus is likely to be transmitted. The group said that sitting within one metre of a person side by side or back to back is as safe as facing a person at two metres when indoors. Sir Patrick Vallance, the Government’s chief scientific adviser, has previously made it clear that it was up to politicians, not scientists, to make a decision on relaxing the 2 metre rule.“It’s not a scientific rule, it is a risk-based assessment.”The apparent move to muzzle advisers is likely to reignite anger over the Government’s lack of transparency around SAGE at the start of the coronavirus crisis, including its initial refusal to say who sits on the committee.It also follows claims that England’s chief nurse, Ruth May, was dropped from one of Downing Street’s daily briefings after she refused to publicly back the Prime Minister’s most senior aide, Dominic Cummings, in the row over his trip to Durham during lockdown. Number 10 has disputed the claim.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"macron claims first victory against coronavirus france","story":"French President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday gave Paris restaurants and cafés the green light to reopen fully and serve customers indoors, saying France has won “a first victory against the coronavirus.”In his first televised address to the nation in two months, the centrist president delivered a message that the worst was over and it was time to get back to work. “If we can reopen the country it is because everyone has played their part,” Mr Macron said. “The prime minister and the government worked tirelessly. People stayed home and and showed a great sense of responsibility.”Mr Macron also sought to reassure an anxious public that his administration can steer France out of economic crisis without raising the country’s already high income tax rates.France has spent some £440 billion on bailing out companies and a job retention scheme under which the state has paid about 80 per cent of the wages of furloughed workers.Paris was the last part of mainland France still classified as a higher risk “orange zone”, but has now joined the rest of the country in being considered a “green zone” where the spread of the coronavirus is under control.Mr Macron said all children can return to primary schools, nurseries and day-care centres from June 22, ending formal social distancing but avoiding close contact where possible. Limitations will remain on the number of pupils in the upper three years of secondary school.Many schools had already reopened, but had to halve class sizes because of France’s one-metre social distancing rule. Its relaxation will come as a relief for exhausted parents. Many have been working from home while struggling with child care since France began a strict lockdown on March 17 that lasted two-and-half months before the country began lifting restrictions.Restaurants and cafés were allowed to reopen from June 2,  but the government had been under pressure to lift an additional restriction on Paris, where they could only serve customers outdoors. Elsewhere in mainland France, they are operating as normal, except that tables must be kept one-metre apart and staff must wear face-masks.France has reported 29,398 coronavirus deaths in hospitals and care homes since the pandemic began, with a daily toll of 24 announced on Saturday.Mr Macron’s relative success in combatting Covid-19 has not improved his popularity. His approval ratings rose at the start of the crisis, but have now fallen back below 40 per cent, according to opinion polls.He is under fire from the Left for his business-friendly economic reforms, while the Right says he has failed to back the police over accusations of brutality and racism, and has allowed law and order to degenerate.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"monday morning news briefing cant photoshop history","story":"If you want to receive twice-daily briefings like this by email, sign up to the Front Page newsletter here.

After violent clashes between far-Right protesters and police at the weekend, the Prime Minister promises to fight with every breath in his body any attempt to remove the statue of Winston Churchill from Parliament Square. Writing for The , Mr Johnson acknowledged Britain has much more to do to tackle the issue of racism and pledged to set up a cross-government commission to examine inequality. But he also launched a passionate defence of one of the country\u0027s greatest ever leaders, declaring it the height of lunacy to accuse Churchill of racism. Read Mr Johnson\u0027s article for us, in which he says we have to tackle inequality now instead of rewriting the past.Meanwhile, a policing leader has called for Home Secretary Priti Patel to ban demonstrations on health grounds during the coronavirus pandemic - rather than having statues and memorials boarded up. Ken Marsh, chairman of the politan Police Federation, said the Government would be acting lawfully if it was to ban protests under the regulations barring no more than six people from gathering. It came as the Black Lives Matter demonstrator who was photographed carrying an injured white man away from danger on Saturday described how he was compelled to act because he feared the man was about to be killed.Thousands of non-essential shops across England are reopening their doors to customers for the first time in almost three months today in the latest easing of the coronavirus lockdown rules. But the scale of the challenge facing retailers is laid bare by an exclusive YouGov poll suggesting that half of shoppers could stay away. The hospitality sector is also warning of an impending crisis. Industry leaders will tell ministers tomorrow that a Downing Street-led review of the two-metre social distancing rule must be completed by next week - or hotels, bars and restaurants will start to sack tens of thousands of staff.

But in my mind there echoed the equivocal response of the browbeaten editor of Evelyn Waugh’s Scoop: “Up to a point.”All my life, I have been a keen and accomplished shopper, following the formidable example of my mother. As a child I used to accompany her stately progress along our local high street, from fishmonger to butcher to grocer, learning important life lessons about good food and good shopkeepers. Later there came an education in retail therapy: at Madame Stuart of Canterbury I admired bolts of brocade and chiffon while my mother discussed evening dresses with Madame (implacably chic black dress, pincushion on an elastic band around her wrist).There followed exotic trips to Way In, Harrods’s teen boutique, with lunch afterwards in the dim, rose-plush surroundings of the Dress Circle restaurant. Since then I have regarded shopping as a kind of discipline and, occasionally, a defiant gesture of hope.Hours before my son was born, I bought a preposterous couture version of a leather biker jacket. “It will remind you,” said the shop assistant, understanding my need to remember the person I was before I became a mother. Almost 30 years later, moments before lockdown, I impulse-bought an absurd pair of cream leather lace-up boots from M\u0026ampS, sensing that I might never again shop in the same way.The life of a freelance writer is both fortunate (no commuting a welcome absence of chivvying memos) and lonely. It is a kind of self-imposed lockdown, to which shopping – IRL, rather than online – provides a welcome punctuation: the solid reality of ordinary things – potatoes, coffee, mustard – alongside the drama of everyday life. The Covid-driven revelation that shop staff are key workers, together with doctors and nurses, cleaners and carers, was not news to me. Before lockdown, there were days on which the only people I spoke to were my kind, knowledgeable and entertaining local shopkeepers.Now shops are reopening and the Prime Minister has urged us to go out and spend. I long for nothing more than the old normal: my online experience has been miserable – fraught with the sedentary expectation and disappointment to which shopping used to be such a erting and effective antidote. The easing points us in the direction of the old model, from the “revenge shopping” for expensive couture fripperies that followed China’s emergence from lockdown, to the hours-long queues at Ikea and B\u0026ampQ. The human impulse to get new stuff, we may conclude, is indefatigable.As for me, since high street shopping cautiously opened I have queued, briefly, at a garden centre for compost and herbs. I am accustomed to queuing at food shops (I take a book to read while I wait). As for “normal” shopping – I feel no impulse to go there: for now it feels too soon too strange.

This could be due to the delay between people experiencing symptoms and people being tested for Covid-19.Google has previously attempted to predict such trends through its nowcast function, which launched in 2008. A paper published in the scientific journal Nature at the time explained how people\u0027s search patterns could estimate flu prevalence two weeks before it was registered by official bodies like the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).As the world\u0027s most popular online search engine, the data from people\u0027s digital footprints offered potentially life-saving insights and it was the poster child of so-called \u0027Big Data\u0027. But by 2015 it was shut down after it failed to foresee a massive flu outbreak in 2013.UK now has more daily Covid-19 deaths than the rest of Europe combinedIt was described by some publications as an epic failure and a note on its landing page now states: Google Flu Trends and Google Dengue Trends are no longer publishing current estimates of Flu and Dengue fever based on search patterns...  It is still early days for nowcasting and similar tools for understanding the spread of diseases like flu and dengue – we\u0027re excited to see what comes next.A blog post explaining the decision said that Google would work directly with academic institutions to make sense of the search data. More than 265 peer-reviewed papers have since drawn on aggregated data taken from Google searches, used to track epidemics like Ebola in 2014, Zika in 2016 and West Nile fever over several years in Italy.

They said: “Gone with the Wind is a product of its time and depicts some of the ethnic and racial prejudices that have, unfortunately, been commonplace in American society.” The film has been accused of white-washing slavery and romanticising the treatment of black people in the south through the use of racist archetypes.“Obviously, symbolic progress is progress and a lot of these changes have been a long time coming,” said Oliver, adding: “this week also brought stubborn reminders of the institutional inertia that is going to make real change so difficult like Joe Biden sticking by his plan to invest an additional $300 million into community policing efforts which is the precise opposite of reading the room.”Gone with the Wind\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And there are no front footprints.”Professor Kyung Soo Kim, who also authored the paper alongside Jong Deock Lim, Seul Mi Bae and Anthony Romilio, corroberated Professor Lockley’s view.This is because of how deep the animal’s heel left an impression in the fossil.“Our trackways are very narrow-looking - more like a crocodile balancing on a tight-rope,” he told the BBC. “When combined with the lack of any tail-drag marks, it became clear that these creatures were moving bipedally.Created with Sketch.Science Photographer of the Year shortlist  Show all 9Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.19 Soap bubble structures showing light interference colours and patterningBubbles want to optimise space and minimise their surface area for a given volume of air.

Twitter, like Facebook and other major social media sites, is currently banned in China.“We should expect continued evolution and improvement, given the enormous resourcing the Chinese party‑state can bring to bear in aligning state messaging across its diplomacy, state media and covert influence operations.” the ASPI wrote.The research pointed out a number of tactics from the Chinese government to attempt to shape the information environment to its advantage,” including:The coordination of diplomatic and state media messagingThe use of Western social media platforms to seed disinformation into international media coverageThe immediate mirroring and rebuttal of Western media coverage by Chinese state mediaThe co‑option of fringe conspiracy media to target networks vulnerable to manipulationThe use of coordinated inauthentic networks and undeclared political ads to actively manipulate social media audiencesAdditional reporting by ReutersBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms.Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort. Visit pickforbritain.org.uk to find out moreEat seasonal and local vegBut that’s not the only way to support the industry right now. Simply eating more in-season local produce will help to prevent wastage.A wide range of vegetables are currently being harvested in the UK. These include asparagus, cucumbers, mushrooms, courgettes, spinach, summer squash, radishes, beetroot and tomatoes – and buying and cooking with this seasonal veg is a great way to contribute to the farming industry.​In need of some recipe inspo?

I’ve been a delivery driver for Tesco for the last 16 years. Though I also worked for Tesco for four years before that. I knew that I’d have to continue till 63 but was never informed about the rise to 66.”Carolyn’s life was initially turned upside down by the controversial state pension age rise from 60 to 66 for women born after March 1950, which affected nearly 4 million women. The move was accelerated in 2010 and saw them reach parity with men, at 65, in 2018.Many of these women have been forced to carry on working through the Covid-19 emergency despite being at risk of severe complications from the virus due to their age.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesCarolyn said working at Tesco throughout the lockdown has been immensely stressful due to other staff members refusing to respect her need to socially distance and even poking fun at her for wanting to do so.“There is no possibility of social distancing in our back room and I’m mocked by male, macho, much younger drivers for even trying to social distance,” the 64-year-old adds. “I’m so stressed with the whole situation and so upset by a government who’s throwing money here, there and everywhere but doing nothing to protect me. I’ve lived on my own since my orce 14 years ago, and all I want is to kiss and cuddle my kids, three granddaughters and my 94-year-old dad again.”Campaigners argue changes to the state pension age unlawfully discriminate against women born in the 1950s. The United Nations has previously said women hit by the state pension age change are at increased risk of “poverty, homelessness and financial hardship” as a result.Pensioner backs do not resuscitate legal action after ‘brutal’ GP callBackTo60, a campaign group calling for full restitution for women affected by the changes, lost its landmark High Court battle after taking the government to court over the state pension rise, but will be appealing the ruling in July.Joanne Welch, the group’s founder, told The Independent they were confident about the appeal.“When they were robbed of the state pension with virtually no notice from the government, some of the women’s lives were annihilated and that is no exaggeration,” she adds. “But when the pandemic hit, 1950s women were forced out on to the frontline. Many work in retail, hospitality, cleaning and care homes. We know women are facing homelessness and destitution. They have no choice not to work because they are not entitled to sufficient benefits. There are some workplaces where risk assessment not in place.“Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organisation, said people over 60 were at higher risk of developing severe coronavirus. There is a higher death rate for us. But the government is saying over 70s need to shield, not over 60s.“1950s women feel abandoned. They tell us they were robbed and now they are abandoned amid a pandemic. I would have never got involved in this if I didn’t believe it was an injustice. I’ve never done anything like this in my life.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I have always worked – going back to work after having each of my three children. Over the last two years I have struggled with ill health which has impacted on my job as a community nurse.Coronavirus and food banks: The stories behind the statistics“Due to this I had to reduce the hours that I work, but I am still struggling as I need a new hip, and I am in constant pain with this and back pain. I am also struggling with my memory and cannot retain a lot of the information required to do my job safely, which has caused me to suffer with depression. I have been off sick for the last eight weeks. The thought of going back to work makes me feel physically sick as I am terrified that I will make a mistake. I cannot afford to stop working as my husband only revives a state pension. I feel trapped.” A major report by King’s College London which came out last month found the rise in the state pension age has triggered a 30 per cent rise in the likelihood of experiencing depressive symptoms for women doing physically and psychosocially onerous jobs.Researchers said these roles were defined by the mixture of high demands and low levels of control – explaining around a third of women work in these sorts of positions, which involve toiling away in restaurants, sales, personal care, housekeeping, machine operation and cleaning.Debbie de Spon, of Women Against State Pension Inequality (Waspi), said women have been penalised by the government due to the “maladministration” of state pension age changes.She added: “Coupled with inequalities in life expectancy across the country and a substantial pensions gap, Waspi women continue to suffer huge financial losses. Currently many have fallen through the gap of Covid-19 support arrangements, and fear for their future.”Jane, another woman hit by the pension change, said the public health crisis had also wreaked havoc on her working life.“I was 65 last weekend,” she says. “The day before I got told I possibly have heart failure. I am still working and feel like I can’t work any longer. I work for £400 a month less than I was in 2010 due to government pay cuts. I feel so angry and stressed that I might not live to see my pension that I have worked since I was 15 for. Even having four children I worked with only six weeks off when they were born. I feel totally robbed. I am trying to pay for my funeral. It’s a pity when I got so close to it, to lose it. Hopefully, there will be something they can do to keep me going long enough to enjoy my retirement in September. But there’s a possibility I will not. Furthermore, I couldn’t afford to keep my house in 2010 so that had to go. I’ve been part-time for six months.

All the famous faces, including a picture of Sir Peter, are “fans” of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group.Each fragment will be signed by the artist and auctioned on Bidsquare, with bids starting at £325. The auction will be live until midnight on 26 June.The idea originated when London Advertising approached Sir Peter about the project as it wanted to use the mural to raise money for organisations helping people during the pandemic.Sir Peter, who also designed artwork for Paul Weller, Ian Dury and The Who, said: “I’m very happy that the Mandarin Oriental mural can be used a second time to raise money for such a wonderful purpose. I do all kinds of areas of work but one of them is to make crowds of people.Created with Sketch.

But organisers stepped up after the lockdown began and started providing 5,000 meals a week to families in Poplar struggling to afford or access food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesDizzee volunteered as part of his work with Kitchen Social – the Mayor’s Fund for London programme providing food for children across the capital during the school holidays. “I was given an amazing opportunity to visit and help out Kitchen Social at Bygrove Primary School in Poplar, who are providing free food, books and school equipment to kids in the local area where I grew up,” he said.“Thank you to all the amazing people I met and thanks to the Mayor’s Fund for London for connecting the dots.”How to support our campaignBygrove Primary School is also receiving vital supplies from The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project.The food surplus charity, which delivers to hundreds of food banks and community projects across London, began helping the school at the start of the crisis by dropping off one or two trays of fresh produce and staple items each week.The charity has since increased the supply from one or two trays of food each week to 40 trays to help organisers cope with the huge demand.Mark Causton, manager of the school’s initiative, said: “The Felix Project have been an immense help – I can’t praise them enough. We know we’ll need to carry on this work right through the summer, so we rely on all the fresh food they’re supplying.”Mr Causton added: “We’ve seen a lot of parents furloughed or losing work over the past couple of months. In the case of some families struggling to afford to buy shopping, this is one of their only sources of getting food for their children.“It was really great to have Dizzee Rascal here helping out. He got stuck in, and got on so well with all the volunteers and all the families. It was just nice to see a smile on a lot of people’s faces.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

Figures from the Independent Food Aid Network (IFAN) show a 175 per cent rise, with both charities reporting this their “busiest period ever”. Furthermore, a survey by the giving platform Neighbourly of 900 charities and community groups providing food to the vulnerable found that 70 per cent expect the situation to get even worse in the next six to 12 months.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent proprietor Evgeny Lebedev paid special tribute to the almost 6,000 ordinary iniduals who have dug deep to contribute to our appeal. He said: “Time and time again Londoners have shown that they are capable of immense generosity and community spirit in this period of crisis.“To all those that donated, bought and bid — I salute you.”Morgan Stanley said the bank and its employees in London had made the donation as part of their global Covid-19 response.How to support our campaignClare Woodman, head of Morgan Stanley EMEA, said: “The Felix Project plays a vital role in distributing food to people in need, especially those severely impacted by the pandemic. I am proud our employees in London are supporting them as part of our Covid-19 Hunger Relief Campaign.”Another substantial donor was Partners Capital investment group, which donated £95,287.John Collis, head of Partners Capital, Europe, said they “selected The Felix Project as one of our charities to support during this difficult period as it is one of the most impactful charities in London today”.Heads down for quiz nightThe original Top Gear trio — Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May — will tonight host a special Zoom quiz in aid of our appeal partner, The Felix Project. Participants in the Quintessentially Foundation’s “World’s Greatest Quiz Night” will face five rounds of questions devised by Nicholas Shearing, questions producer for top British TV quiz shows Pointless, Debatable and Impossible. May, who has driven Felix vans delivering food to vulnerable Londoners throughout lockdown, said: “At least in this stay-at-home pub quiz version, it will be easy to cheat.” 7.30-9pm. Tickets £10: thefelixproject.orggreatestquizOur appeal was also boosted by the silent auction, in partnership with Quintessentially Foundation, which closed this week with 135 bids placed for 36 lots and raising almost £40,000.The most highly prized lots were two tickets to a Liverpool FC game, four tickets to the Euro 2021 semi-finals, a video-chat with Spurs coach Jose Mourinho, a private guitar lesson with singer-songwriter Ellie Goulding and a helicopter lesson.The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

After paying rent and all her bills from the universal credit she receives at the beginning of the month, she now finds she has just £4.30 left over for food and nappies for the rest of the month.How to support our campaignSo she is almost entirely dependent on school vouchers available for her oldest two children (£15 per child per week) to buy absolute essentials, and one weekly food package dropped off by the Sufra food bank.“I don’t mind going hungry sometimes, so long as my kids have food,” said Ms Sarri-Gonzalez. “Sometimes I might have just one main meal for myself in a day. There was one point during lockdown I didn’t manage to eat anything for myself for two days, almost three days. But I always set the table for the children – I keep things as normal as possible for them.”“It’s so difficult at the moment. So stressful. I’m hoping when the kids go back to school later in the year I can go back to work and make things easier somehow.”The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project has quadrupled the volume of surplus food it gets out to people in need since the crisis began.The work remains as urgent than ever. The most recent YouGov poll for the Food Foundation charity shows over 1.5 million people in households with children have been unable to access food for economic reasons during the lockdown.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Watching parents struggle to put food on the table and go without food themselves is devastating.”Rebecca Archer and her partner – who have three girls aged eight, six and three at home in London’s High Barnet – have found it difficult to afford enough food during lockdown. “The shopping I do is costing a lot more with them at home all the time,” she said.Once the bills are paid and the main weekly shop is done on a Monday, the couple finds they have about £50 left to get through the week – about half the amount they usually had before the pandemic hit.The family has recently taken advantage of two £15-a-week school vouchers they get for their two oldest girls, and receive some cooked meals from their neighbour Katie-Louise Barber – a volunteer delivering food using The Felix Project’s supplies.“It’s been a real strain. Thinking and worrying about money all the time isn’t easy,” said Ms Archer. “I never thought I’d be worrying about having enough for the children to eat. There was one point we just didn’t have enough for the pre-paid gas meter, so we had to go without that for more than a week.”The Trussell Trust, which runs the country’s biggest network of food banks, has warned food charities cannot cope “indefinitely” with the huge spike in demand for help caused by the pandemic.A coalition of anti-poverty charities had written to the chancellor asking for an emergency income support scheme that would increase child benefits and end the five-week wait for initial universal credit payments.Anthony Cotterill, leader of the Salvation Army in the UK, warned: “It’s years since we have seen poverty to be such a real and present danger for so many people. We are approaching a poverty tipping point.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis. Find out how you can help here.

Everyone is very grateful,’ says a volunteer who also uses service when his own illness means he is unable to pitch inFormer music manager John McIntyre was unsure how he would cope when lockdown began.“I was very scared,” said the 75-year-old who has a respiratory condition and lives alone in a one-bedroom flat in Dalston. “If I caught Covid, I wouldn’t be able to get enough oxygen to the heart. I just had to follow the advice and be safe.” Mr McIntyre, who used to manage the jazz reggae band The Beatroots, has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema.He has relied for his daily meal from local charity Made In Hackney which is supplied by our Help the Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project. Mr McIntyre is one of more than two million people who are classified as “extremely vulnerable” because they have compromised immune systems. For the last 10 weeks, many of them have struggled to get access to food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSince March, volunteers from the River House Trust charity have been dropping off Felix produce to people living with HIV. One such volunteer is former actor Stephen Hart who was diagnosed in 2006. When he is too ill to leave the house, he also uses the food delivery service.Despite being high-risk and a life-long diabetic, Mr Hart has been helping to get food to those more vulnerable than him. He has been unable to work since his health deteriorated two years ago, but Mr Hart, who lives alone in south London, said he wanted to help others.How to support our campaign“When I feel well enough, I pick up boxes from River House and drop them off for people who need them,” he said. “I do it when I can but some days are bad days.”Mr Hart said his condition means sometimes he can’t get out of bed. He occasionally receives a Felix box for himself so he knows he has food when he is too sick to move. “It is reassuring to have food in the house,” he said. “Felix has been a lifeline.”Although the British HIV Association said there “remains no evidence” that people with HIV are at greater risk of Covid-19 infection, those with a low CD4 count – the white blood cells affected by HIV – have been advised to shield.Mr Hart said members of the HIV community have been “nervous” since the outbreak. “There isn’t much specific advice so the community has been trying to look after each other.”A 62-year-old living with HIV for 37 years, who asked not to be named, described how his parcels have helped him. He said: “I pick up the boxes as I don’t have energy to go shopping. They’ve been great.”Mr Hart said it was extremely moving to see the response to his deliveries: “It is amazing. Everyone is very grateful.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

It has four core beliefs: family, integrity, teamwork and success – all integral pillars of its Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme.Put together by Sharon Gray OBE and the federation’s head teachers, it’s designed to welcome pupils back to class after lockdown. “Everybody in the Embark community has done their bit,” says Gray, a headteacher for 20 years, mostly in special schools supporting youngsters experiencing social, emotional and mental health difficulties and schools going through challenges.“It’s been all hands on deck,” executive headteacher and Trust leader of Embark’s schools Matthew Crawford adds. “Even two weeks into lockdown we were thinking about our children returning to school, whatever date that may be.”Safety at school1. Anyone who is unwell or been in contact with somebody showing coronavirus symptoms should stay away from schools, colleges and childcare settings2. Hands should be cleaned more often than usual with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds and dried thoroughly. Alternatively, hand sanitiser or alcohol hand rub can be used3. Promote the ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach to coughing and sneezing4. Clean frequently touched surfaces regularly using standard products, such as detergent and bleach5. Help to minimise contact and mixing by altering classroom layout and timetablesWith regards to physical changes that parents and pupils can expect to see in corridors and classrooms, Embark is working with Government guidance and undertaking a thorough, bespoke risk assessment for each of its schools. “It can’t be a one-size-fits all approach,” Crawford stresses.According to Anna Upton – head of the 240-pupil Chaucer Junior School in Ilkeston, Derbyshire – questionnaires were sent out to reconnect with parents, through which they could express concerns and suggest ideas about the return to classrooms.According to Upton, staggered breaks and how drop-offs will work were important issues that were flagged in questionnaires. “But the risk assessment the Trust has put in has allowed us to make a comprehensive plan and we can communicate that to the parents,” she explains.“What the Trust have done with the programme is to implement nine stages which support our schools to open as safely as possible, supporting the staff parents and the children. The risk assessment means that I, as a headteacher, can do what’s right for my school.”Chair of trustees Sarah Armitage emphasises the importance of teamwork based around a guiding principle: families first. We look after families, so we reach out we talk.” she says.“Then there’s teamwork. Let’s harness the power of the team so it’s not the headteacher sitting by themselves with all these things to think about – that load is shared.”Armitage’s back-to-school outlook is optimistic too: “We have created something with this programme that we hope will be massively beneficial. Our role as leaders is to keep that going, carry on putting emotional needs at the heart of everything we do, because then children are able to learn and benefit – and move through this crisis.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.Wearing face coverings is to be compulsory on public transport in England from 15 June, with fines for those who refuse, transport secretary Grant Shapps has announced.Speaking at the daily Downing Street press conference, Mr Shapps said the move was designed to prevent an upsurge in coronavirus infections as the country moves to the next stage of lockdown relaxation, with non-essential shops allowed to reopen.Mr Shapps said wearing a face covering would be made a “condition of travel” on public transport, allowing passengers to be refused carriage if they do not comply, with the British Transport Police called in to deal with those resisting the rule where necessary. Face coverings are not currently included in the Health Protection Regulations which give the police legal power to take action over lockdown breaches. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Shapps said: “As of Monday 15 June face coverings will become mandatory on public transport.“That doesn’t mean surgical masks, which we must keep for clinical settings. It means the kind of face covering you can easily make at home. There will be exemptions to these rules for very young children, for disabled people and those with breathing difficulties.”He added: “We need to ensure every precaution is taken on buses, trains, aircraft, and on ferries.”Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?“With more people using transport, the evidence suggests wearing face coverings offers some – albeit limited – protection against the spread for the virus.”Frontline staff such as bus drivers will also be required to wear face coverings, and Mr Shapps said the government will work with devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to try to make the change nationwide.The announcement was welcomed by London mayor Sadiq Khan, who has long lobbied for mandatory face coverings on the capital’s Underground system.“I’m pleased that our lobbying has paid off and the government has finally seen sense and made it mandatory for people to wear face coverings on public transport,” said Mr Khan.Mick Whelan, general secretary of the train drivers’ union Aslef, agreed: “This is a sensible step. We have been working closely with the government to ensure that agreed increases in services on Britain’s train and Tube network is done in a safe and controlled manner, to help spread the loading, and maintain social distancing for the safety of passengers and staff.“The instruction to wear face coverings to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus will ease the concerns of people travelling, and working, on the transport network.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailHowever, scientists are ided over the value of homemade face coverings.Dr Antonio Lazzarino, of the department of epidemiology and public health at University College London, warned that their use might encourage people to wash hands less and to make more use of buses and trains, where face coverings will offer no protection against them being infected by touching handrails contaminated with the virus.“It is now commonly accepted that face coverings provide very little protection, if any. But one clear, logical, widely accepted side effect is that face coverings may give an excuse to easing other more important measures,” said Dr Lazzarino.“Will more people use the Tube or buses because they will feel more secure given that everybody wears a face covering? This will increase the risk of transmission.“Will people be able not to contaminate their hands and the handrails by not touching their face coverings and not touching the handrails while standing inside buses and trains? This seems to be impossible to me. Face coverings can therefore be a vehicle of infection, rather than a barrier.”But health care professor Prof Trish Greenhalgh of the University of Oxford said: “Face coverings aren’t 100 per cent effective, but they’re not zero per cent effective either.“I’ve seen evidence that a double layer of cloth is between 60 and 90 per cent effective in stopping the spread of viral-laden droplets coming from the wearer, and also that the same mask is also 30-50 per cent effective at stopping virus particles getting to the wearer. You can argue about the exact percentages, but overall, if everyone wears a face covering when they’re at close quarters, transmission is going to go down dramatically.”Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, said: “This policy will add more burden on the general public to prevent the spread of Covid-19. This is much more complicated than ‘wash your hands for 20 seconds’ or ‘stay at home’. We are asking the whole population of Britain, with no prior experience of mask-wearing, to overnight become competent makers, wearers, and maintainers of PPE.“I have seen no new evidence to suggest why the government is reversing its previous policy, and ignoring its previous scientific guidance and the guidance of the WHO. I’m left wondering if this is a political decision, rather than one based on science.”Labour’s shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon said: “This is just another example of the government being slow to act. Two months ago, Labour immediately backed the Mayor of London’s call for face coverings on public transport to be compulsory. Yet only now Tory ministers are acting.“Two months after first raising this with government we are still yet to hear whether drivers will be issued with gloves, masks, and other PPE items as standard, what specification this PPE should be and, if there isn’t sufficient PPE, whether buses should still run.“We can’t go on like this. We need a comprehensive transport plan to get our public transport moving, to protect staff and to protect passengers.”Network Rail chairman Sir Peter Hendy said he expected most passengers to comply with the requirement to wear face coverings.“I am not expecting a huge upsurge in railway staff having to police this,” he told the No 10 briefing. “I am expecting sensible passengers to do their duty and look after themselves and others.”Mr Shapps said that if people refused to comply they could be fined under new provisions in the national rail conditions of travel and the public service vehicle regulations for buses.“It is a condition of travel. You cannot travel unless you are wearing a face covering,” he said. “There will also be other powers so it could ultimately lead to fines. I very much hope we won’t be in that situation.”He said he did not expect enforcement action to be required on a regular basis, saying: “I expect the vast majority of people won’t need to be forced into this, because wearing a face covering helps protect others and most people simply want to help defeat this disease.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Almost 210,000 coronavirus cases have been confirmed in New York City alone since the US pandemic began, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhilst one million Americans contracted the virus within the initial three months of the pandemic, the past one million cases were contracted within six weeks, according to the data.  The US also continues to have more confirmed Covid-19 cases and deaths – which have passed 112,000 – than any other nation.The National Center for Disaster Preparedness (NCDP), issued a warning this week that the US case count was “multiples more” than the confirmed two million.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?US authorities have otherwise claimed that high testing levels were contributing to the confirmed case count, in comparison to other states and international data.Whilst new coronavirus cases have declined in some parts of the US, including New York, there are now 20 states with rising infection rates as states ease some restrictions. California, Texas, Florida, North Carolina, and Arizona are among 20 states with more cases on average in the past week, according to New York Times analysis. Arizona alone has seen, on average, more than 1,000 new cases each day this week. The highest per capita rate in the US. “It’s very clear that it’s a real increase in community spread,” Will Humble, Arizona Public Health Association executive director, told KJZZ in Phoenix. “It’s not some artifact of additional testing.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.China has removed pangolin parts from its list of traditional medicines, state-backed media reported, in a move campaigners say is a vital step in helping to protect the endangered animal.Pangolins – the world’s most trafficked mammal  – are highly sought after in China and Vietnam for their meat which is considered a delicacy, while their scales are used in traditional medicine and folk remedies.Similar in size to domestic cats and the only mammal covered in scales, all eight pangolin species are protected under international laws but there remains a growing illegal trade of the animals. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis week health authorities omitted pangolin scales from China’s latest Pharmacopoeia, an approved list of traditional drugs and remedies due to “wild resources exhaustion”, according to a report in the Health Times.WildAid CEO Peter Knights said the move was “the greatest single action that could have been taken to save pangolins from extinction.”“The increased protection coupled with the swift and comprehensive closure of live wildlife markets and removal of many wild species from the list of what can be consumed as food in China were already very positive steps to saving the pangolin worldwide and reducing the possibility of them ever being a vector for disease.“And now this announcement, effectively the closure of legal sales of pangolin scales, shutting the last major loophole in pangolin protection efforts,” he added.People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) welcomed China’s decision, but urged action to stop the sale of pangolins on the black market. “PETA gives a nod to China for taking an important step to combat the demand for pangolin scales,” director Elisa Allen told The Independent.“However, as long as it remains desirable and profitable for endangered animals’ body parts to be sold for medicine, wildlife will continue to be killed on the black market.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some scientists believe they may incubate the Covid-19 virus that is thought to have emerged in Wuhan last year and has since swept the globe.Scientists find virus similar to Covid-19 in pangolinsFollowing the outbreak of coronavirus at the end of last year, China banned the consumption of all wild animals in a bid to prevent further outbreaks but many wet markets have since reopened.Earlier this year, The Independent renewed its call for the banning of trade in wild animals to help protect endangered species and avoid future pandemics.“These actions of China will have a real impact, these are steps that were critical, that needed to be taken if real conservation was going to happen for these animals,” said David Olson, director of Conservation at WWF Hong Kong.“Most of the demand for pangolin is coming from traditional Chinese medicine and consumption.

On Monday, Chinese authorities announced that in total there had been 49 new coronavirus cases in the country.The recent outbreak in the capital is linked to a large wholesale food market that sources much of the city’s meat and vegetables. The complex, whose size is equivalent to almost 160 soccer pitches, has been shut as a precaution and tens of thousands of nearby residents are undergoing tests for the virus. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe capital has now had 79 new cases in the last four days, the largest concentration of infection in the city since February. At a press conference on Monday, Xu Hejiang, a spokesman at the Beijing city government, said: The risk of the epidemic spreading is very high, so we should take resolute and decisive measures.”Dozens of people test positive for coronavirus in new China outbreakTrump fans cheer as he describes coronavirus as \u0027plague from China\u0027William Hague calls on UK and China to fight illegal wildlife tradeAs a result of the recent outbreak, some neighbourhoods in the west and southwest of Beijing were classified as medium-risk, which enforces strict controls on the movement of people and vehicles.One neighbourhood near the food market was upgraded to high-risk, with people being warned not to go there. As a result of the spike in the number of infections, Beijing started mass-testing on Sunday. Samples from 8,950 people who had recently been to the food market were collected, with the 6,075 tested so far coming back negative, according to a spokesperson for the Beijing public health commission. Elsewhere, some governments in other cities and provinces warned their citizens against all but essential travel to Beijing. How thousands of Chinese visitors became pawns in the Covid blame gameThis comes as the provinces of Liaoning and Hebei, in the northeast and north of the country respectively, reported a handful of cases linked to the Beijing outbreak.Sichuan in the southwest also confirmed it had one suspected case connected to the capital. Beijing health officials said a preliminary assessment of the gene sequencing of the virus shows that the food market outbreak could have originated in Europe.

It was corrected immediately and the case was resolved – also by the Czech side.”The accidental invasion was launched from a small border village in southern Poland called Pielgrzymow, which sits opposite Czech countryside. A road there serves as a boundary between the two countries.

Couples who live apart will be able to finally meet up and have sex indoors again - as long as one of them is living alone.You can already meet groups of up to six people from dferent households at a time - outside.You are allowed to spend time in gardens, parks and other private outdoor spaces such as gardens or roof terraces.But, you must stick to social distancing rules, which means staying two metresapart.Physical contact is a no-no: hugging, kissing or shaking hands must be avoided unless you are one of the single Brits Mr Johnson referred to.The government says you should not go indoors unless you need the toilet, or are passing through to access the garden. Also, avoid touching surfaces.Andyou use the loo, wash your hands thoroughly, wipe down surfaces, use paper towels and wash or dispose of them safely after use.Most importantly,  you are showing coronavirus symptoms, oryou or any of your household are self-isolating, you should stay at home - this is critical to staying safe and saving lives.England’s deputy chief medical officer, Jenny Harries, emphasised the need for people to remain on their guard.She said: “This is a really, really critical time.England’s deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam urged people must not “tear the pants” out of the tweaked guidelines.TransportWearing a face covering on public transport is compulsory in England, as the rules changed on  June.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: Its a condition of travel, you cannot travel until youre wearing one.Shops and entertainmentMore shops in England reopened on June .All manner of shops from food stores to non-essential businesses selling clothing, shoes and electrical items are now able to reopen, but onlythey follow Government guidelines to make them “Covid-secure.Zoos, safari parks and drive through cinemas are also allowed to operate.Garden centres and DIY shops reopened at least a month before.Supermarkets and chemists have remained open throughout lockdown as they were deemed essential.Places of worshipPlaces of worship reopen but for private prayer only on June .DentistsDental practices reopened their doors on June , allowing doctors to see patients, provided strict rules are met.In the treatment room, dentists must wear full PPE, while social distancing should be observed in the waiting areas.Receptionists must wear a face mask and have a perspex screen separating themselves and patients.Patients will likely have their temperature taken during their visit and declarethey have any Covid- symptoms or not.BarbecuesYou are allowed to have a barbecue or picnic, but you should not pass each other food or drink unless you live together.Dont share utensils or crockery either. Its safer to bring your own.If you are in someone ’s garden, you must not go inside to help the host carry the food out or to help with the washing up.SchoolsReception, years one and six began going back to school in England on June .Nurseries and other early year providers, including childminders, are also allowed to welcome back kids, according to the governments website.But these pupils are not expected toon a full-time basis at this stage, the official guidance adds.Secondary schools, sixth forms, and further education colleges have begun some face-to-face support with year  and  pupils.WorkIf you can do your job from home, then you should continue to do so.Butyou cant work from home - for instance,youre employed in a factory - then its fine to go into work as long as social distancing is maintained, says No.If you need to work in someone s home, for instance,youre a plumber or a childminder, its also fine for you to .You must follow hygiene and social distancing rules, however.Work should not be carried out in the home of someone who is shielding.You should also try to avoid taking public transport to workpossible - the best thing to do is cycle or walkyou can.Outside exerciseYou can travel to outdoor open space irrespective of distance, as long as you canthe same night and do not put others at risk, says the government.Unfortunately, not all councils have reopened public toilets.There were no rule changes to the amount of outside exercise you can do.That means youre allowed to go outside for unlimited walks, runs and workouts daily.But you still need to follow social distancing rules.Clinically extremely vulnerablePeople who are clinically extremely vulnerable are able to leave their homes.Those that have been shielding are at a higher risk of getting seriously ill from coronavirus - for example those who are organ transplant recipients or have severe respiratory conditions.The government says the .million in this category are strongly advised to stay at home as much as possible and keep visits outside to a minimum, for instance once per day.Those who have been shielding remain vulnerable and should continue to take precautions but can now leave their homethey wish, as long as they are able to maintain strict social distancing, the updated guidance adds.HaircutsFor those fed up with colouring their hair, and trimming their locks, youll need to continue doing so, as salons remain closed at this stage.GymsThere are still no plans to reopen gyms yet, although Brits are allowed unlimited outside exercise.PubsPub gardens could reopen on June  in a bid to help save .million hospitality jobs at risk.The beer gardens would have to adhere to social-distancing plans, including ordering drinks via an app.An initial timescale suggested July, but the PM suggested experts are close to a solution to halting the coronavirus spread in bars, which would bring the reopening date forward.The same goes for restaurants - although the majority of eateries have remained open for takeaway during lockdown or have already opened.HolidaysThe Foreign Offices advice is still to refrain from all but essential travel - including in and out of the UK.A -day quarantine period for people arriving into the UK has been implemented from June .Several resorts across Europe, including in Greece and Spain have reopened - but Brits are banned from visiting for a period of time.The Suns travel editor, Lisa Minot, has answered FAQs about summer hols.You also should not travel from England to Wales or Scotland for a holiday.WeddingsWeddings still can’t go ahead.You cannot gather in sufficient numbers indoors to enable a wedding ceremony.Places of worshipAs of June , worshippers will be able to pray in a church, mosque, synagogue, temple or other places of worship. The rules state the opening of religious places will be for private prayer only.A date for when services can resume has not yet been decided.Leaders of the devolved nations are handling lockdown slightly dferently to the PM, although all four governments have stressed the lockdown across the UK will be lted together.Since May , people in Scotland have been allowed to meet in groups of eight, outdoors in parks or gardens, but these gatherings can only include members of two separate households.There have been no changes to rules for people who are shielding.In Wales, people from two households could meet outdoors, as long as they do not travel more than five miles and observe social distancing with restrictions only eased on June .People who have been shielding in Wales will also be able to exercise outdoors and meet people from another household, but must not go into another house or share food.In Northern Ireland, socially distanced meetups are allowed in groups of four to six.The Welsh government is holding off reopening schools until June  - unlike Englands June  .In Wales you shouldnt go to the beach, whereas in England this is allowed.And in Northern Ireland, schools are hoping for a phasedin September.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A face covering can be as simple as a scarf or bandana that ties behind the head.It should cover your mouth and nose while allowing you to breathe comfortably. Before putting your face mask on, wash your hands or use hand sanitiser and repeat after taking it off. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth at all times and store used face coverings in a plastic bag until you have an opportunity to wash them.Do not touch the front of the face covering, or the part of the face covering that has been in contact with your mouth and nose. Once removed, make sure you clean any surfaces the face covering has touched.You should wash a face covering regularly - it can go in with other laundry, using your normal detergent.The Government had previously said that face coverings should not be used by children under the age of two - but it updated its advice on June .It now says that face coverings should not be used by children under the age of three or those who may find it dficult to manage them correctly. For example, primary age children unassisted, or those with respiratory conditions.Children should also only wear a face mask under the supervision of an adult.Experts are still pretty ided on their effectiveness outside of a medical setting.Wearing a mask can act as a physical barrier to prevent infecting othersyou are sick by blocking the droplets that come out when you cough or sneeze.But some experts argue that people can accidentally infect themselves when taking a mask off or they can lead to complacency with other measures such as hand-washing.New evidence from Hong Kong about face masks has been shared confidentially with the World Health Organisation.The data hasnt been made public yet but it reportedly suggests that the protective gear was effective in slowing the spread in Asian countries.Professor Susan Michie, of University College London, said there is not good evidence to suggest wearing masks will cut transmissions.She said: They do not protect against the virus getting into the eyes - only close fitting goggles do this.People may not fit the masks properly or take them on and off. Touching face masks and not taking them off in the correct way may mean people contaminate their hands and spread the virus.People may have a  sense of reassurance and thus pay less attention to other behaviours key to reducing transmission such as social distancing and hand-washing.Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, reviewed  studies which looked at the efficacy of face masks in preventing respiratory illness.He said the research was poor, adding that it was as easy to make an argument for opposing the widespread use of masks as it would be to make an argument promoting their use.Most experts are in agreement that for masks to work as they are intended, they must be used correctly.Dr Jenna Macciochi, a lecturer in immunology at the University of Sussex, told the Mail: To be effective, a mask has to be fitted correctly, worn correctly and disposed of correctly — which is not something the general public has been trained in.She added that not wearing one correctly is potentially more hazardous than not using one at all, as you may infect yourself with the particles the mask is protecting you against when you take it off.The WHO says surgical masks can only help when used with other preventative measures such as frequent hand-washing.On June , the Government announced that it would be mandatory for people to wear face coverings on public transport from June .Prior to that, the Government had only advised the use of face masks in situations where people cannot keep two metres apart - such as in supermarkets.But the new rule means that those who dont wear a face covering on any public transport - including buses, Tubes, trains, ferries and aircraft - could be refused travel, or even face being fined.The Government has said asking people to wear face coverings isnt the same as asking people to wear face masks - and surgical masks should be reserved for frontline healthcare workers.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.The rule is only in place for England at the moment but it could be rolled out to the devolved nations in the future.So far, Scotland has recommended people use face coverings - not masks, for example fabric such as a scarf, to cover their nose and mouth.Northern Ireland has issued the same advice on face coverings.Speaking on May , the UK Governments chief scientic adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said wearing face masks had a marginal but positive impact on the spread of infection.Where masks may have a role is where distancing isnt possible, where there might be undue crowding, he added.But Sir Patrick says wearing a mask should not replace social distancing and hand washing - which are both vital.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

What a hypocritical shambles.But the bigger problem is PHE’s advice to cap class sizes at , making normal school le all but impossible in terms of staffing and space.Its two-metre social-distancing rule is virtually impossible to maintain too, especially in playgrounds.And the reality is that now looks hugely over­cautious and is sabotaging both schools and businesses desperate to reopen.The WHO only recommended one metre. Our scientists doubled it for good measure.Fair enough, perhaps, when infections were soaring.Not now that less than one in , people in England — and falling fast — has Covid.Yes, the virus can kill in extreme circumstances.But our chances of getting it are tiny at two metres and STILL tiny at one.Especially with routine mask use.International studies show reopening schools has barely any effect on increasing infections, among kids or adults.The Government is on the ropes, only prepared to make timid and incremental changes which lead to chaotic and baffling new rules like the new “bubbles” for people living alone.It simply has to be bolder, starting by relaxing the two-metre rule.Now, before it does any more damage.IT’S quite the confession.The same Sage scientists who unanimously advised the Government against an earlier lockdown now say it came too late and may have killed thousands.What, then, should Boris have decided after receiving that advice on March  Perhaps he should have told Britain’s finest epidemiologists: “You clueless clowns don’t know what you’re talking about”, as his prominent critics apparently believe.Instead he deferred to their expertise.Imagine the howling rage of Remainer MPs, journalists and punditsthis Vote Leave Government had not done so.These same champions of hindsight — who had a hissy-fit both over Dominic Cummings attending Sage meetings and over Boris attending too few — now suggest No dithered. But they didn’t.The advice was clear and unanimous. They followed it.The mental gymnastics necessary to blame the Tories for doing both too little and too much, too fast and too slow, would win gold at every Olympics.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So it is extremely confusing why Prince Andrew is resisting demands to meet US officials probing convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and his associates.Department of Justice investigators want to speak to Andrew as a witness. Jeffrey Epstein killed himself in August last year, taking many of his depraved secrets to the grave.Despite this, Andrew has, according to US prosecutors, “repeatedly declined” a request to be interviewed and had “unequivocally” stated he would not come in for one.Instead, his lawyers say he has offered to provide a witness statement, which is not quite the same.Although I guess he knows that already, having submitted to the car crash Newsnight interview with Emily Maitlis, during which he kept digging the hole he was in.If Andrew has got nothing to hide about his relationship with Jeffery Epstein, why did he request to communicate with the FBI through a written statement Friends of the duke this week claimed he was “utterly bewildered” by accusations that he was refusing to help US investigators.But it all just feels a bit . . . murky, doesn’t it He should jump at the chance of properly explaining his relationship with Epstein and his close friend Ghislaine Maxwell.She has been accused of acting as a pimp for Epstein — which her lawyers have denied — and has vanished.No doubt the duke has spent the past few months hoping this story will just go away, or be eclipsed by other, bigger news events. But clearly, this story is going nowhere.The bottom line is thatthe authorities in the US want to interview him, he must speak to them.Then he can repair his reputation and that of the wider Royal Family.He needs to restore the public’s trust in him. In his Newsnight interview he referred to himself, repeatedly, as “honourable”.Well, now is the time to prove it. Just step up, do the FBI interview and get it over and done with.And in all of this furore, let’s not forget Epstein’s victims. If Prince Andrew can shed any light on Epstein, who killed himself before he could go to trial for new sex trafficking charges, then why won’t he Perhaps he feels that, as a member of the Royal Family, he should not be subject to the same kind of scrutiny as “ordinary” people.But that line of thinking won’t cut the mustard in light of the seriousness of the allegations about Epstein — and those who benefitted from spending time with him.Anyone who watched the documentary about victim Virginia Roberts, Epstein and Prince Andrew will agree that it seems unlikely that anyone who knew Epstein would have known something was not right.I knowI had seen what is alleged, I would have walked straight out and to the first police station.But perhaps he can persuade prosecutors otherwise. And anyway, what is plain to see is that Andrew will only get his le back once he has answered some questions and cleared his name.In the meantime, though, I have another, possibly more pressing question that I would like answered: Where the hell has Ghislaine Maxwell disappeared to, and why is she not being interviewed about her role in all of this A good education closes the gap between the advantaged and the disadvantaged. The better your education, the more career choices you have.So when schools closed in March and we were all told to stay at home, a plan for how to reopen them should have been an absolute priority from day one.But schools are still closed to most children – indefinitely and with no firm or credible plan for them to reopen, even in September.We can go to Thorpe Park. We can go to Ikea. But our children cannot go to school.In the meantime, an estimated , kids are currently doing no school-work at all.No one disagrees that lockdown should have included schools. But they need to reopen as soon as it is safe to do so.That might mean cutting class sizes from  to . It might mean half-days for children or twice as many classrooms and teachers, plus proper arrangements for social-distancing.These things all need managing and organising. So why don’t schools ask local business leaders to help with the logistics This is a national crisis and it is turning into a national emergency, as the gulf between the haves and have-nots widens.Of course, some families will not be comfortable sending their children to school. If that is the case, it should be their choice not to send them.But we need to get schools open again, fast.I had a little chuckle while reading the interview with Oscar-winning actress Cate Blanchett.With her four children and long-standing marriage, she seemingly has it all.But I loved her honesty about the reality of home-schooling her kids while also trying to work during lockdown.Cate said: “I know, as a working mother who identies as a feminist . . . it’s a very rare partnership where the men also accept that responsibility in making things work.”She added that her husband, Andrew Upton, bought her a vacuum cleaner for their first anniversary and has also given her a mixer and an ironing board.It could have been me talking, except I wasn’t given a vacuum cleaner.I was given a frying pan.A hospital costs about £million but without doctors and nurses there is no point.So perhaps I would suggest the money goes towards emergency funding to train hospital staff.What would NOT be on my list, though, is a new royal yacht. Yet that is exactly what former trade minister Lord Digby Jones has called for, to lt the nation’s spirits in the wake of the Covid- lockdown.Somehow, I doubt the Queen – who famously uses Tupperware to keep her breakfast cereal fresh – would agree that a new yacht is what is needed in these tough economic times.She might deserve it but wouldn’t want it.There are so many reasons to love the flute-playing American rapper Lizzo.This week she gave us another, with a tweet showing footage of her working out in many dferent guises.A voiceover said: “I’ve been working out consistently for the past five years – and it may come as a surprise to some of y’all that I’m not working out to have your ideal body type.“I’m working out to have MY ideal body type.“And you know what that is  None of your fing business. Because I am beautul. I am strong. I do my job.”I love this message, which is true in so many ways. I really hope women, young and old, take note. Love yourself and, seriously, don’t give a rat’s a what anyone  thinks.Litter – and worse.One green space near me has a sign up saying: “This is a park, not a toilet.”What happened to us during lockdown that we think it is OK to behave like this  Come on, people. We can do better.Having said that, maybe the council needs to put out some more bins.In the Nineties, it seemed barely a day went by without front-page shots of Kate Moss looking worse for wear after a night on the tiles.But those days are gone and there is something strangely comforting about Kate, who is now teetotal, needing to be in bed by pm so she gets her eight hours.Maybe that’s why she still looks so good. She spent years being there and doing that – now it’s time to get her beauty sleep.Not drinking has many benefits. I feel so much better at the end of Dry January than I do end after boozy December. Good for her.It was heartwarming to see Prince Philip in such fine fettle as he turned  last week.I love how dapper he still is. And he has good health, a strong marriage and great wit – le goals for all of us.I do hope he will be celebrating his th birthday – and beyond.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I was so excited for them to hatch but I still had in the back of my mind that these are supermarket eggs.They have been collected, bashed around on a delivery truck, then rattled around on a trolley onto a shelf, picked up and put down by who knows how many people, so they still might not go all the way.Charli was shocked when the ducklings did hatch - and said the experience with the cutest little balls of fluff had been amazing.The only reason I could try was because Im currently furloughed and have the time to raise them to an age where they wont need me all day, she said.Under normal circumstances it wouldnt have been possible or fair on them.A spokeswoman for Clarence Court Farms said: It is a feat of remarkably slim odds that a duckling has been hatched. But we acknowledge that its not impossible.Officials from Waitrose say fertilised eggs were safe to eat and entirely indistinguishable from normal eggs, unless incubated.Our farmers work hard to ensure ducks and drakes are separated correctly, the spokesperson said.As a result of this dficulty in sexing, a male white-feathered duck may very occasionally be left with a group of females, although, these instances are extremely rare.There may also be instances when a wild duck encounters farmed drakes, but again, this is rare.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Below is a breakdown of the new rules.Brits are now allowed to go clothes shopping, to the zoo or to places of worship for private prayer, as the rules officially changed this morning.Face coverings on public transport are also mandatory, meaning you might be denied travelyou’re not wearing one.In schools, meanwhile, more youngsters are allowed in – with older pupils welcomed back in smaller class sizes.But some of the strictest rules will stay in place, with pubs, bars, restaurants and hairdressers closed until July at the earliest, the two-metre rule still unchanged, and the -day quarantine for holidaymakers ing to the UK remaining in place.Here is everything you need to know about the upcoming coronavirus lockdown changes.On Wednesday, June , the Prime Minister announced that people living alone in England will be allowed to stay at someone ’s house from last weekend.Boris Johnson said that Brits who live on their own, or are a single parent with kids under , would be able to visit another household – of any size – without following social distancing rules.Speaking at the Downing Street press conference, the PM said: “All those in a support bubble will be able to act asthey live in the same household, meaning they can spend time together inside each others’ homes and do not need to stay two metres apart.However, Mr Johnson added that “support bubbles must be exclusive”, meaning you can’t change the household you are in a bubble with.There were . million people living alone in the UK last year, according to the Office for National Statistics, and the change could be a huge help for older people suffering from loneliness. Non-essential shops have reopened for the first time in almost three months today.Now, Brits can head out to buy clothes, furniture and kitchenware on the high street.Big brands reopening their branches include Argos, Debenhams, HM, Primark and John Lewis.However, there are plans in place for strict social distancing rules for shoppers.This will likely see one-way systems down the aisles, and limits on the number of customers allowed in store.You will need to wear a face coveringyou want to travel on public transport from today.Speaking in early June, Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, said that Brits could make their mask at home, and shouldn’t wear ones used in hospitals.He told the Downing Street press conference on June : “That doesn’t mean surgical masks, which we must keep for clinical settings. It means the kind of face covering you can easily make at home.”If you’re found not wearing a face covering, you might be refused travel and could face a fine of up to £ - or £paid in  days.There will be exceptions for young kids and disabled people.Also, all hospital visitors must wear face coverings from June .Zoos, safari parks and drive-in cinemas in England are allowed to reopen too.The announcement came amid fears that some zoos would be bankruptedforced to stay closed over the summer.Edward Perry, managing director of Knowsley Safari, in Merseyside, said while it was “very good news”, he wanted the park to have reopened sooner.He commented: “Knowsley Safari has been ready for the past week to safely open to the public and we still can’t understand why it’s been OK for people to jump in their cars to go and get Big Macs but not to come and see our big cats.”However, the Prime Minister has said that some zoo areas will still be off limits – in particular indoor areas like reptile houses.Places of worship across England also opened their doors today.But large gatherings will still not be allowed, meaning people can only pray while following social distancing rules.The Government has said that all churches will need to be cleaned regularly, and books cannot be shared.Places of worship havent been open since March , when lockdown began.There are also set to be some big changes in the classroom, with Year  and Year  pupils allowed back in waves.The Government has announced that only a quarter of kids will be allowed in school at a time – meaning that for some kids, they could get just one full day of teaching each week.Classrooms will have undergone some huge changes since March, with less desks, more frequent cleaning, and only minimal contact between pupils.When they’re not at school, children will still be required to complete remote learning, with the Government saying it should remain “the predominant mode of education”.Plans for other years toto the classroom have been delayed, with the Education Secretary last week saying that not all primary school kids will go back before summer.“We are not able to welcome all primary children back for a full month before the summer,” Gavin Williamson admitted on Tuesday.Some of the biggest changes are still to come, with bars and pubs still shut and the two-metre rule still being enforced.The Government has said that most other shops will be allowed to reopen from July  at the earliest – meaning Brits can get a proper haircut for the first time in months.Meanwhile, social distancing rules are currently under review, with the Government’s scientic advisers looking into whether it can be reduced.This would mean that shops, boozers and restaurants could let more customers in.Air bridges between the UK and other countries – which could see Brits allowed on summer holidays – are also yet to be agreed.Brits who go abroad now must self-isolate for two weeks when theyto the country.However, air bridges could be agreed by June , with Transport Secretary Grant Shapps saying last week that the Government is “actively working” on them.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So it is important that we look at it. “Now that we have made good progress in suppressing the virus we are at a dferent stage in the epidemic than we were at the beginning. That enables us to take a fresh look at this.“Obviously many other countries around the world use a dferent rule and indeed we have seen a couple of countries recently - I think Norway and Denmark - have moved from two metres to something less as well.“But is it important we look at it comprehensively in the round and that is what we will do urgently.”Mr Sunak yesterday urged bargain-hunters to go on a spending spree — to help Britain bounce back from the Covid crisis.He has now insisted slashing the two metre limit could help companies get back on their feet.Mr Sunak added: I can very much understand the positive impact it will have on businesses ability to open and thereby maintain the jobs that they have and make sure the people who work for them can come back to those jobs and remain employed.Yesterday, Labour called for clarity on the Government’s plan to reopen the hospitality sector as well as demanding additional help for businesses forced to stay shut while the two-metre rule is in place.Labour’s Shadow Minister for Business and Consumers Lucy Powell said: “That means no more backroom briefings to Tory MPs and more public advice and guidance to companies.”Britain has kept the two-metre rule when the World Health Organisation says one metre is a safe distance.The WHO advice is followed in Spain, Italy, Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway.In Germany, Poland and the Netherlands the distance is . metres, with just the UK, Switzerland and US staying two metres apart.The risk of catching the virus at one metre is . per cent, compared with . per cent at two metres. But this can be cut dramatically by other measures such as wearing face masks or taking regular breaks.Scientists have drawn up a list of imaginative new ways to make it safer for people to work or socialise within one metre of each other.Mr Johnson is expected to make the cut conditional on a continued fall in the infection rate and bosses agreeing to alternative regulations.Tory MPs and ministers have warned only a third of pubs, restaurants and cafes will open for businessthe two-metre rule stays in place.Last month former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith claimed Britain needed to slash the distance people must be apart to get the nation back in work.The prominent backbencher warned unemployment depends on how quickly the economy starts back up again.He said: “We need to get that moving as quick as possible and Ive certainly been arguing that for some weeks now.The move could be timed for when the hospitality trade reopens in July. To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In the new book, serialised in the \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"Mail on Sunday, it is revealed that some lions are deboned while they are still ALIVE because it gives the skeleton a lucrative pink colour – caused by blood being left in the bones. Unfair Game details a covert operation by security services, including ex-British soldiers, to expose the vile industry by using a dealer as an undercover “double agent.” One of the most serious claims by ex-Tory deputy chairman Lord Ashcroft is that the lions which are born into captivity are raised in such disgusting conditions that they could spread fatal diseases such as tuberculosis and botulism. Dr Peter Caldwell, a wildle vet in Pretoria, said botulism – an infection which attacks the nervous system – could spread to people through infected bones and skin. He said: “If that lion dies from botulism, the people who bred it won’t waste that animal by burying it or burning it. Instead, they will put it into the lion bone and skin trade. “And the toxin remains in the body, so the people who utilise that lion can die a miserable, painful death.”Other diseases spread by lion bones include brucellosis - an infection that causes arthritis and inflammation of the heart - and tuberculosis, which killed . million people globally in .Another shocking claim in the book is that a rich Russian paid one of the farms to let his bloodthirsty pack of hunting dogs savage one of the caged lions to death. When Lord Ashcroft’s lead investigator, who carried out an eight-month probe, presented his evidence to a South African police chief it was rejected and he was told he was “lucky” he was not in jail. The book estimates there are at least , lions, bred in captivity in South Africa, compared to just , in the wild. Sick farm bosses let wealthy hunters into the enclosures to kill the big cats for sport in so-called “canned hunts” which result in , lion deaths every year. Investigators also found that poachers hunt and kill wild lions in neighbouring Botswana by poisoning or shooting them in the stomachs to protect the precious bones. A lion skeleton is worth up to £,. And in sick markets in Johannesburg, lion bones and skins are sold alongside exotic animals such as pangolins – a creature which has been linked to Covid-.Lord Ashcroft writes: So are we sleep-walking straight into a new major public health crisis with the lion bone industry at its core  I fear we are.

The prince has long faced questions about his friendship with financier Epstein, who killed himself in August while awaiting trial on federal charges for the sex trafficking of minors. He was widely criticised for a November interview with the BBCs Emily Maitlis for, among other things, saying he didnt regret the association because it had helped him make contacts that proved useful for his work as a royal. Speaking to the Sunday Times, a source close to the duke said: “I don’t think he regrets the intention behind the interview, which was to clear the air for his family, the royal family and the institution. But the fact he was unable to appropriately or sufficiently convey his sympathy for the victims of Epstein, is of course a source of regret.”Virgina Roberts, who claims she had sex with Andrew aged  after being trafficked by Epstein, took to twitter to respond to the reports. Oh the gull of this toad - he regrets the BBC interview but not his friendship with Epstein because it gave him great contacts and much more, she wrote. This man is not a prince but a facet of insidiousness who has proven to get away with it all.Prince Andrew has always denied any wrongdoing. Recent weeks have also seen the princes legal team engage in a war of words with FBI prosecutors leading the probe into Epsteins crimes. Each side has publicly blamed the other for the fact Andrew is yet to be questioned at part of the investigation. It was reported last week that the US Department of Justice had submitted a formal request to the Home Office for assistance in speaking with Andrew as a witness. The dukes team responded by claiming he had offered his assistance as a witness to the DoJ on at least three occasions since the start of this year, and that the DoJ had breached its own confidentiality rules.Lead federal prosecutor Geoffrey Berman said in response that the prince ly [seeking to] portray himself to the public as eager and willing to cooperate. The prince has... repeatedly declined our request to schedule... an interview and nearly four months ago informed us unequivocally... that he would not come in for such an interview, Berman said.The duke is now reported to be unwilling to help with the probe unless US officials begin to work more honourably. A source close to Andrew told the Sunday Times: “The duke is not going any further in the co-operation process... unless [the DoJ offer] some kind of olive branch to rebuild trust.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

My focus, however, has been on exposing those who raise captive-bred lions, either for their bones or as so-called “trophies” in “canned” hunts, where the lion — sometimes semi-tame and drugged — is shot in an enclosed area with no chance of escape.In an exclusive interview to mark the publication of my new book Unfair Game: An Exposé Of South Africa’s Captive-Bred Lion Industry, which is out tomorrow, Kevin, , spoke about his determination to make a dference.He said he is now prouder of his off-the-pitch exploits relating to wildle than of his cricketing achievements.“I am pleased that I found something that I am keen to do but also I think it is so much greater than any achievement I had on the cricket field,” he said.Sitting in a private room at the Wentworth Club in Surrey, close to his family home, Kevin told me that his love of wild animals stems from his childhood.He was born in Pietermaritzburg, South Africa, in  to an Afrikaner father and an English mother .He said: “A lot of people talk about ‘you are not born in Africa, Africa is born in you’, and that’s so true.“As an African kid, as a boy of the soil, I appreciated what was in the country. And wildle was right up there.”As a youngster, Kevin and his three brothers were taken on safari by his parents to the Kruger National Park in South Africa.“We saw some pretty amazing sights,” he said. His passion for wildle continued during his cricket career, when he often went on safari with family and friends to enjoy watching the “big five”  —  lion, leopard, rhino, elephant and African buffalo.However, his attitude to wildle underwent a major change when he travelled with two friends to South Africa in .Kevin said: “I had just finished with England. After playing a charity game, we went to a couple of safari lodges and went on a rhino micro-chipping experience, where you chip the horn for tracking purposes andthe rhino is poached. Only then did I appreciate what was happening to this beautul, iconic species.“So from  my focus and drive shted away from the international sporting buzz to a much-needed and much more necessary conservation plan. I realised quite what an issue rhino-poaching was, and I realised that I could make a dference by raising awareness, by raising money and by being a voice for an animal that has no voice.“So since  I have been banging the drum about what’s happening in Africa. I can’t tell you how many people now approach me to talk about conservation and not about cricket. The change has been fabulous. To sht from being identied as a familiar face through sport to going into a dferent world where people love animals is something I am incredibly proud of.”As well as establishing a luxury lodge on the edge of the Kruger National Park, Kevin has founded campaign group Save Our Rhino Africa India .It works to help prevent poaching for rhino horn, care for injured and orphaned rhino and to educate people about the fact that the five species of rhino face extinction, with fewer than , left in Africa and Asia.In Africa alone, there are fewer than , white rhinos and for black rhinos the number is below ,. Father-of-two Kevin, who is married to former Liberty X singer Jessica Taylor, spoke emotionally about his love for rhinos: “What is Africa without one of the ‘big five’  What is the world without one of the ‘big five’  That is why the rhino, which is crucially endangered, means so much to me. I just have this love affair with this animal that we are desperate to save.”Kevin is realistic when it comes to the occasional need to kill wild animals.While he strongly opposes trophy-hunting and the hunting of endangered species, he considers that hunting for food and culling wildle can both be legitimate in certain circumstances.“I am just a vocal campaigner on things I don’t think are right, whether it be bullying or plastics in the ocean or protecting wildle,” he said.Many of his strong views, including his anger towards trophy hunters, are aired on his Twitter feed, where he has .million followers.On Twitter, Kevin has highlighted my own wildle work.Last year, I revealed the full horrors of “lion farming” in South Africa, where some , captive lions are bred either for their bones — largely to serve an Asian market — or as “trophies”, most killed in the pretence of a “hunt”.In Africa, captive-bred lions now outnumber wild lions by around four to one. I asked Kevin whether he is ashamed of how some people in the country of his birth abuse lions, the so-called “King Of The Jungle.”He replied: “Absolutely right. I do not understand the end game, the end user, the person that pulls the trigger. I do not understand how you would want to take money out of your pocket to shoot an animal that has been born and raised to be shot.“I don’t understand the brain inside the head that says ‘Look at me in this photo’ [next to a dead wild animal — known as the ‘kill shot’]. It’s just not a space that I live in. It’s just not a world that I live in.“It’s pretty disgusting really to do such a thing. In this trophy photo, you see they [the so-called hunters] are smiling or laughing next to this majestic animal. For me it’s an absolute no-go.”Kevin said that he has long been aware that lion farming and canned hunting exist in South Africa. “It is something that can be stopped and should be stopped.“The human race doesn’t surprise me any more and that’s such a sad thing to say. There are some filthy people out there that don’t have any feeling for animals.”Like me, Kevin wants the UK Government to change the law so that body parts of endangered species can no longer be imported into the country.“I am  per cent against this importation,” he said.Kevin is disappointed the South African government and police have so far refused to act on information I supplied from two undercover investigations which I commissioned.These resulted in my team secretly filming, and eventually identying, many of those guilty of criminal offences. Yet Kevin is not that surprised by the inaction.“In all honestly, South Africa has such big issues — lack of electricity, blood-shedding, corruption within the government who have been looting the country for so many years, that I don’t think this wildle issue is high on their agendaI can be brutally honest,” he said, speaking shortly before the coronavirus pandemic.My respect for Kevin and his work is immense. Unlike many talented sportsman whose careers end because of age or injury, he has a real purpose to his le since retiring as a professional cricketer two years ago.“I did almost everything in the game of cricket, but being able to be a huge voice and a campaigner to try to keep a species alive is . . . something that I love,” he said. Kevin believes his work as a conservationist will be ongoing.“I don’t think it will ever be complete. Unfortunately these horrible people are seeing so much financial gain from killing these animals that it is going to take a lot of amazing people to constantly keep banging the drum to save our animals.”GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Speaking on Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that plans for schools tobefore the summer break had been dropped because the viruss infection rate “is not quite down far enough to change the social distancing measures in schools”.Head teachers association had previously said the plans would not be practicably possible, while teaching unions had raised concerns about the safety of pupils and staff. Running schools safely could mean reducing class sizes by up to a half, and the government is now under pressure to lay out a comprehensive plan for how it intends to see all pupils back by September.

This is quite common in criminal proceedings.It is the duty of the state to prove that a suspect committed a crime. No accused person has to prove his innocence to the investigating authorities.A former German police chief has admitted it was a huge mistake to noty Christian B in  that he was a person of interest in Madeleines disappearance.Cops in Braunschweig sent Christian B a summons seven years ago to appear for questioning in relation to the Madeleine case,Der Spiegelreported last Friday.There are fears the alleged blunder could have allowed him to destroy any evidence that may have existed, experts told the German newspaper.Ulf Kuch, the former head of police in the German city of Braunschweig, said sending the letter was a huge mistake.Mr Kuch said he did not know about the Christian B summons despite his role at the time as supervisor for the officer who issued the notice, Thereported.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

For the first time in three months youaposll be able to go clothes shopping and see the lemurs. But there will be strict social distancing rules in place and firms will be ordered to carry out more hygiene measures than usual. Expect queues outside shops and high demand for tickets for attractions allowed to reopen.

This means breaking the two-metre rule for the first time to hug and kiss, share childcare, stay the night and have sexthataposs your thing. Hereaposs everything you need to know about the lockdown changes this week. Two separate households in England can now join together in a “support bubble” under certain conditions. They won’t need to follow the two-metre rule - meaning they can hug, kiss, share childcare and meals, hang out indoors, stay the night and even have sex for the first time since March . One of the two households in each bubble must be a “single-adult household”. This means either a person who lives alone, or a single parent who lives with children under . The other household they are joining with can be of any size, and can have more than one adult in it. However, in total each bubble must only consist of two households - and each household must keep the arrangement “exclusive”. That means a person living alone cannot form multiple bubbles with multiple households. Likewise, a family cannot form multiple bubbles with more than one lonely relative. For a full explanation and QA click here. What changes in England from June  Non-essential shops reopen  Non-essential shops will be allowed to reopen for the first time for almost three months in England. Stories will need strict social distancing measures, much like those weaposve already seen in supermarkets and other essential stores. Brands vowing to reopen bang on time from June  include Primark, GAME, Debenhams, O, EE and BT, HM, Lush, GAME, H Samuel and Argos. John Lewis is set to open most stores from June , while Next will open a handful followed by others in the coming weeks. Types of shop allowed to reopen include:Fashion shops Charity shops Betting shops and arcades Tailors, dress fitters and fashion designers Auction houses Antique stores Retail art galleries Photography studios Gt shops and retail spaces in theatres, museums, libraries, heritage sites and tourism sites Mobile phone stores Craft fairsFace coverings will be mandatory on public transport  Everyone travelling on public transport in England will be required to wear a face covering from June . Wearing a face covering - not a surgical mask - will be part of the conditions of carriage for travelling on public transport. That means travellers could be refused permission to board buses or trainsthey refuse to comply with the order. Serious offenders could be fined, but ministers have claimed people will largely comply and this wonapost be needed.  Hospital visitors and staff will need to wear face coverings and masks All hospital visitors and outpatients in England will be required to wear face coverings - while all hospital staff will be required to wear higher-grade, type  or  surgical masks. Zoos, safari parks and drive-in cinemasstart to re-open  Zoos, safari parks and drive-in cinemas are set to reopen in England from Monday. Boris Johnson has said they can reopen as long as they follow social distancing rules. That means their on-site cafes and restaurants are expected to operate as take-away only. Only outdoor attractions are allowed to reopen, so reptile houses and indoor aquariums will remain closed. Sites will be operating at reduced capacity, and there may be one-way systems in place. And of course, because very few things are likely to be open it will be busy, you should book your ticket online in advance to ensure youaposre not disappointed when you turn up. Churches reopen but only for private prayer  Places of worship reopen in England from June , but only for private prayer and not for services. Iniduals are expected to be able to reflect and pray while adhering to social-distancing rules - but worship groups, weddings and other services will still not be permitted. In line with government guidance churches will be expected to be deep-cleaned regularly and should remove shared books from public areas. Churches have been closed since  March, following instructions from the Government. School pupils in Years  and a quarter at a time  Secondary schools in England can reopen for Years  and  from June , but not all students will be allowed toat the same time. Only a quarter of eligible pupils will be allowed in school at any one time - meaning schools have had to instigate special timetables and classes to make the system work. Secondary schools are not likely to fully reopen until September at the earliest. Students who dowill be encouraged to travel separately and avoid public transport. The teaching of vulnerable children and those of critical workers in all year groups will continue until the start of the summer holidays. Some primary schools will open a bit further than they are now While around half of the UKaposs primary schools have been open to more pupils from June , some have remained closed to all but key workersapos kids. This meant nursery, reception, year one and year six pupils in some parts of the country havenapost yet got back into the classroom. Some places, like Doncaster and Liverpool, stopped schools reopening on June , but will see them reopening their doors on Monday. Donapost expect more big changes to primary school attendance before September though. Plans for all pupils in Years , ,  and  tofor a month before the summer break in England have been dropped by Education Secretary Gavin Williamson. Instead schools are just being asked to bring back whoever they can, depending on capacity. He told MPs he is now aiming to get all children back to school in September,possible. What has already changed in recent weeks in EnglandJune : Primary schools were asked to reopen to years R,  and  in England - though only about half of them actually did June : People allowed to meet in socially-distanced groups of up to  outdoors, including in private gardens June : Car showrooms and outdoor markets allowed to reopen June : Dentists begin to reopen with extra hygiene measures in place June : -day quarantine comes into forced for those arriving in the UK June : Some parking charges that were suspended . What weaposll still need to wait until July for - or longer Pubs, restaurants and bars Pubs, restaurants, bars and cafes are not expected to reopen in England until July  at the earliest. They can already operate as takeaways - good news for pubs next to parks or beaches - but they canapost have people drinking on the premises, even in the beer garden. Pubs arenapost guaranteed to reopen on July  - thataposs just the starting date for the hospitality and leisure industry so boozers might come later. When they do open itaposll have to be with social distancing rules in place. Hairdressers and nail bars  Hairdressers, barbers and beauty salons are also only opening from July  at the earliest. And like pubs, the date could end up being later because itaposs hard to avoid being in close contact with someone cutting your hair. The two-metre rule Boris Johnson is under pressure to drop the two-metre social distancing rule down to one metre or one and a half. This would increase the risk of catching the virus from someone but allow the economy to restart. The government has made clear that the two-metre rule is still in all its guidance, including draft rules for pubs and cafes to reopen. But that could change in future. Boris Johnson has said he wants to cut the distance but only when itaposs supported by the science. In basic terms, that means waiting until your overall risk from catching the virus in wider society is so low, some extra risk from the person youaposre next to is acceptable. Scientists say youaposre  to  times more at risk from one metre away than two metres away.

It is feared the PM will do everything to avoid it because he knows it will reveal how he mishandled the pandemic. But he has been told lessons from his mistakes must be learnedlives are to be saved in a new peak feared in September. Emma Norris, of the Institute for Government, said: “A rapid review is essential to be better prepared. The Government must learn lessons nowit is to make adjustments and help save lives in the event of a second wave. “This exercise should be launched as soon as possible, reporting by early autumn and sharing findings with the public.” And she says the  should be made up of public health experts, epidemiologists and Whitehall officials, with an independent chair. It would look at PPE failures, test and trace fiasco, care home disasters and how lockdown is being lted. The PM has refused calls for an immediate inquiry, saying although there will be a time to learn lessons he’s been “very proud” of pandemic handling.He also rejected any probe into aide Dominic Cummings who flouted lockdown by driving  miles to Durham. Pandemic predictor Professor Neil Ferguson said the “R” transmission rate needs to be below . to avert a second wave. It currently averages . but the position is “unclear” going forward. That’s why Nightingale hospitals have been put on ice rather than closed down. Professor Ferguson, of Imperial College London, added: “We have a little bit of wiggle room, but it will be a learning experience as to how we allow society to resume while maintaining control of transmission.” An inquiry would also answer the question of whether two-metre social distancing can be reduced to one – a move the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies says is dodgy.  UK chief scientic adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said: “A minute at two metres contact is about the same risk as six seconds at one.” The UK has the second-highest death rate of any major country in the world with  per million of population, behind Belgium’s .

By September local authority providers will face a £.billion bill including £billion on PPE, £billion on staff and £million on deep cleaning. But the Government has only provided half the social care funding needed.  The spread of the virus has been blamed on a failure to test early. At the height of the pandemic the UK conducted . tests per , people compared to Italy’s ., Ireland’s  and Germany’s ..

Adults living alone or single parents living with children under the age of  can form a bubble with one other household which means they will effectively be treated as a single household for the purpose of the lockdown rules. That means they can visit each other indoors in their homes - staying overnightthey wish - and they will not have to observe the two-metre social-distancing rule. These bubbles are strictly exclusive - neither household can form a bubble with anyone . It means elderly people living alone could form a bubble with the household of an adult son or daughter enabling them to visit and even hug their grandchildren for the first time since lockdown. Single parents could pair up with their own parents allowing them to share childcare duties and reuniting grandparents and grandchildren. And couples who do not live together will be able to visit and to stay with each other.  But some scientists have advised against social bubbles. A SAGE report of its meeting on May  said: Sage advised that social bubbles have the potential to create signicant unwanted effects and advised against their introduction in the short term, when other distancing measures have only just been lted or in conjunction with release of other measures. Sage advised strong caution concerning the introduction of social bubbling - particularly in the short term, when other distancing measures have only just been lted or in conjunction with release of other measures.

One woman, who was cycling alone when she was targeted by the ten-strong gang, has spoken out about her ordeal in order to raise awareness of the aposcanal pusherapos gang. Sophie Watson, , said she was attacked by a teenage gang as she rode home to the Jewellery Quarter on the Worcester and Birmingham Canal on Friday evening, June . As she was left bruised and soaking, she came across another woman who appeared to have suffered the same attack.Speaking to BirminghamLive, Sophie said at least five women had been targeted along the canal on the same night.While only one incident has been reported to the police, officers have increased their foot patrols along the canal route. Sophie reported what happened to her, but said there were no witnesses to her attack as the stretch of canal had been quiet at the time. I was coming from the university towards the city centre, along the canal, when I saw around ten boys on bikes shouting between them, she said. I squeezed past - I was right next to the canal - and one of them nudged me in. They just cycled on towards Stirchley, laughing. There was no-one around to call for help so I climbed out and headed on home. But a little further down the canal I saw another woman - roughly the same age as me - being helped out of the water. Two men had stopped to help her. Sheaposd been pushed in too. Sophie later tweeted about her experience and has since heard about other women being pushed in to the canal near Bournville, also on Friday night. I cycle this route most days and had just been out for a bit of exercise. Iaposd travelled down cycle route five to Stichley, then back along the canal, she said. I always wondered when Iaposd end up falling in, I never expected Iaposd be pushed in. People have since contacted me to say they knew of others who had been pushed in around Bournville last night. It was a shock but my biggest worry is that it will deter women from cycling, she added. Iaposll continue to cycle but will steer clear of the canal for a while. The yobs who targeted Ms Watson as she was cycling were said to have been aged between  and . A statement from West Midlands Police read: We were called to reports of a woman cyclist being pushed into a canal near Carver Street, Birmingham just after .pm on Friday evening.

David Banks told The Sun that son Andy, , must have become desperate with all public toilets closed during protests in central London - but had not aimed at the memorial. A photo of Banks in Parliament Square showing a line of urine running behind him has caused outrage due to the fact the memorial was for PC Palmer who was stabbed to death in the  terror attack in Westminster. Violence erupted over the weekend as a far-right demonstration took place after thousands of anti-racism protesters had marched on previous weekends sparked by the death of George Floyd in the US.  Mr Floydaposs death has prompted weeks of discussion and outrage about racism and colonialism in the UK. Mr Banks said his son is not a member of EDL and he would kill himhe joined the far-right group. “Sometimes young lads get a bit desperate. Andy picked a stupid place to go to the toilet,” said the dad. “He’s devastated. He can apologise for being a stupid plonker.  “He was next to it, not on it. All the toilets were closed. Its a silly thing to go and urinate on a public street. “But he’s not the first person to have done that and I don’t suppose he’ll be the last.” Mr Banks said his son had never been in trouble with the police before. On Sunday evening, Scotland Yard said Banks, from Stansted, Essex, had been charged with outraging public decency and remains in custody. The act was widely condemned by politicians including MP Tobias Ellwood, who gave first aid to PC Palmer as he lay dying after being stabbed to death in the grounds of Parliament by Khalid Masood.  Boris Johnson has announced plans for a cross-government commission to examine all aspects of racial inequality in Britain in the wake of two weeks of Black Lives Matter protests. Writing in The Daily , the Prime Minister acknowledged that the country had much more to do to deal with the issue. He said the commission on race and ethnic disparities would look at all aspects of inequality - in employment, in health outcomes, in academic and all other walks of le. Mr Johnson told broadcasters: What I really want to do as Prime Minister is change the narrative so we stop the sense of victimisation and discrimination.  We stamp out racism and we start to have a real expectation of success. Thataposs where I want to get to but it wonapost be easy. The Prime Ministeraposs announcement comes after a statue of Winston Churchill in Parliament Square was boarded up due to vandalism during an anti-racist protest. Members of Saturdayaposs far-right demonstration, which was attended by several hundred mostly white men, claimed to be guarding the statue of Churchill as well as the cenotaph. However, the event turned violent after hundreds of self-proclaimed statue defenders took over areas near the Houses of Parliament and Trafalgar Square and hurled missiles, smoke grenades, glass bottles and flares at police officers. A total of  people were arrested and the protest was condemned by Boris Johnson as racist thuggery and described as mindless hooliganism by police.

Heads are expected to be told they can bring back one extra year groupthey have the capacity to maintain classes of just  pupils. But there will be no extra funding for more teachers or alternative ­premises, such as Portakabins or local community halls. And the Government was accused of failing to back hundreds of ­thousands of disadvantaged kids who do not have proper access to computers or the internet and who may struggle with schoolwork. In the most deprived schools, % of teachers report more than a third of students would not have had use of a device for home learning over the  weeks of lockdown so far. The Government promised , free laptops as part of a £million scheme to help narrow the digital ide – but last week Education Secretary Gavin Williamson admitted just half of those have arrived. The UK coronavirus death toll yesterday rose by  to , – and some experts have warned against children going back to school. But there were growing calls on ministers to address the growing fears for disadvantaged children kept home as research revealed their learning is most likely to suffer. Former PM Tony Blair, ex-chief inspector of schools Sir Michael Wilshaw, four former education ­secretaries, cross-party MPs, teaching unions and charities are among ­signatories to a letter to ministers warning of the risk to education.  The letter says: “This leline has not been available for all, with schools across the country reporting ­struggling families who do not have internet access at home. “Those children who can’t access the same resources as their ­classmates will find themselves even further behind when theyto school. “There is a risk that some may never catch up.” With growing frustration among teachers, MPs and unions over the chaoticof schools, Children’s Commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, warned the right to ­a ­guaranteed education was under threat. She said: “It has taken  years of campaigning to get children into the classroom, ensuring that education was a basic right for all.  “We seem for the first time to be prepared to let that start to go into reverse. And I think that is a very, very dangerous place to be. “We heard from the Prime Minister back in April that education was one of the top three priorities for easing lockdown, but it seems to have been given up on quite easily.” The Government will today come under pressure to provide laptops and internet access to the homes of the most vulnerable children to help them catch up. Labour MP Siobhain McDonagh is presenting a Bill in Parliament calling for all ­children eligible for free school meals to have a broadband ­connection and internet at home. Ministers have also been stung by ­accusations they have put retail ahead of education – especially that of the most deprived – as ­non-essential shops start to reopen today. There are at least , ­disadvantaged children who do not have access to devices Primaries have reopened to Reception classes, Year One and Year Six. Under the push to get more back, it is thought schools may be able to take Year Five pupils,schools can limit the numbers to .

The Duke of York, , is hoping he will be able to resume his senior royal duties, according to the Sunday Times. But the Queenaposs patience with her embattled son is aposwearing thinapos after he got himself into yet another public scrap over the FBIaposs investigation into Epstein, a source told the newspaper. Buckingham Palace is aposfuriousapos with the Duke of York after he rowed with US investigators probing the American billionaire, who died in jail awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Courtiers are accusing the dukeaposs statement to investigators who have requested to quiz him of overshadowing his fatheraposs birthday celebrations.  Prince Philipaposs th birthday was hoped to be a positive moment for the troubled monarchy, but it came in the same week Andrew dominated headlines once again as he slammed US investigators. A source close to the duke told the newspaper the duke regretted the fallout over his disastrous interview with the BBCaposs Emily Maitlis. He had described the widely-mocked interview as a apossuccessapos - but is now said to have expressed regret he failed to apologise to Epsteinaposs victims. The Duke has faced humiliation over his response to questions about his links to disgraced Epstein. The Sunday Times reports today he will refuse to co-operate with the request of US investigators that he travel to the States to help with their inquiries until he gets an aposolive branchapos. In the Newsnight interview he denied having sex with Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre, now Roberts, on three occasions. Giuffre has claimed in US court she was flown across the world by Epstein, including once, in March , to have sex in London with the prince, who has denied her allegation.  The source told the Sunday Times: I donapost think he regrets the intention behind the interview, which was to clear the air for his family, the royal family and the institution. But the fact he was unable to appropriately or sufficiently convey his sympathy for the victims of Epstein, is of course a source of regret. Prince Andrewaposs handling of the saga was said to have dismayed senior Palace courtiers. They claimed the duke still intended to resume a public role, and viewed his step back from senior duties as a apossabbaticalapos rather than a permanent move. They also claimed the duke is conscious of the effect of the scrutiny on him has had on the royal family, also still reeling from Meghan Markle and Prince Harryaposs bombshell exit.  But palace officials were said to be fuming anew after he publicly locked horns with the US Department of Justicein a fresh row last week. The DOJ has filed a Mutual Legal Assistance request to the British government in a bid to force the prince to supply a statement. He issued a scathing statement through his lawyers claiming he had offered at least three times to speak to US investigators and that they had used his status to gain publicity for their inquiry. The source claimed Palace staff were aposfuriousapos at Andrew, saying he propelled himself back into the public spotlight during the Duke of Edinburghaposs birthday week.

Many refugees and asylum seekers endure long, painful and desperate journeys - travelling by overcrowded boats, cramped lorries or on foot as they trek in search of safety. They don’t want to leave their home countries, their family and friends, but when war breaks out they are left with no other option. Tens of thousands of refugees have arrived in the UK in recent years and the majority have grabbed every opportunity they can to make a better le for themselves in their new homeland by studying, volunteering, working and starting their own businesses. Today marks the first day of Refugee Week  , celebrating the contributions, resilience and creativity of refugees. This yearaposs theme is Imagine, and there will be an online programme of virtual workshops and activities. To mark Refugee Week, weaposve spoken to refugees and asylum seekers, many of whom have been volunteering tirelessly during the Covid- pandemic, about their new lives. Mahmoud Juma is a stall manager at Breadwinners Mahmoud came to England at the age of  without any family or friends. The journey from his home country Sudan took more than a year. Since then, he has been building his confidence and recently enrolled at college to study ESOL. He has also joined Breadwinners - a charity and social enterprise, which sees refugees and asylum seekers sell artisan bread on market stalls across London and has been delivering supplies during the Covid crisis. Mahmoud is now a stall manager for their Victoria Park branch. He is also supported by the Dost Centre, which works with newly-arrived young refugees and newly-arrived migrants.  Mahmoud, , says: “Before joining Breadwinners I didn’t have any confidence, I didn’t know any English, but since running the market I have met many dferent people from dferent cultures. It has helped my confidence and I really enjoy it. When I came to England I felt very lucky, because it was the safest place. It was a very, very painful and tough journey to get here. I faced a lot of challenges. When I first arrived I felt alone and I had no support until I came across some charities including Dost Centre. It was Marian from the Dost Centre who told me about the Breadwinners programme. It is great because I have been able to go camping, play football and make new friends thanks to the support from the centre. I feel this is the beginning of my future. During the Covid- crisis, I have delivered bread to  homes, through our new online orders. I have learnt a lot of skills from Breadwinners which will be valuable for my CV. I have a mentor with Breadwinners who has given me a lot of support, she has been texting me everyday to check I am okay during lockdown. In the future I would like to study and do a job in IT and technology.”  Since Breadwinners was set up in , they have helped  refugees and asylum seekers through their two programmes, Risers and Breadwinners. Risers supports young people who are seeking asylum by giving them work experience as market stall assistants. They also provide training and mentoring so they can build their skills and CV for future employment. The Breadwinners programme supports refugees with newly received status who are struggling to find work by providing opportunities for their first employment in the UK. They work as market stall managers, earning the UK Living Wage, until they are ready to find full time jobs or run their own business. Martin Campos, director at Breadwinners, says: The people we support have something very special, they have gone through so much and faced a lot of challenges, they will cherish every opportunity. It is crazy to see how the people we work with develop and how far they come, from when they first started with us. Some of the people we have supported have gone on to work in nursing, the tourism industry, sales and waitering. Zak Mohammed volunteers to deliver food parcels for Hope charity Zak, who is an asylum seeker, came to England in  from East Africa, but he has chosen not to share his past as he finds it too traumatic. Instead he has chosen to look at the positives in his le and is “thankful” for each day and is passionate about helping others. He is a volunteer with Hope - a Christian charity which works with local churches and community groups to support those in need. The Nottingham-based charity also helps to run food banks in the city. Since the start of the pandemic, Zak has delivered around  food parcels a week for the past two months to residents in need with charity volunteer and friend Julie James. He is also a volunteer with Derbyshire Refugee Solidarity and in the past, he has volunteered with a charity which supports children with disabilities called Umbrella and with Sue Ryder.  Zak, , says: “It feels good to help others, I enjoy volunteering. Everyone is dferent, some people like volunteering and doing something to keep busy, but it doesn’t always suit everyone. When I first came to this country I felt alone and I didn’t know anyone and I had nothing to do, which stressed me out. But now I volunteer with the Hope charity, I volunteer with the Derbyshire Refugee Solidarity and I am a keen runner so I have joined a running club in Derbyshire too. I have been delivering food parcels for Hope for about eight weeks now, it has helped me to continue learning English, I meet dferent people, and I have learnt more about Nottingham too. I don’t have any plans for the future, because I have learnt to take each day at a time and to just be happy.” Julie James, a former teacher of  years, now works in the charity sector focusing on refugees and asylum seekers. Julie, , from Nottingham, said: “Every refugee and asylum seeker who I have worked with has wanted to contribute to society in some way or another, or they’ve looked for paid employment and this needs to be celebrated. Through the charities I work with, refugees and asylum seekers have taken part in fundraising, volunteering and day trips out.”Mazin Saad volunteers to deliver food parcels and has been working at the Covid- testing centre Mazin, who is from Sudan, came to this country in  after a seven month journey. He has lived in Doncaster, South Yorkshire and most recently moved to London and was granted refugee status two years ago. Since the start of the Covid- pandemic, Mazin has been volunteering by delivering food parcels to refugees and asylum seekers in his local community. He also worked at a Covid- testing centre in March and he is now in the process of setting up a charity called Sudanese Solidarity Organisation, alongside his day job as a security officer. Mazin is also a member of the Good Chance Theatre where he regularly takes part in shows and workshops. He recently performed a poem about his journey to England for the theatre’s Migration Matters show.  Mazin, , says: Since the moment I was rescued as an asylum seeker by the Royal Navy, I have felt this country has given me so much that I want to give back. I have so many people to thank. During the pandemic I have been helping refugees and asylum seekers to make sure they have food and any support they need. I am looking to continue this work by setting up a charity called Sudanese Solidarity Organisation, we’re in the process of getting it set up and we have just done the logo. We want to eventually reach out to other countries and help as many people as possible. In this country the gap between refugees and asylum seekers is big, asylum seekers have very little money to live on, they need more support.  Over the years I have volunteered with the likes of British Red Cross and British Heart Foundation. It has helped with my confidence and it has allowed me to understand dferent cultures. I have met many dferent people through my volunteer work and have taken part in many social activities, especially with Good Chance Theatre. It has been great to engage in their workshops and help with fundraising too. Before the Covid- pandemic started, I was studying for a foundation course, which I am hoping to continue, which will hopefully allow me to enrol for an undergraduate course.Teem Khan, is an NHS worker, who also has his own fashion brand. He has been making masks. Teem, who is from East Africa, came to this country as a student in . He studied Travel and Tourism. After a y and challenging four year process, Teem went from being an asylum seeker to being granted refugee status  months ago. Teem, who lives in London, has recently started working for the NHS as a warehouse supervisor. Teem has recently started his own fashion brand, with the help of TERN - an organisation which helps refugees start a business. Teem has been making masks during the pandemic. Teem, , says: The process to become a refugee has ruined my mental health, it has been very traumatic, I was not able to work which was very hard for me. It still affects my anxiety today. However I had a lot of support from people, charities and organisations. I have recently started my own fashion brand, but I have had to put this on hold due to the panademic. I am now in week five of my new job. I have also been making masks in my own time. For every mask that I sell, I donate one to an asylum seeker. Asylum Seekers donapost have a lot of money to live on from the Government and buying a mask is probably the last thing on their mind. The masks are colourful, some have sequins, some are plain and some are made from denim, I have also used fabric with printed superheroes on including Toy Story.

Jacob Gregory was having a picnic with his mum Sophie Hall, , and her partner Alex Conduit, , his daughter Bella, six, and their daughter Lily,  months, when the swan flew at him as he enjoyed a swim. The youngster was hauled from the water with blood streaming from his head after the attack by the huge bird which viciously pecked him. He was only saved when his brave mum ed fully-clothed into a river to rescue him. The Year  pupil at Bitham Brook Primary School in Westbury, Wilts, was taken to Frome Community Hospital with a deep wound in his head and is now recovering at home. Sophie Hall, of Oldfield Park, Westbury, said they chose a spot beside the River Wylye at picturesque Hanging Langford a few miles from their home. Jacob was playing in the river in his rubber ring along with a few other children in the water. Out of nowhere, a swan came charging towards him, and mounted him, flapping constantly, and attacked. Blood was pouring from his head. My partner and I ed into the water fully clothed to rescue my son and attempted to deter the swan from further attacking him. After dragging him from the water we were shocked to see he was covered in blood from a gash the swan had made on the back of his head. We took him to the minor injuries unit at Frome Community Hospital where he was treated and is now on medication for the wound. After the swan had been scared off by us, he then went up-stream and attacked another lady. My son was very shaken up but is very proud that he survived an animal attack and enjoys telling his story to people. At the hospital, nursing staff cleaned the wound but were reluctant to glue it closed because of fears that it might be contaminated with germs from the swan. Sophie said: They gave us a week’s supply of antibiotics and some special cream to put on it. The River Wylye between Hanging Langford and Steeple Langford is a popular picnic spot for families as there is parking opposite. Adults and children are able to swim and play in the river and afterwards sunbathe and dry off on the grassy river bank.

For more than  years the South Carolina store sold robes and hosted meetings for white supremacists - including supporters of the American Nazi party. It also sold Confederate memorabilia to sick collectors and was a hub for the KKK, which is responsible for more than  years of racist violence and killings. Now the new owner is fundraising to turn the building in Laurens into a community centre which celebrates ersity. Kindhearted Reverend David Kennedy brought a share in the shop from former Klansman Michael Burden Jr - and after a long legal battle ownership was finally passed to the  The New Beginning Missionary Baptist Church. In an astonishing act of forgiveness Rev Kennedy gave Burden a home, food for his family and a place to worship when he decided to put his former le behind him. Inthe ex-Ku Klux Klan member offered the minister the chance to buy a share of the Redneck Store, which finally closed in , having opened in . The story of Burdenaposs escape from the clutches of the white supremacist group is told in  movie Burden, starring Forrest Whitaker as Rev Kennedy.Back in , Burden said, the Washington Post reported : I want to apologize for causing an eyesore on Laurens.At one point, I believed in this. But it was the wrong belief.A fundraising page calling for the former shop to be turned into a beacon of hope says: Currently, the building sits dilapidated and abandoned, still containing remnants of its past tenant.There are Klan recruitment cards scattered around the main floor, Klan robe order forms still tacked up, and a floor-to-ceiling Swastika mural, left over from the - use of the property by members of the American Nazi Party. These visceral reminders of the building’s not-so-distant past only work to strengthen our resolve to finally create lasting change in Laurens, South Carolina. In place of the far-right meeting place, a new initiative called the Echo Project is being created instead.

Rayshard Brooks died in hospital on Friday night after a scuffle with officers outside a Wendyaposs in Georgia, having allegedly failed a sobriety test and resisting arrest after falling asleep in his car. The -year-old was a father to three girls and also had a stepson, WSB-TV reports. Investigators tonight released footage of the struggle with Atlanta Police that preceded him being shot and killed, which comes only weeks after the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis. It has sparked fresh demonstrations in the streets of Atlanta, which saw the Wendyaposs where Mr Brooks died lit on fire by protesters on Saturday night.to get the Mirroraposs biggest and best stories delivered straight to your inbox at www.mirror email  Images on local television showed the restaurant in flames while an anti-racist march has also completely shut down the Interstate  Highway. Mr Floydaposs death has sparked three weeks of widespread protests against racial discrimination, and in some cases violent clashes with police and right-wing counter-protesters, across the US and around the world.The Georgia Bureau of Investigation has now launched a probe into Mr Brooksapos death. In a statement given to CNN, it says police were called to the restaurant at around .pm on Friday after a man was found to be asleep in his vehicle, blocking the drive-through lane and forcing other customers to drive around him. The GBI says police then gave Mr Brooks a sobriety test, which he failed, leading to the scuffle.  Attorneys L. Chris Stewart and Justin Miller, who are now representing Mr Brooksapos family, released the images on Saturday night. According to broadcaster CBS, he had spent the evening of his death celebrating his eldest daughteraposs birthday. The fatal shooting led to Atlantaaposs police chief, Erika Shields, resigning on Saturday. Shieldsapos statement said: For more than two decades, I have served alongside some of the finest women and men in the Atlanta Police Department. Out of a deep and abiding love for this City and this department, I offered to step aside as police chief. APD has my full support, and Mayor Bottoms has my support on the future direction of this department. I have faith in the Mayor, and it is time for the city to move forward and build trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve. The Atlanta police involved in the shooting have been criticised for the use of firearms, given that Mr Brooks appears to have only had a Taser. The cityaposs mayor, Keisha Lance Bottoms, said: I do not believe that this was a justied use of deadly force and have called for the immediate termination of the officer. US politician Stacey Abrams, a former Georgia political candidate, is among those who have called for restrictions on police use of deadly force.Commenting on Twitter, she said: A Taser is not a deadly weapon. A gun is. Adrenaline and irritation are not the same as mortal fear. Running away should not be punishable by death. Public safety must mean the public is safe. All of us. And Jen Jordan, a Democratic State Senator for Georgiaaposs th District, wrote: Asleep in his car. Thataposs why police were called. Now he is dead after being shot three times in the back as he was running away. #RayshardBrooksshould not be dead.

Jake, , from Manchester often goes in search of the weirdest, and most wonderful buildings and structures as part of his photography project aposAbandoned.aposBut he is best known for his appearances on a number of television shows like Coronation Street, Judge Rinderaposs Crime Stories and Fast and Furious  - which is yet to be released, reported Stoke-On-Trent Live. Before lockdown Jake went in search of the Crewe property after spotting it on Google Maps.Hidden behind an array of trees and overgrown bushes was the abandoned property - and it did not disappoint. He said: I never reveal the exact location of the places I find but this one was near Crewe. The sort of places I find are all old and abandoned so I never know what I am going to find. This house was as though someone just left and never came back. There was a pair of shoes and a sewing machine, and beds still in the house - plus an enormous Quality Street tin which was much bigger than the ones we get now!  The exterior of the property, albeit run-down, shows so much potential with its grand structure and columns surrounding the front door. Upon entering the property, the wallpaper in the hallway was peeling and the pretty geometric design of the floor was barely noticeable beneath the dirt.  Among the dirt and rubble were a number of books and magazines lying open - including a page from the Daily Star dated August ,  - as well as a sewing machine, a pair of menaposs smart shoes and a large tin of Quality Street. Upstairs, you can expect to see one of the bedrooms filled with broken furniture as well as branches pushing their way through the window. In the garden, other than the caravan, Jake spotted an array of car parts strewn around, and a mattress. This is a hobby for me, says Jake.

Discount African Hunts, popular with Brits, operates in Namibia, Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe - offering hunters the chance to kill animals - some endangered - for thousands of pounds.Some of the siteaposs packages even include having the animal carcass shipped back home, reports the Daily Star.“This is the most exciting way to hunt a lion,” a note on the site says, before describing how the wild animals are ambushed by trackers in order for aposhuntersapos to take pot shots with high-powered rles. The site displays menus for what sort of hunts it has available and also features customers boasting about their kills and twisted obsessions with slaughtering animals in the reviews. One hunter, Jacques, shared a picture posing with a dead lioness and said he had realised he “NEEDED to hunt LIONS”. He said of his trip: “After putting on all my layers the hunt began. Holy crap that’s a lion track! After seemingly endless tracking in sand and thorns, Holy crap that’s a lion tail!  “Four days of amazing experiences and close calls later my dream was fulfilled.

Some will run and run while others will make a stand rather quickly. “This hunt is much more exciting than a traditional lion hunt on bait where you just sit in a blind and wait to ambush the lion. “This is the most exciting way to hunt a lion.” The Campaign to Ban Trophy Hunting said: “Humans have no right to take the le of an animal for recreation.

It will be a massive plus that we have something to work to.“Every manager will probably tell you the same – we need a date for when we are going to go back.“But as I said, I am cautious because there is an awful lot going on at the moment, from where you can take your kids to when you can go and meet other people.“Everything is changing and I don’t think football will be any dferent.”Reconstruction plans have now been run up the flagpole and ripped back down again more than once.Consensus, as is so often the case in Scottish football, has proved impossible to reach.Meanwhile clubs like Dundee, whose business model means they sit uncomfortably in the Championship, have been left in limbo.It has affected everyone at the club – and their manager is growing tired of the uncertainty.However, McPake is conscious of the wider issues in today’s world, and his annoyance is tempered by realism.He said: “There is frustration but for me that can’t be put on anyone.“There is a frustration in every industry about where we find ourselves.“We have never been in a situation like this before and what that brings is a real level of uncertainty.“We are looking for answers every day. I would be very reluctant to blame that on a single person or organisation as you can see it right across the world at the minute. But yes, it is frustrating.“If you are looking at it purely from a footballing point of view it is really dficult for the players, for the backroom staff and for the fans.“But again there is a bigger picture here in terms of a health crisis.“We have to be guided by the government and the governing bodies in football but it has not been easy.“Everybody is in the same boat really and there are no real answers to what is happening and when we can get back to what is perceived as normal.“It is dficult – there is no other way of putting it.”For as long as the Championship remains without a definitive restart date, many elements of Dundee’s normal business operations will remain on hold. On the football side, that means recruitment and day-to-day work with players.They are crucial to any club’s success.But McPake insists he – and everybody  at Dens Park who is not furloughed – is doing everything he can to ensure as seamless ato action as possible.“I speak to Johna couple of times a week or maybe more but nothing has really changed,” he said. “We are where we are and there is no definitive date to when we can start back.

We knew we needed to improve his fitness.“Once we got him fit – we needed to get him up to scratch and keep him playing at the same time – and got into his head in terms of how we played, he was great for us.“He was brilliant at taking the ball, getting us up the park and running past defenders, his pace was a major asset.“I didn’t have a lot of hair at the time but I still lost a bit because he would drive you bananas at times with some of the silly things he’d do in good positions.“It goes without saying that he’s matured well beyond that now. He might have lost a bit of pace in recent years but he is a seasoned campaigner.“Back then he was desperate to come up to Scotland and play games.“The big thing we sold him on was the area, the lestyle – the tranquillity up here compared to the hurly-burly down south.“We told him he could get himself on the TV, sell himself in the big games and we were the type of club thatsomeone came in for you with a decent offer, you’d have the option to go.”Hayes – who started out at Reading – eventually left for Aberdeen in  after three years with Inverness.Over  games in five seasons and a League Cup winners’ medal in the Granite City followed before he clinched a £ million move to Celtic.The winger struggled to establish himself as a Hoops regular but he started several crucial games for the Scottish champions, including the  Scottish Cup final triumph over Hearts and the stunning Europa League victory over Lazio in Rome last November.Two months earlier he grabbed the second goal in the Old Firm derby as Neil Lennon’s side beat Rangers - at Ibrox.Hayes’ Parkhead exit – which has also led to interest from his former employers at Pittodrie – came less than two weeks after he picked up his third title medal in three campaigns with the club.Malpas said: “I thought Jonny would’ve got another contract at Celtic and that he would happily have stayed.“But maybe they’re trimming their squad a bit to get players in and maybe there wasn’t going to be the chance to play as many games next season.“He certainly didn’t let Celtic down when he was called upon.“For United, though, good on them for trying to sign Jonny. They’re clearly thinking about the right players and I think that’s the type of player they need.“He’s experienced and he’s played at a very good level. He’s still got pace, he can play in more than one position and he’s good in a dressing room.“I thinkyou were struggling in the middle of the pitch he could do a job there as well.“You’d never say he was the best defender, but he never seems to get a doing from the wide players he plays against.“Sometimes you think he isn’t the best at beating people yet he always seems to get crosses in.“For us at Inverness he was great at getting the ball in the box and created a lot of goals for guys like Adam Rooney.”The former United captain saw a transformation in Hayes during his time with the Dons.He added: “I’ve followed Jonny’s career for years and hoped he would do well.“He was great for us and did everything we asked. He’s one of the many guys you like to think you’ve helped a bit.“Jonny’s really matured and looked after his fitness. At Aberdeen he was playing under a bit more pressure in front of a more demanding crowd and that helped him make the move to Celtic.“He was a cheeky chappie when we had him –he got a bit of stick, he’d give a bit back. Some things used to affect him but I could see a dference at Aberdeen, he’d outgrown that and he could handle that.“We had a great group at Inverness. When we went in, we only kept three or four players and started again.“Graeme Shinnie was one of the kids that was there and he has developed into a right good player as well.“These guys would run through a wall for you and they were a joy to work with.“We didn’t have great facilities but these guys wanted to learn, they wanted to work and they had a great attitude.”Dundee United appoint senior club representative to liaise with Terrors fan groups\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-united-fan-groups-liaison embed # secretNdKFhlJe\" data-secret\"NdKFhlJe\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

They are doing the same to support other temporary NHS services across Scotland.Our people have worked around the clock with health boards across the country to offer new, technical solutions to help frontline health workers get on with their jobs during this crisis.Our frontline staff in contact centres across Scotland – including Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow and Greenock – have risen to this unprecedented challenge. We’ve received a huge surge of customers asking for faster connections to help with home working, home schooling and running their businesses remotely.These colleagues – most of whom can now work from home when they want to – have performed a critical role keeping our customers, including frontline health workers and vulnerable people, connected.The people in our two  contact centres in Scotland are also playing a critical role, answering lesaving emergency calls.I couldn’t be more proud of how my colleagues have responded to these challenges and their desire to help us all through this crisis.Jane Wood, BT Group director in Scotland, Edinburgh.COVID- is seriously not a jokeGlobally kills thousands of folkYou start coughing, you can#t breatheWithout a respirator, this earth you#ll leaveSocial distancing is now in placeKeep two metres apart, not face to faceWash your hands frequently and well hours on surfaces it can dwellShop infrequently, for essentials onlyDon#t mix with othersyou#re lonelyKeep in touch by text and phoneDon#t put yourself at risk, stay aloneIt#s hoped soon this contagion will peakThen we canto normal, so to speakDon#t travel to other towns by carIt can spread the virus near and farSports, socialising and most work on holdThe alternative could cause damage untoldSupport the NHS, essential workers and neighboursThen we#ll defeat this virus by all our laboursDugald MacGilp, Lochgilphead.Sir,We are looking for people who have the passion to bring communities together, believe in the power of co-operation and who hold the well-being of their community at the forefront of their mind.The successful #Member Pioneers# will receive full training and business support as they help groups and iniduals during the coronavirus pandemic and beyond.

Action is needed and the bullies must be confronted. That they were allowed to behave in this way for so long is the real shocker.Their own managers have questions to answer. Why was this not nipped in the bud  Is there an ongoing lack of management training and support Whatever the reasons, it has to stop now.Minard folk were surprised to find themselves in the papers, on television and on the radio this week.

Mindfulness concentrates your mind on the ‘here and now’ and is a proven way of dealing with mild depression or anxiety.Focus on what the plants feel like – not just their fragrance when touched – from leathery and lacey to soft and smooth. You can also mix plants that are great to touch with tactile hard landscaping elements such as a water feature, smooth polished round pebbles or the glazed ceramics.Some top touching plants and features to considerLeaves # try Stachys byzantina, commonly known as Lamb#s Ear. Its soft, downy, furry silver-grey leaves are a favourite among gardeners who tend to use it for ground cover in rich soil. As a contrast there is Acuba japonicawhich has smooth, glossy leathery leaves.Flowers # who can resist touching a bottlebrush Callistemon cintrinus – bundles of tiny delicate stamen flowers form a brush that’s soft to touch – or the soft paper-thin petals of a poppy Papaver orientale.Grasses # run your hand over the arching, thread-like leaves of feathery Stipa tenuissima also known as Mexican feather grass or the more robust drought proof ornamental Festuca glauca with thread-like blue foliage that forms dense mounds.Bark – tree bark can also provide a tactile experience especially when it’s the stunning flowering cherry Prunus serrulate with mahogany coloured bark that peels away in bands round the trunk.Landscaping – you can easily y the textures in your garden by choosing dferent hard landscaping options. If you have smooth pebbles surrounding a water feature that you can run your hand over and through, you could place lichen-covered rocks in another area of the garden.Our general well-being is intrinsically linked to the natural world which is why Thrive – the gardening for health charity – has developed the Thrive Gardening Club.For fortnightly tips on getting the most out of your garden, whatever your age or ability, and information on how gardening can keep you healthy and feeling good visit www.thrive.org.uk get-involved keep-in-touch subscribe-to-gardening-clubThrive is the UK’s leading provider of social and therapeutic horticulture programmes using gardening to bring about positive changes in the lives of people living with disabilities, ill health or mental health issues, or who are isolated, disadvantaged or vulnerable."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 22 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,Mental Health Awareness Week, now in its th year, runs from May  to May .This year, the theme for the week is kindness and across the country, people will be celebrating kindness in digital and creative ways within social distancing restrictions.The last couple of months, with all the uncertainty of the virus and the impact of lockdown, have been an extremely stressful and worrying time for many people across the Highlands and Islands. People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

Cockenzie Power Station site in its National Planning Frameworkdocument to a wider area in its planned revised framework which is under review.This could pave the way for the creation of the ClimatEvolution Zone which could transform the area over the next  years through innovative approaches to development.A public consultation on the vision has been launched by the council and breaks the plans down into dferent themes from environment to travel.It asks people to give their views on its approach to a wide range of issues including access and movement the water environment culture, heritage and leisure greenspace and bioersity strong communities and regeneration and enterprise.However, the vision has already come under fire from Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council which branded it ldquocomplex and unclear.The community council warned that the launch of a new vision for the area three years after the local authority produced its Cockenzie Masterplan document ndash which it has never adopted ndash would leave the public with no confidence in the planning system.East Lothian Council paid consultants to produce the Cockenzie Masterplan for the former Cockenzie Power Station site, which it owns, after a series of public consultations in  but the report remains an informal ldquovisionary document.Now the former power station site could be merged into the new ClimatEvolution Zone with no reference to the original masterplan.Bryan Hickman, community council chairman, said: ldquoThe community council are very concerned by the documents recently published by the council.\"We understood that the changes required for NPF related to the former power station site.\"The y report now extends to Tranent, Prestonpans, Cockenzie and Port Seton, Longniddry and Blindwells as well as the power station site.\"Whilst some of the objectives are to be welcomed, the overall content is complex and unclear and includes such a large area as to be unmanageable in its detail.ldquoThe existing communities have been consulted on the power station site and the result was a masterplan commissioned by the council but not adopted by them.\"We have submitted this masterplan to be included in NPF.\"A number of consultations have taken place in our area and they have come to nothing.\"The feeling is the residents have lost confidence in the system.Neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council also raised concerns about the consultation.Brian Weddell, chairman, questioned whether the proposed train station in the new plan would ever happen, saying: ldquoThere has been no meaningful consultation with local communities who all have concerns about the impact of this development on their communities.The new consultation is based around a study, drawn up in partnership with East Lothian Council, the Scottish Government, The Lothian Drainage Partnership, SEPA, Scottish Water and Scottish Natural Heritage.It considers how the council can take the opportunity of creating a new town at Blindwells and harness the latest technologies to reduce the arearsquos carbon footprint.Among the ideas up for discussion is using groundwater at Blindwells to create waterways and using natural geothermic energy to heat the outdoor water features.Douglas Proudfoot, project leader, said the idea behind the new water features was to avoid putting pipes underground to remove groundwater and utilise it instead as the new town of Blindwells develops on the former opencast coal site of the same name between Longniddry and Tranent.The first houses are due to be built later this year.He said: ldquoWe have a unique opportunity here with a blank canvas for a new town at a time when climate change is central to policies.\"I also think the Covid- pandemic has driven forward the idea that people can work from home and find alternative ways to work with the support of digital technology.Central to the vision is alternative ways to travel with an emphasis on walkways and cycle routes.A new train station at a central hub within an area the council has dubbed Greater Blindwells will provide additional access to public transport.To the north of the central hub between Cockenzie and Port Seton and Longniddry there are proposals for a water park or outdoor leisure area with the potential to create a lido with space for kayaking and other water sports.At the former Cockenzie Power Station site, less than half-a-mile away, a new centre of excellence is proposed described as a training school and ldquoexemplar developmentin modular manufacture and construction.East Lothian MSP Iain Gray welcomed the ambitious strategy.He said: ldquoThe Cockenzie and Blindwells sites are adjacent to one another and it has always been inevitable that their development will be closely linked, so it makes sense to seek to extend National Development status to Blindwells.ldquoThe whole area offers unique potential to transform these former industrial sites into places where people can live and work in a sustainable way.Kenny MacAskill, East Lothian MP, also welcomed the project which will lsquointeractrsquo with neighbouring communities.He said: ldquoThe area is a far wider community and cannot be seen in isolation.The inclusion of adjacent communities is therefore essential.Councillor Norman Hampshire stressed the proposals are not a lsquofinalised masterplanrsquo but rather a ldquohigh level document which sets out an ambitious vision for the area over the coming  years.He said: ldquoItrsquos an exciting opportunity to ensure that one of the key areas of East Lothian, is developed in an innovative way.\"Itrsquos not all about whatrsquos new, though.\"We are looking at enhancing the existing local environment and making the most of the arearsquos unique history as well as its mining and agricultural heritage and the site of the Battle of Prestonpans.The council launched its eightweek consultation on its online hub on Monday.The Scottish Government is revising its National Development Planning Framework which gives an overview of what it wants to see develop on key sites across Scotland.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoWe are grateful for the many views and ideas received in response to early engagement on National Planning Framework  .Our analysis of the responses is underway and will continue over the summer, and we expect to publish an update in the autumn.The council consultation can be found at

Hotels require one space per room.I understand that the parking standards have only recently come into effect and all other licensed premises have the benefit of being historical licensed premises and therefore protected. However, I fully believe that a common sense approach should have been taken in this instance, particularly as I submitted a very detailed travel plan which included not only promoting nearby parking options, bus timetables and taxis but actually incentivised travel to and from The Catrsquos Pyjamas by bus, taxi or on foot. When coming up with the concept of The Catrsquos Pyjamas in late summer early autumn  the first thing I did, being a total novice to owning a bar, was to engage with the licensing department.The licensing standards officer advised me I could operate with occasional licences whilst working toward the full premises licence so after submitting the occasional licence applications I was surprised to be told by planning I needed to submit a change of use application for the occasional licences.Bewildered by the conflicting information but just wishing to do what was required, I immediately submitted the application and paid the associated fee.It is frustrating that I was erroneously informed that a change of use was required for occasional licences which stopped me operating and establishing precedent.It is also frustrating I find myself in this situation because I accepted the advice and guidance of East Lothian Council. I am not seeking to apportion all the blame on the council as I have made mistakes, the biggest of which is being naive enough to believe that those who should have and give you the correct information actually do have and give you the correct information. What we have created at The Catrsquos Pyjamas is truly special. Those who have enjoyed an evening with us will validate that.I have had such incredible support from people across Dunbar and beyond that it continues to blow my mind. There is a real desire for The Catrsquos Pyjamas to work and given the chance it could become something truly amazing which is beneficial not only to the town but the county. But this journey has been very painful and costly.There has been a clear campaign against The Catrsquos Pyjamas to the point of it being a vendetta.Objectors have ly contacted the police to report noise when there was none ndash veried by Police Scotland ndash just to get it on the record ahead of the licensing board hearing. I need to take time to reflect on everything that has happened, to reflect on the impact that it has had on myself and my family. I need to investigate whether another location would be better orthe business model should change.At the moment all I can say is sincere thank you to everyone who has supported this venture from the outset and especially to my family for all the blood, sweat, tears and cash they have put into creating this very special place.Ross Hardie,The Catrsquos Pyjamas,Belhaven,Dunbar"},{"url":null,"title":"kids-create-chain-key-workers-tesco-superstore","story":"They were asked to create a window display for the store by its community champion, Jane Shepherd, and were rewarded with some treats.The hub, based at Pinkie St Peterrsquos Primary School, provides learning and childcare.

School pupils, too, have been subject to major disruption and face an uncertain future as jobs and employment prospects disappear.Some workers and pupils, especially those without access to digital technology and skills, will be particularly hard hit and this is why CGI is keen to reach the most vulnerable to help them stay afloat in a post-Covid world.Through their community engagement programme, the company already has a focus on disadvantaged groups and this will continue and be strengthened further over the next year, according to CGIrsquos Director of Corporate Responsibility,Philippa Green.The company has almost , UK staffand she said they were keen to become involved and do what they could to help society recover.Before the pandemic hit, part of CGIrsquos community programme which focuses on supporting the next generation, was working in schools to interest pupils in careers in science, technology, engineering and maths.This work involved hosting STEM camps which engaged students across the UK in fun STEM related activities. The physical camps were cancelled when schools shut their doors but the organisation quickly pivoted and put a version online to help children, parents and schools through the lockdown.ldquoWe started doing it as an immediate response to the situation, said Green.ldquoLike many other people we thought it was going to be a short term project and children would be going back to school fairly quickly but it is now apparent that it is going to be longer than first expected so we are trying to pivot to the next stage.The content will remain online but unfortunately may not be of much use to pupils without a good digital connection or devices at home.Educationalists have already raised fears that this group of already disadvantaged children will suffer most because of the lockdown and CGI is keen to see how it can help reach them.ldquoMany children will not have been in school for six months which is a very long time. For youngsters thatrsquos a letime! said Green.CGI supports many organisations working with vulnerable and disadvantaged children and is working with them to reach those who do not have access to technology.The physical camps had often been targeted at the most vulnerable children in society and one of the companyrsquos last events in Glasgow was in a special educational needs school.One of the other aspects of the companyrsquos community programme is mentoring, when members go into an event in school to give older children career advice and an idea of what working le is like.ldquoTheir parents and their grandparents may not have worked and so the children may not have any idea about working le, said Green. ldquoEvents have been successful but we would normally do that in a school setting in a hall where our members can have one to one chats with pupils and that is obviously tricky to do at the moment.The company has started to record career mentoring videos to support some community groups.In the meantime there are still some new STEM from Home themes to come online before July and these will be released weekly until the end of June.Another group at the front of minds at CGI are those currently working through CGIrsquos graduate apprenticeships at Glasgow Caledonian and Edinburgh Napier Universities. ldquoWe are clear that these iniduals are key to the future of our business says Green.ldquoMark East and Maria Whittingham in our student recruitment team are working hard to ensure they have practical support whilst also thinking about the solutions for future student recruitment at this very important stage in their careers.Elsewhere, CGI, which supports The Glasgow Timesrsquo Streets Ahead initiative, continues to encourage its members to fundraise, with efforts being moved online. Members are asked to nominate regional charities for the companyrsquos charities fund whilst in recent weeks they have been at work fundraising for a foodbank to help those people hardest hit.Members also still have the opportunity to nominate local community sports teams for kit sponsorship.It is hoped this will come into its own as group physical exercise is increasingly encouraged and people get the chance to re-establish important bonds.RETRAINING WILL ENSURE NO-ONE IF LEFT BEHINDCGI has been in a better position than many companies to weather the pandemic lockdown and, as a result, is keen to help society recover post-Covid.ldquoIn February the world changed but some communities and industries are more impacted than others so it feels a bit remiss not to refocus our efforts for these areas in particular, said the companyrsquos Vice President Lindsay McGranaghan for Scotland.An important part of CGIrsquos work is its community programme and the company is now looking at how it can help communities and schools post-Covid.ldquoWe do a number of things around community benefit but we may have to rethink what we have been doing historically and tailor some of that to meet the impact of Covid, said McGranaghan.ldquoWe need to think about who is going to be most hard hit by the pandemic from an education perspective and whether we tailor our work to be more focused on the vulnerable children, as well as the industries impacted such as those where there have been quite heavy redundancies.Technology and technological skills have proved to be an immense boon during the pandemic lockdown and it is quickly becoming apparent that those who do not have access to technology, or know how to use it properly, are at a distinct disadvantage in the st century.McGranaghan feels that as a technology company, CGI is well placed to help both children and workers without these skills and could help retrain those in danger of being left behind.The company has already been working with the Wise Group in Glasgow to help retrain long term unemployed people in IT skills and is now wonderingthis could be extended to impacted industries and newly unemployed people.ldquoWe are looking at things like retraining opportunities, she said.ldquoWe have been reasonably resilient in the technology industry during Covid just because of the nature of the work we do and the question is whether we could put out a hand to dferent industries during what is going to be a dficult time ldquoWe want to look at how we can do this through our community programme.ldquoI think there is something there not only in terms of supporting the local authorities that we already work with, but also how we help with the recovery process.ldquoGiving back to the local community is very importantto us."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11477211.jpg?type=article-full","title":"coronavirus-edinburgh-family-one-first-bring-covid-scotland","story":"It comes after new genetic research revealed that the disease began circulating in Scotland during February and that it was brought here from continental Europe.Trish Lumsden, , tried to get her eight-year-old son, Christian, tested for the disease when he fell ill with a cough and fever on February , but was told by her GP that it was \"probably a cold\".By that time he had been back at school for nearly two weeks.UK-wide travel guidance on Italy was updated on February , by which time the country - which quickly became Europes Covid hotbed - had recorded hundreds of cases, a handful of deaths, and had quarantined  towns in Lombardy and Veneto.: Coronavirus spreading in Scotland in FebruaryAnyone who had arrived in the UK from northern Italy since February  was urged to self-isolatethey developed symptoms within  days, or to self-isolate as a precaution - regardless of symptoms -they had been in any of the areas by then under lockdown.Like hundreds of other Scottish holidaymakers who had travelled to Europe for the half-term break, the Lumsden family - who had been ski-ing in the Dolomites - ed to Scotland on February , making them exempt from this advice.But it is now thought the virus would have been widespread well before this date in Italyrsquos popular ski resorts and tourist centres such as Venice ndash which the Lumsdens visited hours before flying home.\"We didnt even realise until we go there that the Carnival was on and it was incredibly busy,\" said Mrs Lumsden.\"We couldnt even get into St Marks Square it was so busy.

Edinburgh City Council is to consider a plan to rededicate the statue to those who continued to suffer enslavement during this period.Across the world other statues have been targeted in the wake of international protests about the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis two weeks ago. In Bristol last Sunday, a statue of the th-century slave trader, Edward Colston, was felled by protesters and flung into the harbour.Devine insisted that focusing merely on statues and other artefacts from the past was misplaced. ldquoIf people want to talk about Scottish involvement in slavery they need to be aware of the full picture. In the th and early-th centuries the Scottish nation as a whole was lsquocomplicitrsquo in slavery. The markets and financial s from lsquothe nefarious businessrsquo helped to lay the foundation for modern Scotland and shaped the economy from which we now benefit.In , Devine edited a collection of essays about Scotlandrsquos historic involvement in the slave plantations. Recovering Scotlandrsquos Slavery Past demonstrated how all levels of Scottish society, from the early-th century to the end of slavery in the British Empire, were directly or indirectly affected.:Without slavery Glasgow wouldnt exist: The brutal truth about Scotlands slaving pastldquoThe new research showed that merely concentrating on prominent mercantile figures fails to take account of the fact that Scottish society as a whole benefited from chattel slavery: weavers of lsquoslave clothrsquo for the West Indies fishermen who exported dried fish to feed the slaves workers in the mills who processed the raw cotton harvested by slave labour the crews of the vessels who sailed across the Atlantic and the officials, lawyers and clergymen who administered the slave colonies and the spiritual needs of their owners.ldquoOnly by acknowledging the full extent of this nationrsquos role in slavery can we begin to construct a meaningful programme of response today to that dark period of history.lsquorsquoI am convinced that the evidence we now have suggests Scottish modernisation was even more dependent on the slavery factor than England. This was not because of involvement in the slave trade itself. Ships from Scottish ports rarely took part in that horrible commerce in human beings after . Rather it was based on the overwhelming place of tobacco, sugar and then cotton in Scottish external trade. The remarkable boom in these commodities depended entirely on armies of black slave labourers.In , Glasgow University published a report, based on more than two years of research, that revealed it benefited directly from the slave trade in Africa and the Caribbean in the th and th centuries. Its audit put the figure at pound million in todayrsquos money. Following this the university launched a wide-ranging ldquoreparative justice programme to include the creation of a centre for the study of slavery and to establish ties with the University of the West Indies.The study also raised questions about how the wealth of Glasgow and other parts of Scotland was accumulated. Devine praised the universityrsquos research and openness. ldquoThe research confirms that manmore Scots gained from the colonial trades based on slave labour than the tobacco lords and sugar princes who are now attracting such virulent media and political condemnation, he said.:Hundreds turn out lsquoto protectrsquo Glasgow war memorialldquoTherefore, it follows that today there must be institutions and families with links to those times and who prospered from the profits of chattel slavery. But so far, in Scotland, only the University of Glasgow has admitted how it benefited and how it intends to proceed by way of some form of recompense to the people of the West Indies. Why are others silent ldquoOne positive consequence of the current furore has been the triggering of a deeper awareness of the inequalities that black people in Britain and the US continue to encounter to this day and which have undeniable connections to slavery. ldquoYet in order to begin to heal that wound in Scotland, a soundly-based and open knowledge of the nationrsquos central part in slave history is an essential precondition."},{"url":null,"title":"shops-call-re-opening-date-announced","story":"The Scottish Retail Consortium wants a provisional reopening date so shops can prepare to open their doors to customers again.Non-essential shops have been shut since lockdown began on March  and many are facing a battle to survive the longer their doors remain closed.In England, clothes stores and bookshops are starting to open again from tomorrow but there is no date yet when this might happen in Scotland.Ewan MacDonald-Russell of the Scottish Retail Consortium said: ldquoWe really need an indicative timetable so we can put the right measures in place so wersquore ready to trade and customers can have a bit of confidence when they can come back to shops and get the products wersquore all hoping theyrsquoll want to buy.The Scottish Government has produced a route map out of lockdown with dferent measures occurring at dferent stages but no dates are attached to the phases.A spokesman said: ldquoWe have a review point on Thursday at which time we will consider further, safe progression through the route map.ldquoOur total package for businesses during this unprecedented economic crisis now exceeds pound. billion.

Yoursquod scarcely know that there has been any lting of lockdown. One neighbour says her grandmother scoffs at the idea that the coronavirus crisis is like the last war, when she was a child in a nearby town. Although they were often hungry, they had complete freedom. Even when the air raid siren went, and they had to e into shelters, they did not feel the all-pervasive threat of today.Nor, unless they were extremely remote or unlucky, were people shut off from each other. We talk a lot about the power of modern technology to keep us connected, but in those times, whether you were in a village or a city, there was daily contact with other folk, evenyou lived alone. People wouldnrsquot have felt the need for video calls when they could nip out of theirdoor and visit whoever they liked nearby. The Blitz spirit is not entirely a myth, but the circumstances in which it thrived were very dferent from this pandemic.My mother lived in London and, in , like countless city children, was evacuated to the country. She was luckier than many, being sent not to strangers but to an aunt, who lived in Herefordshire, near the Welsh border. There was no running water, light was by paraffin lamp, her uncle was an irascible war veteran, and her aunt would often retreat to bed for days, finding the extra responsibility rather too much. But for an -year-old, collecting eggs from under hens, sauntering up the lane for still-warm jugs of milk from the farm, and seeing a night-time sky lit by stars was a revelation. From then on, she counted the days until she could leave London forever.Not all evacuees felt the same way. Encountering beetles and bugs for the first time was hard enough, but herds of cows with a bull among them must have been pretty alarming. One boy, who had never previously left the Gallowgate, ran to tell the farmer that ldquothey coos are eating arsquo your grass. Another Glaswegian, taken into a Perthshire home, escaped onto the roof when they ran him a bath. He thought they were trying to drown him.Recalling that period, my mother spoke of country folksrsquo shock at the poverty of inner city children, who had come from slums. Those who organised the mass evacuation were appalled to discover that, when asked to provide each child with a change of clothing, a toothbrush and enough food for a dayrsquos journey, a lot of families were unable to do so. It was a sobering eye-opener. Rural hardship was re, but it did not compare to the scale of urban deprivation: barefoot youngsters with rickets, scurvy, ringworm, or so underfed they were the colour of lard.Itrsquos hard to imagine what it must have felt like to be dropped into a world of fields and trees and pitch black nights, when you were used to well-lit canyons of concrete and stone or to find yourself alone in a bed, when usually therersquod be siblings on all sides, keeping you warm, and your parents only a step away. Some children were so miserable, they had to be sent home. For others, like my mother, it sparked a lelong love of the countryside.Not that she idealised her auntrsquos way of le. Some aspects of it were, for a Londoner, like stepping back in time. Nor, in the s, was there any glamorising of country le. It was often equated with backward attitudes and ignorance. If anything, most villagers dreamed of escaping to the city, or at least the suburbs, and a clean, warm house with all mod-cons.Irsquove been reading Dirk Bogardersquos memoir, Great Meadow, in which he recalls his childhood in the Sussex Downs, from the age of six. Between  and , he spent weekends and long spells of holiday in what his affluent parents called a cottage, but photos show as a substantial house. Later he was packed off to Glasgow, which he loathed, but thatrsquos another story. In Great Meadow, he and his little sister were looked after by a nanny, while his actress mother swanned around in a kimono, and his father raced up and down to London where he was on The Timesrsquos picture desk. Bogarde often mentions the healthiness of the country, compared to London, where public transport was frowned on, because of the risk of germs. This was a legacy, perhaps, of the Spanish flu.Bogarde loved everything about the cottage, but the most noteworthy feature was the outside lavatory. Every Friday he had to dig a hole in the garden and, under cover of dusk, empty the privy bucket into it. His great fear was of tripping, because sanitation was basic. Theyrsquod have a weekly bath, filled by their nanny, but his parents preferred going to the nearest pub for their ablutions.Years ago I visited friends in rural Perthshire who had an outside toilet. I rather liked it: it was made of wood, and smelled of sawdust. Unlike the shed at the bottom of many cottage gardens, one wall was open, so the view was lovely, even in the snow. You didnrsquot have to crunch over snails in the dark to reach it ndash bedrooms came with chamberpots ndash and as a guest there was no fear of ever being asked to empty it.

Exams were also cancelled for the first time ever.The Scottish Government has announced plans to reopen schools on August  with a \"blended\" learning model, which will see pupils spend up to half of their time learning from home.Union leaders have warned this model could last the entire school year.Mr Swinney said it will be a legal requirement for parents to send their children to school, regardless of anxiety about the virus, but the homeschooling portion of the curriculum will not be legally enforced.He told the BBCs Sunday Politics Scotland: \"I dont want it to go on for a minute longer than its necessary, because I accept that the blended learning model is not as good a model as the one that we had before coronavirus had the effect that it had, resulting in lockdown.\"But he said it was \"unlikely\" things wouldto normal before the end of the school year, adding: \"Well have to maintain the social distancing approaches for some considerable time to come.\"There will be changes and dferences in the way we deliver education as a consequence of the requirements of physical distancing.\"There will be, on an ongoing basis, factors that we have to bear in mind in how schools operate but, obviously, the more we can try to expand the capacity and the involvement of young people in their education in face-to-face schooling, well be taking those opportunities when it is safe to do so.\"Mr Swinney said it is possible exams could start later in the year to give pupils more learning time.However they would need to take place early enough to fit in with university and college timetables.Ms Sturgeon was later asked about the issue during her daily coronavirus update.The First Minister said: \"We continue to be cautious in our assessments, because to do anything other than that risks giving people a misleading picture of what the future might look like.\"She added: \"We are being cautious now about theof time that some kind of blended model may be required for.\"But on the other hand, we shouldnt get to a point where we are accepting now that for a certain period of time schooling will not be normal.\"I want to get young people not just back to school, but back to normal schooling as quickly as it is deemed safe to do that, so we will be working hard to do that.\"And I hope it is the case that over the next academic year we do see schools ing to normal, but it is not possible right now for us, at this vantage point, to give dates and say that with certainty.\"Askedparents should prepare for part-time home learning to continue until potentially next summer, Ms Sturgeon said ministers are trying to be as open with people as they can.She said: \"Part of that involves just being open about the uncertainties.\"What John [Swinney] was doing earlier on is what Ive done today, which is to say we have to be frank with people that we dont yet have complete certainty over what the next few months will look like, so we cant rule out some continued change to the model of education that young people will be following, at this stage, over the course of the next academic year.\"Ms Sturgeon said ministers want schools toto normal as quickly as possible.She added: \"These are all really dficult issues to be absolutely certain about right now, which is why sometimes, I suppose, we err on the side of the worst case scenario.\"Were doing everything we can right now to avoid having a second wave of this virus come the autumn [and] winter, but none of us can rule that out right now.\"The First Minister signalled more money could be made available to councils to help schools cope with social distancing measures.She said: \"Local authorities are making plans and putting plans in place for the blended model of learning we will see from August  onwards.\"The Scottish Government will then look at that and we will make judgments around what additional support is going to be necessary.\"Earlier, Mr Swinney said he was supportive of local authorities seeking to use public buildings to hold classes, such as town halls and libraries, as well as hiring more teachers to increase the number of classes and reduce the size of the cohorts, and was willing to enter talks with councils on funding needs.He said: \"What Ive said to local authorities is come forward with those proposals and well look at those proposals.\"Councils are beginning to set out the approaches that theyre taking, they will be considered and assessed by Her Majestys Inspectorate of Education and will be tested to see whether or not these ideas can be utilised.\"A total of , patients have now died in Scotland after testing positive for coronavirus, up by one from , on Saturday.Statistics show that , people have tested positive

Big name retailers moved in and, as time wore on, the ldquoto let signs began to appear.Now, however, that same community spirit that raised pound.s d from local people to pay for their th century fountain is helping to revive Dumfries High Street, in a project that, it is hoped, will provide inspiration forother towns up and down the country.Rather than wait for someone  to step in to breathe new le into the empty shops and buildings, local people are pushing ahead with plans to take back control of their neglected high street.Work is expected to start within weeks on the first High Street building to be reclaimed from lying empty.While its Victorian frontage with all its unique character will remain in place, a pound. million redevelopment will see the former Bakerrsquos Oven shop reborn as seven new affordable rent flats, with space for start-up businesses, art exhibitions and socialand community enterprise projects.Named ldquoThe Oven, it is one of eight retail units included in community-run Midsteeple Quarterrsquos innovative plans to rejuvenate the heart of the town as a place to live, visit, shop, dine and be entertained.The innovative project is being eyed up by towns and organisations across theUK, anxious to seeits community buy-out model might be a viable option to help transform other places hit by a sht towards internet shopping and out of town retail parks.ldquoFor a long time the town centre was bookies, charity shops and empty units. Dumfries has just said lsquoenough is enoughrsquo, says Evie Copland, chairwoman of the community benefit society, Dumfries High Street Ltd, which is behind the Midsteeple Quarter project.ldquoPeople had been buying buildings in the High Street for too long and not givingus something we could be proud of.ldquoAs people began to use their collective voices, we have been able to get a special development off the ground.ldquoThe Oven is the flagship, and a blueprint to showwhat the people of Dumfries can do.The plans have been brewing since  when the townrsquos artist-led development trust, The Stove Network, carried out research to find out what the future of High Street might be and to ask local people what they wanted.ldquoThere were a number of issues, says Scott Mackay, manager of The Midsteeple Quarter.ldquoOne was ownership of High Street buildings. We discovereda lot are owned by absentee landlords who lived where, people notwith a vested interest in the town.ldquoFunds and investment companies had been buying up the buildings and renting out ground floors to national retail chains.

I hope we get the entire truth of this pandemic, herd immunity and the reasons for the languid approach of the British state, but I doubt it. We get a glimpse of Westminster control-freakery with the side-lining of Englandrsquos Chief Nursing Officer Ruth May and Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jonathon Van Tam, and the prevention of others from answering pertinent questions. This, for political, not scientic or health reasons. Everyone has questions to answer, but Westminster is, by far, the most culpable.G R Weir, Ochiltree.THE ldquoevidence Peter Russell assembles for his claim that the Covid- ldquobuck stops with the Scottish Government has more holes than a piece of Emmental cheese.Showing ldquohow and when the Scottish Government was overruled on the issues of lockdown and quarantine may be interesting, but the fact is that their powers are not adequate to accomplish most of what Mr Russell condemns them for not doing.Mr Russell forgets how Lord McConnell, while still First Minister, was slapped down by the Home Office for suggesting that post-graduate students be allowed to remain for a couple of years after their course had completed. Immigration is reserved to Westminster, so the First Minister had no powers to close Scotlandrsquos borders and any suggestion or implication to the contrary is misleading.As far as the lockdown is concerned,put in place before Westminsterrsquos decision, does Mr Russell not consider it probable to the point of near certainty that, their powers over public health notwithstanding, national chains of shops would have gone to court to test the power of the First Minister to close their Scottish branches as excessive, particularly when Westminster had not done the same Moreover, lockdown would mean many employees having no income, but being non-sovereign, and unlike Rishi Sunak, unable to drop a line to Andrew Barclay at the Bank of England asking him to print more money to support the furlough scheme that has put in place a floor for the economy, where was the First Minister to secure the resources to do this  This is why the Nicola Sturgeon and theFirst Minister of Wales have written to the Chancellor asking that the furlough scheme be extended to suit the pace at which the dferent nations leave lockdown.Despite Mr Russellrsquos imaginative demands to see evidence of the Scottish Government taking its own alternative position, none of this challenges Bismarckrsquos view that ldquopolitics is the art of the possible and that what was possible was very much in the gt of the Westminster Government.

I wrote to my MP, John Lamont, on March , nine days before lockdown, strongly supporting the open letter  British scientists had sent that day urging immediate lockdown. I asked my MP to urge the Government to implement immediate social distancing measures. He replied on March : ldquoI strongly believe the British Government is correct to follow what our own advisors tell us. I was so troubled I emailed him on March  and again on March  emphasising the fact that every day of delay was allowing more viral spread, meaning overwhelmed NHS doctors and nurses would soon be making agonising treatment decisions.Mr Lamont believes that local voices should be heard \"at the highest levels\" and is diligent with correspondence. I have asked him repeatedly whether he acted on my March emails. Unfortunately, he declines to answer that question, instead replying tersely on June : ldquoI point out again, the decision on when and how to impose lockdown restrictions here in Scotland is the responsibility of the Scottish Government. Do you dispute that Irsquove been shaken by such a reply from my elected representative. It leaves me feeling more vulnerable and totally unrepresented by the MP who, in mid-March, I asked three times to forward on to Westminster my urgent and relevant health concerns regarding all UK citizens.Earlier action by Boris Johnson in March would have made such a dference. On March  both Denmark and UK had a similar number of recorded cases of coronavirus,  and  cases respectively. On March  Denmark locked down. UK allowed business to continue as usual and inexplicably stopped all virus testing in the community on March  despite WHO advice to \"Test. Test. Test.\" Denmark is now out of lockdown with a Covid death rate of  per million population. UK has an exhausted care system, a death rate of  per million, and worryingly high rates of new infection as we struggle to emerge from lockdown.

Maybe he needed them checked to read his marriage certicate.

The only dference in principle between statues and books, is that the latter are far more widespread and thus more influential on human thought and action.There is a far better way for the Black Lives Matter movement to create the change needed. Demand reparations from the British state, which includes Scotland, for the evil done by the slave trade. Slavery was abolished by a combination of moral pressure and money. The slave owners received compensation for loss of \"property\" at todayrsquos equivalent of pound billion. The slaves got nothing.Adequate reparations is more than a gesture to correct a historical wrong. A large reparations fund should be run by the minorities whose ancestors were exploited. They, better than anyone , know what needs to be done to build their institutional and societal strengths, and so help create a country where respect and equality are the birth right of everyone.

Unsurprisingly, as time passes so businesses from across the region are increasingly seeking clarity on a wide range of issues vital to their survival.With Phase  of the unlocking process due shortly, the FSB believes that this is the perfect time for smaller businesses to question Mr Ewing on what the Scottish Government is doing to support businesses over the next year.The FSB’s Highlands  Islands Area Leader and director of the Kylesku Hotel, Tanja Lister, said: “We know how anxious businesses are becoming about their abilities to survive in this new world and, given that the virus is unpredictable, they clearly want as much clarity as possible so that they can plan their survival strategies once unlocking takes place.“In particular, they want to know when and how unlocking will take place, what they must do to comply with distancing protocols, how local communities will be persuaded that the time is right to unlock, and the nature of the Government-backed business support that will be put in place to carry the regional economy though to next Easter and beyond.“Nobody should think that businesses can go from nought to  in a few days – it will take a long time for them to recover, and many will need ongoing support from governments, public agencies, other businesses and, very importantly, the general public, for many months to come.“We know how heavily engaged Mr Ewing is in his vital role and we are delighted that he is giving up his time to take questions on Monday. This is the perfect time for him to meet Highlands  Islands businesses and we are looking forward to a very productive hour with him.”Questions must be submitted in advance and we will ask as many as we can in the allotted time, say the organisers. Participants can also submit comments during the meeting using Zoom’s ‘Chat’ .The event is free and open to all businesses.

Hundreds were accused after the Horizon system showed cash shortfalls at their branches.Speaking in the House, Mr Carmichael said: “I hope that when he s to the department today he will tell his officials and tell also the Post Office senior management that this review just isn’t going to cut it.#This is a complex case and that is why it requires a judge-led inquiry, and that is what will happen eventually, so why not just cut to the quick and do it now ”Responding for the Government, Paul Scully MP said: “The point is the terms of reference within this review are the same as a judge-led inquiry.#I do not want an inquiry that lasts  years and that sub-postmasters are going to come back time and time again with no justice. This is something that I have been pushing on from the moment that I found out the detail about it, and that is why I am going to drive this through to make sure that the answers are heard and that independent chair gets to the bottom of this and gets some answers.”Reacting after the exchange, Mr Carmichael said: “The minister’s response was inadequate. Postmasters are vital parts of our communities, especially in the outer isles where they sit at the heart of island le. This scandal and the Post Office’s woeful reaction to it have undermined confidence in the treatment of our postmasters. The government must do more to repair that trust, starting with a proper judicial inquiry.“It bears repeating that local post offices have proven their essential role once again during the Covid- crisis. We have to ensure that future postmasters are not put off by this scandal.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Many protesters’ actions, in clear breach of social distancing rules, were dangerous.Yet nobody should shed tears when the bronze statue of a brutal th century Bristol slaver is hauled from his distinguished plinth in the city centre and thrown into the harbour.Our main concern should be how and why it was allowed to stay there for so long.As Edward Colston#s effigy toppled towards the watery grave to which he had consigned so many enslaved Africans, a protestor knelt on Colston#s neck.That was a graphic illustration of the incident which precipitated the storm: the throttling by a Minneapolis police officer of the US citizen George Floyd.George Floyd#s last words were #I can#t breathe#, which applied both literally and to his place in society.There is nothing sacrosanct about most secular statues. Before  statues of Adolf Hitler were commonplace in Europe.You would be hard pressed to find one now.The same applies to Josef Stalin in most of the former Soviet territories.Just outside New Delhi there is a lonely and extensive graveyard of hundreds of statues of former eminences of the British colonial Raj. Wild dogs roam among them.Closer to home, Glasgow#s and Edinburgh#s exploitation of slavery is being recognised by the alteration of Glasgow street names and a plaque in Edinburgh#s St Andrew#s Square by the -foot statue of Henry Dundas, which will detail his connections with the slave trade.It#s either that or throw him in the Forth.We were no innocents in this field. In , no fewer than  per cent of Jamaican slave plantations were owned by Scots.Research by University College London has revealed that when slavery in British territory was abolished in , the equivalent of £ billon in compensation was handed out to just over  Scottish proprietors.They were not all in Glasgow and Edinburgh.Donald Martin of Monkstadt in Skye cashed in on his ill-gotten gains. So did Alexander MacLean of North Uist.The Raasay proprietor George Rainy banked his share from human traffic, as did Donald MacLeod of Lewis and Alexander McBarnet of Attadale.There are no statues of those gentlemen to throw in the sea.But the next time somebody suggests a similar fate for the statue of the Duke of Sutherland on Ben Bhraggie # a fate to which we would have little objection # we should remember that black lives also matter.They did then and they do now.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/HWRC__Portree_Re_Opening_15th_June_graphic-scaled.jpg","title":"portree recycling centre to re open on","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoineand receive confirmation before travelling to the site.The Portree site is open for essential waste disposal only, and householders are advised that journeys to a HWRC must only be undertakentheir waste cannot be stored at home safely.

Orwe the providers are the birds, desperately hoping for an income, fat and seed to feed us after an extra-long winter.Social media fluttered with posts from businesses stating ‘we hope to be open’, the sensible ones being aware of Fergus Ewing’s proviso: “This date cannot be definitive and is conditional on public health advice and progression to phase three of the route map.”While a lot of work will need to be done, practicalities and protocols worked out, how do we clean rooms, how do we ‘meet and greet’, do we leave rooms fallow for  hours, do we use PPE when cleaning, I think as much work needs to be done in the wider community.How are the visitors going to eat, how are they going to shop I have seen some quite lax adherence to protection in local shops with face covering usage fairly minimal at best.We have probably got away with this behaviour due to the low numbers of cases outwith the care home community.This could change with an influx of people from away. Any vigilantism must be directed at ourselves and the messages we put out when we go about our day to day business as lockdown eases.Protect ourselves and others.Those vulnerable people we have been looking after with prescription runs and message collections, some of them might not be looking forward to an influx of staycationers.What  are they bringing with their much-needed cash None of these problems are insurmountable. Guidelines will be available and in the month ahead, confidence will hopefullyand a dose of common sense will go a long way to making things work.The talk is that furlough is just the precursor to redundancy, and the economy will be struggling in all sectors.The knock on is likely to be fewer visitors with less money, and of course with the quarantine enforcement for overseas visitors, there won’t be many coming from afar.I hope the tourismwill be a trickle, then a stream, in order for us all to get used to how it can work.Despite being involved in the business I actually hope that it never s to the flood, the tsunami of the last two years, where the danger was the destruction of our environment and our community.We were perhaps too busy making money to spend time with our families, friends and neighbours.While loving the quiet roads, the time spent with family, and the time spent re-evaluating prioritiesit couldn’t last for ever.The savings are being eaten into, the government assistance also doesn’t last forever, reality looms.There is an economic model of price and product determination, that everybody is acutely aware of called “supply and demand’.In recent years as the visitor numbers went through the roof, and perhaps became unsustainable, bed provision rose, spare rooms developed, cabins and pods built, garages renovated.Still numbers rose, and so did the prices, a simple correlation.There is likely to now be an oversupply of bed provision, the economists would foresee a reduction in price as people compete for a smaller market.This may at first bring prices down to a realistic level, there was perhaps a danger that Skye was becoming a rich person’s destination.A possible consequence may be what I have heard described as “a race to the bottom”, with what is effectively a price war, and possibly falling too far.This when the product suddenly has become more expensive to manage, rooms costing more to clean, hotels only being able to cope with fewer guests to comply with social distancing.We have a free market economy, there is little or no control, people can charge what they like, and undercutting is a valid entrepreneurial technique do something better cheaper#!I mentioned weeks ago, for many, the tourist dollar is the icing on the pension cake, a second income to a professional wage.Perhaps there is a fine line between need and greed.Some tourist operators have been forced to use food banks and needing help from the Skye Community Response group during lockdown.As business s, and these people can begin rebuilding their livelihoods, perhaps others have to decide what their own needs are.The pension or the wage might be enough.One of the reasons I love starlings is the incredible murmurations they create in autumn, just before roosting in the evenings.These bickering birds who flutter and jostle around the trees, for twenty minutes or so before descending to reeds and branch to sleep, put on a display with no equal in nature.Moving in unison, they create patterns in the sky, shapes, forms, dance. Apparently, each bird affects the six or seven around it but a flock of tens of thousands moves asone, producing something beautul.Community can be like that.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/KC-Photo.jpg","title":"delight as kyleakin connections project to take ownership of its","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe project has been successful with its application to the Scottish Land Fund and has been awarded £, to buy the Old School in Kyleakin.Kyleakin Connections, a charity formerly known as Skye and Lochalsh Association for Disability, has been using the building for nearly  years as a day resource for adults with learning disabilities.This funding will allow Kyleakin Connections to buy the premises from Highland Council.The present services will continue to be delivered from the premises, including a range of activities which focus on increasing the independent living skills of the attenders, encouraging health and wellbeing and interacting with the wider community.The Nice Café and Bookshop, operated by the attenders one day per week, has proved to be a popular enterprise.The Old School is currently also being used by a number of local groups as a complement to the larger community hall.The purchase of the building will open up other possibilities and plans are in progress to expand and develop the facilities to meet the present and future needs of groups, especially the more vulnerable, within South Skye and Lochalsh.Dr Audrey Sinclair, Chairperson of Kyleakin Connections Board said: “We are delighted with the news.#Not only will it allow us to carry on our normal services, we shall be able to expand our activities and extend the usage of the building to other groups in the community.#Kyleakin Connections has been fortunate for many years to have a loyal group of members and friends and we are grateful for their support and encouragement with this project.#I would also like to acknowledge the Highland Council, the present owners of the Old School, for their positive response to our request to purchase the premises.#At a time of so much uncertainty and sad news during this Covid- crisis, it is refreshing to be able to bring some good news into the community and give everyone something to look forward to.#We are especially looking forward to when we can hold an event to celebrate the acquisition of the premises.”Local Councillor John Finlayson said: “I am delighted to have been involved in the discussions about the purchase of the building and I also welcome the positive relationships that have been further established between the Highland Council and the Board of Kyleakin Connections, to further develop the exciting future of this important and community-based group who deliver such a key service.#As someone who lives in the village of Kyleakin, I know how important Kyleakin Connections is to both the users and the local community.”The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3168596.jpg--.jpg?1591792177000\n","title":"low emission funds welcomed by wrightbus","story":"Following this mornings announcement by Northern Irelands Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon pledging poundm for low emission buses, Ballymena-based bus manufacturer Wrightbus has said it is delighted with the commitment to invest in a green recovery.

Meter readers will be able to take readings from meters located in outside positions as normal.NIE Networks is urging customers to protect its meter readers and themselves by continuing to observe social distancing protocols. Ben Cupples, Meter Reading Manager at NIE Networks, explained the importance of recording a precise meter reading for the customer.“Providing a precise meter reading will ensure that your electricity bills accurately reflect your consumption,” he said. “Our meter readers will call to your home and will record the reading you provide while we wait.“If you are unable to read your meter for any reason oryou are not at home when we call, we will leave a card with information on how to submit your meter reading online via the NIE Networks website, via email or over the phone.”Mr Cupples explained that while meter reading activity would resume it would only be carried out with the health and safety of the public and meter readers in mind.“The safety of our employees and customers is our utmost priority. “If you see our meter readers out and about, we would ask that you please help them by standing at least two metres away. Likewise, we will stand at least two metres from customers’ doors at all times.“We are continually reviewing how we undertake our meter reading activities in light of COVID- and we are looking forward to being able to resume our normal way of working with customers at some stage, but we will only make that decision when it’s safe to do so.” NIE Networks is reminding customers that you only need to submit your reading to either NIE Networks or your supplier – there is no need to do it twice. Customers unable to submit a meter reading will receive an estimated bill from their supplier based on their usage history.If a member of the NIE Networks team arrives at the door, they will always show identication. If a customer is concerned about the identity of a caller to their home they can call the PSNI ‘Quick Check’ service on .

The film follows a group of four young misfits as they set out to find the treasure of a long-lost pirate on their last weekend living in their under-threat neighbourhood.A noisy, high-energy and light-hearted watch, it was the perfect feelgood film for a sunny Sunday evening amid the current doom and gloom of the world.Among the spectators were die-hard fans of the movie, Nicky Kells and Michelle Currie. and Michelle Currie from Ballynure\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news f .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news f .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news f .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news f .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news f .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   and Michelle Currie from Ballynure\"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose and Michelle Currie from Ballynure\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news f .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news f .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news f .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news f .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news f .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   and Michelle Currie from Ballynure\"Nicky Kellsand Michelle Currie from Ballynure FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappNicky Kellsand Michelle Currie from BallynureThe couple, who travelled from Ballynure for the occasion, say they were glad of the excuse to leave the house and have some sense of normality for the evening.We love The Goonies, it#s one of my favourite movies. To see it on a big screen will be great, said Nicky . It#s really strange that we haven#t been able to get to the cinema in so long. So, it is nice to just get out to do something dferent is a novelty now.Waiting patiently for the film to get under way, the Co Antrim pair praised the smooth running of the event, which was organised by local firms Red Box Media Productions and MayWe, a Belfast-based event management company.Cars were positioned two metres apart in line with social distancing guidelines and the field was lined with portable toilets for convenience, each one monitored by stewards and cleaned after every use.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseReporter Jenna Gardiner FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappReporter Jenna GardinerEven as soon as we pulled in we were impressed, it#s been very well organised, Nicky said. I couldn#t believe how clean the toilets were, especially for an outdoor event.The view is cracker with the screen positioned just in front of the Harland  Wolff cranes, added Michelle . The setting is just lovely.The couple say they are keen toto the drive-in cinema should it continue when the rest of normal le resumes.Compared with those distant memories of my pre-Covid cinema trips, watching from the car was a convenient experience.While drive-in cinemas are a relatively new attraction to Northern Ireland, borne out of the pandemic, I was struck by how nostalgic an experience it was to join hundreds of others to spectate from the car.Perhaps that#s down to the fact I#ve only ever seen it done in Grease, or due to the now-dated special effects of the film, but the whole ritual certainly felt like a blast from the past.One new novelty of the experience was the lack of distractions, with no coughing or sneezing, people using their phones or pesky whispers to contend with.Accessed by radio, we controlled the sound and volume ourselves and could recline our seats as far as we liked.Another plus for the spectators is that by attending the screening they were also helping in the fight against coronavirus, with all profits going towards vital research at Queen#s University Belfast.Without any indication of adate for conventional cinemas in Northern Ireland, the drive-in event offers a new prospect for movie buffs across the country.Around , cars attended throughout the day for four dferent classic movies, including The Lion King, Frozen  and Back To The Future, with an additional three films shown on Saturday.Certainly a fun way to spend an afternoon, the event kicked off with an interactive quiz to test our knowledge of The Goonies before the film started. Afterwards, it ended with a round of applause - or rather, a honking of horns - as the credits rolled on the Steven Spielberg classic.

The principals also asked all grammar schools to suspend the tests. Sinn Fein education spokesperson Karen Mullan welcomed the intervention.She said: A growing number of grammar schools across the north have already shown leadership and announced they are suspending the use of academic selection tests this year as a result of the Covid- pandemic.I would call on the remaining grammar schools which are still intent on using these unfair, unnecessary and unregulated tests to heed this call and abandon the use of academic selection this year and for good.Unofficial transfer tests have been used since the abolition of the -plus in  and are run by private test providers Association for Quality Educationand the Post-Primary Transfer Consortium .So far,  Catholic grammar schools and the integrated school Lagan College have confirmed they will not use the test results to admit pupils in .The Catholic Principals# Association, which wants a complete end to academic selection, is also calling for the tests to be cancelled in future years due to the impact of the coronavirus. Its chairman Kieran O#Neill said: The grammar schools that have already made the decision to suspend the use for this year have led the way.And whilst that is to be commended, there are still a number of Catholic grammars and indeed other grammars across the province, that haven#t done so.Mr O#Neill added: The current Year  children have just had something like four months out of school. Next year, following the formula suggested by Education Minister Peter Weir, they may have two days in school and two days off school and, depending how long this continues, they will receive % of their education for their whole P year.Belfast Most ReadNorthern Ireland town hall funded by slave trader #should be renamed#No regrets: Martina Purdy moves from sister to saint as ex-reporter who trained as nun takes on new roleCoronavirus: Date for NI hairdressers and gyms to reopen could be earlier than July  Belfast barbers# customers could end up half cut in garage salon serving boutique beerNo further Covid- deaths in Northern Ireland last  hours, Department of Health confirms,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Singing is also discouraged, and the passing of an offering plate among worshippers must not be your practice for the foreseeable future.The document says that in relation to the administration of the sacraments, guidance is still being considered by Church leaders and will be communicated in due course.Rev Trevor Gribben, clerk to the General Assembly, said the lockdown restrictions had been a painful experience for worshippers. The past three months of lockdown across the island of Ireland has presented unprecedented challenges, he said. For our ministers and congregations, this has included the enforced closure of our church buildings and an inability to meet together for worship face-to-face. While undoubtedly this has been a painful experience for many, I have been encouraged to see how our people have adapted to share God#s Word creatively online, and keep in contact with members and others in the community through phone calls, emails and old-fashioned letters.He said theto normal church services posed more complex problems than the sudden closure had. As lockdown restrictions gradually ease, our congregations must think carefully and responsibly about the practical preparations necessary to facilitate theof worship services and other aspects of church le, he added. Each congregation#s circumstances will be dferent and they will come to a iety of decisions about what activities to recommence, and how quickly this can happen. However, meeting together with brothers and sisters in Christ is central to Christian le and a primary expression of church as the family of God.And we look forward to having the opportunity to do so once again.Belfast Most ReadNorthern Ireland town hall funded by slave trader #should be renamed#No regrets: Martina Purdy moves from sister to saint as ex-reporter who trained as nun takes on new roleCoronavirus: Date for NI hairdressers and gyms to reopen could be earlier than July  Belfast barbers# customers could end up half cut in garage salon serving boutique beerTributes to motocross fan Brendan Graham, discovered dead at Desertmartin track,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Most in doubt is the position of the Green Party#s grassroots, where a two-thirds majority is needed to get the deal over the line.Negotiating teams from all three parties broke up in the early hours of yesterday morning after finishing a draft Programme for Government to be considered by their party leaders.Fianna Fail#s Micheal Martin, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar of Fine Gael and Green leader Eamon Ryan met last night to thrash out outstanding issues like the state pension age, plans for income tax and future increases in carbon tax. But Fianna Fail and Fine Gael have agreed to the Green Party#s red-line demand that carbon emissions be cut by an average of %-a-year. The position of the party#s deputy leader Catherine Martin - who is challenging Mr Ryan for his job - will be closely watched as a signal of whether or not the Greens# wider membership will approve the deal.Her supporters in the looming leadership battle have been among the most vocal sceptics of entering government with the two larger parties.Ms Martin - who had been opposed to entering talks with Fianna Fail and Fine Gael - was silent last night, though sources involved in the talks believe she will back the agreed deal.A Fianna Fail source said Ms Martin has given no indication that she#s not on board with the deal while a senior Fine Gael figure said it would be hard for her not to back it as she was at all the meetings where the agreement was reached. A Green source said Ms Martin worked incredibly hard on the draft Programme and has been part of every call we#ve made during this process.TDs and senators from all three parties are to examine the fine details of the proposed coalition today before their wider memberships are consulted.The Green Party source insisted the deal represents a strong Programme for Government. They added: It contains very signicant Green Party policy wins across a wide range of areas - environmental, social, housing and equality. I believe our members will see the real progress that can be achieved over the next five years and I think they#ll support it. Five-year #Carbon Budgets# setting out greenhouse gas emissions cuts for every sector are to feature as part of the battle against climate change.Other environmental initiatives like funding of €m-a-year for walking and cycling as well as a ban on single use plastics have been agreed in the deal.A Fianna Fail source said the expectation in the party is that Mr Martin would take the first stint in a rotating Taoiseach role.Mr Martin was tight-lipped on the matter when he spoke to reporters as he arrived at Government Buildings for the talks, merely saying that the first Taoiseach in the coalition would be revealed in due course. RTE reported that he said the proposed deal can represent a new departure for Irish society.

His younger years coincided with a bright spell in the clubs history. He spoke to Michael McMullan about losing championships, winning the John McLaughlin Cup and building for the future. Gutty McGlone is no dferent to any other competitor. Defeat hits him like a sledgehammer. It festers to the very pit of his stomach. Its county final afternoon in  and an emerging Lavey team savour the sweet aroma of victory. Inside, in the corner of the Glen dressing room, McGlone reflects. The remnants of their - to - defeat get tossed through his mind again, something only disappointment can do. googletag.cmd.push The pitter patter of water in the adjoining shower area stops. The noise you only hear above the eerie silence of failure. John McErlain, Liam Devlin and Damian Barton emerge. Their confab draws a common conclusion. They had left three titles behind them. Next year will be dferent. In , -year-old McGlones debut season, the Bridge didnt stand up for themselves in the championship against Ballinderry, before losing the game. Eamonn Coleman was manager and after making him a regular from the mid-point of the league, Hugh wasnt selected for the championship defeat to the Shamrocks, with Coleman later confessing it was about protecting him for a career ahead. He just wasnt ready. googletag.cmd.push Three years earlier, torn ligaments in McGlones right ankle, sustained in school action for St Pius, worked out for the best. “Before that, I couldnt kick with my weak foot,” recalls Hugh, who would later coach at underage and engineer the foundations for the current senior team. He remembers the late Brendan Convery insisting on ato school training once he could walk, before arming him with a bag of balls. “Convery made me stand on the and kick every ball into the goals with my left foot. The next week, he made me go to the ,” McGlone clearly remembers. The man who managed Laveys All-Ireland winning team was developing McGlone without him even knowing. “I gradually got stronger and stronger and thats where I ended up playing at left corner back for the Bridge seniors at , because I had two feet and was able to go up the line...that was all down to Brendan Convery.” St Pius annexed an U Vocational Schools All-Ireland, with McGlone on board. A year later, in , Derry minors, who played most of the game with  men following the first-minute dismissal of Gregory McCloskey, were beaten by a point in Newry by Down, who went on to win the All-Ireland. McGlone lined out at corner back and a year more experienced, had established himself as a regular on the Bridge senior team. Once again, they crossed paths with Ballinderry. After having previously taken two games to beat Magherafelt, they met the Shamrocks in the infamous semi-final replay encounter at Greenlough. Newbridge came through to play Dungiven in a final.  The Newbridge team pictured before the  Derry senior final It wasnt to be. Newbridge were going to stand their ground this time. Familiarity bred contempt and after another tempestuous battle with the Shamrocks, which saw pitch invasions, Newbridge were thrown out leaving Dungiven to be awarded the title in the boardroom. Losing was becoming a habit and in the aftermath of their  defeat, before leaving Glen, they made a pact. “We are going to learn from this,” McGlone relays of the collective dressing room message. “We left one , we didnt get playing in oneand now we have lost one. We are not going to lose another one.” *** You earned your corn at Newbridge training. The championship jersey wasnt handed out willy nilly. Gutty McGlone, the youngest of seven boys in a house of  children, would leave home for the short walk to the hall for a Saturday pre-championship meeting before the  final. He was unnecessarily uneasy. “Im not sure of my position here,” McGlone thought. He was ever-present and never substituted during the year, but Stephen Walls, an All-Ireland minor winner with Derry in , was breathing down McGlones neck. “Thats the class of player we had on the bench. I knew I had played well, but because of the competition at the time in the Newbridge team, I was thinking I could get a gunk here I knew the pressure was on, thats why you had to perform.” It was an era that secured back-to-back senior leagues in  and , as well as three reserve championships inside five years. “This just wasnt about the senior team, those three teams were the pinnacle of us winning thechampionship in ,” McGlone stated, in no uncertain terms. Before emphasising it again. “We played games at training during ...it was a senior team against a reserve team. We struggled to beat them, so that shows you the class of talent we had in Newbridge at that time.” McGlone name-checks Mickey McGrogan and Shane Doherty as some of the forwards who trotted into his left corner back area in training games, players not even listed on the -man match-day  for the final. And they gave him his fill of it. “Then, you had big Hugh McGrogan, Paudis Da, running around at midfield, kicking the shite out of Damian Barton. There was no respect given whatsoever.” It was dog eat dog. And it needed to be. This was to be the year. “Rabbiand Sam , our managers, picked  seniors against  reserves, so we would learn how to play together in games.” The seniors never overran their reserve counterparts. “Not a chance,” Gutty stresses. The seniors never won by any more than four or five points, with the reserves winning the odd game. It worked wonders when it mattered. “Any time we were down by a couple of points , that team didnt know when it was beat. Now it mightnt have been the silkiest team, but boys just never quit,” Hugh admits. After three years of knocking on the door, with the pain of defeat lingering like a dark cloud and with the younger players beginning to mature, it was time to die dog or shite the licence. *** There was another ingredient. Sam Bateson is described by McGlone as the tactician with his managerial partner Thomas Fullerton also knowing his football. The perfect match. Fullerton, a reserve winning captain, was playing with McGlone in a  Graham Cup game. Magherafelt were running them ragged and led by six or seven points at the interval. “It was one of the first times I saw we had steel and other teams didnt have, Thomas went f**king ballistic at half-time,” Gutty remembers. It was a watershed moment. The law was laid down. Like the rest of the team, McGlone imposed himself. They were like men possessed and won the game well. “I was niggling with my man and remember him filling my mouth when we began to get on top,” said McGlone, who walked off the pitch with blood running out of his nose. “Hes not playing football in the next round, but we are,” Rabbi uttered to him, with a laugh. “Thats when I thought, the odd slap in the mouth doesnt matter, as long as you come out on the right side of it.” Another piece of valuable advice was dished out by John McErlain who often played in front of him on the left wing. In his early days, McGlone would often hoof the ball to safety. As a young buck, and under pressure, it was safer than getting caught in possession. “John roared at me one day in a league game,” he remembers. “I was told to either use the ball up the wing or just lay it off. Its those wee things that helps you when you are growing up.” As the  season began to grow, Newbridge beat  champions Bellaghy in the first round, followed by a hard-earned victory over  winners Glenullin and a semi-final encounter win over Banagher. It took them to the decider against neighbours Castledawson. Midway through the first-half, Brian McErlain was sent off. In the reshuffle, Damian Barton dropped back to centre-back. “Damian was that good with the long pass, that we didnt really have to attack and we could keep six at the back,” McGlone said of his captain. “He was able to get the ball to Devand Paddy Barton up there. On that day, I thought the Newbridge defence was outstanding...everybody. It was tight, it was hard hitting and Castledawson didnt get going.” They knew that Eamonn Heaney wasnt going to make Dawsons starting team, but would play a part. He had played at full-back in the  final, but was now threw in at full-forward to help rescue the game. It wasnt long before Rabbi was out over the sideline to instruct McGlone to do a marking job on Colm McKee for the remainder of the game, having blotted out the substituted Mickey Hughes. “Neither me or Colm touched the ball, but the management had trust in us. I was the youngest man on our team and they were happy to leave me on their county man.” Having played in three county finals and losing two of them, McGlone – who has a memory for detail that matches his enthusiasm – always remembers the call for stewards to pick up their end of match positions. “Its one of the worst feelings you could have as a footballer when you are getting beat by two or three points,” he recalls. One year on from hearing it against Lavey in , they led Castledawson when the announcement bellowed out. He remembers dampening Eoin Gribbins joy at the thought of having their clutches on that elusive championship. “One goal and they are back in it,” McGlone warned him. “In the Lavey game, it seemed to last  seconds until the final whistle, but when it was called that year , we were ahead...it seemed like an eternity until the whistle.” Newbridge were not to be caught. They kept their promise from  months earlier and Damian Barton collected the John McLaughlin Cup after a -year gap, for their th and last title. From McGlones recollection, win lose or draw, Wilfie Garvin, Mick McKenna, Jim Gilmore, Seamus and Dermot Doherty, Owen and Willie Gribbin would always be in the Newbridge dressing room after games. They were part of the teams fabric. “I remember those boys being in the day we won it and I was never as glad to see it. Its one of the wee things I will always remember.” Later in the evening the team went for a meal at the ONeill Arms in Toome, before heading back to Newbridge Hall for the celebrations. McGlone wasnt a teetotaller, he enjoyed a drink like most of the others and it was curbed during the championship preparations. “I never touched drink the night we won the championship, not one pint,” Gutty said of his premeditated decision. “I wanted to savour the whole thing and not to be talking to the older men around the club and me maybe half tight.” The next two or three days were dferent. Between the Elk and the Thatch, it was party central. On the Monday night, the squad did a tour of Newbridge on the back of Mick McKennas lorry.   Derry champions Newbridge “Everyone was on the back of er,” Gutty laughs. “We went down to Toome to pick up Stephen McErlain and then did every road in Newbridge. You wouldve thought there were  cars behind us. For the next two or three days, I dont think we sobered.” They were at the top of Everest. But surprisingly, being one of the most consistent teams of the time, it was the only senior championship that crop won. In , they took the foot off the pedal and lost to Ballinascreen in the semi-final who were beaten by eventual All-Ireland champions Lavey. “In  Eugene Young came in to manage us and we got to the final. We missed two goals and theyscored two goals, that was the dference in us winning another one.” While picking up intermediate silverware in the interim, he recalls the disappointment of relegation in  after surviving for three or four seasons in play-offs. “To start your career with a championship medal in your pocket at  or , struggling and relegation was tough. To go from being top of the pile...from walking around behind bands, to relegation, it was tough.” McGlone picked up an intermediate medal in , but when the same title ed five years later, he had stepped away from the seniors, choosing to play with the reserves. Gutty was coaxed out back into the senior ranks by manager Gavin Devlin for an impact role at full-forward, using his guile to pull full-back lines of position. A dead leg suffered in , a niggle that never fully cleared up told McGlone it was time to pull the pin. In retirement, he was never going to step away from the game he loved. The buzz in his voice, with every word dancing, speaks volumes for his fanaticism for football. He stayed on as long as he could, with the club having little youth coming through. It was time to dig new foundations and survey the lie of the land in the local school. “There were big numbers from U down, so we decided wed start with the underage,” states Hugh, who had the help of Neil Young, Martin Gribbin and Gabriel Farren. It was the clubs first U U group, as part of a unofficial South Derry underage initiative. With clubs coaching for three weeks and playing a blitz on the fourth week. “We couldnt believe it, when all  of them turned up at the first session,” he said of a group that supplied seven players to the senior team beaten by Slaughtneil in last years championship. “By U, CKcame in to help. He had taken teams around Newbridge that boysdidnt want, hed step up. Noel McPeake and Sean McKenna came in too and helped.” After winning the U B league and championship, McGlone took a break before ing at minor level and asked for another step up in class. At the pre-season meeting he asked those in the room with two B medals to stand up. “About  percent stood up and when asked who has at least one , and the rest of them stood,” McGlone states. It was time to move up to the A grade. In their first game, they were away to Slaughtneil and unlucky not to beat a team who were U champions two years earlier. After losing heavily to Magherafelt in the Hughes McElwee Cup, the league game between them finished in a draw.  The  Newbridge U U  “If you win a Byou have to step up to A. We were not going to win anything. If we played somebody and there was  points in it and we played them a second day and there was two points in it, we are progressing.” McGlone expressed. He was looking further down the track. His sons are now playing on the senior team, he helped shape. In recent years, they picked up another intermediate title and are back in the top flight. Hopefully to stay. “Now we have a  again that,nurtured right, can dine at the top table again. Hopefully...I am one of the men that is going in around the dressing room in the next five or six years like the older boys did when we won.” Guttys fanaticism has never diluted, nor is it likely to.

Losing was becoming a habit and in the aftermath of their  defeat, before leaving Glen, they made a pact. “We are going to learn from this,” McGlone relays of the collective dressing room message. “We left one , we didnt get playing in oneand now we have lost one. We are not going to lose another one.” *** You earned your corn at Newbridge training. The championship jersey wasnt handed out willy nilly. Gutty McGlone, the youngest of seven boys in a house of  children, would leave home for the short walk to the hall for a Saturday pre-championship meeting before the  final. He was unnecessarily uneasy. “Im not sure of my position here,” McGlone thought. He was ever-present and never substituted during the year, but Stephen Walls, an All-Ireland minor winner with Derry in , was breathing down McGlones neck. “Thats the class of player we had on the bench. I knew I had played well, but because of the competition at the time in the Newbridge team, I was thinking I could get a gunk here I knew the pressure was on, thats why you had to perform.” It was an era that secured back-to-back senior leagues in  and , as well as three reserve championships inside five years. “This just wasnt about the senior team, those three teams were the pinnacle of us winning thechampionship in ,” McGlone stated, in no uncertain terms. Before emphasising it again. “We played games at training during ...it was a senior team against a reserve team. We struggled to beat them, so that shows you the class of talent we had in Newbridge at that time.” McGlone name-checks Mickey McGrogan and Shane Doherty as some of the forwards who trotted into his left corner back area in training games, players not even listed on the -man match-day  for the final. And they gave him his fill of it. “Then, you had big Hugh McGrogan, Paudis Da, running around at midfield, kicking the shite out of Damian Barton. There was no respect given whatsoever.” It was dog eat dog. And it needed to be. This was to be the year. “Rabbiand Sam , our managers, picked  seniors against  reserves, so we would learn how to play together in games.” The seniors never overran their reserve counterparts. “Not a chance,” Gutty stresses. The seniors never won by any more than four or five points, with the reserves winning the odd game. It worked wonders when it mattered. “Any time we were down by a couple of points , that team didnt know when it was beat. Now it mightnt have been the silkiest team, but boys just never quit,” Hugh admits. After three years of knocking on the door, with the pain of defeat lingering like a dark cloud and with the younger players beginning to mature, it was time to die dog or shite the licence. *** There was another ingredient. Sam Bateson is described by McGlone as the tactician with his managerial partner Thomas Fullerton also knowing his football. The perfect match. Fullerton, a reserve winning captain, was playing with McGlone in a  Graham Cup game. Magherafelt were running them ragged and led by six or seven points at the interval. “It was one of the first times I saw we had steel and other teams didnt have, Thomas went f**king ballistic at half-time,” Gutty remembers. It was a watershed moment. The law was laid down. Like the rest of the team, McGlone imposed himself. They were like men possessed and won the game well. “I was niggling with my man and remember him filling my mouth when we began to get on top,” said McGlone, who walked off the pitch with blood running out of his nose. “Hes not playing football in the next round, but we are,” Rabbi uttered to him, with a laugh. “Thats when I thought, the odd slap in the mouth doesnt matter, as long as you come out on the right side of it.” Another piece of valuable advice was dished out by John McErlain who often played in front of him on the left wing. In his early days, McGlone would often hoof the ball to safety. As a young buck, and under pressure, it was safer than getting caught in possession. “John roared at me one day in a league game,” he remembers. “I was told to either use the ball up the wing or just lay it off. Its those wee things that helps you when you are growing up.” As the  season began to grow, Newbridge beat  champions Bellaghy in the first round, followed by a hard-earned victory over  winners Glenullin and a semi-final encounter win over Banagher. It took them to the decider against neighbours Castledawson. Midway through the first-half, Brian McErlain was sent off. In the reshuffle, Damian Barton dropped back to centre-back. “Damian was that good with the long pass, that we didnt really have to attack and we could keep six at the back,” McGlone said of his captain. “He was able to get the ball to Devand Paddy Barton up there. On that day, I thought the Newbridge defence was outstanding...everybody. It was tight, it was hard hitting and Castledawson didnt get going.” They knew that Eamonn Heaney wasnt going to make Dawsons starting team, but would play a part. He had played at full-back in the  final, but was now threw in at full-forward to help rescue the game. It wasnt long before Rabbi was out over the sideline to instruct McGlone to do a marking job on Colm McKee for the remainder of the game, having blotted out the substituted Mickey Hughes. “Neither me or Colm touched the ball, but the management had trust in us. I was the youngest man on our team and they were happy to leave me on their county man.” Having played in three county finals and losing two of them, McGlone – who has a memory for detail that matches his enthusiasm – always remembers the call for stewards to pick up their end of match positions. “Its one of the worst feelings you could have as a footballer when you are getting beat by two or three points,” he recalls. One year on from hearing it against Lavey in , they led Castledawson when the announcement bellowed out. He remembers dampening Eoin Gribbins joy at the thought of having their clutches on that elusive championship. “One goal and they are back in it,” McGlone warned him. “In the Lavey game, it seemed to last  seconds until the final whistle, but when it was called that year , we were ahead...it seemed like an eternity until the whistle.” Newbridge were not to be caught. They kept their promise from  months earlier and Damian Barton collected the John McLaughlin Cup after a -year gap, for their th and last title. From McGlones recollection, win lose or draw, Wilfie Garvin, Mick McKenna, Jim Gilmore, Seamus and Dermot Doherty, Owen and Willie Gribbin would always be in the Newbridge dressing room after games. They were part of the teams fabric. “I remember those boys being in the day we won it and I was never as glad to see it. Its one of the wee things I will always remember.” Later in the evening the team went for a meal at the ONeill Arms in Toome, before heading back to Newbridge Hall for the celebrations. McGlone wasnt a teetotaller, he enjoyed a drink like most of the others and it was curbed during the championship preparations. “I never touched drink the night we won the championship, not one pint,” Gutty said of his premeditated decision. “I wanted to savour the whole thing and not to be talking to the older men around the club and me maybe half tight.” The next two or three days were dferent. Between the Elk and the Thatch, it was party central. On the Monday night, the squad did a tour of Newbridge on the back of Mick McKennas lorry.   Derry champions Newbridge “Everyone was on the back of er,” Gutty laughs. “We went down to Toome to pick up Stephen McErlain and then did every road in Newbridge. You wouldve thought there were  cars behind us. For the next two or three days, I dont think we sobered.” They were at the top of Everest. But surprisingly, being one of the most consistent teams of the time, it was the only senior championship that crop won. In , they took the foot off the pedal and lost to Ballinascreen in the semi-final who were beaten by eventual All-Ireland champions Lavey. “In  Eugene Young came in to manage us and we got to the final. We missed two goals and theyscored two goals, that was the dference in us winning another one.” While picking up intermediate silverware in the interim, he recalls the disappointment of relegation in  after surviving for three or four seasons in play-offs. “To start your career with a championship medal in your pocket at  or , struggling and relegation was tough. To go from being top of the pile...from walking around behind bands, to relegation, it was tough.” McGlone picked up an intermediate medal in , but when the same title ed five years later, he had stepped away from the seniors, choosing to play with the reserves. Gutty was coaxed out back into the senior ranks by manager Gavin Devlin for an impact role at full-forward, using his guile to pull full-back lines of position. A dead leg suffered in , a niggle that never fully cleared up told McGlone it was time to pull the pin. In retirement, he was never going to step away from the game he loved. The buzz in his voice, with every word dancing, speaks volumes for his fanaticism for football. He stayed on as long as he could, with the club having little youth coming through. It was time to dig new foundations and survey the lie of the land in the local school. “There were big numbers from U down, so we decided wed start with the underage,” states Hugh, who had the help of Neil Young, Martin Gribbin and Gabriel Farren. It was the clubs first U U group, as part of a unofficial South Derry underage initiative. With clubs coaching for three weeks and playing a blitz on the fourth week. “We couldnt believe it, when all  of them turned up at the first session,” he said of a group that supplied seven players to the senior team beaten by Slaughtneil in last years championship. “By U, CKcame in to help. He had taken teams around Newbridge that boysdidnt want, hed step up. Noel McPeake and Sean McKenna came in too and helped.” After winning the U B league and championship, McGlone took a break before ing at minor level and asked for another step up in class. At the pre-season meeting he asked those in the room with two B medals to stand up. “About  percent stood up and when asked who has at least one , and the rest of them stood,” McGlone states. It was time to move up to the A grade. In their first game, they were away to Slaughtneil and unlucky not to beat a team who were U champions two years earlier. After losing heavily to Magherafelt in the Hughes McElwee Cup, the league game between them finished in a draw.  The  Newbridge U U  “If you win a Byou have to step up to A. We were not going to win anything. If we played somebody and there was  points in it and we played them a second day and there was two points in it, we are progressing.” McGlone expressed. He was looking further down the track. His sons are now playing on the senior team, he helped shape. In recent years, they picked up another intermediate title and are back in the top flight. Hopefully to stay. “Now we have a  again that,nurtured right, can dine at the top table again. Hopefully...I am one of the men that is going in around the dressing room in the next five or six years like the older boys did when we won.” Guttys fanaticism has never diluted, nor is it likely to.

GAA GOLD, a new archive based series from TG, looks back at the ’s through the prism of the GAA year.  Each programme focuses on one year and we travel through the GAA season with a mixture of all of the classic games, news stories and music hits from that year. The first programme of the series starts with the year and the programmecharts that year’s twists and turns on Gaelic fields throughout the land with league finals, provincial finals, All-Ireland semi-finals and All-Ireland finals. That year end ends with Joe Connolly’s emotional and evocative speech on the steps of the Hogan Stand with the cheeky line of “People of Galway, we love you! googletag.cmd.push In  All Ireland Football Final, there was Seacuteamus Darbys famous goal that shocked Kerry - and the nation - to end their five in-a-row hopes. In the Hurling Final the Cats claimed their nd All-Ireland title captained by a young man named Brian Cody. In  we will see Jimmy Barry-Murphy’s famous rocket goal against Galway in the All-Ireland semi-final. Michael O’Hehir on commentary said“This is one you need to see in slow motion but the slow motion won’t even slow it down!”.  In the Minor hurling final there is a young man named Niall Quinn playing for the Dubs against Galway. He scored a great point on the day and would go on to score  international goals for the Republic of Ireland soccer team. The Football Final that year saw  players sent off in the Dublin v Galway battle. googletag.cmd.push The series will include the  Ulster Football Final - Frank McGuigan was on fire for Tyrone that day and scored  points from play - each one better than the last as Tyrone claimed their first provincial title since  in Clones.  This was also the GAA’s centenary year with the All-Ireland Hurling Final held in Semple Stadium between Cork and Offaly. We hwill see the first ever International Rules tests between Ireland and Australia from that year with plenty of action on and off the ball. In  we have some action from the first ever Ladies Football Final to be played at Croke Park. The Kerry’s Ladies team went one better than the men as they claimed a‘five in-a-row’ with victory over Wexford. There are other more quirkier events in the GAA season too. In  a National Football League Quarter-final between Dublin and Cork ended in a draw. Cork failed to reappear for extra-time so Dublin ran the ball down unopposed and shot into an empty Cork net to claim a very unusual victory. All of these great memories can be seen in this new GAA GOLD series with the soundtrack of the era - a mix of both international and Irish acts such as U, Thin Lizzy, The Pogues, Mamas Boys, The Undertones, Cry Before Dawn, Sineacutead O’Connor, The Dubliners, The Hothouse Flowers, The Stunning and many more.

It was the greatest walk of all and following the opening of Shamrock Park, following the sporting lockdown, they are again thinking of that famous journey to Thurles. On the re-opening of walkways around GAA grounds, this was an opportunity to get people back out again socialising as a club community and using the club grounds with their Trip  Tipp initiative. The idea was to get as many families as possible out walking, running or crawling, each doing a  mile leg of the  mile journey in allocated, socially distanced, safe slots. googletag.cmd.push A pound contribution per family was requested, with all proceeds going to aid football and camogie youth restarting back training, with the expected rules and regulations that will surely be in place. The uptake was fantastic with  families taking partand more families looking to take part every day so they surpassed their  mile journey!. The club wish to place on record their thanks to all those that participated or helped out in any way preparing the grounds, sorting and fitting hand sanitizers, marking the walkways for one way social distance adherence, with special mention to Paul McIver who was the driving force behind this excellent initiative. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

When he came out of the changing room bearing a grey hoodie, with the rest of his team-mates in black and white, you wondered had he even got a jersey. But whatever he dreamt about on the night before, whatever he thought about over dinner, he wouldn’t have believed he would have scored an injury-time goal to win the trophy for his new club and win the man of the match award. googletag.cmd.push That’s exactly how it panned out. The sides level at - apiece, thirty seconds of injury-time played, and a long ball is spilled and flapped at by Ronan Tracey in the Foreglen goal. Poaching on the edge of the small square , as he did time and again in the green and gold jersey, it was a simple task for O’Kane to punch home the winning goal. Some ironies are just written in the stars. This one came in spite of every single ounce of effort Foreglen had to give. Kevin O’Connor was O’Kane’s partner in crime since the two were knee high. They tormented defences in Intermediate football for years. They fought shoulder to shoulder for the green and the gold. googletag.cmd.push O’Connor played like a man possessed. He played like a man who wanted to show the world he didn’t need a partner. The Foreglen forward took Rian Kealey, a superb player, to the cleaners. O’Connor ended up with five points and set up his side’s goal in a magnicent display. That goal, made by O’Connor and finished by James Brolly, looked as though it had swung the balance in the favour of the underdogs with just four minutes to go. Having been behind from the th minute of a rather stagnant first half, Foreglen had worked incredibly hard to stay in touch with the Magpies. A combination of wasteful finishing from Eugene Kelly’s menand superb defending from a young full-back line of Ruairi and Shane Duffy and Cathal O’Hara kept Damien O’Connor’s side in contention. This was no holds barred football. For the young Dungiven side, sprinkled with Kevin Farren, Kevin Johnston, Sean Murray and Donal McGilligan of last year’s minor team, this was probably the toughest game they’ve played, in a physical sense at least. For that, you have to give Foreglen great credit. Brothers John and Oisin Duffy were lost to their defence before the game, having set off travelling on Friday. They’re without Niall McFeely long term. To most teams with as small a pick, those absentees would be terminal against a side that contained six players that played in last year’s senior county final. But when have Foreglen ever laid down  Kevin O’Connor might have kicked the points, but the spadework was done by plenty other. Ciaran McFeely had an excellent game, the best he’s played in some while. He went after everything, especially in the second half. Darren O’Kane’s heart is bigger than his chest. There’s not much of him, but he ploughs into everything. He’s pretty much the Foreglen prototype. They felt the big decisions didn’t go their way. They may have had a point. Directly after Brolly’s goal, Martin Farrell latched on to a great ball from Darren O’Kane. He appeared to be fouled in front of goal but referee Joe Mulholland blew him for over-carrying. Ninety seconds after what turned out to be Darrell O’Kane’s winning goal, Kevin O’Connor was pushed in the chest inside the area as he collected the ball. The referee felt he went down too easily and played on. But for all the feeling of the world being against them, they were lucky to still be in the game at half-time. Having played with a fresh breeze, they were frustrated by constant stoppages over a stop-start  minutes. With  minutes of -a-side football played, the score was just - apiece. It hadn’t caught fire at all. But Dungiven were missing what chances were being made. They kicked ten wides in that half hour. Foreglen had just three points at the break, but just as importantly, they had conceded just five. What the fans were treated to in the second half was night and day from what they had got in the first. It became a rip-roaring game. It effectively became championship. The first seven minutes of the half were scoreless. The stage seemed set. James McNicholl got out well and fed the man coming off his shoulder. That man fired brilliantly past Ronan Tracey from twelve yards. That man had no fear of celebrating his goal. That man was, of course, Darrell O’Kane. Foreglen seemed to react to the identity of the scorer as much as the goal itself. They responded in the most positive manner. Martin Farrell , Ciaran McFeely, Kevin O’Connor and James Brolly hit points in six brilliant minutes to close the gap back to two. Dungiven’s only response in those six minutes came from O’Kane’s right foot. Kevin O’Connor was not letting it go without a fight. His storming run saw Rian Kealey pull him to the ground along the endline. He got up and sprinted out to the ’ and with Dungiven sleeping, took a quick free that left James Brolly with a relatively simple finish from  yards. That levelled it with just four minutes to play. But they couldn’t quite get the score they needed to nose themselves in front. They just didn’t have anything to hold on to. Substitute Fergal McGuigan kicked a  yard free wide and it seemed as though the gods, having rescued Kerry earlier in the day, had dressed themselves in green and gold. But it just had to be Darrell O’Kane’s day. Of all the men in all the world, it just had to be him.

To most teams with as small a pick, those absentees would be terminal against a side that contained six players that played in last year’s senior county final. But when have Foreglen ever laid down  Kevin O’Connor might have kicked the points, but the spadework was done by plenty other. Ciaran McFeely had an excellent game, the best he’s played in some while. He went after everything, especially in the second half. Darren O’Kane’s heart is bigger than his chest. There’s not much of him, but he ploughs into everything. He’s pretty much the Foreglen prototype. They felt the big decisions didn’t go their way. They may have had a point. Directly after Brolly’s goal, Martin Farrell latched on to a great ball from Darren O’Kane. He appeared to be fouled in front of goal but referee Joe Mulholland blew him for over-carrying. Ninety seconds after what turned out to be Darrell O’Kane’s winning goal, Kevin O’Connor was pushed in the chest inside the area as he collected the ball. The referee felt he went down too easily and played on. But for all the feeling of the world being against them, they were lucky to still be in the game at half-time. Having played with a fresh breeze, they were frustrated by constant stoppages over a stop-start  minutes. With  minutes of -a-side football played, the score was just - apiece. It hadn’t caught fire at all. But Dungiven were missing what chances were being made. They kicked ten wides in that half hour. Foreglen had just three points at the break, but just as importantly, they had conceded just five. What the fans were treated to in the second half was night and day from what they had got in the first. It became a rip-roaring game. It effectively became championship. The first seven minutes of the half were scoreless. The stage seemed set. James McNicholl got out well and fed the man coming off his shoulder. That man fired brilliantly past Ronan Tracey from twelve yards. That man had no fear of celebrating his goal. That man was, of course, Darrell O’Kane. Foreglen seemed to react to the identity of the scorer as much as the goal itself. They responded in the most positive manner. Martin Farrell , Ciaran McFeely, Kevin O’Connor and James Brolly hit points in six brilliant minutes to close the gap back to two. Dungiven’s only response in those six minutes came from O’Kane’s right foot. Kevin O’Connor was not letting it go without a fight. His storming run saw Rian Kealey pull him to the ground along the endline. He got up and sprinted out to the ’ and with Dungiven sleeping, took a quick free that left James Brolly with a relatively simple finish from  yards. That levelled it with just four minutes to play. But they couldn’t quite get the score they needed to nose themselves in front. They just didn’t have anything to hold on to. Substitute Fergal McGuigan kicked a  yard free wide and it seemed as though the gods, having rescued Kerry earlier in the day, had dressed themselves in green and gold. But it just had to be Darrell O’Kane’s day. Of all the men in all the world, it just had to be him.

John O’Neill, from Ballinderry, took to the roads around the village to document the lives of local parishioners during the Covid- lockdown. The project is still ongoing, but Fr Peter Donnelly from St Patrick’s Church in the parish, says the donation of pound, is very welcome. “It is very much appreciated by the entire Ballinderry family as this would be additional expenditure, which has become necessary,” he told the County Derry Post. “Because of the health emergency, we’ve had to seriously think about introducing a webcam, and all of these improvements are costly, and this money will go towards that. googletag.cmd.push “It was very generous of him with his time and photography expertise. It was a kind thought indeed and it was well supported.” The project grew momentum after a local man, Charlie Collins, presented John with a list of  people in the parish who were over . “I would touch base, or say I was calling in an area on a certain day and people would get in contact,” said John. “I arranged rough times that I would call so they were watching or had a family member keeping an eye out. “The older folk were asking about how they would buy a photo, so I did a flat rate and said % would go to Fr Donnelly down in Ballinderry chapel.” googletag.cmd.push One of Johns shots from the project. Pic: John ONeill - Sperrins Photography. Fr Donnelly said the thought of a photographer doing the rounds was enough to give the parish’s elderly parishioners a boost. “The older members found it enormously important and looked forward to getting prepared to have their photographs taken,” he said. “John managed to capture their dferent personalities very well. There are many ways of taking a photo but the artistry is in capturing the character of the person themselves. “I thought he got everyone’s personality very well. Rather than people feeling a bit self-conscious or formal, he was able to put them at ease. “It was a wonderful idea and it was very heartening to see it so well supported.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A number of complaints had been raised about the booking system put in place following the easement of coronavirus restrictions. Cllr Kathleen McGurk said some constituents had experienced dficulty when trying to make a same-day booking, but moves have since been made to improve the service. “I asked the Environmental Services Director to improve the current system to ensure there are less issues when trying to book a slot including provision same day booking,” said Cllr McGurk. “I very much welcome the improvements that the council team have now implemented and praise should be given to the quick response to the complaints. googletag.cmd.push “The new online booking systems which is being rolled out should streamline the service for all users.” The online system, which will facilitate same-day booking, will be trialled at sites in Coleraine and Limavady this week, with the council hoping to roll it out to all sites within a fortnight. The number of slots has also been increased to allow for four vehicles every ten minutes, with a view to increasing it to six vehicles this week. In the meantime, the council has increased the number of operators taking bookings to seven at centres that do not yet have the online booking system in place. googletag.cmd.push “I appreciate there have been frustrations caused by the booking system and some have called for its removal entirely,” said Cllr McGurk “However it is essential that we maintain it for the meantime to avoid the long queues and congestion seen in other Council areas. “It is also worth noting that since the introduction of the booking system, most council recycling centres are working to full capacity with slots being entirely filled for the following day. “If this wasn’t managed correctly it would lead to peak usage times which would have the potential to overwhelm staff at the centres and cause traffic issues. “Whilst this may not have been as likely a scenario in smaller recycling centres, it was important that the same approach was taken to all centres across the council area.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mrs Simpson was one of the speakers at the Black Lives Matter rally on Saturday in Derrys Guildhall Square.

It was a safe space, controlled, we had a voice. “I thought, did police officers just see the colour of my skin and approach me. “They weren’t approaching everyone. Like every organisation there’s an element that think they’re superior. “The rally wasn’t even started when we were approached and they didn’t give us the option of going home. googletag.cmd.push “They annoyed us that much it made us more determined to stay.” She added: “They were trying to put a lid on an active volcano, it will still erupt, but instead of erupting in a controlled manner it will erupt all over the place. “Let it be addressed in a controlled environment, in schools or in church. “People should be able to speak about racism, it’s not going away no matter how many lids are put on it.” Since moving to the city, Mrs Simpson claimed that her entire family have been subjected to racism. “All three of my children have experienced racism, including my -year-old,” she said. “In Derry it may be subtle, not open or staring you in the face, but it’s there and unless we actually speak about it, people get away with it and continue to do it. “Don’t get me wrong, you have people everywhere who are good and bad, you have people in Derry who are not racist. “It’s about people’s moral compass, your ethics and what you value. “Children are born innocent and unless you teach them to hate, and teach them racism, they don’t see the person as another colour. “It is something that is learnt and unless we address our own personal prejudices we’ll get nowhere.” From April  to March , there were  racist incidents, resulting in  crimes, in Northern Ireland. Of those,  occurred in the Derry and Strabane policing district, an increase of  on the previous year. It’s understood that many incidents go unreported. For Mrs Simpson’s daughter Jada, race was never an issue until two years ago. Mrs Simpson said her friends at school are all white and ‘she never saw herself as dferent’. However, an incident in  changed her attitude. “She was at the bus station trying to board a bus when the driver shut the door in her face and drove off, leaving her standing there.” Mrs Simpson said that after viewing footage of the incident, the company apologised and the driver was said to have been disciplined. She continued: “It’s there, and unless each company can do like the bus company, address the inidual who is the rotten egg instead of hiding it, and condoning it or trying to cover it up. Address it openly.” Following the incident, the family felt that somebody had listened to them, but Mrs Simpson said a lot of people are afraid to speak out. “Where does that anger go, where does that hurt go, it stays and grows and infiltrates society.” Confirming the incident, a Translink spokesperson stated: “A complaint was received on thSeptember  at Foyle Street bus station. “This was acknowledged, investigated and followed up. “Translink’s Dignity at Work policy, in which all staff are trained on their induction, makes it clear that we are fully committed to creating a harmonious working environment in which all employees are treated with respect and dignity, regardless of race, colour, ethnic or national origins. “This equally applies to how our staff are expected to treat passengers.” In response to criticism that now is not the right time to hold protests, Mrs Simpson said: “Coronavirus is affecting everyone. It’s affecting the Black, Asian and ethnic minority community more. “We’re being marginalised anyway, we’re being segregated anyway, whether by a natural cause or a man-made cause so give us a chance to speak in a safe space.” The level of support on Saturday surprised Mrs Simpson and she said she was ‘proud’ that people ‘challenged themselves’ by turning out.

These exclusive photographs show the special screens which have been erected at Tinneys Bar in Derry. All other pubs are expected to install similar screens between staff and customers as the hospitality sector reopens following the coronavirus lockdown.  A local blinds shop has been assisting Derry bars and businesses as they prepare to reopen safely. Ace Blinds have been operating in the Derry area, serving the community for over five years and employing local people. As businesses adjust to the so-called new normal after lockdown, they have to enforce social distancing and come up with innovative ways to protect their customers. googletag.cmd.push Therefore, Ace Blinds has fitted ‘COVID- roller shields’ in local bars and the orders have been mounting from other businesses in the city. “It has gone a bit crazy at the minute and we have already taken  orders for bars,” says John Kelly of Ace Blinds. It is new territory for Ace Blinds in terms of the material they are using. “The plastic material suits bars great as they can be moved up and down very easily, not like perspex, and they are a lot easier on the eye for customers, so more friendly. They can be attached to suspension ceilings with a special clip so no drillingneeds be. googletag.cmd.push “The material is easily cleaned, you just hold the bottom bar and wipe clean and it can be secured to bars or the groundneeded.” The company has fitted the bathroom at EI Engineering to separate sinks which provides an extra layer of protection for workers. Other businesses in the town have come to them with dferent proposals which they’re working through together. This week, the Economy Minister Dianne Dodds announced that all non-essential goods retailers in Northern Ireland can re-open from tomorrow. Pubs and restaurants are expected to follow suit in July. Confirming the ‘major step forward’, the Minister said: “The pandemic has had a devastating impact on the local economy. The recovery has already begun and it is time now for the pace to accelerate. The re-opening of all goods retail outlets will be a huge part of this. “The safety of staff and customers is of course paramount. All retailers must be able to implement measures that minimise the risk to their staff and to the people who visit their stores. “We will be co-existing with this virus for some time to come so it is vital that we continue to adhere to guidance to work and live safely.” The Minister added: “The re-opening of our local shopping sector is a signicant step forward in the Executive’s pathway to recovery. I and my Executive colleagues remain committed to moving forward in the recovery while at all times keeping the health, wellbeing and safety of people at the centre and being transparent in our approach.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Tucked off the Halfgain road, it is one of Slaughtneils greatest gems. Glenn, who coaches fitness in the wild outdoors with his company Wild Le, was due to celebrate his rd birthday by competing in a half triathlon, before it was cancelled due to the sporting lockdown. “I always try to do something challenging on or around my birthday. I guess it makes me feel alive as my inevitable demise looms ever closer,” Glenn said. It was time to put his creative mind to work and invent a new challenge, something on his doorstep. googletag.cmd.push “I love kettlebells and live in the middle of a nature reserve with loads of footpaths so it meant I could do the challenge without having to travel,” he points out. He has a background in combat sports, primarily Filipino Stick Fighting, is a big lover of tree climbing, cold water wild swimming. “A fellow stick fighter and kettlebell instructor, Dave Hedges, from Dublin completed a mile of swings a few years ago and sowed the seed to do it here.” As part of his challenge he aimed to raise money for local mental health charity, STEPS. After targetting pound as a total, he smashed it and currently has pound, in his Justgiving account. googletag.cmd.push “As someone who has and still does suffer from, at times acute anxiety, raising money for mental health support is a no-brainer,” he explains. “Suicide is the single biggest killer in men under the age of  and the daily number of deaths is going up for both men and women. In Northern Ireland the suicide rate is about double that of England, with almost  percent of our community suffering from mental health issues.” “We are all affected by mental health issues, either directly or indirectly, and its time for it to stop being a taboo subject.” A back injury curtailed Glenns early preparations and he switched rehab mode. His days comprised a series of flexibility routines. “The human body is remarkable at healing and movement is medicine. After a couple of weeks I felt I was good to go, so started doing kettlebell swings daily, building up in volume and then moving onto to the walking swing whereby i take a step forward at the top of each swing.” With over , swings during his iron mile, technique was everything. There was the small matter of managing his hands, such was the wear and tear from the kettlebell. “The kettlebell is constantly moving inside your grip so any hard skin or calluses there tend to rip off,” Glenn outlines. “So I had a weekly routine of filing, shaving and moisturising my hands. They are more rubbery that leathery. “I used a kg kettlebell. This would be fairly light for my average workout but after , swings it felt anything but light. If I do it again i may go up to a kg. The heat was the biggest issue. Within five minutes of his scheduled .am start, he was dripping with sweat. “I was wishing we started two hours earlier, sweat in the eyes and on the palms is less than ideal.” With about  metres to go, Glenn could feel blisters popping on his fingers, but the finish line was in sight. One year older, another challenge met and money raised for a worthwhile cause.

Tucked off the Halfgain road, it is one of Slaughtneils greatest gems. Glenn, who coaches fitness in the wild outdoors with his company Wild Le, was due to celebrate his rd birthday by competing in a half triathlon, before it was cancelled due to the sporting lockdown. “I always try to do something challenging on or around my birthday. I guess it makes me feel alive as my inevitable demise looms ever closer,” Glenn said. It was time to put his creative mind to work and invent a new challenge, something on his doorstep. googletag.cmd.push “I love kettlebells and live in the middle of a nature reserve with loads of footpaths so it meant I could do the challenge without having to travel,” he points out. He has a background in combat sports, primarily Filipino Stick Fighting, is a big lover of tree climbing, cold water wild swimming. “A fellow stick fighter and kettlebell instructor, Dave Hedges, from Dublin completed a mile of swings a few years ago and sowed the seed to do it here.” As part of his challenge he aimed to raise money for local mental health charity, STEPS. After targetting pound as a total, he smashed it and currently has pound, in his Justgiving account. googletag.cmd.push “As someone who has and still does suffer from, at times acute anxiety, raising money for mental health support is a no-brainer,” he explains. “Suicide is the single biggest killer in men under the age of  and the daily number of deaths is going up for both men and women.

There was substantial damage done to the crop.The farmer continued: ldquoI also had a man who was purposely letting his dog into a field to go to the toilet every morning. This field is used to cut silage for the animals to eat in winter. What these people donrsquot understand is that dog faeces is potentially harmful to cattle.ldquoI appreciate that people like to go for a walk and it is unprecedented times where people are more cautious about meeting people on the roads, but they canrsquot use farmland as recreational ground.ldquoThat is a farmerrsquos work space and every blade of grass is used in farming, eventhere areno cows in the field that they are walking in. The ground is being used for something, be it winter fodder or rotational grazing.ldquoThere are cows calving in my fields and what I am more worried about is that someone is going to get hurt. Cows are extremely volatile around calving season and they will attackthey think their young are in danger.ldquoThe most dangerous animal on a farm is not a bull, itrsquos a newly calved cow. They can and will kill. People think that cows are docile but they can kill.The farmer added: ldquoI am having to look into getting professional CCTV equipment put in place over the land, an expense I could really do without.Mr McGrath said people walking through gated fields, leaving the gates lying open and allowing the livestock to get out placed an ldquounnecessary burden on farmers.ldquoWith some Covid- restrictions being eased itrsquos great to see that people are able to get out and about a bit more whether that be for walking their dogs, going for a longer walk or run or just getting out and about. We need to make full use of our wonderful natural surroundings for our own health and for our own emotional and psychological wellbeing.ldquoHowever, there are issues creeping in regarding walkers and runners using gated fields and pieces of farmland as access points whether for a shortcut or just because they feel they can do this.He continued: ldquoWhen I was growing up in Downpatrick you didnrsquot dare trespass on the land. There was enough respect for the farmer and the great contribution they make to our local communities and as a child probably a healthy level of fear as well.ldquoI want our communities to respect our farmers and to appreciate that they give to the community so much more than they get back.ldquoSoyoursquore out and about and enjoying your walks or runs, please stick to the public roads and public rights of way..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"A walk in the pairc  ","story":"LOCAL GAA clubs are gearing up for ato action.After a three-month lockdown caused by the Covid- pandemic, clubs can look forward to a resumption of gaelic games.Thatrsquos good news for players and spectators, who have been starved of action.The clubs were able to unlock their gates for the first time this week.From Monday they were allowed to open their grounds for small groups of people to use walkways.Non-contact training for club teams will begin on June , initially in groups of no more than ten players with two coaches.Full-contact training can take place from July , with underage games commencing on the same date.

The industry directly employs , people, with thousands more supported in work through the supply chain.The impact of the virus on the sector could be devastating, Baroness Ritchie told peers during a debate on measures needed to repair the UK economy.ldquoProjections indicate that this level of employment could be reduced by  per cent, she said. ldquoThere has been no spend in the tourism industry since March  and it will be late July before tourism outlets open.ldquoMany of those people who will find themselves out of work will have to rely on the benefit system which is already under extreme pressure. It is punitive and needs to be overhauled with the needs of people put at the centre of the debate.She continued: ldquoTo encourage visitors to come to our region to spend money and to invest in our economy, we need to protect our people.ldquoThat means we must ensure our shops are allowed to open subject to social distancing rules and the British Government needs to abolish air passenger duty and reduce VAT on tourism.ldquoThat would assist our hospitality industry and those employed in it as well as the many people who depend on it for their basic source of income. These fiscal measures could indirectly make contributions to reducing inequalities in our society and community. Baroness Ritchie said the furloughing of many staff within the hospitality sector was currently concealing the true extent of the job losses that would follow when the scheme was ended.She also said the pandemic had revealed the ldquodeep levels of poverty and inequalities that are entrenched within many communities.She went on: ldquoThere have been greater levels of dependence on food banks for essential food provisions.

the reinstatement of services at the Downe Hospital.Baroness Margaret Ritchie and Alliance councillor Patrick Brown are both demanding the full restoration of services which were removed at the height

reinstatement of services and staff continues and that the timeline for doing so is published so that the public is fully aware of all the circumstances, she said.ldquoUndoubtedly, all the staff in the Downe Hospital, including medical, nursing and ancillary, have worked with very dficult challenges over the last few months and they deserve our support, solidarity and congratulations.Baroness Ritchie said she had been told equipment will be ed to the Downe and that the Trust was progressing plans for the rebuilding of non-Covid health and social care services.She said she had pressed

quality local services, he said.ldquoWhilst the dficult and unprecedented circumstances caused by the Covid- pandemic have undoubtedly added a strain on hospital resources, the decision to involve a private contractor for endoscopy treatments should be swtly reconsidered.ldquoInstead, efforts should be made to find a cohesive solution with current medical staff and relevant unions, in order to safeguard our local services.He continued: ldquoThe decision to close the AE Department in Downe Hospital was taken to reallocate resources and staff to other hospitals to help fight Covid-,

of emergency medical care prior to the pandemic, with an AE Department that only operated for  hours of the day.Cllr Brown said a global health crisis should not be used as an excuse to remove or

initiative aimed at revitalising Ardglass harbour are expected to be published before the end of the month.Stormont fisheries minister Edwin Poots is due to unveil the first stage of a report from the Fishing and Seafood Development programme whichwill include a timeline for work that needs to be done at Ardglass and the other Co Down ports of Kilkeel and Portavogie.Earlier this year, Mr Poots met with South Down MLA Colin McGrath and local councillor Dermot Curran to discuss the future of the village port.They highlighted the importance of the Ardglass fishing industry to the district and wider South Down economy and outlined planned improvement work at the harbour, including deepening it to facilitate larger herring and mackerel vessels.Mr McGrath and Cllr Curran emphasised the need for additional investment in the harbour and its infrastructure, insisting that the port receives its fair share of funding to help enhance the existing fleet.They said that the harbour was ldquostrategically important for the Co Down fleet, highlighting its crucial role in driving the South Down economy and its location as a central hub for processing fish landed in Ardglass.The politicians said additional investment is critical to allow Ardglass harbour to expand with appropriate slipways provided for larger vessels to dock safely.Several weeks after the meeting with Mr Poots it was revealed that ambitious plans to redevelop Ardglass harbour could cost in the region of poundm.The figure is contained in a detailed consultants report commissioned to undertake an in-depth feasibility study to look at potential developments for the harbour which is home to Northern Irelandrsquos third largest fishing fleet.The key issue the consultants focused on was deepening the harbour to facilitate larger vessels, with work also undertaken to look at improving harbour conditions, berthing pontoons for smaller vessels and increased berthing facilities.In addition, the study included a comprehensive review of possible harbour layouts, historic document research, topographic and bathymetric harbour surveys, quay wall inspection above and below the waterline and computer modelling.The consultants also liaised with the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairswhich has been given a copy of the consultants report ahead of further discussions with its officials on the way forward.Ardglass has the only all-weather harbour between Howth and Bangor and has three primary areas including the so-called fish dock within the south pier.Last August, ious concept layouts produced by consultants were reviewed by members of the Ardglass Harbour Developments group which has been set up to oversee the regeneration of the port. The concepts were subsequently amended in November.The prime focus is on deepening the harbour and moving forward, a cost effective approach may be to zone dredge levels in particular areas.Cllr Curran, who is keen to hear what Mr Poots has to say in a few weeksrsquo time, said there were plans to deepen the outer harbour by nine metres and the area adjacent to Cochranersquos building at the inner harbour by two metres to facilitate crab vessels.He confirmed that consideration is also being given to creating a pontoon with finger berths adjacent to the quay wall in front of Cochranersquos with gangway access for crab vessels. No leisure craft would be permitted at this part of the harbour.ldquoNew investment in Ardglass harbour can help sustain existing jobs and create new employment opportunities, said Cllr Curran. ldquoThe port plays a ket part in the local economy and is at the heart of village le.ldquoArdglass lands some of the largest quantities of prawns in Ireland and deepening the harbour will mean that larger fishing vessels that currently dock where, will be able to access local facilities.Cllr Curran also fears that not deepening the harbour could potentially lead to an economic collapse for the Ardglass fishing industry.He added: ldquoI look forward to hear what the fisheries minister has to say towards the end of the month and hope that it will be positively good news for Ardglass..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Roadworks causing delays in town centre  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK businesswoman has called on Phoenix Gas to complete pipe laying work in St Patrickrsquos Avenue by next Monday mdash as promised.The company is investing poundm investment across East Down and to date has laid over  miles of natural gas pipeline, with contractors also currently working in Newcastle.Phoenix officials have been working with the Department for Infrastructure to identy areas where pipe-laying could be brought forward to avoid further disruption to traders, visitors and residents, with work in Downpatrick starting several weeks ago.A mains pipeline has already been laid in a number of areas in the town, with contractors recently completing work in the Edward Street area. Contractors then moved to Pound Lane and are now in St Patrickrsquos Avenue.Eleanor Telford, who owns Telrsquos Confectionary with her husband Alan, said that she believed that the pipe-laying would start outside her shop imminently.ldquoI suppose the work has to be done sometime and perhaps itrsquos better done now when things are still quiet, but I hope the work is completed within the time we have been told, she said.Motorists have faced some delays in St Patrickrsquos Avenue which feeds into Market Street, the townrsquos main shopping area.Phoenix hopes that by expediting its multi-million pound investment programme now, it will avoid further disruption later in the year, while also providing consumers with additional access to fuel choice before the winter period.The company insists that the safety of its staff and communities is of paramount importance, with the current pipe-laying work scheduled following ldquorobust risk assessment and the implementation of additional operational procedures, in line with government guidance.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran also appealed to Phoenix to complete the work as quickly as possible and for road users to remain patient during the work in the town centre which he said will result in inconvenience.He said it was always anticipated the work on such a major investment in towns and villages across the district would result in some degree of disruption and inconvenience.Cllr Curran said that the arrival of natural gas provides consumers with an added element of choice when it comes to their heating needs and said the investment in Downpatrick and right across the district opens up new opportunities to thousands of homeowners and the townrsquos business community.ldquoPipe-laying on such a large scale along congested streets and town centres results in disruption and while issues have arisen in the past, Phoenix has always done it best to minimise disruption, he said.ldquoBringing forward the work in Downpatrick, especially as schools across the town are closed as part of the coronavirus lockdown measures, makes sense. However, there will be concern about this project across the business community..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Sam helping lift spirits with nursing home gigs  ","story":"A KILLYLEAGH musician is lting the spirits of residents at a local nursing home mdash despite the Coronavirus lockdown and heart surgery.For over  years Sam Miskelly has been entertaining the residents of Fishbourne House at Spa, with his accordion.However, his weekly visits were put on hold after he underwent heart surgery several months ago and had stents fitted.He recovered only for the Covid- virus to spread around the globe, which meant he was no longer to go inside the home.Undaunted, the  year-old former lorry driver now sets up his accordion, amplier and microphone in the garden of the nursing home and residents are still able to enjoy his tuneful medleys.Sam is a regular performer at old tyme dances at a number of local venues and it was at one of them where he met Mr William Brown, owner of Fishbourne House.ldquoOne night he asked meI would play music for the residents.

Work has been going on for some months digging a trench round the curtilage of the building, preparing foundations for a new structure, removing an important hedge, cutting roots of mature trees and damaging the ‘protected’ pillars of the boundary walls. After many weeks of pressure by residents, the planners served Tree Preservation orders and a stop notice last week, long after damage had been done. Unfortunately work has carried on regardless, and the police stand by as lorries deliver more concrete. The planners say they cannot enforce the stop notice. If that is the case, what is the purpose of a stop notice One of the most important aspects of planning is the protection of our built and natural environment, which are fragile assets that are increasingly important and at risk.Ainda Andress, Belfast BT——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

in one of his articles that such a progressive town as Penarth was without an operatic and dramatic society, writes Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Societypresident, Mary Gardner.The response to his outcry was quickly taken up and within three weeks the Penarth Operatic Society was formed.The Societyrsquos first production was Gilbert  Sullivanrsquos Iolanthe, played at The Hippodrome which later burnt down, and what a glittering opening evening it must have been as the audience wore evening dress.The review featured next day read, ldquoBrilliant Initial Performance.More newsVale council issues warning over the use of parksFines increased for coronavirus lockdown breachesMarie Curie Great Blooming Tea Party goes virtualA few years later in , the drama section came into being and with it a new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One, PODS presented the very special play, Last Man Standing, which also won a NODA award for Best Drama.In , PODS decided to do pantomime, and this has been a greatly gratying and popular addition to the companyrsquos output.Itrsquos wonderful to see children in the cast having on-stage experience, and then those children in the audience, perhaps for the first time, enjoying and loving live theatre.PODS is a very busy Society putting on four shows a year, a musical, two plays and a pantomime.Mrs Gardner said: ldquoThis year, sadly and very upsettingly after much hard work by all involved, the covid- virus struck as PODS had just set-up at the Paget Rooms ready for its run of Goodnight Mister Tom, only to be told the venue would be shut down next day.ldquoSince January, the Society had also been rehearsing for its May musical, The Full Monty, and that too has had to be cancelled.       ,params: .pushldquoNevertheless, when this terrible emergency is over the company will put on these two productions sometime in the future. ldquoPODS is proud of its achievement in giving much pleasure and entertainment to the local community with its first-class shows over the last  years, and its goal is to make its centenary in  with the help of its faithful audiences, friends and patrons.PODS is always ready to welcome new members, but at the moment it cannot meet or rehearse due to the covid- restrictions.It might be some time before restrictions are lted on groups being able to rehearse together, or audiences allowed back in theatres, meanwhile PODS members keep in touch

make face masks compulsory public transport","story":"Mark Drakeford said Englands decision to bring in a requirement for coverings had raised issues for people commuting between the two countries.It came as Public Health Wales said a further four people had died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths to ,, while the number of positive cases grew by  to ,.More NewsLuxury car manufacturer Aston Martin to axe  jobsMans efforts toWorld War One Penarth soldiers plaque found in New ZealandPenarth RNLI leboat crew rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public transportthe journey is essential and theres no other travel

decision to bring in a requirement for coverings had raised issues for people commuting between the two countries.It came as Public Health Wales said a further four people had died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths to ,, while the number of positive cases grew by  to ,.More NewsLuxury car manufacturer Aston Martin to axe  jobsMans efforts toWorld War One Penarth soldiers plaque found in New ZealandPenarth RNLI leboat crew rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public transportthe journey is essential and theres no other travel alternative.\" article_url   content_id

option to alleviate potential flood risk.More NewsVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldMillions become unpaid carers due to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh Government is keen for Wales to become an exemplar of good practice. community involvement and support will remain key features of our campaign.He added: ldquoWe are grateful to people far and wide who have supported our campaign, including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge where the stream passes under the A to reduce flood risk.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquolsquoFollowing our meeting on May  Sir David Henshaw chairman of NRW wrote to me on May  to say that NRW received almost  responses to our consultation on the Outline Business Case with the vast majority being opposed to the upstream storage option on the Cadoxton Brook.NRW chairman, Sir Henshaw said: ldquoWhen we consider the marginal case for this option, it is therefore clear that we will not be pursuing an upstream storage scheme. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

The virus is still out there, he said.Still, the need to get Europersquos tourism industry up and running again is also urgent for countries such as Spain and Greece as the economic fallout of the crisis multiplies.Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis acknowledged that ldquoa lot will depend on whether people feel comfortable to travel and whether we can project Greece as a safe destination.In a trial run, Spain is allowing thousands of Germans to fly to its Balearic Islands starting on Monday ndash waiving its -day quarantine for the group. vw,vw,px, px\"People enjoy the warm weather on the beach in Barcelona, Spain The idea is to test out best practices in the coronavirus era.ldquoThis pilot programme will help us learn a lot for what lies ahead in the coming months, Mr Sanchez said.ldquoWe want our country, which is already known as a world-class tourist destination, to be recognised as also a secure destination.Europersquos reopening is not a repeat of the chaotic free-for-all in March, when panicked, unco-ordinated border closures caused traffic jams that stretched for miles.Still, it is a complicated, shting patchwork of dferent rules, and not everyone is equally free to travel everywhere.Several countries are not opening up yet to everyone.Norway and Denmark, for example, are keeping their borders closed with Sweden, whose virus strategy avoided a lockdown but produced a relatively high per capita death rate. vw,vw,px, px\"Vehicles queue at the border crossing in Krusaa, Denmark, after Denmark reopened its borders to Germany Cars queued up on Monday morning at some crossings on the German border with Denmark, which is now letting in visitors from Germany but onlythey have booked accommodation for at least six nights.Britain, which left the EU in January but remains closely aligned with the bloc until the end of this year, only last week imposed a -day quarantine requirement for most arrivals, horrying its tourism and aviation industries.As a result, France is asking people coming from Britain to self-quarantine for two weeks and several other nations are not even letting British tourists come in during the first wave of reopenings.With flights only gradually picking up, nervousness about new outbreaks abroad, uncertainty about social distancing at tourist venues and many people facing record unemployment or pay cuts, many Europeans may choose simply to stay home or explore their own countries.German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz are both planning to holiday in their homelands this year.ldquoThe recommendation is still,you want to be really safe, a holiday in Austria, Austrian foreign minister Alexander Schallenberg told ORF television, recalling the scramble in March to bring home thousands of tourists as borders slammed shut.ldquoIn Austria, you know that you donrsquot have to cross a borderyou want to get home, and you know the infrastructure and the health system well, he said.The German government, which helped fly , people home as the pandemic grew exponentially, also has no desire to repeat that experience. vw,vw,px, px\"A face mask left on the floor of the Roemerberg square in Frankfurt, Germany ldquoMy appeal to all those who travel: enjoy your summer holiday ndash but enjoy it with caution and responsibility, German foreign minister Heiko Maas said.ldquoIn the summer holidays, we want to make it as dficult as possible for the virus to spread again in Europe.The Dutch government said its citizens can now visit  European nations, but urged caution.ldquoYou can go abroad for your holiday again, foreign minister Stef Blok said.ldquoBut it wonrsquot be as carefree as before the corona crisis.

A wide range of services were stood down or scaled back due to the risk of spread of COVID-. New services were introduced to meet the predicted demands of the pandemic. A spokesperson said: With the first peak of the COVID- outbreak in Northern Ireland having passed, the Trust is now focused on planning, with our HSC partners, how to restart services while maintaining sufficient flexibility so that services can respond to future waves of this disease. In working together with our health and social care partners across NI to implement the recovery of non-COVID- HSC Services, the agreed regional approach will be to ensure equity of access to treatment for patients and clients across NI, to minimise transmission of COVID- and to protect the most urgent services. A set of guiding principles in the form of a ‘checklist’ has been established by the Department of Healthto guide service planning. The DoH has asked that service restart plans be assessed against the checklist to ensure that they have been subject to a rigorous risk assessment, take account of new ways of working and can be safely implemented in line with social distancing, use of personal protective equipmentand infection prevention and control requirements.The Western Trust has introduced a Reset Framework to support staff in assessing the impact of scaling up or restarting services and to ensure there is a rigorous and careful approach to planning.A spokesperson continued: The Western Trust Stage  Plan identies the services we have maintained throughout these initial months of the COVID- pandemic across a wide range of areas. It identies those that we will continue and others that we will begin to restart or scale up.
