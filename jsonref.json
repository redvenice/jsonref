She thought it was disgusting.\u0027         In his defence evidence Dr Gelder (pictured outside the Medical Practitioners Tribunal in Manchester) told the hearing he had apologised to both women in writing and had also a attended a course on maintaining professional boundariesNurse A then said she did not want to speak to Dr Gelder, nor work or see him again, Mr Taylor continued.  \u0027When she got to the fridge to pick up some medication for a patient, Dr Gelder was at the fridge and he said: Oh, just got her. \u0027He was laughing and she was in shock and found it inappropriate and not funny, so she walked away.\u0027Before she walked away she told him the only person allowed to do that to her was her husband and he replied Well, he\u0027s a very lucky man. \u0027The hearing was told the second incident occurred later that same day after another female colleague known as Miss B wanted to speak to Dr Gelder about patients who had been treated the previous day.Mr Taylor added: \u0027She told him the patients were not assessed properly downstairs and he had not written in the notes. \u0027They discussed this and Dr Gelder responded saying: You\u0027re sexy when you are cross. \u0027Miss B was surprised and taken aback as he had not spoken to her in that way before. He then walked away.\u0027He accepts he squeezed the nurse\u0027s bottom whilst undertaking the ward round and accepts saying the inappropriate comment you\u0027re sexy when you are cross.\u0027However, he does not accept his actions were sexually motivated saying he never had any such conscious thought and that it was an immature intention to behave in a jokey way.\u0027He thought it could possibly be a reaction to a substance called Valerian, which can be found in Pet Remedy and thought it could possibly be a reaction with the antihistamine he was taking.\u0027The tribunal was told an oral dose of 70ml of Valerian also called Fexofenadine had been shown in reports to alter excitability.Medical expert Dr Johann Grundlingh said: \u0027We know already that the potential effects of Fexofenadine could include delirium and stimulation and it is well known that drugs causing delirium and stimulation may lead to sexually disinhibition and inappropriate behaviour.\u0027Thus, a mild delirium and stimulation caused by Fexofenadine may have led to a degree of disinhibition and inappropriate behaviour, but this conclusion is more tenuous than my previous conclusion stating that Fexofenadine may have explained his symptoms of \u0027mind racing, dizziness, fainting, abnormal dreams, restlessness and nausea.\u0027In his defence evidence Dr Gelder, who has also been a Clinical Lead for a project which helps COPD sufferers, told the hearing he had apologised to both women in writing and had also a attended a course on maintaining professional boundaries.He said: \u0027I had arrived at work at 8am and was experiencing feelings of euphoria. At the time I thought I could do anything and I thought I was Superman. I think if it was a male nurse I even would have done the same to them too.\u0027I know it was a disgusting thing to do but it\u0027s never happened before. I just woke up feeling euphoric. \u0027I told the Trust I would happily expose myself to Pet Remedy again to confirm the effects. \u0027I was absolutely stunned at what happened. I have never behaved in that way before or since. Touching her bottom was inappropriate, it was a stupid idea and a practical joke.But in a statement, the nurse said: \u0027What Dr Gelder did to me made me feel dirty and cheap, he shouldn\u0027t have done it as when I explained to him that he shouldn\u0027t have done that to me, he responded by saying my husband is a lucky man.\u0027It\u0027s disgusting.

Friends have expressed disbelief when he told them of her carnal offer and he admits ‘part of me was certainly ready’. Instead, he reminded himself of his young family. A few years earlier, both virgins, he had married his high-school sweetheart in the Canadian town near Niagara Falls where he’d grown up.‘I was an innocent (very innocent), sexually supercharged guy in my mid-20,’ he recalled.‘I didn’t respond because I was busy loading my film and continuing to take pictures.’Kirkland believes the pictures he got wouldn’t have been so good if he’d got into bed with his subject. ‘We were both on such a fine, teetering edge,’ he said.‘Ultimately all of that fused energy was channelled directly into the lens.’As the shoot started to wind down, he felt a ‘warm satisfying sense of relief, almost as if we’d had sex’.He ended up lying on the floor next to her bed and they chatted about their lives and beliefs.          Monroe, he added, ‘was just being Marilyn and playing to the camera as she knew how to do very well’. Friends have expressed disbelief when he told them of her carnal offer and he admits ‘part of me was certainly ready’‘She told me about her difficult beginnings and I told her about coming from a small town in Canada and never dreaming I would some day be photographing the goddess she had become.’Twenty minutes later, he got up and let the others back in. They didn’t finally leave until well past midnight. Kirkland said he had trouble sleeping that night at the Chateau Marmont hotel as he thought about what might have been.‘We had nearly been lovers an hour earlier and now she was gone,’ he said. ‘The Marilyn Monroe I had been with on that night of the shoot unquestionably took a firm hold on me.‘She arrived in a misty vision, and when she left it was as if she had evaporated. I admitted to myself with some embarrassment that I missed her already.’However, the spell was well and truly broken the following evening as he pitched up at Monroe’s home with a spring in his step to show her the pictures he’d taken.She answered the door wearing sunglasses and a scarf over her head. She sounded ‘drawn, tired and disturbed’ and didn’t look like she’d slept at all.Kirkland said he reviewed the photos with a ‘darker, sadder’ woman than the ‘breathy, sexy beauty’ he had photographed.He’d been pleased with them but she bluntly told him they ‘aren’t great’ and cut up half of them with scissors.However, her mood improved and she finally found one she liked — of her clutching a pillow the way she’d clutch a lover.This was the girl who men would want to sleep with, she told him, using the third person to describe herself.They left on a positive note, with Marilyn telling him: ‘I want to do this with you again, real soon!’Nine months later, he was in Paris when he saw the headlines that she was dead.‘I was in disbelief and heartbroken like the rest of the world,’ he said. The pictures are some of the last professional photos that were taken of Monroe.Kirkland’s success with her proved the making of his career, especially with beautiful actresses. He photographed Julie Christie, Brigitte Bardot, Sophia Loren and Audrey Hepburn.But, he says, he still ‘gets a buzz’ of remembering his moment with Marilyn, a woman who could wield her sex appeal with ruthless efficiency."},{"url":null,"title":"A kangaroo Buckinghamshire Tory MP Steve Baker bumps lonely looking marsupial","story":"Share this article \u0027It is quite unusual for them to be near motorways with all those cars streaming past because they are generally very shy animals.\u0027There have been sporadic sightings of kangaroos and wallabies in Britain over the years.There was a colony of red-necked-wallabies in the Peak District in the 1950s and early 1960s whose population reached around 50.Many of them died during the severe winter of 1962-1963, and they are thought to have died out in the late 1990s.Thames Valley Police said they had no reports of a missing kangaroo or wallaby on Friday, but with England playing the Australian Wallabies in the Rugby World Cup quarter-final on Saturday, perhaps the rogue marsupial was sending a message. "},{"url":null,"title":"Philip Hammond says not duped backing PMs heavily camouflaged No Deal plan","story":"Share this articlePhilip Hammond: I will not vote for a heavily camouflaged no‑deal Brexit | News | The Times"},{"url":null,"title":"Hong Kong activists wear Joker Winnie Pooh masks","story":"Share this article The protests were in opposition to the government\u0027s decision this month to invoke colonial-era emergency regulations banning face masks at rallies as it struggles to contain demonstrations.The peaceful event comes ahead of a mass rally that organisers are planning on Sunday to press their demands.

But can it lead to lasting change?Chidera Eggerue, AKA The Slumflower, is a social media star, south-east London homegirl and feminist. She first came to prominence in 2017 when she created the hashtag #SaggyBoobsMatter on Twitter in order to promote the body-positive message that women’s breasts and bodies are fine just as they are. It’s an important idea and antithetical to a beauty industry that berates us for our imperfections. A year later Eggerue published a self-help motivational book, What a Time to Be Alone: The Slumflower’s Guide to Why You Are Already Enough, which entered the Sunday Times bestseller list the week it was published in 2018, when she was 23. In her very pink, zanily illustrated book, Eggerue, a self-styled “guru, confidante and best friend” to her readers, offers advice on self-worth and self-acceptance. An earlier booklet called Little Black Book: A Toolkit for Working Women, by Otegha Uwagba, became a bestseller in 2016, paving the way for Eggerue. This, in turn, was probably influenced by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s 2014 essay We Should All Be Feminists.These are unprecedented times for black female writers, in no small part due to the internet. It has reconfigured how we present ourselves to the world at large, as well as bringing previously marginalised social groups and writing to the fore in ways hitherto unimaginable. As a society we are beginning to recognise and take seriously the ills and pitfalls of social media, but it is still the most exciting channel of mass communication since history began. And these times really are extraordinary. The ripple effects of 2013’s #BlackLivesMatter moment, and the movement that followed, saw renewed interest in writings about race in the US, which spilled over into the UK. We are used to the spotlight on racism being beamed across the Atlantic while little attention is paid to the perniciousness of systemic racism in Britain, about which there is much denial. Yet when #BlackLivesMatter gained momentum, it precipitated an unprecedented interest in non-fiction books by black writers. In 2016, David Olusoga published Black and British: A Forgotten History, which accompanied an acclaimed television series and reached beyond the usual niche market for such books. Reni Eddo-Lodge’s bestselling Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race (which began as a blog post which went viral) was published in 2017. However, while Eddo-Lodge acknowledges African American feminists of yore, she is silent on our own trailblazers. In 1985, The Heart of the Race: Black Women’s Lives in Britain, edited by Beverley Bryan, Stella Dadzie and Suzanne Scafe, recently reissued, was one of the first non-fiction books that investigated the subject. Heidi Safia Mirza later published Young, Female and Black (1992) and Black British Feminism (1997). Much of this history has been lost: it is rarely taught at universities, nor does it appear in the timelines of what is effectively a whitewashed British feminist history.But all of these recent commercially and critically successful non-fiction books have sent the publishing industry into an unprecedented buying frenzy. Last year, Slay in Your Lane: The Black Girl Bible, by Yomi Adegoke and Elizabeth Uviebinené, hit the shelves, a book that celebrated the achievements of black British women while offering advice on how to get ahead. This summer, Chelsea Kwakye and Ore Ogunbiyi’s Taking Up Space: The Black Girl’s Manifesto for Change was published. It examined the experience of black students in predominantly white higher-education institutions, and also started off as a blog post written when the two women were graduating from Cambridge University in 2018. Television presenter and academic Emma Dabiri is the author of Don’t Touch My Hair (2019), a treatise on black hair and its political, cultural, historical, philosophical and personal resonances. Also published this year was Safe: Black British Men Reclaiming Space, edited by Derek Owusu, co-host of the popular black-focused literature podcast, Mostly Lit. In Black, Listed, Jeffrey Boakye offered a witty and hard-hitting take on black British culture with a quirky dictionary of terms, while No Win Race by Derek Bardowell examined sport and race, family and legacy, ning three decades from the Brixton riots of 1981 to the EU referendum.The field had been so arid up to this point that each of these works feels urgent, essential. Perhaps none is more transgressive than The Grassling, by Elizabeth-Jane Burnett, also a poet, whose 2019 “geological memoir” explores the Devon countryside where she was raised. Burnett’s deeply poetic communion with nature reminds me of Ingrid Pollard’s 1988 Pastoral Interlude series of photographs, which captured, radically, and in a way that was ahead of its time, solitary black figures in the English countryside. Similarly, the play Black Men Walking, written by Testament, featured three northern black men who go on walking trips in the wilds of the Peak District – and talk. Seeing black British people, especially men, extracted from their usual depiction in an urban environment makes you realise how limiting that portrayal has been, how black life has become synonymous with the metropolis. Black Men Walking was a refreshing, progressive look at male friendship in a pastoral setting, while Burnett’s memoir connects us at a primal, immersive level to the topography of a country that is as much ours as anyone else’s.Also off the beaten track is Afropean: Notes from Black Europe (2019) by Johny Pitts, whose travels and encounters with black communities offer a counter-narrative to a continent associated with whiteness. Comparisons will too easily be made with Caryl Phillips’s 1987 pan-European travelogue, The European Tribe. But whereas Phillips’s book is a moving account of the experiences of a black man observing an overwhelming European whiteness more than 30 years ago, Pitts shows us today’s black communities on the continent, and reframes our understanding of it. The books are companion pieces, as well as lessons in history, travel and identity. I ventured on to this terrain in my 2005 novel-with-verse Soul Tourists, creating a fictional black couple who travel across Europe by car to the Middle East in the late 1980s, a journey I myself had undertaken. But books about Europe from a black British perspective, fiction or non-fiction, are hard to find.Writing is a solitary rather than a communal process, and not all writers are community spirited, but the new, mostly female, young activist writer communities use social media to market their projects. These are twentysomethings who employ the term “womxn”, with its inclusive emphasis on women of colour, queer and trans people. These womxn are not waiting for the establishment to fund or publish them they are getting on with it themselves by setting the terms of their intellectual and creative endeavours.I include here the influential gal-dem and Black Ballad magazines, the organisers of the Black Girl festival, Octavia poets’ collective and the Heaux Noire womxn of colour poetry events. Their entrepreneurship and self-determination remind me of the 1980s, when I was their age. Back then, I co-founded Theatre of Black Women, Britain’s first such company, with Patricia Hilaire and Paulette Randall. Out of this community emerged other theatre companies, dance troupes, music groups, publishers, arts collectives. We remade and imagined the complexities of our lives through an art we could call our own. We were a sisterhood, sometimes dysfunctional, not always in agreement, but there was a network of support and collaboration, much as I see with the young womxn of today.In the early 80s, those of us who wanted to write had to look across the Atlantic for inspiration. While there was a literary lineage of black writers in Britain going back to the 1950s and earlier, they were predominantly male and first-generation. In 80s Britain, the Women’s Press imported the successful books of Alice Walker from the US, but with a couple of exceptions, such as the two novels of Joan Riley, was not interested in black British women’s writing. And while Virago championed Maya Angelou, her homegrown counterparts were mostly absent from their lists.I remember disappearing between the pages of Home Girls: A Black Feminist Anthology (1999), edited by Barbara Smith, during one long weekend and discovering African American female writers who had the confidence and experience to express their realities through poetry and essays. The fragmentary prose-poetry books of the Jamaican-American author, Michelle Cliff, such as Claiming an Identity They Taught Me to Despise (1980), inspired me to be adventurous with my own writing. In her essay “Caliban’s Daughter” (1991), Cliff wrote that her aim was “to reject speechlessness, a process which has taken years, and to invent my own peculiar speech with which to describe my own peculiar self, to draw together everything I am and have been”.Similarly, Audre Lorde wrote in Sister Outsider (1984): “What are the words you do not yet have? What do you need to say? What are the tyrannies you swallow day by day and attempt to make your own, until you will sicken of them and die of them, still in silence.” She inspired my generation of feminists, much as she now inspires the latest generation, with new editions of her works. I met her when she visited London in the early 80s. She wanted to spend time with young black feminists. At an event at the Drill Hall theatre, with an audience of mostly white women, she demanded that the black women without tickets in the lobby be let in, or she wouldn’t take to the stage.And how enriching and motivating it was to read interviews with so many great writers in Black Women Writers at Work (1984) edited by Claudia Tate. These African American women spoke of their process and practice long before you could trawl through online interviews and find authors doing the same. I am indebted to the female writers who went before me, whose pamphlets and books shaped me in my formative years and have travelled with me to my many homes over the decades works that are stained with tobacco smoke, coffee and red wine from the days when I indulged in all three, and, while I have dispensed with thousands of books in my time, these and others from that era I treasure – they still reside on my bookshelves, grouped together to remind me that they were the making of me.We British female writers were emboldened and encouraged by their literature as we began to produce our own. Anthologies were a good way to start to showcase our burgeoning talents and to give us the confidence that comes with publication. There were several anthologies, such as Black Women Talk Poetry (1987), which featured 20 poets, including Jackie Kay, Dorothea Smartt and Adjoa Andoh, published by the newly formed Black Women Talk Poetry Collective of Da Choong, Olivette Cole-Wilson, Gabriela Pearse and myself and Watchers and Seekers (1987), a mixture of poetry and fiction, edited by Rhonda Cobham and Merle Collins.In creating an alternative space for our politicised creativity, we were challenging the status quo. We were too often excluded from white feminist endeavours, just as we were excluded or marginalised from much of the contemporaneous black male arts production. Many of us were queer, either transiently, as it turned out, or for life. This meant that we were more likely to organise as women together, and less reliant on male opinion and approval. Like today’s young arts activists, we were doing it for ourselves rather than hoping to be cherry-picked by this country’s white cultural producers.We never imagined that we would be taken as seriously as we are at this moment. I was thrilled to win the Booker prize earlier this week, just as I was overjoyed when Lubaina Himid won the Turner prize in 2017 for her exciting, innovative and spectacular work, four decades after she began her career as an artist. Similarly, Adjoa Andoh recently co-directed and starred in the first all-women-of-colour Shakespeare production on a major stage in Britain, Richard II at the Globe.One thing I have learned is that the future won’t look after itself. We cannot take any developments for granted. If those of us who are considered marginal stop campaigning, we experience social regression. I wonder what will happen if the support systems, networks and development programmes for people of colour cease to exist. The plethora of books currently being published is astonishing, but we must be wary because today’s boom is not the result of a steady, incremental transition. It has exploded out of a void.Where are its foundations? I have written in the past about fads in the literary world for writers of colour, especially the period in the mid-to-late 90s when there were more young black men and women publishing fiction than ever before, with a tendency towards coming-of-age narratives. By the noughties most of these writers had disappeared. What happens when the big advances do not deliver on their promise? What happens when second-book syndrome kicks in? What about those who have become authors almost by accident, via blogs leading to instant book deals? We want the field of writing to be wide and abundant, ning the very young through to the very old. We want our writers to have long careers spent producing work that matures as they do. Yet the emphasis in publishing and the media focuses on the new and the young, although new and young isn’t synonymous with fresh and original. Some of these writers become shooting stars, and when their moment has passed we wonder what happened to them. History tells us that books can too easily disappear from literary and cultural memory, until such time as they are rediscovered, if at all. Alice Walker resurrected the once-celebrated Zora Neale Hurston in 1975, 15 years after her death. Hurston’s books had been out of print for decades. Obscurity has been the fate of too many black female writers.What is the role of books in our brave new world where knee-jerk reactions predominate, moral outrage is the prevailing orthodoxy and ideas must be compressed to sound bites? Chidera Eggerue, with a hefty 244,000-plus Instagram followers and 79,000-plus on Twitter, sagely advises: “Instagram might shut down one day and suddenly nobody will care about your 80,000 followers. Relevance in the offline world is key.” Conversely, the older writers, artists and activists who eschew social media are missing out on bringing their wisdom, experience and perspective to these debates. It’s an exciting political, intellectual and creative space, and we need to be a part of it – and if not, we must ask ourselves if we are relinquishing our responsibility towards the future.Eggerue, and other arts activists of her generation, are benefiting from the desire of the multinationals to be aligned with woke young people and to exploit their marketability. The revolution, or rather what we might think of as this countercultural moment where those previously without a platform are having their say, has already been commodified. Those of us who are alert to the capriciousness of this should trumpet a note of caution to those who are swept up in the glamour of the moment. We need to ask ourselves how best we can effect change for our constituencies that is sustainable rather than fashionable. My answer is that the spirit of entrepreneurship, community and arts activism will sustain us long after it’s no longer woke to be “woke”.• Brave New Words: The Power of Writing Now, edited by Susheila Nasta, is published by Myriad, to celebrate 35 years of Wasafiri magazine.

Can a follow-up recapture its magic? The author talks about surprise success in her sixth decadeThere is a moment in Olive, Again, the eagerly awaited follow-up to Olive Kitteridge, Elizabeth Strout’s best-seller of 2008, in which the novelist’s virtuosity is on full display. Kitteridge, an elderly widow by now and still living in Maine, spots a former pupil in a diner – the girl has become famous, she is the poet laureate – and approaches her to revive the connection. In the exchange that follows, one becomes aware of Strout’s sympathetic range: she is Kitteridge, fawning over the celebrated writer while remaining convinced of her own superiority she is Andrea, the poet, regarding her old teacher with a cold eye and of course she is the novelist herself, exhibiting, in the dynamic between these women, the ruthless gaze of the writer on her prey. “That was the first story that I wrote for Olive, Again,” says Strout, cheerfully. “She just showed up and I saw her nosing her car into the marina and I thought: Oh man, she’s back.” She laughs with pure joy.Olive Kitteridge, one of the great, difficult women of American literature, became instantaneously beloved when the book was first published, somewhat to the surprise of her creator. Olive is blunt, erratic, bad-tempered. Her persona, when fully charged, doesn’t brook any compromise and tends towards the invulnerable, which is why, when she has her feelings hurt, it is almost too much for the reader to bear. In the first book, this took the form of Olive at her son’s wedding, overhearing her daughter-in-law mock her dress. In Olive, Again, it is the moment when Andrea the poet assassinates Olive in a poem, and a slew of small slights and denigrations. “God, she was a strange woman,” thinks Jack, the man who becomes her second husband, much to his surprise. Olive Kitteridge sold more than a million copies and won the 2009 Pulitzer prize, but to the book’s fans, its greater achievement was to take a certain ornery type, eccentric and ungainly, and make her seem noble.Strout, who continues to be mildly baffled by the success of the book, is grateful that it came late in her career she was 53 when Olive Kitteridge was published, “and thank God I wasn’t 23. Because at that point I’d had so many years of isolation and working and just slogging through, that although I was grateful, I was far, far too old to be changed”.Ten years later, we are in her apartment in Manhattan, where she and her husband James, a retired lawyer, live half the time, spending the other half at their house in Maine. They married in 2011 after meeting at one of Strout’s book events (her first husband, Martin, was a public defender they orced after 20 years together). Most of Strout’s work, starting with Amy and Isabelle, published in 2001, and ending with Olive Kitteridge, was written in Brooklyn, where Strout raised her daughter, Zarina, now 35 and working as a playwright. “She was my only kid and I just pathologically loved her,” she says. But while the city nourished her life for decades, as a writer it was undoubtedly Maine that made her.The gap between a character’s persona and their inner workings is everywhere on display in Strout’s books. For Olive, it is there in a moment of existential panic when, seeing her grandson’s abandoned red scarf on the floor, she realises with a sudden pang that she has failed as a mother. In her fifth novel, My Name Is Lucy Barton, the story of a writer living in New York and her mother in Illinois, it is in the gap between the narrator’s polished life in the city and the memory of her spartan, violent childhood. For Strout herself, for a long time, it was the role occupied by Maine in her psyche.As in Elizabeth Gaskell’s Cranford, the apparent smallness of the lives conjured by Strout – small town folk doing small town things – makes the movements within them seem larger. Strout always starts off with a scene. “I learned that years ago, when my daughter was small and I only had a couple of hours: OK, if I can get a scene down with a heartbeat to it, then it will connect with others eventually. So when I write a scene, I try to use whatever is most urgent in me at that moment and transpose it into a character, so that it will be a living thing that’s real.” The scenes are always sequential and she often gets stuck. “Oh, all the time. And I just keep writing different scenes, keep literally scratching them out and lots of them end up on the floor. And then I’ll realise oh, this works, and this works with it.”Strout does regret very well, and disappointment – the aching sadness of Olive’s bad relationship with Christopher, her son. She’s also good at the drive-by observation that doesn’t compact into a teachable moment, and at upending expectation to sometimes shocking effect. In one scene in the new book, a teenage girl permits a man with dementia to observe her touching herself up and, rather than feeling molested by his voyeurism, feels oddly empowered. It’s a risky scene but, says Strout, “I think that a part of me is always trying to write against the grain I don’t mean the political correctness grain, but you’re always trying to look for the areas that are not obvious. So for her to actually do this, and feel important as a result of it, is going against the grain. That’s not why I did it, but it’s an interesting aspect of a human experience.”It took Strout a long time to realise that Maine was her subject. She had spent so many years trying to leave the place that it seemed to her, in the first instance, perverse to return to it in her fiction. She grew up in a remote house outside Portland, where her father was a scientist – he studied parasites and tropical diseases – and her mother was an English teacher. She was an oddball in the family and in that part of the world. The New England character is, according to stereotype, shuttered, repressed, disinclined to outburst and Strout was none of these things. “I used to joke that there had to be some kind of mutation of genes,” she says. “There had to be! I have an older brother and he’s very Maine, very reticent, very much a Yankee. And he’ll tell you that himself, if he chose to speak to you. And I was always talking. My father would say to me at Thanksgiving – these joyless Thanksgivings, with a chicken with no spices and water not alcohol – and I can remember my father telling me: ‘When I put my hand to my tie, it means you’re talking too much.’”Was she crushed by that? “Oh no! Not remotely. Every so often I’d see: Oh! His hand’s on his tie! And then I would just start to talk again.” After attending college, first Bates, in Maine, and later law school at Syracuse University, Strout said to her mother that she’d decided to be a writer. “And her response was: ‘Well you’ve never had a shortage of words.’” In fact, Strout would be 45 before her first novel was published. The strange thing, she says, is that she never doubted that it would happen one day. After graduating, she went to live in the UK, in Oxford for a year where a boyfriend was living and worked at a pub in the city. “And I tried to write stories but I had no success. I survived – I had a little bedsit, a room in a woman’s house outside of town and it was very grim. She didn’t like me.” Her stories were rejected and she carried on, less out of confidence than compulsion “I can’t not do it.”She was helped, she thinks, by her upbringing. “There was a tremendous isolation from the real world,” she says. “Because we had lived in the woods far away from anybody and when I wasn’t talking to my old aunts who lived down the road and paid no attention to me, I spent a lot of time alone. I developed inner resources, out there in the woods. I knew how to be alone. And I just kept thinking if I keep doing this I’ll get better. And then I finally did.”When, in 2001, Amy and Isabelle, a novel about a mother and daughter living in Maine, was finally published and became a bestseller, Strout pulled out a big box of rejection letters from where she’d stored them in her basement in Brooklyn. “And I thought: ‘Well, now I can look at them and not care.’ But they hurt me all over again!” Strout hoots with laughter.The turning point in her writing had come, surprisingly, when she enrolled in a standup comedy course in her late 30s. Something in her released, and for the first time, she realised that in order to write honestly, she had to look with a much clearer eye at where she had come from. “I was so white, as everybody up there – especially then – was, that I didn’t even know it. And then having moved to New York, I started to recognise there are many different cultures, but I still didn’t get who I was in the midst of all these cultures until I took that class the routine was about making fun of myself for being from New England and so white, and then I realised oh my God, that’s who I am. It sounds stupid, but I was so insulated for so long, that I just didn’t know.”She had been writing for about 15 years by then, without much success. “I was trying to write like a Writer, instead of finding my own voice and the other mistake was I was trying to use a relatively new environment to write about – New York – that had not yet absorbed into me completely. At some point I remember being aware of a little bit of nostalgia for New England a little tiny rumble of oh, right, the way the light would fall through the trees, and then I began to realise OK, that’s where I need to be writing about.”She never starts a novel or a story with a big picture in mind. Even her 2013 novel, The Burgess Boys, her most political work that took years to research and told the story of a hate crime in a Somali community, grew out of her interest in family dynamics. In Olive, Again, there are touches of politics a Trump bumper sticker here, a caustic remark from Olive about the president there. But they don’t intrude and there is never a sense that Strout is trying to write a state of the nation novel. Her interest has always been more one of verisimilitude.“Ever since I was a child, I always wanted to know what it felt like to be another person. That’s the engine that has propelled me. What does it feel like to be that person, sitting on the subway – I can see her trousers are a little snug so I know what that would feel like. I would spend so much time trying to figure out what it feels like to be another person.”One of Strout’s concerns about Olive, Again, was that, as her character had aged and become more reflective, “she might not have the same pop that she had had”. That she had moved her into a mellower period? “Exactly. And yet she remains Olive.” She does. Olive is still Olive, her power is undiminished.Many years ago, when the first Kitteridge book came out, Strout was approached by a young woman at a book event who told her that she was part of a group of young women from Greenwich, Connecticut, who met every Monday morning at Starbucks to discuss their “Olive moments” of the previous week. “It was so interesting. I don’t quite understand the reverberation, although I’m grateful for it,” she says. It is something to do with authenticity, the ineffable Olive-ness of Olive, a woman who, however disagreeable, “is who she is”. What would Olive make of that assessment? Strout grins. “She wouldn’t care.”• Olive, Again will be published by Viking (£14.99) on 31 October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8165a8d16c4ad25909e33c150cb0e22f58f19228/61_558_2531_1518/master/2531.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=173cdd1f1142ea28448af838ccaf3121","title":"patti smtih reading mark twain gave me anxiety","story":"The author and musician on Jean Genet, Little Women and crying over Charlotte BrontëThe book I am currently readingI have just begun Space Invaders by Nona Fernández.

All stores remain open for the time being and no redundancies have been made.Tony Wright, a joint administrator and partner at FRP Advisory who was appointed on Friday afternoon, said: “Bonmarché has been a staple on the UK high street for nearly three decades, but the persistent challenges facing retail have taken their toll and led to the administration.” He said he hoped to find a buyer for the business.Helen Connolly, the chief executive of Bonmarché, said: “The high street is going through a period of historic difficulty and we have been unable to weather the economic headwinds impacting the whole of the retail sector.”Bonmarché, founded in 1982, is the latest in a string of high street chains to get into difficulties as shoppers rein in spending amid economic uncertainty while staff costs and business rates have risen. Profits have also come under pressure as the value of the pound has fallen against the dollar, increasing the cost of buying goods overseas.Karen Millen, Coast, House of Fraser and Debenhams have all fallen into administration in the past 18 months while New Look and Marks \u0026amp Spencer have been closing stores.Bonmarché, which previously went into administration with sister chain Peacocks in 2012, issued a string of profits warnings in the past year, saying it expected to make a loss of up to £6m this year.The collapse comes after Bonmarché was taken private by the Edinburgh Woollen Mill owner Philip Day’s Dubai-based acquisition vehicle Spectre in August.The value of Day’s £5m-plus investment in Bonmarché will be wiped out in the administration and it is not clear if Day, who also owns Jaeger, Austin Reed and Peacocks, will try and maintain control of the business.Bonmarché’s problems emerged on the same day that Watt Brothers, the Scottish department store chain, also called in administrators with 220 immediate redundancies and nearly 90 further jobs on the line."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b43a7d0fa640b3756d915d2c68c58e8298a2f417/0_138_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a19436fb58a872b1d91041ea32325f0","title":"no deal brexit food shortages are you a small business owner whos stockpiling","story":"We’d like to hear from small business owners about how they are preparing ahead of BrexitWith the cut-off date to secure a Brexit deal looming, the likely outcome of negotiations this week is still uncertain.

Always ahead of the curve, David Cameron is leaning in to the coming winds of financial and ritualistic deregulation with demob abandon. Speaking in Harrogate to promote his book on Thursday night, Cameron predicted success for Boris Johnson and his deal. As the former prime minister put it: “The thing about the greased piglet is that he manages to slip through other people’s hands where mere mortals fail.”That’s it, mate. Why keep your mouth shut about pigs any more? We should just take it from one who knows: greasing a pig makes it go better. Given the dramatic degeneration of our public conversation over the past three years, it feels right that Cameron chose to finally “go there” on the porcine front in Harrogate, a town that was for so long a byword for a certain type of regional gentility.I would imagine his next tour stop will be in Royal Leamington Spa, where he will expand on the point with a demonstration comparing different means of lubricant. Local boars who’ve always wanted to put their daughter on the stage are invited to get in touch with his promoter.As for which atrocious timeline we are about to be flung into tomorrow, who can say? A lot of journalists would certainly like to say. Everything has improved, hasn’t it, since journalists decided their job is predicting what might happen in the future as opposed to reporting on what they do currently know, or scrutinising what they can currently see.Thus the 36 hours or so between Johnson announcing his deal in Brussels and the special sitting of parliament to vote on it feel like they have been mostly spent watching or reading hacks and pundits debating the complex question, “Will the agreement pass?” I don’t know, guys! I guess you could concentrate on what’s in it – or are you as committed to a no-spoilers Brexit as the government is?Lavishing hours of airtime and miles of column inches on speculating precisely how close it all is feels a bit like being given advance notice of a shitstorm, and frittering your day away taking spread bets on the possible wind speed. Six votes? Three votes? Would someone like to come on air and say they reckon there’s maybe just a couple of votes in it? What if it was a tie?Either way, the conclusion, which may of course be debunked tomorrow, is that it will be Very Close. Then, when it is, lots of people will be able to sweep online to declare that they “CALLED IT”. You can print out those tweets and burn them for warmth in the years when we’re discovering the true implications of the Very Close Vote on whatever it was a vote on.The only people who seem to have spent less time thinking about the detail are the likes of Andrew Bridgen. “It looks like Brexit, it smells like Brexit,” he explained to Channel 4 News. “That’s Brexit for me.” Despite being even more cruelly miscast as a “Spartan” than cinema’s Gerard Butler once was, the likes of Mark Francois and Andrew Bridgen have succeeded in getting apparently serious commentators to use their self-styled nickname “the Spartans” without deploying airquotes so thrustingly sarcastic that they could be harnessed for wind power.Meanwhile, Michael Gove could be found lurching unsteadily towards the TV camera to bat away Andrew Neil’s inquiry about the possibility of a second referendum amendment. “That ain’t gonna happen,” drawled the bespectacled Clint Eastwood of Surrey Heath. “Ain’t gonna – ain’t gonna be no second referendum.” In retrospect, that may be the moment this once self-respecting nation had to officially admit it was over.We have created an environment so intensely deregulated that Michael Gove is emboldened enough to imagine he’s some kind of gunslinger. The system has already failed. We passed checks and balances three galaxies ago. Our executive defences have been breached by Jacob Rees-Mogg, a man grown in a petri dish to provide Monty Burns with someone who could lose to him at arm wrestling.Given the problems Theresa May had, there was some sense of surprise that Johnson should have pulled off a deal acceptable to the more deranged elements of his party. But history is likely to judge that it’s easier than it looks when you’re a man whose sole ideological red line is frictionless abortions. Having given a speech in November 2018 insisting that “no British Conservative government could or should sign up” to regulatory and customs checks in the Irish Sea, Johnson’s British Conservative government was just shy of three months old when it cheerily signed up to regulatory and customs checks in the Irish Sea. That was a great outcome, explained foreign secretary and famous geography dunce Dominic Raab, who said it was a “cracking deal” for Northern Ireland on the basis that they’d keep “frictionless access to the single market”. There it is: the dream. Only a few more days of having to remember which lie you told.Speaking of Northern Ireland, the week has offered the chance to watch the Democratic Unionist party discover in real time who the sucker at the table was. It would take a heart of stone not to enjoy the disappointment of DUP hive queen Arlene Foster, who has carried herself throughout the Brexit process like the kind of maternal screen villain who tries to scupper their child’s every romantic attachment for not being good enough.The DUP have so enjoyed being at the centre of the soap opera since the 2017 election, and acting like as, that they didn’t realise until they saw this week’s script that the producers couldn’t be doing with them any more and were killing them off. It’s a lot like what happened with Martine McCutcheon on EastEnders. She went off and showed them by having a 15-minute pop career Arlene is not thought to have any musical ambitions, but will now always be a hero to those dreaming of a united Ireland.As for the prime minister, he seems to be enjoying himself, as much as is possible for a sort of middle-aged Kylo Ren who’s making all the correct self-care decisions. In Westminster, many judge that, whatever happens tomorrow, Boris Johnson is in a win-win situation, with the sole losing entity being the entire United Kingdom. As David Cameron continues to promote his bestselling book, and the rabid deregulators continue to promote Boris Johnson, it does feel as if the nation might end up the true sucker in all this. Then again, for all the mirth it produced, there was always a rather leaden sense of dramatic irony clouding the original Cameronpig tale. People like David Cameron end up playing David Cameron. The rest of the public is in danger of being the pig."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebe08ff31f6620ca528e6e26f10b217cccc095fc/0_55_5099_3059/master/5099.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23f71e3dc9c2b6fc41bfb55976082636","title":"we as mps need to come together to get brexit done and move on","story":"Pride needs to be swallowed and colleagues of all stripes need to vote for a deal on SaturdayLast month, we came together with colleagues across the house to find a middle ground between the extremes of no deal and a second referendum. Our mission was to give a voice to the silent majority – both in parliament and across the country – a voice to those who respect the result of the referendum, and who want us to leave with a deal and move on.When our constituents tell us they are fed up of politics, and tired of Brexit, we can understand where they are coming from. They tell us we are focused on the wrong things, our priorities are all wrong, and that the issues they care about have been cast aside by the Brexit distraction.Switching on the news, it’s easy to think that MPs spend all their time fighting and disagreeing with each other. But quietly, in the background, many of us have clung to the things that unite us – the things that will matter long after Brexit has been resolved.That’s why we have decided to write together the day before this historic sitting – not just as a proof that MPs of different stripes can work together, but to implore our colleagues to use this unique chance to help us move on, and get back to helping our constituents.A no-deal Brexit will risk their prosperity, and a second referendum will only deepen the schism of the past three years. Pride needs to be swallowed on both sides, and clear heads must prevail.The risk of letting this final shot at a deal slip through our fingers is too great. Our collective hope rests on brave Labour MPs, and indeed others, who can see that.We consider ourselves to be normal women, working hard for our constituencies. We can’t stand the shouting and the ision, and want to return to a politics that remembers the things we have in common with one another. A parliament that extends a hand to the workers, that builds shelter for the homeless, that does more than ever for our environment, and lets our kids grow up on safe streets.Far from being ashamed of relying on one another, as MPs from opposite sides we recognise that it is imperative we move on, together. It’s the only way we can rebuild our politics, and unite the country.

Jargon, vague promises, dire warnings, contradictory predictions, a few catchphrases – an alternately gripping and boring conversation that has been going on for years, only occasionally accompanied by actual changes to everyday life. It’s a conversation that remainers have rarely controlled, let alone dominated. If they are, finally, about to lose the Brexit battle, this may be why.For all their ingenuity and energy since the referendum, they haven’t done enough to undermine the messages that leavers have used to sell their project. Nor have remainers produced equally effective propaganda of their own. Much of the empirical case for Brexit may have unravelled over the past three years, but remainers still haven’t shifted public opinion decisively enough.After the referendum result was announced, leave figures quickly began talking about “the biggest democratic exercise” and “largest mandate” in British history. The first claim was incorrect: more people voted in the 1992 general election, when the UK population was more than a 10th smaller. And the second claim was at least debatable: the leavers’ victory margin was much narrower than those in the UK’s two previous national referendums. Yet remainers did little to stop both claims solidifying into orthodoxies, so widely held that to question them feels a bit nit-picking, nerdy, counterintuitive. The leavers’ preferred frame has been placed around the referendum result.The same has happened with who voted for Brexit. Again and again, they have been characterised as “the left behind”: poor, neglected, Labour-inclined voters from the north of England. The reality that Brexit is essentially a rightwing project – to deregulate the British economy for the benefit of more hard-nosed, non-EU capitalism – has been largely obscured. Since 2016, a few dissenting academics, most prominently the Oxford University geographer Danny Dorling, have produced strong evidence that more Brexit voters were, in fact, prosperous Conservatives from southern England. But these interventions have hardly dented the conventional wisdom. From BBC vox pops to tabloid editorials to Labour shadow cabinet meetings, “left-behind” leavers still loom disproportionately large. Remainers have been unable to identify and promote a similarly marketable political cohort of their own.Another pro-Brexit message that has been allowed to spread largely unchecked is that it’s possible to “get Brexit done” quickly and conclusively. In February, the pollster Andrew Cooper wrote in the London Evening Standard that when focus groups were told that an initial Brexit deal “would actually trigger a new and almost certainly much longer and more complex new phase of talks”, there was “horrified silence”. That remainers have failed since 2016 to bring most voters to this realisation – that they have made Brexit seem a malign but largely abstract process – has been a crucial failure.Yet perhaps the inability of remainers to control the Brexit discourse should be no surprise. The formation of the prevailing common sense on political questions is rarely driven by which side has the better ideas. The leavers have had most of the press on their side, implacably anti-European for decades. And the BBC has been strikingly reluctant to pick apart dubious pro-Brexit claims, for example about the supposedly overwhelming leave mandate – for fear, it seems, of being accused of remainer bias. More helpful still, leave has benefited from the tendency of most journalists, very obvious in recent days – see the breathless excitement about Johnson’s “great new deal” – to prefer breakthroughs to stalemates. Rather than assuming that journalists outside the Tory press would always act as remain’s allies – as fact-checkers against the leavers’ half-truths and lies – remainers should have realised that a Brexit deal, and whatever uncharted world comes after, is simply a better story for the media than Britain staying in the EU.Leavers have had much of Whitehall on their side, too. The government’s “Get Ready for Brexit” campaign, launched last month, was officially described as Britain’s “largest ever government public information campaign”. It may be clunky, but together with the equally derided Department for Exiting the European Union, established in 2016, the publicity campaign has helped to keep Brexit feeling inevitable, even at times when the government’s flailings at Westminster have suggested otherwise.Remain has lacked such potent allies. Despite the huge economic risks of Brexit, business organisations have not opposed it with much intensity. Currently, the website of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) meekly hopes for “a good Brexit deal” that “delivers frictionless trade” – as if the latter was a realistic ambition rather than a fantasy, shared by many leavers, for a country intending to exit the world’s richest free trade zone. This month, the CBI has reserved its energies for a fierce but factually inaccurate attack on Labour’s nationalisation plans instead. The episode suggests the CBI might be more assertive if Brexit were being pursued by a Labour government.Given all these biases, perhaps even a more proactive remain propaganda campaign would have been doomed from the start. Yet the failure to mount one, at least so far, does reveal something important about the remain movement. It has not been focused enough, in a sense, not political enough. At times, in fact, it has tried to make a virtue of not being political.It’s telling that the only two remain phrases to really cut through have been “bollocks to Brexit” (morale-boosting defiance for the already converted) and “people’s vote” (a call for a second referendum that is coy about how people should actually vote). Neither has the agenda-setting quality of the leavers’ best messages.In the long run, the remainers’ rhetorical failures may matter less than they have since 2016. If Johnson’s deal passes, and both the leavers’ euphoria and the wider public’s sense of relief dissipate, the Brexit crisis will still be there – but as a more concrete matter, less about rhetoric and more about economic and diplomatic realities. Remainers may finally be able to say the words that some of them have been itching to use for years: “We told you so.” It’s emblematic of the whole Brexit tragedy that the remainers’ best line can only be used when it’s too late.• Andy Beckett is a feature writer for the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f03f83d52f4ce1a95a00eb2b2d41debdcf9efb72/0_18_1216_730/master/1216.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68f8b116adb1844ec74cb584f1970e6b","title":"10 unmissable experiences in nova scotia","story":"Whether it’s visiting wine country by doubledecker bus, rafting on a tidal bore or tucking into a lobster feast, there are memories to be made in Nova ScotiaNova Scotia is the kind of place where strangers stop to talk and smiles come easy. It’s also where this famous east-coast hospitality, fresh seafood, good wine and pristine beaches all come together to create memorable summer holidays. Just a six-hour flight from the UK, there’s no shortage of things to do, from exploring historic fishing villages to world-class surfing. Here are our top 10 recommendations.Line up a lobsterWhether it’s fish and chips from a food truck or fresh oysters from a trendy downtown restaurant, there is no shortage of seafood here. Although Nova Scotia is renowned for its lobster, other seafood options are extensive and menus are constantly evolving, but for a traditional lobster feast, you can take your pick from a lineup of restaurants along the Halifax waterfront. The most famous local lobster experience, however, can be found at the Shore Club, located by the shore 30 minutes outside of the city in Hubbards. The club has been around for more than 80 years and is popular with locals, while the restaurant serves a daily lobster dinner throughout the summer.Take in colourful LunenburgThe charming seaside town, located an hour south of Halifax, on the South Shore, is known for its brightly painted wooden houses and buildings. The colourful facades are meant to reflect how the town would have looked during Victorian times, when houses served as beacons for the ships coming in to port. It’s the perfect town to stroll in, stopping for a fresh seafood lunch by the water and admiring the secret coves and fishing boats. It’s also home to the Fisheries Museum of the Atlantic, as well as the Ironworks Distillery, where visitors can enjoy both local spirits and a lesson in Lunenburg’s history of rum running.Have a pre-breakfast surfThe secret is out: some of the best waves this side of the Atlantic are waiting for those intrepid enough to withstand the cool waters. Think misty mornings, wetsuits and world-class waves, all set against the bucolic backdrop of friendly, rural communities. Infamous east-coast storms and hurricanes can result in some intense waves, but it’s still a good spot to learn, with the help of expert teachers at East Coast Surf School. Bonus: the waves are so close to the city you can hit the beach for an early-morning surf and be back in time for breakfast.Sea kayaking in Cape LaHaveKayak through a network of more than 20 islands, with incredible local guides at Cape LaHave Adventures. Paddlers can learn about the flora, fauna and folklore of the region and see untouched beaches and coastal wildlife, including seals. Choose from a two-hour lesson to a three-day glamping adventure that includes campfires, craft cocktails and fresh oysters for dinner.The Rum Runners TrailDuring Prohibition, many Nova Scotian fishermen opted for a lucrative career change: rum running from Canada to the eastern seaboard of the US. The former train route that transported much of the booze from the hidden inlets to the main ports, almost 100 years ago, has now been converted into a 74-mile multi-use trail that runs between Halifax and Lunenburg. The trail is the ideal way for outdoor enthusiasts to explore the coastal communities, stopping at local cafes, bars, beaches and provincial parks along the way.Alight at Peggy’s Cove Nova Scotia is home to more than 150 lighthouses, but the one at Peggy’s Cove is definitely the most recognised. Just a 40-minute drive outside Halifax, the cove is covered in sprawling granite boulders that stretch out into the crashing waves of the Atlantic, creating a dramatic backdrop for landscape photos and windswept selfies. Wooden fishing shacks and lobster traps line the inlet that both local fishermen and an inspired community of artists all call home.Fossil hunt at Bay of FundyThe Bay of Fundy is a unique, visually arresting coastal environment. Every day the tide rises as high as 16 metres (53 feet) and during the following six hours recedes back down, leaving behind geological gems on the ocean floor. At low tide, it’s possible to walk along the mudflats, hunt for fossils and look at marine life in tidal pools. For a more adrenaline-infused way to experience the tides, head out on a tidal-bore rafting adventure. When the incoming tide meets the Shubenacadie River, the waves created by the tidal bore make for a pretty wild rafting ride.On the Halifax waterfrontHalifax boasts almost 4km of boardwalk and the waterfront is jam-packed with museums, farmers’ markets and shops. There are also plenty of options for harbour tours. Alternatively, watch the boats sail in while sipping on a cold pint in a beer garden, or head somewhere a little more upscale, like the Five Fishermen, to feast on fresh seafood and local wines. Catch some live music at Stayner’s Wharf Pub and Grill, or at the iconic Lower Deck, located in one of the beautiful Historic Properties. Across the harbour, the downtown of neighbouring Dartmouth boasts lots of excellent cafes, breweries and restaurants. The ferry takes just 10 minutes to cross and offers excellent views of the city.Explore the coastlineWherever you end up in Nova Scotia, you can count on a beach being close by. The province has more than 8,200 miles of pristine coastline, including the many islands that dot the coast, and there are beaches to suit everyone’s taste. Think white sand and crystal-clear turquoise water, rocky, mist-laden shores with rolling waves or swimming and relaxing at the warm water beaches of Northumberland Shore. If you fancy surfing, Lawrencetown beach is a favourite, with its sand and cobblestone beach and big waves, just half an hour from the city centre. Crystal Crescent, just 40 minutes south of the city, is an expansive crescent-shaped beach, backed by a gorgeous 12-mile coastal hiking trail.Enjoy the east-coast hospitality and explore Halifax with Canadian Affair"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbe692aacaa6cff92b06975d8f44d560be532d79/0_172_5733_3442/master/5733.jpg?width=160\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e13e77651c7a5595c41721598933580b 160w","title":"we have the best hole in the walls the insider guide to edmonton","story":"Hometown devotee Jen Mallia chats with city ambassador Linda Hoang and photographer extraordinaire Emilie Iggiotti for the inside scoop on Edmonton, Alberta’s buzzing capitalEdmonton boasts an arts scene that won’t quit and a banging array of places to eat and drink, plus opportunities to commune with nature, shop indie boutiques or visit the largest mall on the continent. It’s a welcoming city on the prairies of roughly a million people – a home for artists, tradespeople, academics, government workers, and people from around the world. Edmonton is the place you didn’t know you belonged!Another way to enjoy the mix of the urban and provincial in Edmonton is at one of the farmers’ markets. Many of them are outdoor, and therefore seasonal, but a select few operate year-round indoors. The Downtown Farmers’ Market is an indoor-outdoor hybrid. During the winter months, the market takes over one of downtown’s historic buildings, and in the warmer months it takes to the streets.During the summer months, the outdoor markets shift around the city, and you’ll find local gems around Edmonton’s inner neighbourhoods on both Saturdays and Sundays from June through to Canadian Thanksgiving in mid-October, when vendors up stalls and shift indoors. (Insider tip: don’t miss Moonshine Doughnuts at Old Strathcona Farmers’ Market – vegan and delicious!)Edmonton is nicknamed Festival City for a reason – you won’t get too far without happening upon a celebration. If a person likes something, Edmonton has a festival for it … from ice to cats! One of the most popular is the Edmonton international fringe theatre festival, held in venues centred in the Old Strathcona neighbourhood. Every year at the end of August, performers from around the world contribute their work. Attendees can see a show at almost any time of the day or night, then hang out in the beer garden, trading critiques on the performances that range from the ridiculous to the sublime.Trendy Whyte Avenue is the backbone of the Old Strathcona neighbourhood. Take time to poke through the shops, restaurants, and bars that line the avenue and surrounding blocks. Don’t miss brunch at Pip, or satisfy your sweet tooth at La Boule or Sugared \u0026amp Spiced. A soft serve ice-cream from Yelo’d is the perfect accompaniment to a sunny day. Venture a bit to the southeast to check out the new Ritchie Market – notably for Transcend Coffee or something stronger from Blind Enthusiasm brewery. Their craft beers pair well with the bites from adjacent Biera.Just like Fringe, Rust Magic is an annual festival that features the work of local and international artists. But Instead of treading the boards, these artists are spray-painting them. Each year since 2016, 15 new murals have been created and bequeathed to the city. Plans are in the works for guided tours of the street art during the festival, and maps are readily available at local businesses for self-guided exploration. Periodically throughout the year, Hoang herself runs Photo Walks featuring Instagrammable Walls of Edmonton, which are a great way to see some city colour and get some superb pics to take home too.Before Alberta developed its oil and gas industry, it was straight-up farming and ranch country. Calling back to the area’s agricultural heritage, high-calibre restaurants are cropping up all over town, with chefs focusing on innovative ways to use locally grown and sourced ingredients. A great way to sample a variety of these restaurants is with a culinary tour from Eat or Alberta Food Tours you can also pedal between nibbles and drinks with Food Bike Tours or the big bikes from Urban Pedal.You won’t go hungry in any area of the city, but a high concentration of foodie favourites are found downtown and in the Ice District. Try the vegan pizzas at Die Pie, Italian to die for at Uccellino, wood-fired creations at Woodwork, or share some plates at Bundok or Baijiu.West of downtown has experienced a hip revival in recent years. In addition to arty new shops, there are tons of places to eat. Start at Wilfred’s in the Brewery District, then swing by the Oliver Exchange Building, full of great places to grab a bite or a drink. Come hungry to enjoy Canadian cuisine at RGE RD on 123rd Street NW. A short walk to the north-east brings you to the fresh and French Café Linnea. If you still have room after that, locals swear by the treats at Duchess Bake Shop and the vegan cookies at Bloom Cookie Co.Before heading off, make sure to toast your time in the city. There are ample opportunities to enjoy a pint or two. To curate the experience, try a brewery tour from Alberta Craft Tours or Urban Pedal. If you are going it on your own, make sure Sea Change, Strathcona Spirits, Town Square, and the newly opened Polar Park are on your list. Make time for an inventive cocktail at the cosy Bar Clementine or chic Partake. For something a little different, try to score tickets on Eventbrite for one of the seasonal Street Car Cask events hosted by the Common.

Following discussions among editors about how we could change the language we use in our coverage of environmental issues, our attention then turned to images. We have been working across the organisation to better understand how we aim to visually communicate the impact the climate emergency is having across the world.Our goal is to provide guidelines for anyone working with images at the . We are also asking the agencies and photographers we work with to provide images that are appropriate to the changing narrative.The concern over how best to depict the climate emergency led us to seek advice from the research organisation Climate Visuals, who have found that “images that define climate change shape the way it is understood and acted upon”.It was important to address our own use of images and understand the processes that lead to image selection for our environmental and weather stories. When given a story, a picture editor or subeditor may have a short time to choose an image from our database, which is why the availability and prominence of climate crisis photography is a key element in the process. It can also be difficult for photographers to capture images that reflect global heating, weather patterns and wildlife extinction, especially when trying to depict what cannot always be seen.We know, from years of experience, that people love polar bears and pandas, so it is easy to see how these appealing creatures have become the emblems for the topics of endangered species and what we previously termed as global warming. Often, when signalling environmental stories to our readers, selecting an image of a polar bear on melting ice has been the obvious – though not necessarily appropriate – choice. These images tell a certain story about the climate crisis but can seem remote and abstract – a problem that is not a human one, nor one that is particularly urgent.So it made sense when we heard that research conducted by the team at Climate Visuals has shown that people respond to human pictures and stories. Images that show emotion and pictures of real situations make the story relevant to the inidual. Rather than choosing, say, an image of a smoke stack pumping out pollution or a forest on fire, such as this: … we should consider showing the direct impact of environmental issues on people’s daily lives as well as trying to indicate the scale of the impact, such as these:In the UK, the weather is a national preoccupation and as such a subject of tradition for British newspapers. People enjoying a sunny holiday weekend, or a fresh fall of snow at home or abroad can deliver some delightful and beautiful images:But as we have reported, the science tells us a much more sinister story of regular heatwaves and unseasonal weather being a defining indicator of the climate crisis. So, although scenes of children playing in fountains and everyone racing to the beach can be uplifting and irresistible, we have to be mindful of the tone of our journalism. This summer, the British media published dramatic headlines issuing climate warnings and covered in detail the negative impact of the crisis, but the images were typically of people taking pleasure in the environment. The contradiction in messaging, between the headlines and imagery, can undermine the effect of the reporting and how we perceive the risks.In June this year we published a picture gallery on the heatwave across Europe. In its original form, this was of a lighter tone, but we felt on reflection this was wrong and disregarded the current context, so we amended the publication to include images that covered a range of human experience of the extraordinary temperatures.The photographer Brook Mitchell made an impactful series about the drought in Australia affecting families in New South Wales, which we published as a photo essay in July. The environmental scenes of the scorched landscape were striking, as were the suffering animals, but the portraits and stories of the people battling the catastrophe really anchored the piece and drove the level of engagement.It is an example of how, as picture editors and photographers, we are having to think again about finding the right focus. Many of the impacts to communities, bioersity, agriculture, water and food supply represent the escalating crisis our planet faces, yet visually they can be far more challenging to depict. We need new imagery for new narratives. This can be challenging in a fast-paced newsroom but it is important to be nuanced and creative with search terms to unearth photography beyond the usual keywords of climate change, heatwave and floods.As our stories make a journey from their initial point of publication through the various networks of social media we also have to be mindful of how the image is connected to the headline. We have to consider that the two must work together to allow the reader to make a broad sense of the article often simply at a glance. Relatable images that are not overly abstract have become a good choice.However, in its simplest form, getting the emotional tone of imagery in line with the issue is critical, rather than the visual overload of society universally having fun in the sun. We hope that if we keep having these conversations, we will be able to have even more of an impact with our climate coverage, and others will follow suit.If you are a journalist, a photographer or work with other news organisations depicting the climate crisis, please contact membershipeditorial@ to join our conversation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6aa18d2a32dce609d4eb036565424fe22b3b0a8f/0_78_4256_2553/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75e821f5ce30ae6fcdc4646cb012cff8","title":"guardian climate pledge 2019 air travel advice","story":" travel editor Andy Pietrasik explains how a flexitarian approach can enable us to enjoy exploring the planet without increasing our carbon footprintWe recently published a guide to Helsinki in which we gave details of how to get there and back without flying. In the comments below the article, a reader wrote: “I think you have to concede that it’s a little disingenuous to pretend that people will be going to Helsinki by train and boat … very few will be willing to allocate six days of the holiday just for the journey. It’s simply not a practical suggestion.”The rise of low-cost flights over the past 20 or so years means we have become so accustomed to flying everywhere for our holidays and short breaks that the idea of taking so long over a journey has become unthinkable. We expect to maximise our time in a location and minimise our time in transit. But maybe that has to change.Another reader put this into context: “In the 70s it was customary to travel around Europe by train (or bus, or hitchhiking). I’ve travelled between Finland and the UK many times by train, and it is quite a pleasant experience.” Travel can have a magical transformation on iniduals and communities. We hope through our pages to encourage people to explore the world, to discover, first-hand, locations they may only have read about in history books or novels to open themselves up to new experiences and tastes to meet people with different ideas and perspectives to try out alternative lifestyles to immerse themselves in beautiful landscapes to have fun. Our writers tap into the joy of new experiences, whether it’s the exhilaration of swimming through a city, as our writer did in Basel, or the thrill of tackling Ireland’s Big Five adventures. And we know that our readers are adventurous and well-travelled because every week we feature their tips from around the world. But we also recognise the need to help tackle the climate emergency by reducing the number of flights we all take. Environment journalist, John Vidal explored the dilemma that “people like me, cursed with loving travel” now face, when he reported on the Swedish concept of “flygskam”, or fly shame. And he referred to people applying the idea of the “flexitarian” diet – where they cut back on their meat consumption dramatically but not completely – to flying.The majority of locations we feature in the ’s weekly travel section do not rely on flying to get there, with most easily accessible by train and public transport. These range from Greek island-hopping odysseys to cycling holidays through Europe and city breaks served by train or ferries.Our Local’s Guide series is one of the most popular and widely read features because each one is written by a local resident in the spirit of showing a visitor around their favourite affordable haunts, rather than the big-ticket attractions. Food and drink is probably the easiest way into another culture, and there can be no better recommendation for somewhere to eat and drink than from someone who lives there. We’ve been tapping in to local people’s tips since Twitter started more than 10 years ago, and have found bloggers all around Europe to compile lists of their favourite cheap places to eat and drink.On our website, we have a long list of guides to alternative cities – Łódź, Genoa and Utrecht, Berne, Burgos and Bristol, for example – rather than perennial hotspots affected by overtourism, such as Barcelona, Amsterdam and Venice.One of the benefits of flying less, of course, is the opportunity it affords to explore the rich and varied landscapes of our own islands. Over the summer, we ran a popular series of stories called car-free coast, in which the writer Phoebe Taplin explored the British seaside on foot and by bus. An avowed public transport enthusiast and non-flyer, Dixe Wills, shared 20 of his favourite campsites accessible by train and bus. And Kevin Rushby set out on a UK expedition to less-visited locations that would have been impossible or prohibitively expensive to get to by car.We still occasionally run stories on long-haul destinations when there is an important initiative or project that benefits the environment or local community, such as the development of community-led tourism startups in Chilean Patagonia following the launch of new national parks in the world’s most ambitious rewilding project.Tourism accounts for one in 10 of the world’s jobs and is vital to some destinations. Kevin Rushby, our principal travel writer, explains: “All around the world, people in disadvantaged communities have been working to set up projects that rely on tourism, and so flying. I’ve met hunters who’ve become wildlife guides, fishermen who are now ing instructors, farmers who get cash for showing visitors their land and life. In Kenya the great migration route has been saved by Maasai herders clubbing their land together as conservancies rather than selling to hoteliers and intensive farming interests. Those conservancies are reliant on overseas visitors who pay to see wildlife.”The Travel website now also features a carbon calculator, and we have written about various carbon offsetting schemes – which allow people to balance out their carbon footprints by investing in clean energy projects such as solar or windfarms. Our travel section is printed and distributed in the UK but our articles online are read by a worldwide audience, so in some instances readers do not need to fly to the places we are writing about.John Vidal’s article about reducing the number of flights we take quotes Kevin Anderson, professor of energy and climate change at the Tyndall centre in Manchester: “I don’t have a no-fly policy, but rather a fly-less one … If we are going to fly, it should be for truly extraordinary and important reasons. Otherwise we shouldn’t go, or we should take a slower form of travel and arrange for a longer visit.”Returning to that article on Helsinki, there’s another Scandinavian lifestyle trend that has emerged as a positive counterbalance to “flygskam”, and that is “tagskryt” (train brag). Another reader of the article captured its spirit perfectly in the comment: “The journey is the holiday. Just think of all the places you see along the way.”Because, of course, we’ve been doing long-distance slow travel since the 1970s, as was pointed out. That was the decade when the Interrail scheme was launched. And, as Wills said when he revisited the Interrail experience this summer after a 30-year gap: “How many of us have cherished memories of zipping inexpensively across Europe – delving into new and thrillingly esoteric cultures, befriending the locals, mangling their language beyond all comprehension, and enjoying all manner of mind-broadening episodes.”That is the spirit of adventure we hope you take away with you after reading the travel section."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/399dfc115cc0d5d9d9d140ac885cc05cfca93401/0_97_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44fcc539d5e386fbff529197dec69b4c","title":"naming and shaming the polluters","story":"Global environment editor Jonathan Watts discusses the ’s investigation into the fossil fuel industry, and the structures that need to change to halt the climate emergency.

Klopp, however, claims it is insulting to dismiss United as a “nobody” while Danny Mills’ combined XI featuring only Liverpool players, the overwhelming odds on his team to win at Old Trafford and the negativity surrounding Solskjær are designed purely to motivate the struggling hosts. “People are trying to create it as a banana skin,” said Klopp, who has not won at Old Trafford as Liverpool manager.“They are trying to make it as we are THE team and they are nobody. I saw the combined lineup and it’s really funny – 11 Liverpool players and no Man United players.“That is the situation everyone creates: that we are so good and they have so many problems, they can not play football anymore and we are flying. All this stuff gets built up in a week when there have been no other games. That is what I mean about building a banana skin. It is like we just have to go there and don’t respect them on the level they deserve. We need to respect them to face the difficulties in the game and it will be there in the right way.”Liverpool’s victory over United at Anfield last season marked the end of José Mourinho’s reign but was also their only win in the last 10 league meetings between the clubs. Klopp admits he would try to turn the insults that Solskjær has faced to his advantage were the roles reversed.When asked to name one United player who would get in a combined team with Liverpool, however, Klopp chose the diplomatic line.“I was always completely happy with my players and I don’t look at other players,” he replied. “If you asked me about Barcelona I will tell you the same. I don’t want to have any Barcelona players in this specific Liverpool team at the moment.I am completely happy with my team. There’s no difference – no Bayern player or Dortmund player, nothing – this is the team and I am completely happy with that.”Klopp, meanwhile, has said it is unacceptable to force City to play twice in under 48 hours over the festive period due to television demands, but had rejected the champions’ claims that December’s schedule hands Liverpool an advantage in the title race. Liverpool have their own issues over Christmas with an 8pm kick-off at Leicester on Boxing Day, days after their return from the Club World Cup in Qatar, but Klopp has only sympathy for the demands placed on Pep Guardiola’s players.“We have a game more in December than City. How can we have an advantage?” he said. “But I am completely on City’s side that these games where they have 46 hours between should not happen. It’s like when we played Sunderland, it’s just not OK. That was in 2016 and three years later we are still speaking about it.The Liverpool defender Joël Matip, meanwhile, has signed a new five-year contract with the club."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/306aee87d0ecb8461a725df7746ac601a9c52393/0_116_2938_1763/master/2938.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ddbf07861fbcdfd3ab2e265d4ecf1e7","title":"everton v west ham premier league live","story":"Bernard and Gylfi Sigurdsson scored as Everton produced a performance of blistering intensity to deservedly beat West Ham and ease the pressure on Marco SilvaThere are seven 3pm fixtures in the Premier League. Tom Bassam has team news from around the country.Gylfi Sigurdsson “It was a fantastic performance. It was one of those games where we had a lot of chances, so you never know when it’s only 1-0, but luckily we managed to hold on to the three points. We had a lot of energy andthere was a real purpose to our game today. We pressed them high we passed the ball really well with good movement.Theo Walcott “The guys were fantastic from start to finish. The international break can be difficult but we worked hard and the team showed how strong we actually are going forward. We don’t want to get ahead of ourselves but we know the quality of the team. The fans were fantastic. There was a sense of urgency in our game today and everyone enjoyed it.” It’s safe to say Marco Silva hasn’t lost the dressing-room. That was a superb performance, with a blistering intensity throughout. There was plenty of quality, too Theo Walcott, Richarlison and Andre Gomes were especially good, while the substitute Gylfi Sigurdsson scored a spectacular late goal to settle the match.Peep peep! Everton jump up to 12th with a rousing, emphatic victory over West Ham.That was a classic Sigurdsson goal. He received a square pass from Richarlison 25 yards from goal and sat Wilshere down by dummying to shoot with his left foot. Then he came back onto his right foot, looked up and swept a beautiful rising drive that flew into the net. It brushed the fingers of Roberto, who was at full stretch, but he was never saving that.The substitute Gylfi Sigurdsson seals victory with a glorious goal!90+1 min There will be four minutes of added time. Pickford makes a smart save from Ajeti, who had been flagged offside. That would have been tight had it gone to VAR.90 min “Even I am currently higher than Man Utd,” sniffs Ian Copestake.89 min Rice abandons his station to surge into the Everton area, but Mina comes across to shepherd the ball through to Pickford. Good defending.89 min “Shouldn’t the referee wait for the ball to go out of play in order to blow the whistle?” says Miltos Kal. “What’s the point of VAR if the referee stops the attack and it can’t be reviewed?”I have no idea any more. There are so many inconsistencies and imperfections.88 min Sigurdsson gets involved straight away, warming Roberto’s right hand from 20 yards.87 min Gylfi Sigurdsson replaces Alex Iwobi, who has had a good game apart from that missed chance a few moments ago. 85 min Everton make a change: Moise Kean on, Theo Walcott off. He’s been outstanding.83 min West Ham are given a corner despite a clear hack by Masuaku on Sidibe. I’m not sure Sidibe touched the ball either. The corner leads to a goalmouth scramble and eventually a brilliant save from Pickford to repel Ogbonna’s deflected close-range shot. There would have been mayhem had that gone in.82 min Everton have been great today a 3-0 scoreline wouldn’t flatter them. 81 min Walcott plays a give-and-go with Iwobi and fizzes a cross to the near post. Diop gets in a tangle and unwittingly rams the ball towards his own goal it flies off the head of Roberto, who had no time to react, and over the bar. 79 min Diop is booked for a foul on Richarlison. I think that Mina goal was disallowed because Andre Gomes blocked Diop, but it looked a very harsh decision. There was no pause for a VAR check, so goodness knows.78 min: Mina has a goal disallowed! It was an empathic header from Bernard’s right-wing corner, but Paul Tierney had blown for a foul. I’m not exactly sure what that was for.77 min: Iwobi misses a glorious chance! That should have been the match for Everton. Sidibe charged down the inside-right channel, waited for Richarlison to drag defenders out of the way and then played a fine pass towards Iwobi in space down the middle. His first touch was immaculate, dragging the ball away from Diop on the run, but he stabbed his shot far close to Roberto.76 min “Is it just me,” says Ian Copestake, “or has this game been going on for hours?”Well you might think that but I couldn’t possibly comment. 74 min West Ham make their final change, and switch to a 4-4-2 formation: Mark Noble is replaced by the young Swiss striker Albian Ajeti.73 min It’s a much tighter game in the second half, though Everton still look the likelier scorers. Andre Gomes plays a delightful pass inside Fredericks for Digne, whose low cross towards Richarlison deflects through to the keeper Roberto.71 min “Good to see a report written partly in Old English,” says Charles Antaki. “The phrase ‘the superb Walcott’ dates back to c. 2007-8 AD but was thought to have fallen into disuse somewhere around 2012. Fondly remembered, if now largely obsolete.”Wait until Jack Wilshere equalises. Then you’ll really see some Chaucer.70 min Declan Rice is booked for a foul on Walcott, who has been the best player on the pitch. On which subject...68 min The Premier League is so tight that a win would lift Everton from 18th to 12th, above Manchster United and only a point behind Spurs.67 min Yarmolenko’s free-kick is comfortably saved by Pickford, moving smartly across his line.64 min: Walcott hits the bar! That was a ferocious strike. Digne’s free-kick from the left was headed out to him, 25 yards from goal, by Ogbonna. He controlled the ball with his chest and then, as it bounced up, lashed a beautiful shot that flashed past the ing Roberto all ends up and rebounded off the underside of the bar.63 min Another West Ham substitution. Jack Wilshere replaces Pablo Fornals, who has had a minor stinker.63 min “West Ham are overrated,” says Clive Smith. “Their displays this season have not been that good. The manager plays one forward home and away. The defence is one of the worst in the league. I have supported this team over seventy years. Nothing changes. As long as they stay in the Premiership that’s ok. They have not won anything for nearly forty years and never will.”I sense a certain apathy towards the 1999 Intertoto Cup. 62 min Roberto makes a comfortable save from Mina’s header.61 min This has been a stirring performance from Everton, who have played with the kind of intensity that the home fans love.59 min Digne whistles a free-kick just wide from a tight angle on the right.56 min West Ham have been slightly better in attack since the break, with Fornals seeing a lot of the ball. He’s done bugger all with it, but it’s the taking part that counts.53 min The superb Walcott wins a corner for Everton. Digne curls it towards the far post, where Mina’s downward header is saved comfortably by Roberto.51 min West Ham’s best chance.

Harry Kane, Toby Alderweireld, Jan Vertonghen and Moussa Sissoko are the players to retain their spots in the starting XI. Dele Alli and Lucas Moura both in from the start.With just over an hour until the afternoon action kicks off, a guide to weekend’s Premier League action:It is back! Football, real sodding football, is actually back. After the joyless rigmarole of the international break we can get back to Premier League business, VAR chat and minor breakdowns over the Match of the Day running order.For Tottenham there can be no more a heartening sight than the Watford team bus coming down the M1. Given the mood around White Hart Lane currently, you could be forgiven for thinking it is Spurs who are rock bottom of the Premier League and already on to their second manager of the season. Instead, a win for Mauricio Pochettino, a few kind results elsewhere and all of a sudden the picture looks a little prettier.One of those results those in North London will be hoping for will be at Chelsea, where Newcastle arrive at Stamford Bridge on the back of a win over Manchester United. That used to mean a lot more but Steve Bruce and his team will have confidence that they are capable of causing their hosts some problems.Away from the marquee fixtures, there is a healthy slate of Premier League action. Leicester host Burnley in a battle of two sides hoping to gatecrash the top four and with markedly different approaches to doing so. Leicester, the aesthetes, are all silky touches and waif-like midfielders and Burnley, a bowling ball of razors dressed in claret. Elsewhere, Graham Potter’s pass-happy Seagulls head to Aston Villa hoping their win over Spurs was more than a flash in the pan Wolves host Southampton with an eye on the top half of the table and mid-table Bournemouth welcome a Norwich side capable of giving anyone a game whilst leaking goals at a prodigious rate.

Whenever she sees a sapling that’s doomed to be mown or trampled, or has appeared in the middle of a vegetable bed, she is there to rehome it. Now, when I see an oak sapling in the wrong spot, I think of her and move it. To love trees is to invest hope in the future. To have faith in times to come is not easy right now, but there is scientific evidence that mass tree planting may be one of the simplest and cheapest ways to reduce our impact on our ecosystem.We will need a lot of trees, however – more than a trillion, and they will have to  the globe. They will not negate climate change on their own, but they will store carbon, help clean the air, filter and slow down rainwater to help prevent flooding and, if a erse bunch is planted, help increase bioersity. A target of a trillion trees needs worldwide backing from every country and every government. It’s easy to feel pessimistic about the likelihood of that.But on 30 November the Woodland Trust is leading the Big Climate Fightback as part of national tree week, where you can either plant a tree or make a donation and it will plant one for you. Research suggests that every tree matters, even if it’s just a few more on grazing land, or on your street. We don’t need to create dense forests, but we do need to start fitting them in everywhere: that means at home, at work and all the bits in between. Does your office block have a car park that could be home to some trees? Is there a local playground begging for some shade? Or is there a strip of grass by the side of a road crying out for a tree?There will be hurdles – you will need permission on land you don’t own – and much concrete to crack, but there’s no time to be lost. Autumn is the best time to plant a tree. It’s a good time for seed-sowing, too. There is an abundance of free seeds scattered below many trees to harvest a few recycled yoghurt pots and compost and you’ve got the beginnings of a nursery.If you’re looking for the perfect tree for your garden, Martin Crawford’s Trees For Gardens, Orchards And Permaculture is the bible for productive nut, fruit and medicinal trees that store carbon and provide something for the larder. If you don’t have space at home, consider supporting charities such as Trees For Cities, which has been improving lives by creating urban forests for more than 20 years. Or get in touch with the Incredible Edible Network and the Orchard Project, both of which are planting fruit trees that will be rewarding communities and the environment for years to come."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc5fac5c3fd02d2e2f82592ae12676d70d6ce0ea/0_213_5017_3010/master/5017.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cde0b4a062c8f4d34a24e1830dbd3846","title":"ray davies kinks brexit mood album arthur","story":"As ‘pop documentary’ Arthur is reissued and turned into a radio drama, the singer explains why it is more relevant than everArthur (Or The Decline And Fall Of The British Empire) is a courageous concept album, about both personal loss and the loss of imperial identity after the second world war. But when it came out in 1969 the record industry did not know what to do with it, despite reviews in the music press saluting a creative masterpiece.This autumn the Kinks’ lyrical story of an ordinary man caught up in a time of great national change has been turned into a BBC Radio 4 show, broadcast next month. For Sir Ray Davies, the band’s revered frontman, the radio revival and a 50-year anniversary re-release of the album this week could not have come at a more fitting moment.“It has found its voice. By sheer coincidence, it resonates more now that it did then,” he told the Observer. The struggles and uncertainty of the postwar era are matched, he believes, by the current search for what it means to be English or British.“Today, I feel we have got a similar atmosphere. To be fairly critical, looking back at the 60s, I think we blew it,” he said.“It was a generation that made great art, but the politics and the country was falling apart.”Davies, 75, describes the album as a “pop documentary” rather than a “pop opera”. Featuring his well-known songs Shangri-la and Victoria, it tells of a working-class family split in two when the father figure, Arthur, decides to move to Australia to make a better life.“I brought in all these characters I knew and used the break-up of family as a metaphor for the break-up of empire,” Davies explained.Back in the 1960s a television version of the musical story got as far as being cast by Granada, with actor Frank Finlay as the lead. “He was a bit older than we’d imagined. Another generation up,” said Davies. “But anyway there was a falling out between the producer and the director and Granada TV. Words were said to the effect of ‘If I don’t get what I want I’m walking.’ And they said, ‘Go ahead.’ ”The playwright Julian Mitchell had written a script, inspired by the life of Davies’s brother-in-law, and Davies wrote 12 accompanying songs.“As an album it is a signpost of where the Kinks were going,” said Davies. “We stopped being a pop band with the album The Kinks Are The Village Green Preservation Society the year before, which was a homage to my spiritual or fantasy world. Then, with Arthur, I turned back to reality. I wanted to write about England, damn it. And so I stood my ground after Village Green failed commercially, if not artistically. I was quite stubborn and I’m still quite stubborn.”The tracks were not all designed for release as singles and some space for longer guitar solos was “negotiated”.“We didn’t really win any battles with the record company. You never do. They say they’ll do something, then they bend your arm and do what they want. So I just thought I would make the record I want to make,” said Davies.The hour-long radio version, together with a longer stage show, has been adapted in collaboration with the playwright and musician Paul Sirett, with whom Davies wrote the show Come Dancing.The cast includes Lee Ross as Arthur, Davies’s real-life brother-in-law, and Rosie Cavaliero as his beloved elder sister, Rose, and there are key songs from the original album, along with other Kinks’ hits Waterloo Sunset and You Really Got Me. It is also likely to come to the stage as a musical in the new year.“It is a play set 50 years ago that is about now,” said Sirett, adding: “Ray is a very important English voice. He can still tell us things we haven’t even spotted about ourselves.”The Davies brothers were born into a large, close-knit family in north London and suffered poverty and bereavement before they achieved fame. Their eldest sister, Rene, a dance hall star, had died suddenly when Ray was 13.“It is a more emotional album for me than Village Green, as it is based on my own family,” said Davies. “Arthur and Rose were a surrogate father and mother to me. Arthur didn’t know the word ‘mentor’ and didn’t know that’s what he was. He was disciplined after his time in the army and it was character-building for me. He thought I was an annoying little bastard but we really missed them. Yet if Arthur had not left for Australia, my brother and I might not have formed the band. He wanted me to get a job and I would have stayed at art school for longer.”The remastered re-release of the original album includes extra tracks that show the genesis of the key musical themes. It also features the solo music that Dave Davies, the band’s lead guitarist, was making at the same time.“I wanted to put out a balanced overview,” said Ray Davies. The brothers notoriously fought throughout the latter part of their careers, but things are on the mend. The inclusion of his brother’s tracks from a solo album that was never released is a sign they are now, as Davies has admitted, if not exactly back together again, then at least “back to our dysfunction”.The Kinks’ musical mood has been called nostalgic, but Davies isn’t keen on the word. He prefers “remembrance” or “melancholy” and also points out his hits All Day and All of the Night and You Really Got Me hardly fit this bill. He does concede though that the sadnesses of his youth “may have had an effect”.“I was traumatised by Rene’s death,” he said. “When I was a kid if you had an issue you kept quiet about it. There was shame. So I didn’t sit down and say I am going to write a melancholy theme. I was sensitive and couldn’t express myself. Then I found music and the outpouring began. I’ll never stop writing because I think of tunes incessantly – it bugs me. They come into my head – literally voices in my head.”When the Kinks toured Australia in 1971, Davies met up again backstage with his brother-in-law Arthur. “He told me he liked my work and that he knew I had written about him,” said Davies. “The overall impression I got was that the trip out to Australia was a success, although Rose didn’t want to go.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc4c514a5764e32a7188e1c78423735b43c91d5d/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d0b712bf483dcf989645a28c016421b","title":"slowthai swg3 glasgow review","story":"At some point during the melee that is this Slowthai gig, a bra lands on the stage. The grinning Northampton rapper drapes it over his head, a pair of flapping D-cups giving him the look of a demented puppy.The song is Ladies, the track off his debut album, Nothing Great About Britain, where Slowthai pays tribute to “the ladies” – not just as makers of babies, but as makers of men. Like any number of rappers on both sides of the Atlantic, Tyron Frampton was raised by strong women in the face of considerable odds, an upbringing he details later on a track called Northampton’s Child. In short: teenage mum, absent dad, dodgy stepfather, a series of council flats, the death of his baby brother… it has all arguably contributed to making Slowthai the breakout British artist of 2019, in cultural significance, if not crude album sales.The bra ears, meanwhile, come accessorised with a John Lydon stare, a bottle of Buckfast, a T-shirt that says “Slowthai” in the form of the Irn-Bru logo, and, later, a bare chest with prison inmate-style tattoos – one of them Nothing Great About Britain. His wide, gappy smile speaks both of an overactive inner child and something darker.Another set of floppy ears roams the stage: Woioii the Crack Rabbit, a mascot with a filthy bunny head and demonic, glowing red eyes. Woioii has his own Instagram and apparently represents Slowthai’s chemically inclined past. Two songs in is Drug Dealer, in which the young Frampton – a stigmatised young male from the “Bush” area of Northampton, where the council estates are hidden behind a screen of trees – answers a teacher’s question about his future plans with a truthful reply. He’ll be a drug dealer when he grows up. (“Sorry mum” is another of his tattoos.)Alongside Slowthai’s DJ, producer and hype man, Kwes Darko, Woioii is there to swirl up a moshpit that doesn’t actually require risotto levels of prodding. A circle pit takes up all the space between the stage and the mixing desk in this sold-out 1,250-capacity venue. The gig was recently upgraded to accommodate demand – in no way was a smaller boîte elsewhere in this warehouse complex going to contain all this consensual aggro. Slowthai’s sonics tend largely towards grime and US hip-hop, but the action has the muscular gaiety of a punk gig. “Run clockwise in a circle until your feet fall off!” he commands at one point, part chaos-bringer, part drill sergeant. He could easily be caricatured as the attack dog of austerity Britain – Nothing Great About Britain uses his hyper-local reference points to make universal arguments about class, race, the withdrawn ladders of social mobility and slippery slopes snaking down – but Slowthai’s gleeful charisma makes his a more complex offering than that.In medieval times, court jesters were licensed to tell truth to power, provided they entertained. Slowthai is fulfilling that brief in 2019. Sometimes he is direct and uncouth (“Elizabeth, you cunt,” he quips, on the title track of his debut album). There are a couple of dud songs in this set, where the energy levels drop and the tunes don’t quite make up for it.Sometimes, however, there is a greater degree of sophistication at play. His ideas can startle. Instead of a backdrop, the Bet Ya a £5er tour (tickets: £5) features a clever trick: lots of mirrors, as you might find in a perv’s boudoir. Not, as Slowthai later jokes, to show off how great the back of him looks, but to hold up a mirror to what is actually great about Britain, its people – or Slowthai fans, at any rate. Even in an age of social media, Slowthai is particularly fan-forward, using Twitter to max out the guest list, inviting an audience member – tonight, make way for Phoebe – on stage to perform the absent guest MC Skepta’s verse on Inglorious.Tonight, the pontificating is kept to a minimum: there are many young pores to open in this sweat bath and belongings to sacrifice to the pit (“You lost your glasses? Get some new ones!” Slowthai suggests). And if the set list mostly revisits songs from his five-month-old album – it feels like it has been around far longer – a couple of tracks point forwards. Slowthai has spoken vaguely of his next steps – an album that you can smell, “growth”, “not a follow-up or a sequel”, but in the meantime, momentum is gathering further afield.Released last month, a new single, Psycho, found Slowthai combining with Florida rapper Denzel Curry in a two-hander that dripped with ferocity. It established that a man known for rapping about Cash in the Attic, being blacklisted by minicab firms and tea and biscuits now has traction Stateside. Curry’s not here tonight, but everyone goes feral for Psycho nonetheless, featuring as it does some of Slowthai’s most impressive wordplay so far: “Flow is hysterical, you sound terribleHigh off the chemicals, turn you vegetable, why are you cynical?You are minuscule, drain you of minerals, nothin’ but residue.”Shorter and less impressive is Heaven Belongs to You, his contribution to the latest album by US outfit Brockhampton, somewhere between a boyband and a hip-hop crew. Significantly, Slowthai recently gave up his slot supporting Liam Gallagher on his forthcoming dates to join Brockhampton’s North American tour, signalling, perhaps, a desire to capitalise on his burgeoning reputation in the US rather than be misunderstood by ageing mods."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd67411371a9a294fd623e369476d85222ea87b5/0_332_5592_3356/master/5592.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98dd06efe01e9af0590fde47a87e7de8","title":"on the frontline as us troops leave northern syria","story":"Martin Chulov, who covers the Middle East for the , has spent the past week on the frontline of north-east Syria.

But this would not get Brexit done. It will, instead, be the start of a long and bitter series of negotiations for our country which could still end in a no deal outcome.”The former prime ministers Tony Blair and Sir John Major have also united to make a short film warning against Brexit and its impact on Northern Ireland to be broadcast at the rally.The pair, who faced each other across the dispatch box between 1994 and 1997 and helped broker the Good Friday agreement, have both been vociferous in their calls to avoid a hard Brexit.Blair said: “The Good Friday agreement was a careful, painstaking construction in which the conflicting aspirations of unionists and nationalists were held in the most delicate balance.“Now either there is a hard border between Northern Ireland and Britain or a hard border between the north and south of Ireland. And it is a shame and an outrage that peace in Northern Ireland is now treated as some disposable inconvenience to be bartered away in exchange for satisfying the obsession of the Brexiteers with wrenching our country out of Europe.”Major, who has made several high-profile interventions against Brexit, said: “There’s a whole generation of people in Northern Ireland who have no memory of what life was like before the Good Friday agreement. No one under the age of 20 would have any memory of the violence and death that once engulfed their neighbourhoods. I hope and pray they never do.”The People’s Vote march will set off from Park Lane at midday and reach Parliament Square at 2pm with a rally lasting 90 minutes for speakers to address the crowds.It was scheduled for 19 October to coincide with the provisions of Labour MP Hilary Benn’s act. The Benn act legislated for Saturday to be the deadline by which a deal needed to be passed or the prime minister must request an extension of article 50 from the EU.The rally may be one of the best attended of the three People’s Vote demonstrations so far, with a record 172 coaches bringing in campaigners from across the country. Previous marches are believed to have attracted between 500,000 and a million people.Pauline Hardman, a food bank volunteer, is travelling to London for the first time from Ushaw Moor in County Durham – a former mining village.She did not vote in the 2016 referendum but said she feared Brexit would damage former coal communities in the north.She said: “People in mining villages like mine are getting more and more worried about the damage Brexit will cause. We can see it’s a million miles from what was promised back in 2016, we know this matters and we want to have our say.“If you read the newspapers, you’d think that everyone in the north-east thinks exactly the same way, that we all want Brexit whatever the cost, but that’s not what I hear when I speak to my neighbours and friends.”Another marcher will be Stephen Goodall, 97, who served in the far east during during the second world war and is travelling to the protest from his home in south Devon.He said: “I’m 97 years old, my knees are knackered from playing rugby, and I’ll be in a wheelchair, but as long as I’m still alive and kicking, I’ll march to defend the democracy I’ve always fought to protect.”The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, will be supporting the event, as well as the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, and the Labour MPs David Lammy, Benn, Jess Phillips and Chi Onwurah.The Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, and her party’s MPs Ed Davey, Layla Moran, Luciana Berger and Sam Gyimah will be attending, as will the former deputy prime minister Michael Heseltine, the leader of the Independent Group for Change, Anna Soubry, the independent MP Antoinette Sandbach, Plaid Cymru’s Liz Saville Roberts, the SNP’s leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford, and the SNP MP Joanna Cherry.The new Brexit deal is essentially the old\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspdeal with a new chapter on the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland and a few key tweaks to the political declaration. Here is a\u0026nbsplink to the full text.The backstop has essentially been replaced by a full stop whereby Northern Ireland remains aligned to the EU from the end of the transition period for at least four years. A change can only happen if it is voted on by the Stormont assembly.Stormont will have a key role in future Brexit arrangements. And if there is cross-community support to remain aligned to the EU rather than the UK the consent will hold for eight years.The arrangements in this deal will automatically kick in for a mandated four years if there is a breakdown in trade talks, so it remains a “backstop” but with a permanent tinge.That four-year period will start at the end of December 2020.Two months before the end of the four-year period, that is October 2024, Stormont will be asked to vote on whether to remain aligned to the EU in ways outlined by this deal or not.Under the deal, the UK and the EU are “underlining their firm commitment to no customs and regulatory checks or controls and related physical infrastructure at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland”.The EU and the UK will aim for a zero-tariff deal with unlimited quotas. The entire UK, including Northern Ireland, will be free to sign trade deals. The line in the political declaration that “the United Kingdom will consider aligning with union rules in relevant areas” in any future trade talks has been ditched.Northern Ireland will remain legally in the UK customs territory but practically in the EU customs unions. There will therefore be no customs checks on the border but tariffs will be payable on certain commercial goods.No customs duties will be payable on “personal property” being transited from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. That protects online shopping and all items bought for personal rather than commercial use.Customs duties will be payable on goods imported from the UK for commercial use unless it can be demonstrated that the goods remain in Northern Ireland or are for personal use, as above.A system of rebates will allow importers to be reimbursed.The commitment to frictionless trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain is restated.EU law on VAT will apply in Northern Ireland.The island of Ireland is considering a single market for electricity so homes in Northern Ireland can get their energy from a supplier in Northern Ireland or the republic. There were fears this could be disrupted by Brexit. Under the Johnson deal, the provisions of union law remain so nothing will change.This guarantees that the UK will remain in line with EU conventions on climate, environment and workers rights in a future trade agreement.The cost of a number of the coaches has been covered by supporters including the TV chef Delia Smith, who is paying for transport from Norwich and Bury St Edmunds. Patrick Stewart is paying for a coach from Huddersfield and the writer and director Armando Iannucci is meeting the cost of coaches from Oxford.The Brexit protest group Led By Donkeys unveiled its latest stunt to coincide with the crunch vote and march.The words “Britain now wants to remain” was ploughed into a field in Wiltshire in 40-metre letters visible from passing aircraft.The group released a video shot from a helicopter, with a voiceover by Lisa Dodd, who voted leave. She said: “I voted leave because of the NHS. I just can’t believe I fell for it. Manipulated wasn’t I, well and truly? I wonder how many more?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1dbb5f126815751176cc12e132556d61a47e7680/0_228_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79227817223d3d37acb0f5ad1f688af1","title":"labours melanie onn declares intention to vote for brexit deal","story":"MP for Grimsby asks colleagues to back plan in an article with Tory Victoria PrentisMelanie Onn has become the latest Labour MP to declare she is prepared to vote for Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal despite intense pressure to oppose it.Onn, who represents the leave-voting seat of Grimsby, has written an article for the  with the Conservative MP Victoria Prentis urging colleagues to “use this unique chance to help us move on and get back to helping our constituents”.They wrote: “The risk of letting this final shot at a deal slip through our fingers is too great. Our collective hope rests on brave Labour MPs, and indeed others, who can see that.”Onn, who comes from a working-class background and grew up in Grimsby, was considered a rising star in the party before she resigned from a frontbench role in March in protest at Labour’s support for a second referendum.The Democratic Unionist party opposes Johnson’s deal and is encouraging Conservative MPs to vote against it, meaning the prime minister is likely to need to win over more Labour MPs than the handful of ardent Brexiters who supported Theresa May’s deal.The Labour leadership have said Johnson’s deal shifts the “level playing field” pledges on workers’ rights and environmental standards from the legally binding withdrawal agreement to the political declaration. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said on Friday he did not expect more than a few Labour MPs to be won over.He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I don’t believe there are Labour MPs out there who will not think through the detail of this deal and then, when they see the impact – particularly on environmental, consumers’ and workers’ rights – will vote for it.”Among the Labour MPs who have said they will vote for the deal are Jim Fitzpatrick, who represents Poplar and Limehouse in London, and Ronnie Campbell, the MP for Blyth Valley in the north-east.Asked about Campbell’s views, McDonnell said: “I’m going to have a chat with Ronnie because he is a good socialist and all his life he has fought alongside me to protect trade union rights and develop trade union rights.“On this one I’m going to have a chat with him and point out to him: please do not give this power to Boris Johnson, because you know what he’ll do. He’ll undermine trade union rights. Boris Johnson and those Tory MPs that populate the cabinet, these are the extreme right who have attacked trade unions throughout their political careers.”He added: “No MP, as far as I’m concerned, who has the true interest of their constituents at heart can allow that to happen.”Several more Labour MPs who in the past have expressed their preference for a Brexit deal over a second referendum will continue considering their decision overnight.One said colleagues were finding the decision very difficult, with more than one in tears at a recent meeting. They suggested trades unions were ringing round MPs saying they would not receive financial support in future if they voted with the government.Many of the “MPs for a deal” group, which includes Onn and Prentis, are likely to support the Letwin amendment, which effectively delays the final decision. They would then hope to amend the withdrawal agreement, potentially to allow more reassurances on workers’ rights and other issues.Jon Lansman, the chair of pro-Jeremy Corbyn campaign group Momentum, suggested the party’s ruling national executive committee could replace Labour MPs who defied the whip.Corbyn himself has hinted he is minded to take a gentler approach, saying: “I believe in the power of persuasion rather than the power of threat.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9583d90dadff1914f568a2214ab75bdde8bc2d3/42_0_2368_1421/master/2368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4718d05b21c819bc9fb12af251a8938a","title":"brexit amendments mps are voting on","story":"What are the Letwin and Kyle amendments to the PM’s deal being put before the Commons?MPs have a packed timetable for “super Saturday” – the first time the Commons has met on a Saturday since 1982.The Speaker, John Bercow, has selected two amendments from MPs trying to change, shape and amend Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal, which is being presented as a motion for approval.The rebel MP Sir Oliver Letwin, who lost the Conservative whip and now sits as an independent after blocking a no-deal Brexit, has consistently tried to use parliamentary procedure to shape how the UK leaves the EU.His latest amendment would withhold approval of the prime minister’s deal until the legislation to enact it – the EU withdrawal bill – is passed. This might happen next week. Passing the Letwin amendment would trigger the Benn act, which compels Johnson to request an extension to article 50 if a deal cannot be agreed.Letwin said he supported Johnson’s deal and it was “sensible”, but that he wanted to make sure there is an “insurance policy” that if the Brexit deal is approved but something goes wrong at a later stage the government has an extension already in place so there is no possible way the country can crash out without a deal. The deadline in the Benn act is 11pm on Saturday, so this is an attempt to close down a potential loophole.Sir Oliver Letwin was born in London in 1956. He studied at\u0026nbspEton and then Trinity College, Cambridge, and first became a Conservative MP in 1997.However, his political career had started long before then, as he had served in Margaret Thatcher\u0027s policy unit from 1983 to 1986. The poll tax was an idea Letwin almost single-handedly kept alive in the mid-1980s. In a 1985 memo, he suggested it could be introduced in Scotland first as “a trailblazer for the real thing”.In 2016 Letwin was forced to apologise after it emerged he had co-written a paper telling Thatcher that providing financial assistance for black unemployed youth after the 1985 riots would only end up in the “disco and drug trade”. The memo, Letwin admitted, was “badly worded and wrong”.Letwin was forced into hiding in 2001 by a desperate Conservative party, after being outed as the minister who had\u0026nbsppromised £20bn of tax and spending cuts\u0026nbspin an anonymous interview with the Financial Times, far beyond the party’s manifesto at the time.In many respects, the best periods of Letwin’s career were in the policy engine room, not least when he acted as David Cameron’s fixer, when he was a cabinet office minister in the coalition government. His influence went far beyond the ministerial title.Then he wrestled with issues such as the future of press regulation in the aftermath of the Leveson inquiry. Letwin’s\u0026nbspbig idea, to deal with the fact that newspapers refused to accept statutory regulation, was to create an independent regulator backed by royal charter. It was neat, but the mainstream press refused to accept it.Letwin has emerged as an unlikely Brexit rebel, going from being the ultimate loyalist to serial rebel, beginning in January 2019 when he voted with Labour to give Theresa May a two-week deadline to debate Brexit next steps if her deal was voted down.“My right honourable friend\u0026nbspSir Nicholas Soames, who is sitting next to me, and I have calculated that we have been in the house, collectively, for 56 years, and we have only ever, either of us, voted once against the Conservative whip,” Letwin said.A month later his concerns had hardened, as demonstrated in a Commons speech in which he worried that “when the chips are down” the government “would prefer to do what some of my esteemed colleagues would prefer to do: head for the exit door without a deal”. It was, he added, “a terrifying fact” – and one he resolved to prevent.Ultimately it was to cost him his place in the Conservative party, as Prime Minister Boris Johnson removed the whip from 21 Tory rebels including Letwin, as his Brexit plans were thwarted yet again.\u0026nbspThe amendment has the backing of Labour and has a good chance of passing: however, it has been heavily criticised for denying Johnson a conclusive vote on his deal.Other people to put their name to the amendment were Labour’s Hilary Benn, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, Jo Swinson, and the former Tory chancellor Philip Hammond.If the government loses on the Letwin amendment, it is expected to boycott the rest of the day’s proceedings, and press ahead with tabling the withdrawal agreement bill – the legislation needed to enact Brexit.There could then be a vote on the second reading of the bill on Tuesday – which government sources suggested could effectively become the “meaningful vote” denied to Johnson on Saturday.If the Letwin amendment has not passed, MPs will then move on to vote for or against the prime minister’s Brexit deal. On the order paper, the government has stated: “That, in light of the new deal agreed with the European Union, which enables the United Kingdom to respect the result of the referendum on its membership of the European Union and to leave the European Union on 31 October with a deal.”But if the Letwin amendment has already been accepted, the motion would not signal approval – but would say the Commons “withholds approval unless and until implementing legislation is passed”. Downing Street says that would make it a meaningless vote.This is attached to a second motion put down by the government on Saturday, which asks MPs to vote for a no-deal Brexit. The Labour MP Peter Kyle has tabled an amendment that calls for a second referendum.He tweeted: “It’s our hope that this will give greater focus and clarity to the debate and lessen the anxiety for colleagues grappling with the very real challenges … by separating them out.”The text of his amendment says any final decision on the future relationship between the UK and EU “should be subject to a confirmatory referendum before exit day”.However, the government is not expected to move the no-deal motion – because Johnson wants to leave the EU with a deal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/502110e277c415b894fbeeaa1d160e705f45f62e/0_3010_4912_2946/master/4912.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=009b7c7fa32045bd45e6f5499df1ae03","title":"led by donkeys interview there is as political power in laughing","story":"On billboards, beaches, buildings, and Twitter, four activist friends have wittily exposed the hypocrisies of Brexit politics. As they publish a book about their campaign, they reflect on their rollercoaster year• Read an extract from Led By Donkeys’ book here“It was like, ‘Hang on a second: that should be the iceberg to the government’s no-deal Titanic,’” exclaims 45-year-old Ben Stewart, one of the four founders of Led By Donkeys. “The leader of the campaign, the person charged with no-deal planning has said there is no mandate for this. And now they are claiming a mandate for it. So I felt and we all felt: we need to make that quote famous.”Its work has been, to some camps, the Remain campaign that never was: impassioned, humorous, compelling. Through more than 50 poster designs, photographs of which have had more than 200m views on social media, Led By Donkeys has taken the fight to the flip-flopping Brexiters. They have also taken potshots at Donald Trump and what they consider the dangers of post-truth politics. When the US president visited the UK in June, they projected his approval ratings (and those of Barack Obama) on to the Tower of London, and a video in which Boris Johnson called Trump out for “quite stupefying ignorance” was superimposed on to Big Ben. In the US, these stunts were picked up by Stephen Colbert on The Late Show and Rachel Maddow on MSNBC. Just last week, Led By Donkeys launched posters satirising the government’s Get Ready for Brexit campaign, designed by members of the public, and, as this article went to press, were finalising plans for Saturday’s People’s Vote march.Back in the summer, as Boris Johnson pushed more insistently for a no-deal Brexit, Led By Donkeys decided its Michael Gove quote needed a special treatment, eventually settling on a sand sculpture of his words for Redcar beach in Teeside. Redcar was chosen because, for one thing, it has a massive beach, but also because analysis suggests that the north-east will be profoundly affected by leaving the EU without a deal, especially up the coast in Sunderland, home of Nissan, the UK’s biggest car plant. On 1 September, Gove’s face and his comment (“We didn’t vote to leave without a deal”) were carved into the sand in ginormous letters, covering around 7,500 square metres of the beach.Stewart smiles. “So it’s like: ‘Oh well, if Michael Gove thinks he can take us out without a deal he needs to own what he said on a sand sculpture visible from space.’ And he saw it, because Sarah Vine, his wife, replied to our tweet saying: ‘Wow, that’s really impressive!’ So that fucker saw it over the breakfast table and maybe he’ll think twice before repeating that bullshit.”These criticisms, for the most part, miss the target, the Led By Donkeys founders think. They don’t believe they can single-handedly bring down the government in fact, they started the project for “catharsis”: they could either laugh or cry – and they would rather laugh. And that’s still true today.“You just have to laugh with this massive shitshow going on,” says Stewart. “We have this unifying thing where we do laugh at Gove and Cummings and Fox and Johnson and I hope that comes out through the project. And there is a political power in laughing at these people.”That’s not to say, though, that there isn’t serious intent behind the project. “At the moment, we’re thinking, ‘Can we stop Brexit happening on 31 October?’” says Stewart. “Look, we alone are not going to do it, but what is our tiny, tiny role in that effort?”Blue or red, Leave or Remain, the rise of Led By Donkeys is an entertaining caper that often slides into farce, and it’s told with vim in a new book by the founders, Led By Donkeys: How Four Friends With a Ladder Took on Brexit. The broad aims of the project were conceived in a pub, the Birdcage in Stoke Newington, north London, last December. Much has been made of the founders’ connection to Greenpeace, but the make-up of the group was as random as nights out often are. “It just happened to be us four in the pub that night. It could have been five of us, or us two with two others,” says Stewart.The camaraderie between the four is clear when we meet this month at a cafe in north London. Stewart, Greenpeace’s deputy programme director, speaks the most, and the most bluntly, while Knowles comes across as clear and concise, a moral anchor for the group. Sadri, whose background is in human rights and the Middle East, cuts through any pomposity that might creep in and runs the digital side of the operation, while Rose – who today has just arrived, on next to no sleep, from Sweden, where he lives – is a photographer and often designs the Led By Donkeys posters.No one remembers who first thought of doing quotes on billboards, but there was unanimous agreement that the initial target should be David Cameron and his evergreen 2015 line: “Britain faces a simple and inescapable choice – stability and strong government with me, or chaos with Ed Miliband.” They ordered the posters and Sadri came up with a name for the group, a riff on “lions led by the donkeys”, the phrase used in the first world war to describe the tragedy of the British footsoldiers led to slaughter by incompetent or stupid generals. When it came to putting up the first billboard in January, by the A10 in Stamford Hill, close to the Birdcage, the job fell to Knowles and Stewart, who both live in the area.The team didn’t have the money to pay for the billboard, so they decided to requisition one. This, of course, is illegal: criminal damage at the very least. All four men had, in their activist pasts, had skirmishes with police, specifically campaigning on the climate crisis and against the Iraq war, and they knew their actions could result in them being arrested. As Stewart explains: “We come from a political culture that is comfortable with civil disobedience and thinks that civil disobedience has got us a lot of the freedoms we’ve got, and, speaking personally, isn’t that bothered by getting a conviction.”“It felt important to do something that was more than just writing a letter of concern or protest,” adds Sadri. “It feels like this is such a momentous political moment that there should be more people out there prepared to do a little bit more to stop this calamitous thing from happening. So this was a very modest and small way of personally doing something.”Putting up a billboard poster, it turns out, is a skilled task. “It very nearly didn’t continue as a project,” says Knowles, the man up the £90 B\u0026ampQ ladder that night. “We were covered in paste, couldn’t get the poster up and people were stopping in their cars and looking at us and laughing. So for a moment, it didn’t feel like it was going anywhere.”Stewart bristles a little. “I would describe it as guerrilla-style,” he smiles, then relents. “No, it was amateurish. Sheet one of poster one was nearly the sum total of this project. But we got that fucker up! And it just developed from there.”The plan was always to combine the analogue – billboards – with the digital: taking photographs and videos of people interacting with the work and posting them on their social media channels. So after the Cameron poster went up, Stewart contacted the  columnist Marina Hyde through Twitter. She retweeted the image, and within minutes Led By Donkeys had hundreds of followers and interview requests had begun to come in there was a special frisson among the four when Gary Kemp from Spandau Ballet started following them.“I didn’t know anything about it at all,” remembers Hyde, “but as soon as I saw their first billboard I thought it was so striking and funny. It’s so rare to see a sense of pisstake in any political campaigning. I just thought it was a great, simple, modern idea – one of the few things on what I suppose you’d call the Remain side to try and elicit an emotional response. It definitely shits on another ‘letter to the Times from 100 businessmen’.”Led By Donkeys describes what it does as “political theatre” and it’s most effective when, whether it’s a physical billboard or the Angel of the North, you can’t just thumb past it on your smartphone. “People talk about how the problems in today’s world are because we live in these little echo chambers, all talking to ourselves, and Twitter is one of the worst culprits of that culture,” says Sadri. “So there’s something about taking a politician’s tweet – something that flies past you at a million miles per hour – and slapping it on this massive, wooden, 100-year-old structure in the middle of somebody’s neighbourhood that breaks that, and says: ‘We have to look at that if it’s a sunny day, if it’s pissing with rain.’ And it gives you time to digest it if you’re sitting at a bus stop or talking to your neighbours.”Going straight hasn’t always been easy for Led By Donkeys: there was clearly a thrill to dodging police and furious Leavers, which was heightened by being anonymous and sometimes overhearing friends or colleagues talking about their latest stunt, without having a clue that they were involved.“I did a lot of activism when I was younger and then I settled down, mortgage, kids,” says Stewart. “So suddenly finding myself with Olly out on a ladder, doing something that was actually illegal but you really believed in it, was something I hadn’t done for eight or nine years. And there was something beautiful for us about doing it with friends, not doing it as part of a big group or organisation.”Still, even if they are “mired in Excel spreadsheets” now, there are clear upsides. From the beginning, Led By Donkeys had been conscious it could be accused of only existing in a bubble, but now it has the resources to reach a much wider audience. There is satisfaction in getting 10,000 retweets from a post, but these days the founders insist they are more excited when their work is picked up by regional papers, sparking local debate. They also want their message to be heard beyond British borders: to that end, they have bought billboard space in Brussels and beamed “SOS” on an EU flag in a 75x50m projection on the Dover cliffs. “Quite something to see the white cliffs of Dover turn blue,” noted Guy Verhofstadt, the former Belgian prime minister and now the EU parliament’s representative in the Brexit negotiations.“We have a project that definitely reaches Remainers, but what we’re increasingly passionate about is finding people outside that camp,” says Knowles. “And our premise is that there’s a lot of people who have changed their mind who aren’t being heard at the moment. Can we find a way to talk to them and bring them into the discussion?”The concepts can also become more outsized. “Being in Redcar,” says Rose, “watching them draw it out on the sand and then seeing the drone go up and looking at the screen and seeing the message revealed – that was a different level of excitement.”Alastair Campbell suggested that, if Brexit were to be averted, Led By Donkeys would deserve a special award as “secret heroes” of the campaign. But it’s hard to tell what impact, if any, they have had on the political discourse. “I have absolutely no idea!” says Hyde. “I mean it all gets worse, doesn’t it… We know politicians lie or make promises they can’t keep, but that perception seems to have achieved full spectrum dominance on all sides of our political ides. I think the implications of that are still playing out and will do for a long time, but are generally very bad.”Posting the politicians’ quotes without any additional comment or analysis of their own (the idea is to get people talking) has not always worked seamlessly for Led By Donkeys. After putting a pronouncement from Anne Widdecombe – “Homosexual acts are wrongful” – on a billboard in Christchurch, Dorset, they had to apologise and quickly backtrack, noting that some might take her words at “face value”. But mostly the group has shown a sophisticated and intuitive understanding of conveying a political message in 2019. You can’t rely on people seeing a billboard or reading an article in the local paper or not scrolling past a tweet – but if you hit all of those spots then you increase the chance of them seeing one of them.It’s a radical, even pioneering, mashing of old and new media – albeit one that sometimes spirals in ways the four never remotely considered when they started out. “We’ve taken a quote, turned it into a tweet, put it on a billboard, tweeted a photo of that billboard, the tweet’s gone viral, the local newspaper’s written about the viral tweet of a billboard of a tweet, that article itself has gone viral, then our tweet about the article has exploded,” they write in their book. “It’s a kind of meta-virality that we struggle to get our heads round.”For their part, the Led By Donkeys founders will keep hoping, angling for a second referendum. If it does happen, they’re clear that the Remain campaign has to learn lessons from 2016. It shouldn’t base itself in central London, for a start. It has to concentrate on issues that people really care about and “not let Dominic Cummings and that crew spread bullshit about the NHS”. But mainly it has to show an energy and vigour it didn’t have last time. Knowles says: “People have told me, ‘I didn’t feel the Remain campaign offered anything positive. And there was passion and emotion behind the Leave campaign.’ Any new campaign has got to get to the things people love and that’s the NHS, values, education and much more positively framed.”If it comes down to passion – well, here, Led By Donkeys think they will be in their element. And even though they are doing things legally these days, the subversive spirit remains. “We are always on the look out for something that would take us back out there,” says Sadri mischievously. “We were slightly disappointed when the government decided to put its ‘Get Ready for Brexit’ posters on digital screens and not on actual physical billboards, because we’d been honing our ‘cut-out giant letters and re-word giant billboards’ technique.”“The ladder is safely stored,” says Knowles, “and is ready to come out again.”• Led By Donkeys: How Four Friends With a Ladder Took on Brexit is published by Atlantic (£10).

I worry that they’ll take the working-class vote – that massive turnout in areas where people never voted before – for granted. If the next campaign is geared towards the professional middle classes, what is there to motivate the rest?”Devine suggests there should be some focus on what would happen after a vote in favour of independence. The maintenance of a social union with England, as well as what form of trade barrier would exist with Scotland’s biggest market, would depend of the goodwill of the governing party in London at the time.Furthermore, there would be a pressing need for reconciliation: “The governing party in Scotland has a moral as well as political duty to assuage the doubts of those who will still vote against independence in the next referendum. This is a small country and currently split 5050. It’s difficult to see with such a profound change how those wounds can be healed in the short-term.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1819aa26587e5206327aced943cdb6fec60bea95/0_0_3500_2128/master/3500.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41b1fbbd08934c0f4c1a42bd26e161ea","title":"nasa all female spacewalk christina koch jessica meir","story":"Christina Koch and Jessica Meir, tasked with replacing faulty device at International Space Station, embarked on ‘historic’ effortTwo Nasa astronauts have embarked on the first all-female space walk in a historic first.Christina Koch and Jessica Meir floated feet-first out of the International Space Station’s (ISS) Quest airlock on Friday lunchtime UK time, tasked with replacing a failed power control unit.The spacewalk, known as an extra-vehicular activity (EVA) in astronaut jargon, took place seven months after the original planned date for an all-female outing, which had to be scrapped because the ISS had only one medium-sized spacesuit on board. The agency sent up a second medium spacesuit in October.“I think it’s important because of the historical nature of what we’re doing,” Koch said ahead of the spacewalk. “In the past, women haven’t always been at the table. It’s wonderful to be contributing to the space program at a time when all contributions are being accepted, when everyone has a role. That can lead in turn to increased chance for success.”Koch, who has been on the ISS since March, was first out the hatch, followed by Meir, carrying a tool bag. During the five-and-a-half-hour spacewalk, the astronauts remained attached to handrails on the exterior of the ISS using harnesses and pairs of metal carabiners. These are sequentially clipped and unclipped to ensure that the astronauts cannot float off into space.Video footage from the astronauts’ helmet cameras, as they dangled 260 miles above Earth, provided a live stream of the painstaking operation to carry the new hardware, install it and then return the faulty battery to the airlock for a postmortem back on Earth into why it failed.Tracy Caldwell Dyson, a Nasa astronaut who completed three spacewalks as part of the Expedition 24 crew on the ISS in 2010, said: “This is significant … As much as it’s worth celebrating, many of us are looking forward to it just being normal.”During the spacewalk, the coordinator on the ground was Stephanie Wilson, also an astronaut.Koch, 40, is due to remain on the ISS until February, bringing her total time in space to 328 days, the longest single spaceflight by a woman and just short of Scott Kelly’s 340-day record. Researchers are collecting extensive biomedical data on the impact of spaceflight on Koch’s body.The majority of data available is on male astronauts, but there is some evidence that there are sex differences in responses to a space environment. One study found that women are more likely than men to experience faintness as a result of “orthostatic hypotension”, a cardiovascular issue. Men appear more prone to vision changes caused by spaceflight associated neuro-ocular syndrome (Sans).Previously, 14 women and 213 men have carried out spacewalks. The first woman was the Russian cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, who went outside the USSR’s Salyut 7 space station in 1984.On Tuesday, Nasa unveiled the prototype for a new spacesuit that could be worn by the next crew, expected to include a woman, to land on the moon. The suit is designed to give a customised fit to the inidual astronaut, whatever their shape or size."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67e9b6046203170031bcf080771d25425efdf72b/0_99_4016_2411/master/4016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed943919bca95c7fcd624f976bcb09ce","title":"england australia rugby world cup match report","story":"No typhoons this week, just a gathering English storm. Whether it will be enough to propel Eddie Jones’s side all the way to World Cup glory remains to be seen but Australia could not withstand their second-half surge in this eventful quarter-final. For the first time since 2007 England are into the last four and Saturday’s smackdown with New Zealand will be some collision.If the final margin was slightly harsh on a spirited Wallaby side it was hard-earned reward for England’s well-organised defence and the last-quarter power lurking on their bench. It took until the final quarter to establish clear forward control but a rampaging 46th-minute score by tight-head Kyle Sinckler had already pushed Michael Cheika’s team towards Australia’s earliest World Cup exit for a dozen years.If you had offered Eddie Jones a 24-point margin of victory against his homeland prior to the start he would have snatched your arm off above the elbow. The fact it was achieved with only 36 per cent of the ball and similar territory stats underlines the reality of modern-day rugby: possession is all very well but taking your chances when they arise is what really counts.In that regard Australia’s 18 turnovers were a costly case of self-harm. So, too, were the two interception tries that ultimately wrecked any chance of Cheika’s side ending their recent grim sequence against the Poms. This was Jones’s seventh successive win over his old Randwick teammate and, with the Cheika era drawing to a close, there can be no disputing the runaway winner of their personal duel.It was certainly a painful way for two great Wallaby servants, David Pocock and Will Genia, to go out. They can still bask in Australia’s 33-13 victory over their old rivals at the 2015 World Cup but that golden glow is now a fading memory. Only one of these two teams currently appears to be on an upward curve.Jones could still do with Jonny May, the scorer of the first two of England’s four tries, recovering swiftly from an apparent hamstring tweak but in Sinckler and his young flankers, Tom Curry and Sam Underhill, the coach has some steadily improving iniduals. Anthony Watson’s late interception and Owen Farrell’s 100 per cent kicking contribution also helped scupper the Wallabies, despite the promise of their exciting new centre Jordan Petaia and the roadrunner pace of winger Marika Koroibete.A one-sided outcome, however, did not always look an inevitability. Australia had looked the brighter side initially, probing for gaps in England’s defensive spacing and taking an early lead via Christian Lealiifano’s first successful penalty. Their opponents took a while to make any kind of consistent front-foot impression before May’s double whammy inside four minutes banished their jangling nerves.The first was the product of a destructive hard line down the middle by Manu Tuilagi, which sucked in the Australian defence and stretched the cover further out, allowing Farrell and Curry to put May over in the left corner. The Wallabies needed to strike back immediately but, instead, Pocock’s attempted pass to Lealiifano was intercepted by Henry Slade whose chip ahead with his supposedly weaker right foot gave May another chance to show his searing pace.Farrell’s second touchline conversion deepened the pain and left Australia to play catch-up rugby, precisely the scenario they had been anxious to avoid. To their credit Cheika’s side did not panic, attacking with verve and using purposeful pick-and-go tactics to try and fluster England. In terms of the scoreboard it yielded only a couple more penalties for Lealiifano to one from Farrell but at no stage could England entirely relax.Barely two minutes after the interval the margin was reduced to just a single point after Elliot Daly, under a bit of pressure, knocked on 40 metres from his own line and gave the Wallabies a broken field to play with. Slick use of the resulting turnover ball gave Koroibete the space to burn off Daly, only the third try England have so far conceded in this tournament.Australia’s second-half record against England, however, has been dreadful lately and the same achilles heel duly presented itself. The Wallaby defence was too easily spilt by Farrell’s snappy midfield miss-pass, allowing a beaming Sinckler to storm untouched through the unguarded heart of the defence. The Harlequins front-rower used to be a fly-half in his youth but this was the stuff of any prop forward’s dreams.Sinckler was also responsible for a crucial defensive rip as Australia pressed for another score before Watson’s final intervention and Farrell’s fourth conversion took England into 40-point territory. There have been more conveniently situated stadiums in World Cup history – exactly how and why two of rugby’s showpiece games ended up in this relatively obscure Japanese city remains a good question – but England will forever remember their visit to this striking dome.Jones, his selection reshuffle fully vindicated, also reckons Japan’s illustrious old Samurai warriors would approve of how his team are playing. “The best Samurais were always the guys who had a plan they could adapt. They had calm heads but were full of aggression. I thought we were like that today but there’s always a better Samurai around the corner.”Dressed all in black, in this case, and capable of asking more serious questions than England ultimately had to face here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5cab4e26e094e5a3d5823470803fa522664ac16/26_99_3419_2053/master/3419.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=902d308430026a1a1e83a917bfbcb7f5","title":"japan test mind muscle south africa rugby world cup quarter final","story":"World Cup has elevated the hosts but they are highly programmed and have struggled when tactics changeJapan have made this World Cup with their effervescence, verve and slickness, but to beat South Africa for the second successive tournament they will need to show a capacity to react to something they have not planned for.The Springboks feel like a customer at a bar who cannot get served. The focus has been on the hosts since their stunning victory over Scotland, a match that went ahead only after volunteers, some of whom had lost their houses when Typhoon Hagibis hit Japan’s capital last Saturday, worked selflessly from the early morning at the stadium in Yokohama. Little attention has been paid to the remarkable turnaround since Rassie Erasmus took charge of South Africa last year.It was difficult to think of them as World Cup contenders in December 2017 when they faced a weakened Wales in Cardiff and were 21-3 down at one point in the first half, conceding two tries when not even a rudimentary grasp of defending was shown. An abiding image was of Eben Etzebeth, then captain and one of the world’s top second-rows, leading a forlorn charge from his own line and then limping off. Would he, you wondered, ever wear the green jersey again?However, Erasmus, in a short time, has South Africa playing like the Springboks again: hard, abrasive, uncompromising, well-conditioned but also spiced with some devilry. Primed by the scrum-half, Faf de Klerk, they can wing it with Cheslin Kolbe and Makazole Mapimpi, two of the most potent finishers here.The way they started their final pool match against Canada, running from everywhere when their opponents were prepared for a forward onslaught, showed they pack the element of surprise, serious contenders who have earned the renewed respect of the All Blacks.They will test Japan in a way Ireland and Scotland could not because their game, while having a fixed point, is multifaceted. By having six forwards on the bench, including a complete tight five, Erasmus is pointing the hosts to an attritional approach from the first minute to the last, sustained by fresh legs, but is it a trap?The concern over Japan is that they are a highly programmed side. From the opening week, as they prepared to face Russia, a parade of players has said the same thing: we trust our leaders and follow their gameplan. Generals and soldiers, but what happens, in the heat of battle, when commands cannot be heard and initiative needs to be taken?Japan have looked their least effective against the teams they were expected to beat, Russia and Samoa, emerging with a try bonus point but only late on.Once Michael Leitch came on after 30 minutes, they were so impressive against Ireland when they were underdogs that they spooked one of the most structured teams around into, if not panic, a radical departure, by offloading and running from deep. The team that led the world rankings at the start of the tournament were unable to control the pace of the game, their fabric unravelling to the point where their staples of scrum, lineout and maul offered no comfort.Scotland were similarly bewitched by Japan’s ability to release the ball dextrously at the point of contact, but when they rallied in the second half, scoring two tries to reduce the gap to seven points and disarming their opponents through vigorous counter-rucking, the hosts struggled to adapt. It is an inherent weakness of a side whose exposure, while greater in the past six years than that of any other tier-two nation here, is sporadic.Japan have reached the quarter-finals for the first time largely because of the brilliance of the strategies devised by their coaches, led by three New Zealanders, Jamie Joseph, Tony Brown, and Scott Hansen, together with the attention to detail, the skill of the players and an outstanding back row. But in South Africa they are up against opponents who play New Zealand twice a year and are equipped to deal with devious attacking ploys and high-octane rugby.Erasmus opted to build his side up when other coaches, given the frenzy generated by Japan, may have looked for a fence to sit on. “We prepare to win and play to our strength, which is physical rugby.”Was it five weeks ago that the World Cup had barely generated a ripple in the capital? The Japan News on Friday interviewed a customer at the tournament’s megastore. He had come looking, in vain, for a Brave Blossoms jersey, more than 200,000 sold and counting. “I really did not know about the game of rugby, but it has become a sport that has ignited the whole nation,” he said.A South Africa victory would dampen the fire, not extinguish it. The spirit of 2015 is being invoked but it was the Springboks who played most of the rugby in Brighton that day. This is a different team, meaner and focused, geared to go all the way. Japan are also better equipped and have a nation and the neutrals behind them, winning hearts as well as matches, but every dream has a wake-up moment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db67f31853de6b73c3e784d50361d082cbe667dc/0_66_2955_1773/master/2955.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a00ac2c5b0c6a2efcd6dc27ba9df39b","title":"new zealand ireland rugby world cup match report","story":"The forecast rain did not turn up but a big black cloud did. New Zealand are never more menacing than when they are portrayed as vulnerable, which they were in the buildup to this quarter-final, but they left Ireland scattered all over the turf to set up a semi-final with England.Attention was focused on the lack of international experience between scrum-half and full-back but the history of the All Blacks contains several examples of getting an opponent to look one way when the danger is coming from another direction. Ireland prepared for a battle out wide, but the ball only went there after New Zealand had driven hard time and again through the belly of the Ireland pack. It was a victory based on forward supremacy.It was brutally simple, intelligent and skilful rugby, the ability to absorb contact, hold on to the ball, make gradual metres and then move it quickly when gaps appeared. The two wings, Sevu Reece and George Bridge, had a licence to roam and Ireland reached points where, manfully though they defended, they ran out of numbers.New Zealand’s first try, after 13 minutes, summed up the opening, Joe Moody, Kieran Read and Sam Cane driving hard and low into tackles. The ball was delivered cleanly giving Ireland no chance to slow it down and when Aaron Smith, close to the line, saw that no guard was posted at the ruck ed for the line.Smith scored his side’s second from a scrum move with Reece appearing in midfield to throw out a long pass to Bridge whose opposite number, Keith Earls, was sucked infield. Bridge went past Jacob Stockdale and Robbie Henshaw, who had earlier suffered a clash of heads with his midfield partner, Garry Ringrose, as they tackled Ardie Savea, only to be hauled down by Earls.New Zealand’s 12, 13 and 14 were first to the breakdown and when Stockdale moved too early Smith had an open invitation to score.New Zealand were playing with such pace and precision that Ireland did well not to collapse. They had few opportunities, not helped when Jonathan Sexton’s kick to touch after a penalty did not make it, one of three from the men in green, but they were under such constant pressure in defence and attack that they struggled for oxygen.They were on the attack when New Zealand scored their third try. Sexton’s pass to Rob Kearney went to ground, Anton Lienert-Brown hacked on and Beauden Barrett kicked it towards the line and picked up to make it 22-0 and leave Ireland needing a comeback to rival France’s against the All Blacks in the 1999 semi-final.Ireland’s supporters, here in their thousands, had made this corner of Tokyo Dublin’s twin, drowning out the haka, but New Zealand dominated after taking the kick-off, Richie Mo’unga’s early penalty after Stockdale’s deliberate knock-on offering little sign of what was to come.The All Blacks did not let up after the break when Scott Barrett replaced the back-rower Sam Cane, presumably to fortify the lineout, their only area of weakness, Read’s pass as he hit the ground set up Codie Taylor before the replacement Matt Todd made it 34-0 after Reece had collected Mo’unga’s cross-kick.Ireland kept going: their captain, Rory Best, who had been too emotional to sing the national anthem, came off to a standing ovation after 62 minutes in his final appearance as a professional and the reaction stirred Ireland.Henshaw knocked on as he tried to ground Carbery’s chip over the line but immediately scored from a scrum.New Zealand responded with their sixth try, Dane Coles freeing Bridge but Ireland kept coming. A penalty try took them into double figures but New Zealand had to have the final word through Jordie Barrett with the final move of a game that showed the holders will take some toppling."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5bd8847c0a3d37e310eb6095df12f6dc02660f8b/60_393_3925_2354/master/3925.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ddfbd644195a068ffb562f9ec1db4d2e","title":"champions day 2019 at ascot live updates horse racing","story":"Star Catcher will be hard to beat if Frankie Dettori is once more allowed his own way in front but that can’t be taken for granted against 11 rivals with a big prize on the line.

A field of 17 runners went to post for the six-furlong contest, with the William Haggas-trained mare One Master and Martyn Meade’s Advertise the joint-favourites at 4-1.There were still several in with chances as the leaders raced inside the final furlong, with Denis Hogan’s remarkable improver Make A Challenge - rated just 66 prior to six wins this season - looking the most likely winner after hitting the front. However, he was swamped by four runners as the post loomed and it was Andrew Balding’s 33-1 shot Donjuan Triumphant who had his head in front where it mattered, scoring by a length in the hands of Silvestre de Sousa.Turning out just under a fortnight after claiming a second successive victory in the Prix de la Foret at ParisLongchamp, One Master ran a fine race to fill the runner-up spot, with Forever In Dreams and Brando close-up in third and fourth respectively. The win comes a year on from the tragic death of Leicester City owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, who founded King Power Racing, in whose blue and white colours Balding’s charge runs. Balding said: “He’s always come good in the autumn and I thought he ran a really good race last time behind Cape Byron, because he fluffed the start and things didn’t go to plan. He was third in the race last year and he’s such a legend - it’s fantastic for King Power to win their first Group One race, there were a couple of anxious moments, but Silvestre managed to get himself out. “I’m just so thrilled for the horse as he was the first horse the chairman ever bought - he’d be so proud right now.” He added: “We were quietly hopeful coming into it, but we needed everything to go right and we got a bit of luck in the end. He has been a star and has got easier to train.

If you fancy a trip out for Champions Day here’s an idea of what’s on offer.Juliet Slot, Ascot’s chief commercial director, said: “We have a huge array of things going on. We’ve got the Pony Club here with an enormous amount of activities trying to get young people to understand about racing we’ve got great films about following foals from the moment they are born until they get on the track.“We’ve got a students’ area there are a lot of different places to eat and a lot of different activities to engage with. I would encourage anyone to download our app – it just shows you how you can engage with the site here, especially if it is your first day here.”Asked what first-time Ascot visitors should do to maximise their enjoyment of the day, she replied: “I always think there are some amazing hidden bars and areas of seating, generally towards the ends of the grandstands. There are some fantastic hidden lawns, such as the Grundy and Bustino Lawn and the Brigadier Gerard Lawn, which have tables and chairs and little bar areas.“If you want to watch the racing, I always think you should go down to the rails.

We know what he did at Ascot in 1996 when he went one better with the Magnificent Seven. The approximate odds for a Frankie accumulator are 2,865-1.A spokesperson from bookmakers.tv commented: “Champions Day is perfectly placed to be a highlight in a bumper day of sport and the bookmakers are going all out to ensure the top class racing appeals as a betting proposition to the recreational customer, who’ll no doubt have Frankie’s Royal Ascot four-timer fresh in the memory.“But short of battening down the hatches, on the basis the meeting has been one of mixed fortunes for punters over the years the firms don’t appear to be running scared at all and the Dettori accumulator is being marketed aggressively. If he were to repeat the feat it would be a costly one - although not as much as the bookie reps may suggest - but the odds suggest it’s a risk worth taking for the layers.”Ladbrokes current odds on Frankie’s mounts ...If he does ride all six winners let’s hope the next statue’s a better one!Can you imagine Adam Gemili running up that Ascot straight?Straight Course: HeavyInner Flat Course: Good to Soft, Soft in placesGoingStick readings today at 8.15am: Straight Course: 5.3  Inner Flat Course 6.6Clerk of the Course Chris Stickels said: “We have been dry since 6pm yesterday and we are forecast a generally dry day, with the outside chance of a shower.”It’s going to be tough going out there, never mind the testing ground the runners have to deal with there’s also a strong headwind to contend with!Aidan O’Brien has won almost every top-class Flat race in Britain but one of the few to have evaded him is the Champion Stakes, which has not fallen to a raider from Ballydoyle since the Vincent O’Brien-trained Sir Ivor in 1968.

Benbatl, in contrast, is a top-class animal who might hate this mud. King Of Comedy has become tricky, while Magna Grecia and Mohaather have plenty to prove after missing the summer. So the way is open for an outsider like Happy Power to get involved.

The grey has sometimes pulled too hard early on but there should be a decent pace on here.4.40 Ascot A 12lb rise for winning the Cambridgeshire makes this tough for Lord North but the way he shot forwards once in the clear that day suggests he really does belong in a higher grade and he can end the day on a high for the Gosden  Dettori team. Kynren was a fair fifth a year ago but was running on empty at the line and is 8lb higher now.There is positive news to start the day at Ascot, which has somehow managed to remain rain-free since 6pm on Friday evening allowing Chris Stickels, the clerk of the course, to report unchanged going: good-to-soft, soft in places on the inner hurdles track where much of the action will unfold, and heavy for the milers and sprinters on the straight course.And it seems likely to stay that way, with the latest forecast suggesting “a generally dry day with the outside risk of a shower”, so a card that might have descended into a muddy farce should be able to take its proper place in an outstanding day of sporting action.That said, it will be a tough, demanding afternoon for horses and jockeys alike. Heavy ground at Ascot is widely seen to be as gruelling as it gets, not least when it has had a few hours without rain allowing it to get a little “gluey”. The runners in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes , in particular, will need to get every inch of the mile, and even on the inner track, the runners in the Long Distance Cup and Champion Stakes may be grateful for the shorter trip in both events: 82yds less than normal for the stayers’ race and 78yds less for the day’s feature race.The early news in the betting is that Straarius, the only odds-on shot on the card, is a little uneasy in the market for the Long Distance Cup, drifting to 4-6 from an overnight price of 4-7 with most firms, following support for Aidan O’Brien’s Kew Gardens.Donnacha O’Brien, the trainer’s son, will be aboard his father’s main runners this afternoon as Ryan Moore, the stable jockey, seems to have drawn the short straw by heading to Australia to trail home last on Ten Sovereigns in the hugely valuable Everest a few hours ago.And it could be a big day for Ireland’s reigning champion jockey as Magna Grecia, who took the 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket with O’Brien in the saddle back in May, has joined The Revenant at the top of a very open market for the QEII, with both runners available at 5-1.Chris Cook’s tips for today’s races are in his preview here and listed below and all the news and views from Ascot will be in this space as the richest afternoon in British racing unfolds from 1.50."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8c183aa28006f80f5b63420410c0cb6f08aa7a6/0_36_3121_1873/master/3121.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf9486de3359b4152c1e931438c8a558","title":"england v australia rugby world cup 2019 quarter final live","story":"All the action as England reached the semis with an eventually comfortable win over Australia• Robert Kitson’s match report | Bret Harris on a self-inflicted defeat“The good news for us is we can still improve,” said England coach Eddie Jones after masterminding victory against his native Australia. “We’re happy to play anyone but obviously I’ve got a soft spot for New Zealand,” he added, looking ahead to next weekend’s semi-finals before the All Blacks’ demolition of Ireland.Right, that’ll be it from me. Thanks for your company and I’ll be back tomorrow for Wales vs France. Bye.Cheika looking genuinely wounded there and far more gracious to the opposition than he has been of late, but a pretty accurate summation of what happened. However, he was the coach, and question marks have to be raised about the game management by his side and what part he played in the players believing it was a sensible approach.Michael Cheika, in his last game as coach, shares his thoughts.Here’s the full match report for your post-match reading pleasure.“We played an attacking brand of rugby and troubled England at times, but England kicked well and got their restarts right and then our exits weren’t right”You can follow all the build up to New Zealand vs Ireland with Barry Glendenning now“Pleased with the way players stuck with the game after first 20 minutes from Australia, we took some good opportunities. We stuck at it and it was brilliant. We haven’t been at our best yet and I’m looking forward to seeing our best.”“Keep giving it to Kurtley Beale seems to have been both teams’ key tactic” snarks Steve Holford, and he’s not wrong. His decision making in his own 22 was historically bad.Owen Farrell is giving his view.“Australia made that a brilliant game, they attacked, but we are pretty dangerous when we have field position. In the second half we played the game at our pace, not theirs.” In the end it looked very easy for England as their forwards from the bench, kicking game and Australia’s increasing desperation all conspired to make for a comfortable victory.A few fitful attempts from both teams come to nought and England are in the semis.Koroibete, who has been so good, receives the ball out left from an inside pop and is through the tackle line and once again rounds Daly to touch down with a sidewinding run from 4o metres out. But Garces wants to look at a forward pass in the build up and he was right to check and Hooper threw one a metre forward. NO TRY! That’s a heartbreaker after a lungbusting run from Koroibete.75 mins. Ford sends a raking, soul-splintering kick into touch near the Australia line. The Wallabies will have to go from there, but they’re given some help with a penalty that Beale taps and floats a pass towards Hooper but Watson intercepts it and walks it in.Make no mistake, this has become a pasting.73 mins. The ball is over the posts and and the match is pretty much all over.Heinz is on for Youngs and Joseph takes the field for Tuilagi.Petaia, who has faded along with the rest of his team in the second period, is off for James O’Connor.71 mins.  England catch and drive and begin a slow, draining, demoralising maul march forward which Australia are pinged for collapsing.Owen takes the screw and decides to turn it by pointing at the posts.70 mins. Australia mangle their own lineout and the knock-on leads to a scrum, that leads to the new men Marler and Cole making a mess of the Wallaby scrum. Penalty England and they’re up to halfway with possession.67 mins. Koroibete carries the ball into the England half, he’s off his wing again and at the heart of everything good Australia have produced as he has been all game. England are forced to concede a lineout in their own half.Marler is on for Mako, Ludlam is on for Underhill and Cowan-Dickie is on for George. The full spoiling operation is engaged by England.66 mins. More subs for Australia in the pack. Coleman is on for Arnold and Uelese is on for Latu.65 mins. He’s not missed one yet, and he’s not starting with that one.You have to think that that’s the game. England catch and drive the lineout, Youngs pulls the ball out of the maul sprints for the blindside corner and grounds it, but it has a look of being spilled. The TMO confirms is, but England have a penalty for Australia’s side entry to the maul.Farrell points at the sticks with a crushing inevitability.63 mins. Ford is probing with kicks and making Australia play out from their own half, something they are not showing much ability to do. Beale eventually screws the ball off his boot and into touch for England to have a go from 10 metres out.Sinckler, who has made quite the contribution, is off for Cole. Kruis is on for Lawes.Slade is off for Ford, that will push Farrell out to 12 and Tuilagi to 13.Genia is off for Nic White and Tupou is on for Allan Alaalatoa 60 mins. Naisarani picks up and drives to within a metre of the line, it’s worked to Kerevi who sucks some defenders in. England are very narrow now but Sinckler gets his hand in the tackle to rip the ball away! Slade booms it upfield, misses touch, but they spoil the possession enough to win the scrum on halfway.That was ridiculously good work from Sinckler. What a ten minutes he’s had.58 mins. Toomua made all the difference when he came on against Wales, and he’s already showing signs of a similar impact here. He has plenty of options from this scrum, with Petaia standing at 12 and Kerevi pushed out one to outside centre. England’s defence best have their eyes up.56 mins. Itoje does a great job of discrupting the Aus throw and thwarting the catch and drive, but the Wallanbies still have it and are working phases in the England 22 with Toomua now orchestrating. Another penalty to Australia as Underhill goes off his feet in the 22 and they take the scrum in the shadow of the posts.53 mins.  Rory Arnold nicks England’s lineout and Australia are in the England half, on the attack and in receipt of a penalty for Henry Slade not rolling away. They put it in the corner.51 mins.  Lealiifano is coming apart at the seams here as he follows up that poor pass with not making the 10 metres with the kick off. The ball is eventually out for an England lineout.Cheika has had enough and Toomua is on for the Lealiifano.The England captain adds three from in front, 25 metres out.48 mins. England hold up Sio in defence after the prop is given a pretty impossible task by a dodgy pass from Lealiifano and they win the scrum. They double down on this by splintering the Wallaby pack in the resulting scrum and winning a penalty. Farrell indicates he’ll kick for the posts.46 mins. Watson makes some headway up the right and when the ball is recycled left Sinckler runs a fabulous out to in line in midfield, and he is through and in from 15 metres. He even deliberately ran at Beale to bump him, just to make some sort of point.43 mins. Daly drops a straightforward catch, and Australia are back on the attack. Slade pushes up too far in defence and the ball is floated over him and popped to Koroibete on the inside drift on halfway and he’s through and takes Daly to the cleaners by standing him up and going around him to score. Not a great few minutes for the England fullback.Game very much on.40 mins. It’s as you were with the line-ups as Owen Farrell get us back underwayThe death of the drop-goal is the greatest tactical tragedy in the history of any sport, Gary, let me tell you.Although, it has made something of a comeback this tournament after being persona non grata for at least a decade.It’s looking a realistic request at the moment, Phil.What to make of that half? Neither team look that decent without the ball, for a start. With the ball, England are more structured with more obvious patterns, while Australia are punching through the defensive line at will when they can keep hold of the ball, but they must exit their 22 better.The ball is off the field and now so are the teams.Lealiifano slots it as the gong goes, but there’s time for the restart.38 mins.  Austrlia have a scrum in the England 22. It goes down once and Sinckler believes Sio is dropping his bind and screams “Romain!” at touch judge Romain Poite 50 metres away on that side of the scrum to draw his attention. That level of cheeking of officials should bring a penalty, but Garces is traditionally weak on this and does nothing again.However, the next scrum brings the Aus penalty they should’ve had for that for England collapsing and Christian Lealiifano lines it up. 37 mins. Billy Vunipola, whose carrying has been significantly less effective than usual, is given the Hooper treatment at the breakdown and gives away a penalty. From the line-out Kerevi gets on the hoof and is through Tuilagi. Once again, the Wallabies are dangerous when they play in the right parts of the field.35 mins. Farrell turns Koroibete with a kick into the corner, and the Wallabies again try to run it from deep via Beale. It goes nowhere after four phases and they clear their lines not very far up the field.If Australia are going to keep doing that then England would be advised to keep letting them.33 mins. Possession is turned over to England again who kick for territory. Reece Hodge decides to have a run back and is absolutely powdered by a thundering hit by Sam Underhill. The ball was lost in the aftermath and England have a scrum just inside Australia’s half.32 mins. England gather the restart and allow Ben Youngs to do the necessary to touch and Australia chuck a huge ballooning throw over the top of the lineout. It was deliberate and is gathered to put them back on the attack just outside the England 22. 29 mins.  Tuilagi gets some momentum on a carry and Christian Lealiifano gives away a kickable penalty for not rolling away. Owen Farrell can stroke the likes of that over all day.27 mins. Beale launches a disgusting kick across his own 22 that puts England on the attack, but the spew the ball again to allow Australia to try and play out from their 22 again, but then they drop it and are accidentally offside. England scrum. Easy as that for the Wallaby ten."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b77ce8d13827996af40c1db21adaec17a03e515a/63_100_3437_2062/master/3437.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=684413e29d03e761b2ae62cf6437b0ba","title":"new zealand v ireland rugby world cup 2019 quarter final live","story":"Joe Schmidt speaks: “We gave them too many access points into the game,” says Ireland’s now former coach, as he agrees that today’s outcome was the result of a combination of New Zealand being particularly good and Ireland being particularly poor. “We gave them a bit of a leg up and you just can’t afford to do that,” he says. Brian O’Driscoll speaks: “Ultimately it will be seen as a disappointment,” says the former Ireland international when asked how he thinks this campaign - one in which they lost to Japan and got hockeyed in yet another quarter-final - will be viewed by the Irish. That, ladies and gentlemen, is why he gets paid the big bucks. Rory Best speaks: Well, he doesn’t - after his final game of rugby Ireland’s captain looks like he’s going to cry cry as the crowd cheer him. Then he speaks. “The All Blacks were fantastic,” he says. “We felt we prepared well and we felt we had a game plan. They started well and put us on the back foot. They were really clinical and didn’t let us get on the front foot. This is a front foot, momentum game. I think for now you just have to give credit to the All Blacks.” Just the seven tries for New Zealand: They were simply outstanding today, going over seven times, albeit in the face of fairly feeble resistance from Ireland. It’s all over: Having put in arguably their best performance since the last World Cup, New Zealand swat Ireland aside with a minimum of fuss. They were as outstanding as the Irish were inept and will now face England in the last four. For Ireland, it’s yet another dismal failure to win a knockout match at a Rugby World Cup. They didn’t show up today and were punished accordingly.79 min New Zealand 46-14 Ireland Beauden Barrett is announced as the Man of the Match. It’s a New Zealand scrum, five metres from the Ireland line. Another long pass kick out to the corner, from Beauden Barrett to his brother Jordie Barrett and he es over in the corner in the face of shockingly bad Irish defending. Richie Mo’unga misses the conversion. 78 min New Zealand 41-14 Ireland: Apologies, I meant they’re right back on their own line, after another dreadful kick from Joey Carberry, who has been even more wayward off the boot than Johnny Sexton, who he replaced. 77 min New Zealand 41-14 Ireland: With Ireland camped on the New Zealand line, CJ Stander’s route to touching the ball against the base of the upright by an offside Matt Todd. That’s a yellow card for the cheating Kiwi and Ireland are right back in this game!!! 75 min New Zealand 41-7 Ireland: Ireland make their way towards the New Zealand line, going close to scoring a second try as Jordan Lamour chases a kick to the corner. 73 min New Zealand 41-7 Ireland Ardie Savea turns over possession for New Zealand. A burst through the centre and Dane Coles offloads to Bridge, who goes over. This is a massacre. 71 min New Zealand 34-7 Ireland: If anything, that consolation try has just riled up the All Blacks. They capitalise on more poor kicking from hand to make ground and a hot-knife-through-butter move looks guaranteed to end in a try until Anton Lienert-Brown misplaces a pass to TJ Perenara. 69 min New Zealand 34-7 Ireland From a five-metre scrum, CJ Stander takes the ball and makes a clever before passing to Henshaw, who darts over between the posts. The extra are added and it’s game on! New Zealand are on the ropes! 68 min New Zealand 34-0 Ireland Robbie Henshaw fails to gather a little grubber kick in behind and a great try-scoring opportunity goes to waste for Ireland. 66 min New Zealand 34-0 Ireland Decent from Ireland, as Jacob Stockdale gallops down the right wing before being brought to ground. Irelandgo through the phases and are camped in front of the New Zealand posts, as the crowd roar them on, patronising them to within an inch of their lies. 65 min New Zealand 34-0 Ireland Another Irish penalty, another missed effort for touch. 63 min New Zealand 34-0 Ireland The conversion is missed and Ireland captain Rory Best goes off to rapturous applause from the Ireland fans, who have had little else to clap. That’s him done with rugby after a fine career, although he’ll be unhappy at having to sign off like this. 62 min New Zealand 34-0 Ireland From a lineout, New Zealand drive forward, smithereening the Irish pack. An inch-perfect cross-field kick from Mo’unga is gathered on the far touchline and a ruck forms. The ball’s picked out from the base of the ruck and fed to Matt Todd, who goes over. Sensational stuff from the All Blacks. 60 min New Zealand 29-0 Ireland A brilliant chip-and-chase from Beauden Barrett has New Zealand back on their own line, trying to clear with a relieving box-kick. 59 min New Zealand 29-0 Ireland “OK we’re going nowhere here, lads,” says Owens, as New Zealand come up from the scrum early. After playing the advantage, he awards Ireland the penalty. Once again, they fail to make touch. That is diabolically inept from Ireland. 58 min New Zealand 29-0 Ireland Scrum for Ireland just inside their own half for a New Zealand knock on. Not for the first time in this game, Conor Murray gets a lecture from Nigel Owens about the manner in which he is appealing for decisions to go his way. 56 min New Zealand 29-0 Ireland Brody Retallick is penalised for going off his feet and Ireland clear their lines. Matt Todd and Rhys Ruddock come off their respective benches. 54 min New Zealand 29-0 Ireland  New Zealand rampage forward again, playing the ball out wide to George Bridge on the touchline, seven or eight yards from the Ireland line. They move it back inside and Ireland are defending their own line again. 53 min New Zealand 29-0 Ireland: Sonny Bill Williams comes on for Jack Goodhue, whose lucky mullet has served him well today. He’s been excellent for New Zealand, a pivotal ever-present menace as they stretch Ireland hither and yon across the pitch. 52 min New Zealand 29-0 Ireland: Ireland get into the New Zealand 22 for only the second time in the game and promptly give the ball away. They proceed to give away another penalty for a Tadhg Furlong tackle on a man without the ball. 50 min New Zealand 29-0 Ireland: New Zealand make front row changes, with Ofa Tuungafasi and Angus Ta’avao coming on for Moody and Laualala. For Ireland, Dave Kilcoyne replaces Cian Healy. 48 min New Zealand 29-0 Ireland: Kieran Read drives for the line and is brought down. He pops the ball up to Taylor, who grabs the pass and drops between the posts. The conversion sails between the posts. New Zealand are so, so good ... 46 min New Zealand 22-0 Ireland:  Kieran Read drives as New Zealand inch towards the Ireland line. Scott Barrett is next to put the head down and burrow. “Keep your feet, please,” says Nigel Owens to Ireland’s forwards. We’re on Phase Seven and Ireland are taking a ferocious pummelling. 46 min New Zealand 22-0 Ireland: Smith offloads to Goodhue after a good carry from Brodie Retallick. A knock on by CJ Stander give New Zealand the scrum and there’s a break in play as New Zealand prop Joe Moody receives medical attention. Scrum for New Zealand about eight metres from the Irish line. 44 min New Zealand 22-0 Ireland: Ireland have a 22 drop out and New Zealand claim Johnny Sexton’s kick. They play the ball from one touchline to the other, with Jack Goodhue making ground. They are on complete control of this match. 42 min New Zealand 22-0 Ireland: Scott Barrett is on for New Zealand and Ireland are already pinned back inside their own half. They have the scrum, about 10 metres from their own line. Conor Murray kicks for touch and New Zealand win the lineout. 41 min: “Ireland need to create a little bit of quicker ruck balls ... they’re running into a brick wall at the moment,” says Brian O’Driscoll in the ITV studio. They missed 10 out of 66 tackles in that first half. New Zealand missed one out of 75. They kick off and Beauden Barrett catches the ball. He kicks for touch and Jacob Stockdale catches. He has a foot in touch and that’s another silly Irish error ... Gerard Lyne is not happy: “Just nine properly competitive rugby playing nations, nine World Cups and Ireland have never got past the quarter finals,” he writes. “Also-rans, never nearly men. Overhyped. Over glorification of meaningless Soldier Field wins. Time to wind in the hype machine. It’s Demolition Day. Again.” It’s only half-time, Gerard. Anything could happen ... although I have a feeling I know what’s about to unfold. The players go off at half-time with Ireland having had the collective backside handed to them in a first half in which they had only one meaningful trip past the New Zealand 22. The reigning champions have been outstanding and for all their pre-match talk, Ireland have been pretty poor. 40+2 min New Zealand 22-0 Ireland:  Ireland get a penalty, which is reversed because Peter O’Mahony is penalised for leading a tackle with his shoulder on a man who was on the ground. 40+2 min New Zealand 22-0 Ireland: Excellent defence from New Zealand, but Ireland have another penalty for a tackle off the ball by Kieran Read. Nigel Owens is also checking a bad tackle by Peter O’Mahony, who he suspects of leading with his shoulder on a player on the ground. 40+1 min New Zealand 22-0 Ireland: Ireland win a penalty as Sam Whitlock goes off his feet. Johnny Sexton kicks for touch in the corner and Ireland win the lineout. 40 min New Zealand 22-0 Ireland: Ireland win the lineout and are driven backwards as the half-time gong goes. Ireland are in possession a few metres from the New Zealand 22. This is actually as close as they’ve come to scoring a try. 40 min New Zealand 22-0 Ireland: Conor Murray kicks for touch and wins his team the lineout after the ball goes out off Mo’unga. 37 min New Zealand 22-0 Ireland: New Zealand go about their hunt for try No4. Ireland scrum after some indiscretion in the ruck perpetrated by Kieran Read. 33 min New Zealand 22-0 Ireland: Nigel Owens awards the try after a long consultation with Graham Hughes. Richie Mo’unga misses the conversion from out wide by the right touchline. 32 min New Zealand 22-0 Ireland: A bruising tackle on Sexton from Reece prompts the Irishman to lose the ball. Barrett kicks the ball ahead, gathers and goes over. The TMO is checking to see if Barrett was offside when he kicked the ball.

The Libra cryptocurrency project now faces existential threats from world leaders and central bankers worried about its harmful potential: as a vehicle for money laundering, a threat to global financial stability, open to data privacy abuse, dangerous for consumers and stripping nations of the control of their economies by privatising the money supply.Seven high-profile partners in the Facebook-led consortium that is building the digital currency – known as the Libra Association – have quit in dramatic fashion in recent weeks, including PayPal, eBay, Visa and Mastercard, as concerns mount.“One by one they’re starting to drop away. That’s certainly not good news,” said John Sedunov, a professor of finance and expert in cryptocurrencies at Villanova University.“I’m not saying that it’s tearing apart at the seams totally, but we’re starting to inch towards the cliff. The fewer financial firms and fewer mainstream companies in this project, the more it loses credibility,” he added.In the latest blow to the project, the G7 group of the world’s most powerful nations warned on Friday that digital currencies such as Libra “pose challenges for competition and antitrust policies” and should not be allowed to launch until the regulatory concerns are addressed.Mark Zuckerberg is expected to feel the pressure mount further next week when he heads for a grilling at the US House of Representatives over Libra. In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, he will face sharp questions over data privacy. To add to fears over Facebook’s control of personal information, building a digital currency brings sensitive financial data into its orbit, raising the stakes.“I get the sense that they’ll get hit harder on those areas for Libra. And I don’t think Zuckerberg is the politicians’ favourite person. That comes into play,” said Sedunov.As the problems for Libra mount, comments made this week by the Labour MP Alison McGovern could prove instructive to preview the showdown in Washington: “Isn’t it a legitimate question of policymakers to ask Facebook: ‘Why are you bothering? Why is this for you?’”Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, told McGovern and other MPs on the Commons Treasury committee that Libra should be heavily regulated worldwide “or it’s not going to happen”.“This will not be like social media. This will not be a case where something gets up and starts running and then the system tries to figure out after the fact how it’s going to regulate it,” he said.Threadneedle Street insiders believe Libra was probably planned with too many technologists and too few economists to think about its risks to the world economy. With 2 billion Facebook users, Libra could become systemically important for the global financial system overnight. In a clash of worlds between technology and finance, the fail-fast-and-improve Silicon Valley approach is incompatible with a too-big-to-fail financial project.Dante Disparte, the head of policy and communications for the Libra Association, dismissed the concerns, adding: “We agree that the Libra project should be appropriately regulated, so calls for regulation are not a ‘setback’ or ‘blow’ to the project. Responsible financial innovation and regulatory oversight are not in contest.”However, governments and central banks around the world are worried they could lose control of their monetary policy if significant chunks of activity shift to Libra.Bruno Le Maire, the French finance minister, warned in the Financial Times this week that Libra posed a threat to national sovereignty. He argued that even regulation would not be enough to address the risks posed, “because Libra is asking states to share their monetary sovereignty with private companies”. Le Maire wrote that he “cannot countenance” passing control of a key tool for steering the economy from democratically elected governments and their central banks to a group with explicitly commercial interests.Andrew Milligan, the head of global strategy at the fund manager Aberdeen Standard, said: “With digital money created by corporations, we therefore have to transfer our trust to corporations. That’s different from trusting a traditional bank and the governments that back deposits in them.”Despite the existential threat to its future, Libra still draws support for its potential to revolutionise finance – if it can satisfy central bankers over their concerns.Financial exclusion around the globe could be tackled by a company with Facebook’s presence in developing countries, while the promise of digital currency has potential to cut the cost of notoriously expensive cross-border payments, saving households and businesses money and time.However, with mounting regulatory pressures, the time and cost of building Libra to settle those concerns could quickly spiral. The Bank of England warned earlier this month that Libra would need to meet similar standards to traditional banks. Building a payment system to meet the myriad of bank regulations could rapidly erode the high-tech competitive advantages that would make Libra quicker and cheaper.Teunis Brosens, the lead economist for digital finance regulation at the Dutch bank ING, said: “The financial sector is the most heavily regulated sector of all and I think they underestimated that.”However, big banks have long feared competition from internet giants. And in the shape of Facebook, they have a rival with deep pockets. Brosens added: “It really could go both ways. I find it a bit too easy to say with schadenfreude that Facebook has launched this thing and they fell flat on their face.“They made a big play and now they face a substantial setback. But they can still recover. I don’t expect Facebook to give up this easily.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/411a59e02a87aa38b568424a0cdd43101085b8e1/0_61_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f8631485a537947d87d2ffd734d56ca","title":"new cycling trail northern france french flanders reseau cycle network","story":"A 800km network across French Flanders is so easy to follow (and ride) you don’t even need a map to find the country’s favourite village, inspiring landscapes and great foodI’m sitting down to a picnic breakfast at a sun-flecked table beside the River Lys in Flanders. Consulting my map, I write the following numbers on something approximating a waxed luggage tag: “22-37-71-34-33-32-31-30-08-01-33”. I put the map away, slip the tag around my bike’s handlebars and I’m set for the morning. I’ve never been to this part of Flanders before – it’s the lesser-known French part, on the northernmost tip of the country, bordering Belgium – but I’m now confident I can cycle today from my table in the riverside town of Saint-Venant, through Haverskerque, across the Nieppe forest, down into Merville and finally into the town of Estaires.Welcome to French Flanders’ ingenious new cycle network. Launched earlier this year, the catchily titled Réseau Points-Nœuds Vélo (literally Network Node-Points Bike) comprises 830km of minor roads and cycle paths covering the Vallée de la Lys, the Monts de Flandre hills and a small slice of southern Belgium. The clever bit is its hundreds of numbered signposts – or “node-points” – each directing cyclists to the next numbered signpost. All riders need to do is pick up the map (€8), note down the node-point numbers on their chosen route and pedal away. The map also highlights restaurants, breweries, museums, attractions, campsites and eco-lodges, and shows the distances between the node-points, which makes tailoring your own Tour de Flandre extremely simple. And once you’ve set off, there’s no need to consult the map again, or worry about your phone dying.Less than three hours after setting off from London, I picked up my hire bike (eeuwenhout.info) at Bailleul, one of the many small towns and villages within the network served by a railway station. On my three-day circular tour I would cover 180km, starting with a gentle climb into the low hills of the Monts de Flandre.It was lunchtime when I rolled into Terdeghem, a village of neat brick cottages and the Het Kerk Hoek, holder of the much-prized Estaminets flamands marque, awarded to authentically Flemish restaurants and bars. I think it’s fairly safe to say that, like the rest of Flanders – which loves its beef, chicken, mussels and cheeses – it has yet to receive the memo about veganism. However, it’s wonderful how far cow eyes and a sad inflection in the voice will get you. In no time, I was tucking into a beautiful platter of locally grown crudités, complete with little pots of dressings, sauces and a compôte, along with a 3 Monts beer. “Brewed just 3km from here,” according to the barman.It was the first of many Flemish beers I sampled. At the Bellenaert eco-brewery in Outtersteene, where all the energy comes from renewables, I learned a little about the nuances of bitterness, density and colour. Flemish beers are usually fermented a second time in the bottle, which gives them a delicate crispness.I also discovered that the Flemish have a sceptical attitude to Mondays, and opening hours in general – my attempts to visit the museums dedicated to life on the FrenchBelgian border and bees were rebuffed by musée fermé signs. However, I had more luck when I breezed along the few kilometres (“59-23-27-22-33”) from Terdeghem to Cassel.Perched on the saddle between two hills, and sprinkled with gorgeous Flemish architecture, Cassel is said to be the inspiration for the nursery rhyme The Grand Old Duke of York, and was voted France’s favourite village in a TV competition last year. On the beautiful old Grand’Place I popped into the Musée de Flandre to unearth something of the region’s history. It was rather bloody: the area was fought over by Burgundians, Dutch, Spanish, French and Germans (though not all at once). However, its people did inspire Pieter Bruegel the Elder, so there’s that.I was just about to leave when I heard Harpo’s 1975 smash, Movie Star, being played outside by a marching band, striding over the cobbles. And then came another. And another. I had stumbled upon a competition – six brass bands from local villages taking turns to roam around Cassel’s Grand’Place blasting out three-minute renditions of popular classics, from Abba and Aha to the White Stripes and, well, ACDC. Until you’ve heard Highway to Hell played by 30 mild-mannered, uniformed village folk, you cannot truly claim to have lived.My days rolled away as I bowled languorously along quiet back roads. This is farming country: the path alongside the River Lys from Thiennes to Haverskerque made for a pleasant off-road stretch, while the track through the Nieppe forest provided a sylvan interlude.Accommodation in the region is plentiful: I spent my first night in a Cabane Rando, a rustic wooden pod the shape of an A-frame tent (€25 single occupancy, €46 double) my second in what looked like a charming folly converted into an elegant little gîte (sleeps 4 from €110), where I listened to a pair of owls calling back and forth across the woodland garden and my final night in Flandre Lys eco-lodge (sleeps 4, €36) at a fetching little pleasure boat marina on the Lys, where my thrillingly lofty bedroom was reached by a ladder.Over the next two years, the network will expand north to Dunkirk, and one would hope that it’s only a matter of time before this brilliantly simple idea makes the leap across the Channel.

A problematic show in which her family shadow the lives of a Namibian tribe should put an end to itWhere on the Scarlett-Moffatt-Is-England’s-Rose-O-Meter™ are we at the moment? I always forget. There was that ascent to fame when she sat horizontal on a sofa and said arch things on Gogglebox: we quite liked her then. After that there was the predictable I’m A Celeb … win and the boom-and-bust fitness DVD: an unfurling of the bud. After that, the full bloom of Moffattism, where she was drafted by ITV as a sort of Ant and Dec ancillary on Saturday Night Takeaway, turning them from a diarchy to a triumvirate by holding cue cards a lot and waving.Since then, a holy silence: the panel-show guest appearances, some sort of Instagram controversy about a skirt, a little McDonald’s spon-con. And now this, The British Tribe Next Door (Tuesday, 9.15pm, Channel 4), one final swing of the Moffatt bat, a last attempt to cement her as beloved in the British canon, a sort of Kerry KatonaPrincess Diana mash-up event and a, uh, show where her and her family live in a faithfully rebuilt version of their County Durham terrace house in among the mud-and-stone huts of a Namibian tribe.I doubt I am the first to say this and I will not be the last, but: what? On paper, you would be right to think that this does not sound like a good idea. In practice, it is also very much not a good idea. The vague intention is: the Moffatts – dad Mark, who is boring mum Betty, who is boring the teen sister Ava-Grace is mostly mute – move in with the semi-nomadic Himba tribe in Namibia, and they stay in an exact replica of their home (frustratingly glossed over are the logistics of building an exact replica of Scarlett Moffatt’s house in the middle of the Namib desert. I would rather watch an hour of someone explaining how they erected an untethered terrace with electricity and running water in such a setting than, say, the dire five-minute segment where Mark Moffatt goes metal detecting and finds a whistle). The Himba – who are pitched somewhere between props for the Moffatts to bounce off and actual, rounded people with their own thoughts and feelings and to-camera segments – patiently explain to the Moffatts how much they prize their livestock’s health, shy away from excessive possessions and dress traditionally the Moffatts nod and point to a plug socket and say: “That box, very spiky!”This is the thing: what would otherwise be, at the very edges, a semi-interesting anthropological exploration – a member of the Himba sees her face for the first time in a mirror Betty’s new friend, Ueripanga, marvels at the time-saving practicality of a washing machine cattle herder Mbiki questions the fundamental need for an upstairs – is ruined because all of the Moffatts are totally uninquisitive, only seeming to venture out of their new build when lured there by the camera crew. Their every interaction with the tribe is boiled down to slowly walking somewhere with them and saying: “Oh you do this, do you?” and looking scared whenever someone starts dancing. It feels as if there were other ways to clang Scarlett Moffatt stiffly over the head with life lessons, frankly. Time to stop shovelling manure on this one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2d1c12eb585c616b1ec52172a45ba85d0d92a11/0_45_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=13ba8941ef04843eb445f9e347d22a82","title":"clinton emails investigation ends state department","story":"State department did find violations by 38 current and former department officials, some of whom may face disciplinary actionThe state department has completed its years-long internal investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of private email and found “no persuasive evidence of systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified information”.The investigation, launched more than three years ago, did find violations by 38 people, some of whom may face disciplinary action.Investigators determined that those 38 people were “culpable” in 91 cases of sending classified information that ended up in Clinton’s personal email, according to a letter sent to Republican senator Chuck Grassley this week and released on Friday. The 38 are current and former state department officials but were not identified.While there were no findings of deliberate mishandling of classified information, the report made clear that Clinton’s use of the private email while serving as the secretary of state in the Obama administration had increased the vulnerability of classified information.The Associated Press sent an email seeking comment to a Clinton representative.The investigation covered 33,000 emails that Clinton turned over for review after her use of the private email account became public. The department said it found a total of 588 violations involving information then or now deemed to be classified but could not assign fault in 497 cases.For current and former officials, culpability means the violations will be noted in their files and will be considered when they apply for or go to renew security clearances. For current officials, there could also be some kind of disciplinary action. But it was not immediately clear what that would be.The report concluded “that the use of a private email system to conduct official business added an increased degree of risk of compromise as a private system lacks the network monitoring and intrusion detection capabilities of state department networks”.The department began the review in 2016 after declaring 22 emails from Clinton’s private server to be “top secret”. Clinton was then running for president against Donald Trump, and Trump made the server a major focus of his campaign.James Comey, the then-FBI director, held a news conference that year in which he criticized Clinton as “extremely careless” in her use of the private email server as secretary of state but said the FBI would not recommend charges.The justice department’s inspector general said FBI specialists did not find evidence that the server had been hacked, with one forensics agent saying he felt “fairly confident that there wasn’t an intrusion”.Grassley started investigating Clinton’s email server in 2017, when he was the chair of the Senate judiciary committee. The Iowa Republican has been critical of Clinton’s handling of classified information and urged administrative sanctions.Clinton has frequently lampooned the Republicans’ ongoing obsession with her email controversy (“lock her up” is still a popular chant at Trump rallies). An exhibit at the Venice Biennale in September saw her sitting behind a replica of the Oval Office’s Resolute Desk and reading from the 62,000 pages of emails."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09f46922dcd1de8c36ec7afa685553e147a34c7d/0_431_5200_3120/master/5200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca83b9f6b4d4ee0140b9692512467404","title":"eu refusal to open talks with albania and north macedonia condemned as historic mistake","story":"Juncker says failure of EU to keep its promises was ‘major historic mistake’Leaders of the EU institutions have condemned the bloc’s refusal to open membership talks with North Macedonia and Albania as a “historic mistake”.In a blow to pro-EU politicians in the small Balkan states, EU government leaders missed a deadline to approve the launch of talks.Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, said it was a “major historic mistake”, adding: “If we want to be respected, we have to keep our promises.”Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, described the impasse as a mistake. “It is not a failure, it is a mistake. I feel really embarrassed,” he told journalists at the end of a two-day summit in Brussels. “Both countries, they passed their exams I can’t say this about our member states.”The French president, Emmanuel Macron, led opposition to opening membership talks with North Macedonia and Albania, putting him at odds with Germany’s Angela Merkel, who has championed the EU hopes of six Balkan states.Denmark and the Netherlands also blocked the decision, although were open to considering the two countries separately. Both opposed opening talks with Albania, but suggested North Macedonia could get a green light by passing a law to safeguard the future of an independent public prosecutor.Balkan states began their long journey to EU membership at a summit in Thessaloniki in 2003 when optimism after the end of the cold war was still high.North Macedonia’s foreign minister, Nikola Dimitrov, suggested the EU was being dishonest. “The least that the European Union owes the region is to be straightforward with us,” he tweeted. “If there is no more consensus on the European future of the western Balkans, if the promise of Thessaloniki 2003 does not stand, the citizens deserve to know.”North Macedonia had been led to believe the path to EU membership would be opened after it resolved a three-decade-long dispute over its name. The former Yugoslav Republic became North Macedonia in February after a historic agreement with Greece, which had blocked Skopje’s Nato and EU ambitions over the dispute.Albania’s prime minister, Edi Rama, said the decision was “linked with an open confrontation within the EU itself”, on its enlargement process. He vowed to continue domestic reforms “not because Paris, Berlin, Brussels or all of them are asking for it, but because it is needed to turn our country into a European, functional one”, Associated Press in Tirana reported.EU leaders had promised in June to take “a clear and substantive decision as soon as possible and no later than October 2019”.Shortly before a ministerial decision was due this week, France announced it wanted to reform the EU’s enlargement process. The last-minute decision was greeted with scepticism by EU diplomats supporting enlargement, who suspected a ruse to delay a decision.The French government has said it supports the “European perspective” of the western Balkan countries, but argues the current process is not credible.Democratic backsliding in Poland and Hungary, fatigue after the Greek eurozone crisis, as well as a widespread view that Romania and Bulgaria were let into the EU too soon, has contributed to doubts about EU expansion in some of the club’s older members."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26bea1ebd567303c96edced656a6a1817df5448c/0_220_4783_2870/master/4783.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f938569de4b9cae60ddd2bf5eb5c294c","title":"thousands take to streets in rome for far right rally salvini","story":"Matteo Salvini’s League joins rightwing parties in ‘Italian pride’ protestThousands of protesters are gathering in Rome for an “Italian pride” rally that brings together the rightwing League of Matteo Salvini, the far-right Brothers of Italy party led by Giorgia Meloni and former premier Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia.Salvini’s League, which remains Italy’s largest party, called for the mass demonstration to protest against the government forged by two former arch-enemies, the centre-left Democrats and the 5-Star Movement.The centre-right alliance is trying to show unity despite internal frictions among the strongman Salvini, the struggling Berlusconi and far-right Meloni, who is rising on the political scene as Italy shifts further to the right.Neo-fascist group CasaPound is also joining Saturday’s rally."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4056563.1571488188!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"fianna f%C3%A1il td says colleague voted for him while he was not in d%C3%A1il","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTimmy Dooley, a Fianna Fáil TD for Clare, said he had left  the Dáil chamber to take a phone call.

I was made aware yesterday that my vote was recorded. “I understand from Niall Collins, that under the mistaken belief that I was at the back of the chamber on the phone, he pressed my voting button.”Mr Dooley, a TD for Clare, added: “I have spoken to the Ceann Comhairle today, to explain what happened and apologise for the misunderstanding.”A Fianna Fáil spokesman declined to comment on Mr Dooley being absent from his assigned seat during the electronic voting. “That’s for Timmy at the moment,” said a Fianna Fáil spokesman. “If you want to try get a hold of Timmy, you are welcome to.

Photograph: Sean GallupGetty Images The Taoiseach moved to reassure unionists about the constitutional implications of the new Brexit deal, telling journalists at the conclusion of the European Union summit in Brussels that “people will still post letters in Royal Mail red letterboxes”.However, his overtures were rejected by the DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds, who said Mr Varadkar was “either very ill-informed or else just wishes to be offensive”.Mr Varadkar said: “The queen will still be the queen, the pound will still be the pound , people will still post letters in Royal Mail red letterboxes.DifferencesMr Varadkar said that there were already differences between the North and the rest of the UK, which did not affect its constitutional position.“It’s been the case for 100 years now that Northern Ireland has its own legal system, has a different education system, has lots of different laws, lots of different rules from the rest of the UK,” he said.“And that’s a reflection of devolution and autonomy and doesn’t change the constitutional position of Northern Ireland.”Mr Varadkar also said many of the Government’s preparations for a no-deal Brexit would be stood down if the House of Commons votes to approve the new agreement on Saturday.“If the House of Commons does vote yes on the indicative vote on Saturday, that will put us in a position to stand down no-deal preparations,” he said.“But we won’t stop them entirely. Because there is always an outside chance of something going wrong over the next couple of weeks. Because as I understand it, what’s required as well is legislation, the withdrawal Act, as well as an indicative vote.”‘Confident’Mr Varadkar said he was “confident” that Stormont would not vote to leave the special arrangements agreed in the new deal and precipitate a hardening of the Border.“If there is a risk we are taking, the risk we are taking is one on democracy and saying to the people of Northern Ireland that you determine your future and that is something I can stand over,” he said.Mr Varadkar also said that it had “crossed my mind” that he might be put under pressure by EU leaders to compromise on the backstop but he said he learned “this was a concern that we did not need to have”.Mr Varadkar also warned that MPs should not assume there would be an extension if they vote to reject the deal today.While Ireland would be favourable towards any request for a further extension, Mr Varadkar said: “Our point of view has always been that we would be open to it, but it would be a mistake to assume that it’s a guarantee, given that it requires unanimity by all 27 member states.”He said the revised withdrawal agreement was unlikely to be revisited further, and the choice was between this agreement and no deal.“Plan B is no deal, and we’re all preparing for that, and we’ve all been preparing for that since the referendum, but let’s hope that doesn’t happen,” he said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph:  UK parliamentary recordng unit British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pleaded with members of Parliament to back his Brexit agreement in a day of high tension in the House of Commons in London.The prime minister, who said the choice is his deal or no deal, must win the approval of lawmakers today or he will have to seek a further delay from the European Union.But he won’t push it to a vote if lawmakers back former Tory minister Oliver Letwin’s amendment, which would force Mr Johnson to request an extension whatever the outcome of Saturday’s proceedings.Mr Letwin and former Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond say the amendment would be an insurance against crashing out without an agreement on October 31st, but a government official said it would make Saturday’s vote meaningless.A large crowd gathered outside Parliament after marching across central London demanding a referendum on Mr Johnson’s deal. Parliament Square was full of singing protesters waving EU and British flags as tens of thousands more packed Whitehall - the road between Parliament and Trafalgar Square which houses government buildings. They carried banners calling for a second referendum and chanted “Object to Brexit”.Former Prime Minister Theresa May said she will vote for Boris Johnson’s agreement with the EU, even though it sets up a border in the Irish Sea, something she pledged never to accept. There had been speculation that she might not back it for that reason. “If you don’t want no deal, you have to vote for a deal,” she told the House of Commons. “If you want to deliver Brexit, if you want to keep faith with the British people, if you want this country to move forward, then vote for the deal today.”Mr Letwin has so far shrugged off pressure to drop his amendment and spoke to introduce it in the House of Commons. It doesn’t cause a delay but adds the insurance that the UK won’t leave without a deal if the government fails to get the necessary legislation through in time, he said.The prime minister “wants to be able to say to any waverers ‘it’s my deal or no-deal. Vote for the implementing legislation or we crash out’,” Mr Letwin said. “Despite my support for the Prime Minister’s deal, I do not believe that it’s responsible to put the nation at risk by making that threat.”If Parliament backs the amendment “we can be secure in the knowledge that the UK will have requested an extension tonight, which if granted can be used if and to the extent necessary, and only the extent necessary, to prevent a no-deal exit.”Under pressureKeir Starmer, Brexit spokesman for the opposition Labour party, told MPs that Johnson’s deal “rips up our close trading relationship with the EU,” with the price being paid in damage to the UK economy and job-losses. He ran through passages of Theresa May’s old deal versus Boris Johnson’s new one, notably the removal of the phrase “the parties envisage having a trading relationship on goods as close as possible with a view to facilitating a needs of legitimate trade.”He asked Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay: “If the aspiration of the government is to stay as close as possible to the EU on trade rules, why take the words out?” Mr Barclay didn’t reply.Mr Starmer added that he doesn’t believe the prime minister’s promises on workers rights and the future relationship with the EU. “There is more than enough evidence that his word doesn’t mean anything and can’t be trusted,” he said.Mr Letwin is coming under pressure from his former Tory colleagues to drop his amendment, according to three Tory MPs who have been involved in discussions with him. While another MP could push Letwin’s amendment to a vote, if he doesn’t gun for it himself then support - particularly among former Tories - could melt away.Mark Francois, deputy chairman of the hard line Brexit European Research Group of Tory MPs, said the caucus agreed at its meeting on Saturday morning that its members won’t disrupt the passage of orce legislation through Parliament this month. The announcement is significant because some MPs have said they will back the Letwin amendment to stop the ERG from forcing a no-deal orce from the EU on October 31 by blocking the government’s Withdrawal Agreement Bill.“We agreed that if we vote for the deal, we vote for the bill,” Mr Francois told the House of Commons.Appeal for more timeFormer Attorney General Dominic Grieve, one of the MPs expelled from the Conservative Party for opposing Boris Johnson’s Brexit strategy, appealed for more time for MPs to scrutinise the deal with the EU. The government “is taking us out at such a gallop that proper scrutiny can’t take place,” he told the House of Commons. “It continues to give the impression that it wants to run a coach and horses through the rights of this house.”Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay defended the lack of an official assessment of the deal’s economic impact. “It’s difficult to model a deal that was only made on Thursday,” he said.The opposition Labour Party confirmed its lawmakers will be ordered to back Oliver Letwin’s amendment, which would force Boris Johnson to send a letter to the EU requesting a Brexit extension on Saturday night. Labour will vote for the amendment “to stop Boris Johnson sneaking through a no-deal crash out or setting up a blackmail vote between his sell-out deal and no deal on October 31,” the party said. They argue that the amendment wouldn’t stop the UK leaving the EU on October 31st if the necessary legislation is passed in time and simply prevents a “crash out by stealth.”Last chanceMr Johnson depicted the vote in parliament as the last chance to secure an orderly Brexit. Though he is obliged by law to seek a Brexit delay if his deal falls, Mr Johnson said the United Kingdom would still leave on October 31st. He didn’t explain how.The so-called “Super Saturday” Brexit extravaganza tops a frenetic week which saw Mr Johnson confound his opponents by clinching a new Brexit deal only to find his Northern Irish allies oppose the deal he struck.In a ided parliament where he has no majority and opponents are plotting maximum political damage ahead of an imminent election, Mr Johnson must now win the support of 320 lawmakers to pass his deal through a booby-trapped legislature.With a number of hardline Brexiteers still undecided and a group of expelled Conservatives ided over how to vote, the outcome is expected to depend on a handful of votes if the vote goes ahead on Saturday.Addressing parliament on Saturday morning Mr Johnson urged MPs to back his Brexit deal telling them that the time had come to heal the rift in British politics over the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.He said the agreement he has struck with Brussels would allow the UK to leave “whole and entire” on October 31st.Mr Johnson called for MPs to reconcile their differences over Brexit.He told MPs: “The House will need no reminding that this is the second deal and the fourth vote, three-and-a-half years after the nation voted for Brexit.“And during those years friendships have been strained, families ided and the attention of this House consumed by a single issue that has at times felt incapable of resolution.“But I hope that this is the moment when we can finally achieve that resolution and reconcile the instincts that compete within us.”He said any further delay to Brexit would be “pointless, expensive and deeply corrosive of public trust”.Beginning his address to the House of Commons shortly after 9.30am the Prime Minister thanked parliamentary staff for “giving up their Saturdays” and missing the end of England’s World Cup Rugby tie with Australia.He added: “I do hope that in assembling for the purposes of a meaningful vote that we will indeed be allowed to have a meaningful vote this evening.”‘Duped’Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his MPs would “not be duped” into supporting the Prime Minister’s Brexit deal.He told the Commons: “(Mr Johnson) has renegotiated the Withdrawal Agreement and made it even worse. He has renegotiated the Political Declaration and made that even worse.”He bemoaned the lack of an economic impact assessment and accompanying legal advice for the Brexit deal.Mr Corbyn added Mr Johnson has made “empty promises” on workers’ rights and the environment.He said: “This Government cannot be trusted and these benches will not be duped.”Mr Corbyn concluded that “voting for a deal today won’t end Brexit. It won’t deliver certainty and the people should have the final say”, adding: “We will not back this sell-out deal.”DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds told the Commons: “Weariness in this House over Brexit should not be an excuse for weakness on Brexit or weakness on the union.”He said there must be “Brexit for the whole of the United Kingdom”, leaving the single market and customs union as one.Mr Dodds raised concerns over Northern Ireland’s involvement in the VAT regime and the single market “without any consent up front” before claiming: “It drives a coach and horses through the Belfast Agreement by altering the cross-community consent mechanism.”Mr Dodds then alluded to previous warnings from Mr Johnson about how no British PM could agree to such terms, adding: “Will he now abide by that and please reconsider the fact that we must leave as one nation together?”Replying Mr Johnson said together he and the DUP secured changes on the customs union before defending the measures in the deal for Northern Ireland. He said: “In all frankness I do think it a pity that it is thought necessary for one side or the other in the debate in Northern Ireland to have a veto on those arrangements.“Because after all, I must be very frank about this, the people of this country have taken a great decision embracing the entire four nations of this country by a simple majority vote that went 52-48, which we’re honouring now. I think that principle should be applied elsewhere and I see no reason why it should not be applied in Northern Ireland, and it is in full compatibility with the Good Friday Agreement.”Mrs May urged MPs to get on with Brexit. She told the Commons: “I hope the whole House will forgive me if I say standing here I have a distinct sense of deja vu.” Prime Minister Boris Johnson could be heard saying: “I know how you feel.”PersuadeIf he wins the vote, if it goes ahead, Mr Johnson will go down in history as the leader who delivered a Brexit - for good or bad - that pulls the United Kingdom far out of the EU’s orbit.Should he fail, Mr Johnson will face the humiliation of Brexit unravelling after repeatedly promising that he would get it done - “do or die” - by October 31st.To win the vote, though, Mr Johnson must persuade enough Brexit-supporting rebels in both his own Conservative Party and the opposition Labour Party to back his deal. His Northern Irish allies and the three main opposition parties oppose it.In a boost for Mr Johnson, some influential hardline Brexit supporters such as Mark Francois and Iain Duncan Smith said they would support the deal.Yet Mr Johnson must navigate a legislative jungle that his opponents are trying to booby trap with amendments that could wreck his path to Brexit.DUP to consider amendmentMr Dodds said on Saturday morning that the DUP would look at whether or not to back the Letwin amendment.“It is a very interesting amendment. We are going to look at that very closely, and examine it. It does have the merit of pointing out that this would withhold approval of the Commons from the Government’s plans. So, we haven’t made any final decision on that, we will meet later and discuss as a parliamentary group... tactics,” he said.Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay said however the Government wanted to block the Letwin amendment. Mr Barclay told the BBC: “It will add further delay, further dither, further uncertainty, which is bad for investment, bad for our economy.”In Brussels on Friday, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said that although Ireland would be favourable towards any request, MPs should not assume there will be an extension if they vote to reject the deal today.“Our point of view has always been that we would be open to it, but it would be a mistake to assume that it’s a guarantee, given that it requires unanimity by all 27 member states.”The Taoiseach moved to reassure unionists about the constitutional implications of the new Brexit deal, saying at the conclusion of the EU summit in Brussels that “the queen will still be the queen, the pound will still be the pound , people will still post letters in Royal Mail red letterboxes”.Mr Varadkar said that he was “confident” Stormont would not vote to leave the special arrangements agreed in the new deal and precipitate a hardening of the Border.“If there is a risk we are taking, the risk we are taking is one on democracy and saying to the people of Northern Ireland that you determine your future and that is something I can stand over,” he said.Mr Dodds said: “If Leo Varadkar thinks unionism is just about red post boxes then he is either very ill-informed or else just wishes to be offensive.”He complained that “a new trade barrier will have been erected between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom without the consent of anyone who lives here”.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

The more sponsors pay, the more products they can nominate to be on the list and the more prominently their own products will be featured on the popular website. Amazon aimed to sell at least $20m in sponsorships for this year’s list, the documents show. Amazon also published a summer toy list with lower sponsorship prices.It’s perfectly legal for Amazon to sell advertising on its site. It becomes a problem when the world’s largest online retailer tells shoppers recommendations are curated by experts but doesn’t disclose the money it gets from the toy industry, said Robert Weissman, president of the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen. Because consumers place more value on recommendations from independent sources, companies prefer to keep their financial involvement hidden, he argued.“They don’t write ‘paid ad’ on it because it completely changes how consumers perceive the information,” Mr Weissman said. “If the list is entirely or in part paid advertising, people have a right to know.”Amazon likened the payments it received to the money brands pay stores to be included in advertising circulars or to get prominent shelf space.In an emailed statement, the company said: “Every product on our annual Holiday Toy List, which features family gift ideas from new releases to customer favourites, is independently curated by a team of in-house experts based on a high bar for quality, design, innovation and play experience. We source product ideas from many places, including our selling partners who have an opportunity to nominate their best toys for the season and increase visibility of those toys.”Gift lists are a time-tested way for toy manufacturers to stand out in the critical holiday rush when busy parents are desperate for ideas. Toymakers are eager to appear on these lists because the companies generate about half their annual sales during the holiday season.Walmart charges toymakers $10,000 monthly per product to appear on its “Buyer’s Picks” toy list in November and December, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg. The company produces other lists, including “Top Rated by Kids”, which uses feedback from children who test and rate more than 100 toys in July. Walmart and its toy suppliers partner to determine which 100 toys will be tested. Spokeswoman Leigh Stidham said suppliers and brands cannot pay to be included on the latter list, but didn’t comment on “Buyer’s Picks”.Parents looking for independent recommendations can turn to toy lists produced by third-party reviewers such as Toy Insider and Toys, Tots, Pets \u0026amp More (TTPM). But in an era when customer reviews can be gamed and social media influencers push products without always disclosing that they’re getting paid, consumers sometimes struggle to distinguish between objective online recommendations and paid promotions.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe US law is murky about precisely what should be disclosed and when. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which enforces laws on deceptive advertising, issues general guidelines. A full-page magazine photo of a thirsty runner guzzling from a glistening bottle of Fiji water is so obviously an advertisement it doesn’t have to be disclosed. If the same water brand pays the magazine to publish what appears to be a news story about the health benefits of its product, it must be clearly labelled an advertisement so consumers aren’t confused.While federal regulators are taking a closer look at advertising these days, they can’t possibly monitor all the promotional activity out there. So the FTC occasionally cracks down to send a message, as it did in 2017 with letters to more than 90 influencers and marketers reminding them about the need to disclose paid promotions in social media. The spotty enforcement presents a big grey area for the toy industry.Amazon promotes security cameras that can be hacked to spy on youNew Amazon devices put Alexa inside glasses, a ring and your earsHow to get the best Amazon Black Friday deals this yearThe lists are a powerful negotiating tool for retailers, according to industry insiders familiar with the process. Toymakers are led to understand that if they buy marketing space on the lists they will get bigger orders, the people said. Sometimes manufacturers get better visibility if they agree to sell a product exclusively through the retailer, they said. Retailers include only toys on the list that they are actually selling.Lists are a fast-growing part of Amazon’s advertising business. Amazon holiday gift guides promoting toys, electronics and home goods combined to generate more than $120m in revenue in 2017, up about 40 per cent from the previous year, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg.What sets Amazon apart from other retailers is how much it charges for space on its toy page over the holidays. A narrow strip across the top of the web page costs $500,000 per month in November and December, up from $150,000 the rest of the year, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg. A billboard ad atop the toys page runs $300,000 per month, up from $75,000 the rest of the year.Similar spots atop Walmart’s toy page cost $180,000 in November and $132,000 in December. According to Comscore, Amazon generates about twice as much web traffic as Walmart, which could explain the discrepancy in pricing.Public Citizen, the watchdog group, in July lodged a complaint with the FTC about Amazon’s annual summer sale Prime Day, alleging the retailer didn’t do enough to help shoppers differentiate between paid promotions and genuine recommendations. The FTC confirmed receiving the complaint. The annual toy list presents similar concerns, Mr Weissman said.“When Amazon presents a top 100 toy list,” he said, “it’s a mistake to assume that shoppers understand this is just paid billboard space versus a list Amazon curated itself.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

While a deal has now been agreed firms are still unclear about what shape Brexit will take and how it will affect them.\u0026nbsp in\u0026nbspProperty and real estate businesses experienced the highest annual increase in distress of any sector covered by the research, in part because they have found it difficult to raise the cash needed to finance their operations.\u0026nbspJulie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, said: “With a considerable increase in the number of businesses suffering significant financial distress in the last three years there is growing frustration among businesses that they cannot plan for the future and the whole economy is lagging as a result.“Much investment is on hold as businesses have their hands tied by not knowing what the state of play will be post-Brexit and whether the agreements or contracts they currently have in place will still be valid following the expected withdrawal, which is contributing to stifled growth nationwide.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The more sponsors pay, the more products they can nominate to be on the list and the more prominently their own products will be featured on the popular website. Amazon aimed to sell at least $20m in sponsorships for this year’s list, the documents show. Amazon also published a summer toy list with lower sponsorship prices.It’s perfectly legal for Amazon to sell advertising on its site. It becomes a problem when the world’s largest online retailer tells shoppers recommendations are curated by experts but doesn’t disclose the money it gets from the toy industry, said Robert Weissman, president of the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen. Because consumers place more value on recommendations from independent sources, companies prefer to keep their financial involvement hidden, he argued.“They don’t write ‘paid ad’ on it because it completely changes how consumers perceive the information,” Mr Weissman said. “If the list is entirely or in part paid advertising, people have a right to know.”Amazon likened the payments it received to the money brands pay stores to be included in advertising circulars or to get prominent shelf space.In an emailed statement, the company said: “Every product on our annual Holiday Toy List, which features family gift ideas from new releases to customer favourites, is independently curated by a team of in-house experts based on a high bar for quality, design, innovation and play experience. We source product ideas from many places, including our selling partners who have an opportunity to nominate their best toys for the season and increase visibility of those toys.”Gift lists are a time-tested way for toy manufacturers to stand out in the critical holiday rush when busy parents are desperate for ideas. Toymakers are eager to appear on these lists because the companies generate about half their annual sales during the holiday season.Walmart charges toymakers $10,000 monthly per product to appear on its “Buyer’s Picks” toy list in November and December, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg. The company produces other lists, including “Top Rated by Kids”, which uses feedback from children who test and rate more than 100 toys in July. Walmart and its toy suppliers partner to determine which 100 toys will be tested. Spokeswoman Leigh Stidham said suppliers and brands cannot pay to be included on the latter list, but didn’t comment on “Buyer’s Picks”.Parents looking for independent recommendations can turn to toy lists produced by third-party reviewers such as Toy Insider and Toys, Tots, Pets \u0026amp More (TTPM). But in an era when customer reviews can be gamed and social media influencers push products without always disclosing that they’re getting paid, consumers sometimes struggle to distinguish between objective online recommendations and paid promotions.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe US law is murky about precisely what should be disclosed and when. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which enforces laws on deceptive advertising, issues general guidelines. A full-page magazine photo of a thirsty runner guzzling from a glistening bottle of Fiji water is so obviously an advertisement it doesn’t have to be disclosed. If the same water brand pays the magazine to publish what appears to be a news story about the health benefits of its product, it must be clearly labelled an advertisement so consumers aren’t confused.While federal regulators are taking a closer look at advertising these days, they can’t possibly monitor all the promotional activity out there. So the FTC occasionally cracks down to send a message, as it did in 2017 with letters to more than 90 influencers and marketers reminding them about the need to disclose paid promotions in social media. The spotty enforcement presents a big grey area for the toy industry.Amazon promotes security cameras that can be hacked to spy on youNew Amazon devices put Alexa inside glasses, a ring and your earsHow to get the best Amazon Black Friday deals this yearThe lists are a powerful negotiating tool for retailers, according to industry insiders familiar with the process. Toymakers are led to understand that if they buy marketing space on the lists they will get bigger orders, the people said. Sometimes manufacturers get better visibility if they agree to sell a product exclusively through the retailer, they said. Retailers include only toys on the list that they are actually selling.Lists are a fast-growing part of Amazon’s advertising business. Amazon holiday gift guides promoting toys, electronics and home goods combined to generate more than $120m in revenue in 2017, up about 40 per cent from the previous year, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg.What sets Amazon apart from other retailers is how much it charges for space on its toy page over the holidays. A narrow strip across the top of the web page costs $500,000 per month in November and December, up from $150,000 the rest of the year, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg. A billboard ad atop the toys page runs $300,000 per month, up from $75,000 the rest of the year.Similar spots atop Walmart’s toy page cost $180,000 in November and $132,000 in December. According to Comscore, Amazon generates about twice as much web traffic as Walmart, which could explain the discrepancy in pricing.Public Citizen, the watchdog group, in July lodged a complaint with the FTC about Amazon’s annual summer sale Prime Day, alleging the retailer didn’t do enough to help shoppers differentiate between paid promotions and genuine recommendations. The FTC confirmed receiving the complaint. The annual toy list presents similar concerns, Mr Weissman said.“When Amazon presents a top 100 toy list,” he said, “it’s a mistake to assume that shoppers understand this is just paid billboard space versus a list Amazon curated itself.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

While a deal has now been agreed firms are still unclear about what shape Brexit will take and how it will affect them.\u0026nbsp in\u0026nbspProperty and real estate businesses experienced the highest annual increase in distress of any sector covered by the research, in part because they have found it difficult to raise the cash needed to finance their operations.\u0026nbspJulie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, said: “With a considerable increase in the number of businesses suffering significant financial distress in the last three years there is growing frustration among businesses that they cannot plan for the future and the whole economy is lagging as a result.“Much investment is on hold as businesses have their hands tied by not knowing what the state of play will be post-Brexit and whether the agreements or contracts they currently have in place will still be valid following the expected withdrawal, which is contributing to stifled growth nationwide.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The researchers point to previous work by the OECD showing that some people with health issues or a disability would be able to work if arrangements such as flexible hours or remote work were an option.In contrast, UK government statisticians treat those two types of the “hidden” jobless as economically inactive rather than unemployed, without distinguishing why some people are not looking for work.“When the hidden unemployed are added to official unemployment statistics, the number of working-age jobless people not in education is estimated to jump from 4.6 per cent to 13.2 per cent,” the Centre for Cities said on Thursday.“This challenges the claim that Britain has experienced a job creation miracle in recent years.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Britain\u0027s Prime Minister Boris Johnson shake hands during a news conference after agreeing on a Brexit deal, in BrusselsA man walks his dog through the fallen leaves in Clarkes Gardens, Allerton in LiverpoolPolice officers carry away an activist as Extinction Rebellion protesters block a road with a caravan in central LondonQueen Elizabeth II sits with Prince Charles on the Sovereign\u0027s throne ahead of delivering the Queen\u0027s Speech at the State Opening of ParliamentGreat Britain\u0027s Joe Fraser competes on Parallel Bars during the World Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart, Germany.

The authors used that figure because other data in the report is also from 2017.In cities with weaker economies, such as Liverpool, Dundee and Sunderland, the jobless rate that includes the “hidden” unemployed reaches nearly 20 per cent, according to the report.“This research suggests that people in cities which have struggled to recover from the deindustrialisation of the 20th\u0026nbspcentury could be dealt a second blow as they are ill-equipped to respond to automation,” said Andrew Carter, the chief executive of the Centre for Cities.In another change from official statistics, the researchers excluded from their calculation of the overall unemployment rates people who are inactive by choice or for other non-economic reasons – specifically, students, early retirees and people looking after children, relatives or a home.“Being a student, retiring earlier and looking after family or home are not necessarily directly linked to the economic performance of the local area where people live and work,” they wrote.For example, most early retirees have probably left work because they can afford it, the authors note.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The mysterious, so-called \u0027Lausanne\u0027 Sunflowers – the first Arles Sunflowers painting – with turquoise background. It was created in the summer of 1886 at Van Gogh\u0027s studio at Arles, north of Marseille in Provence. It has not been show to the public since 1948. 1889, oil on canvas. This painting depicts the view from the window of Van Gogh\u0027s asylum room of Saint-Remy-de-Provence. It is one of the most recognised paintings in the history of Western culture.1889, oil on canvas. The most recognised of several iris paintings made by Van Gogh at the Saint Paul-de-Mausole asylum, in the last year before his death in 1890. 1889, oil on canvas. Van Gogh painted over 43 self-portraits, paintings and drawings over a period of 10 years. He wrote to his sister: \u0027I am looking for a deeper likeness than that obtained by a photographer\u0027 and to his brother: \u0027People say, and I am willing to believe it, that it is hard to know yourself. But it is not easy to paint yourself either. The portraits painted by Rembrandt are more like a revelation.\u0027Oil on canvas, 1890. This painting was completed in early May, when Van Gogh was suffering a severe relapse of poor health – two months before his death. It is based on a pencil drawing, \u0027Worn Out\u0027, from a series of studies he made of a war veteran in 1882.620 Cafe Terrace at NightOil on canvas, 1888. This work was the first in a trilogy of paintings that featured starlit skies, completed over two years. Van Gogh was enthusiastic about the painting and wrote to his sister: \u0027Here you have a night picture without any black in it, done with nothing but beautiful blue and violet and green, and in these surroundings the lighted square acquires a pale sulphur and greenish citron-yellow colour. It amuses me enormously to paint the night right on the spot... I find satisfaction in painting things immediately.\u00271888, oil on canvas. The five customers in the scene have described as \u0027three drunks and derelicts in a large public room... huddled down in sleep or stupor.\u0027 Van Gogh told his brother that the cafe owner, Ginoux, had taken so much money it was time to take his revenge by painting the place.820 Bedroom in ArlesOil on canvas, 1888. Three authentic versions of this painting were made, easily discernible from the different paintings on the right wall. Oil on canvas, 1888. This painting is currently at the National Gallery in London. It was completed after Van Gogh moved from the Hotel Carrel to the Cafe de la Gare at Arles, south France. 1885, oil on canvas. Van Gogh chose this deliberately tricky composition to prove himself as a figure painter, wanting to show the way \u0027they have tilled the earth themselves with these hands they are putting in the dish... that they have thus honestly earned their food\u0027. 1120 Road with Cypress and Star1890, oil on canvas. Also known as Country Road, this was the last painting Van Gogh made in Saint Remy, It is part of the large Van Gogh collection at the Kroller-Muller Museum at Otterlo in the Netherlands.1220 Starry Night Over the Rhone1888, oil on canvas. Another of Van Gogh\u0027s paintings of Arles at nighttime – painted at a spot on the bank of the Rhone a few minutes walk from the Yellow House, which he was renting at the time. 1888, oil on canvas. In a short space of time during his first weeks at Arles, Van Gogh painted some fifteen orchards, hoping they would sell well because his subject, the glorious blossoms of the flowering trees, had the power to \u0027cheer everyone up\u0027. 1420 Self Portrait with a Grey Felt Hat1887, oil on canvas. This self portrait is slightly unusual because Van Gogh\u0027s face is angled to face straight towards the observer. Most of them depicted the face as it appeared in the mirror he used, so the right side seen in the image was actually the left side of his face. 1888 - 1890, oil on canvas. Van Gogh loved flowering trees, which to him symbolised hope and new life. This painting was created to celebrate the birth of his nephew and namesake, the son of his brother Theo and sister-in-law Jo.This was part of Van Gogh\u0027s preparation for The Potato Eaters, where he attempted to paint a figure against the light. He struggled, telling his brother Theo: \u0027It\u0027s a difficult effect\u0027, yet he succeeded in a strong contrast with the almost-black head of the woman and the use of white for the window, which focuses the gaze mainly on the woman\u0027s hands. 1720 Peasant Woman Against a Background of WheatOil on canvas, 1890. This painting, one of several versions by Van Gogh, has exchanged hands several times and was bought by Stephen Wynn in 1997 for $47.5 million. Seven years later, it was sold to American investor Steven A Cohen for more than $100 million. Oil on canvas, 1889. In the cypress trees of Saint Remy, Van Gogh found beauty as regards lines and proportions, like an Egyptian obelisk. He was enraptured but also challenged: \u0027It\u0027s the dark patch in a sun-drenched landscape, but it\u0027s one of the most interesting dark notes, the most difficult to hit off exactly that I can imagine\u0027. 1888, oil on canvas. Art historians believe this is the only Van Gogh painting he managed to sell during his lifetime, and has been listed among his major works. It was sold in Brussels for 400 francs (about £3,000) to Anna Boch, an impressionist painter and art collector from Belgium, who was the sister of Van Gogh\u0027s friend Eugene Boch. 2020 Wheatfield with Crows1890, oil on canvas.Commonly regarded as Van Gogh\u0027s final painting (with some doubt from art historians due to lack of historical records). Around 10 July Van Gogh wrote to his brother Theo and wife Jo Bonger to say he had painted another three large canvases since visiting them in Paris the week before. Two of them, he said, expressed sadness and what he called \u0027extreme loneliness\u0027, but he also believed them to show the healthy and fortifying nature of the countryside. 1886, oil on canvas.

Sebastian Smee looks back at the work of Gordon ParksFive months after the inauguration of president John Kennedy, Gordon Parks, the famous photographer for Life magazine, found himself on a plane to Rio de Janeiro. As he cruised along at 30,000 feet, an immense thought pressed in: I am about to save a boy’s life.His name was Flavio da Silva, and he lived in a favela called Catacumba on the steep hillsides of Rio. Days earlier, the boy had written: “This is a dream, and I shall end by awakening.”\u0026nbspBut it wasn’t. It wasn’t a dream. It was his life.Though neither he nor Parks could have foreseen it, Flavio was about to become a pawn in a battle between two media titans: one in the United States, the other in Brazil. Both publications were trying to influence public opinion at a time when the ideological and geopolitical stakes felt frighteningly high.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

Fidel Castro’s grip on Cuba had tightened after the Bay of Pigs fiasco. Latin America looked vulnerable to a communist takeover. Life decided to launch a five-part series titled “Crisis in Latin America”. Parks, the first African American to work as a staff photographer at the magazine, was assigned to the second part.Brazil, like the US, had a new president, Jânio Quadros. Quadros inherited an economy in crisis. He implemented an austerity programme, of which the US approved. But when the United States offered $300m\u0026nbsp(£234m) in foreign aid in return for cooperating with US\u0026nbspopposition to Castro’s Cuba, Quadros rejected it. The offer, he felt, was an insult to Brazil’s autonomy. It was tantamount to a bribe.Life editors liked to script photo assignments in advance. Parks was told to go to the Rio favelas, “find an impoverished father with a family of eight to 10 children. Show how he earns a living. Explore his political leanings. Is he a communist, or about to become one?”They wanted Parks to round out the family shots with images providing some social context: ideally, a political rally in the favelas.Parks had been uneasy about the assignment from the beginning. He had his own ideas. But an ally at Life urged him to accept, saying: “Rio de Janeiro is a long, long way from Rockefeller Plaza. Who knows, you might just misinterpret your instructions?”The first thing was to find a suitable family. Parks went to the favelas on a steaming hot day in March 1961. He was accompanied by José Gallo, who managed the local bureau of Time Inc, Life’s owner. As they climbed up a “tangled maze of shacks”, Parks saw Flavio, who was carrying a 40-pound tin of water on his head and who – he would soon discover – suffered from severe asthma.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

His legs looked like sticks covered with skin and screwed into two dirty feet. He stopped for breath, coughing, his chest heaving as the water slopped over his shoulder and distended belly.”Parks had his subject. He met Flavio’s seven siblings in their home, high up the Catacumba hillside, and, that evening, his parents. Flavio’s mother, Nair, worked as a washerwoman. She was 35, and pregnant with their ninth child. His father, José Manuel, was 42. He had a kiosk selling kerosene and detergent.\u0026nbspMunizThe J Paul Getty Museum)Parks had travelled widely – including an earlier trip to Rio – but never had he seen such destitution. He and Gallo explained themselves and asked for permission to carry out their assignment. “You can photograph us,” José replied, eventually, “but you must show us in a good light.”“Just doing my job,” we journalists tell ourselves. The lives we affect, and sometimes rearrange, are rarely changed intentionally. We maintain this stance even when it feels suspiciously convenient, discharging us from the obligation to anticipate consequences.\u0026nbspThen again, some consequences are hard to anticipate.\u0026nbspParks finished his assignment, largely ignoring the instruction to focus on the father and his political leanings. Instead, he focused on Flavio and on Flavio’s brothers and sisters. He kept a diary of his days in the favela. He was there when the children woke up. He photographed them in the rudimentary kitchen. He even took them by car to Copacabana. The famous beach was just 15 minutes away, but they had never seen it, and Parks recorded their euphoric responses.\u0026nbspEach night he left the favela and returned, uneasy, to his room in Copacabana’s upscale Hotel Excelsior. Parks had grown up the youngest of 15 children and the victim of racist bullying. Now a parent himself, he couldn’t help but empathise with Flavio. He wrote of being “filled with confusion and guilt during my final days in Catacumba. Flavio, like thousands of other children, would die\u0026nbsp... I could not help compare the good fortune of my own children with the fate of these others”.But it wasn’t a lie.\u0026nbspPark’s photos appeared in the 16 June 1961, issue of Life under the heading, “Freedom’s Fearful Foe: Poverty.” You can see them in the first room of “Gordon Parks: The Flavio Story”, a riveting show at the Getty Museum in Los Angeles. The second, third and fourth rooms uncover the bewildering events that the photo essay set in motion.\u0026nbspParks belonged to a generation of photojournalists whose work could get massive exposure. He said he wanted his work “to draw people’s attention to the problems they show” and to play a role in effecting change. An admirer of President Kennedy, he hoped that the new president’s youth and progressive policies would have positive results. But he had seen firsthand, too, that the United States lacked credibility in Latin America. If it wanted to solve problems there, he realised, the United States needed first to “clean up its own yard”.Intimate, observant, poetically suggestive, Parks’s photos of Flavio and his family were the work of an artist. “Far from condescending, they utterly personalised ... and made intimate the tragedy of poverty,” Paul Roth wrote in the show’s terrific catalogue. (Roth’s essay is the source of much of the information in this story). They “punctured”, he said, Life magazine’s “conception of indigence as an abstract lure to an ideological foe” – communism.\u0026nbspParks’s photo essay was one of the most influential Life ever published. It provoked an enormous response from readers, who sent thousands of letters and unsolicited donations. When Life published excerpts from the letters in a subsequent issue, under the headline “A Great Urge to Help Flavio”, it included an appeal for more donations, which Life said it would use to move the Da\u0026nbspSilvas\u0026nbspto a modest new home and to seek medical treatment for Flavio.\u0026nbspParks flew back to Rio on 28 June to deliver the message. To his relief, Flavio’s parents needed no persuading to release Flavio to the care of a hospital in Denver. “Keep him in hospital as long as necessary but please bring him back cured and well,” his father said.\u0026nbspAt Parks’s hotel, Flavio had his first-ever bath (“The water was black,” Parks noted) and donned new clothes that Parks had bought for him. A team of people worked on getting Flavio a visa and on finding a suitable home for his family.The day came for the family to move out of Catacumba. Their story had spread, and a crowd gathered to watch. Parks, who was there to document the day, remembered a woman grabbing his shoulder and saying: “What about us? All the rest of us stay here to die!”\u0026nbspThat same night, Parks and Gallo drove Flavio to the airport,\u0026nbspand all three flew to the United States.In Denver, Flavio was treated at the Children’s Asthma Research Institute and Hospital. Life photographer Carl Iwasaki documented the first days of his life in Denver, including visits to the hospital, first days at school and a visit to an amusement park. The photographs of Flavio 2.0 – designed above all, it can seem, to make America feel good about itself – were published in the magazine’s 21 July issue.\u0026nbspThe repercussions of this intervention went beyond Flavio and his family. Editors at O Cruzeiro, an illustrated weekly in Brazil, took umbrage at Parks’s photo essay (which had appeared in a Spanish-language version of Life, distributed throughout South America).\u0026nbspO Cruzeiro had Brazilian nationalist leanings. Its editors objected to a high-circulation US\u0026nbspmagazine with an explicit political agenda coming to Brazil to point out problems that had not been solved in its own country.\u0026nbspTheir response was impudent, blunt and charged with chutzpah. They sent a photographer of their own, Henri Ballot, to New York City. After photographing the streets of impoverished communities in Spanish Harlem and on the Lower East Side, Ballot homed in on Puerto Rican immigrants Felix and Esther Gonzalez. They lived with their six children in a dilapidated, rat- and cockroach-infested tenement building on Rivington Street.\u0026nbspBallot’s photographs were published in the 7 October 1961 issue of O Cruzeiro. They revealed living conditions every bit as desperate as those of the Da Silvas. One photograph shows a child sleeping with three enormous cockroaches on his bare skin. Another shows a child with a bandage covering a rat bite on his forehead. O Cruzeiro rammed home its point by publishing some of Ballot’s New York images with insets showing Park’s original Rio images.\u0026nbspThe two magazines went to war, each accusing the other of staging its photographs – of, effectively, manufacturing “fake news”. And, as happens routinely in any polarised media environment, real people enduring real predicaments were reduced to pawns in a propaganda war.The ultimate guide to Rio de JaneiroHighway 61: Jessica Lange’s photography explores her midwestern rootsMeanwhile, in Denver, the transition proved tricky for Flavio. He struggled at school. But things slowly settled down. He learned English, adapted his behaviour and spent weekends with a Portuguese-speaking family, the Gonçalves. Over time, he had less and less contact with his family back in Rio. And when the treatment neared its conclusion after two full years, he was desperate to remain.\u0026nbspHe begged Parks and the Gonçalves to adopt him. Instead, in July 1963, Flavio returned to Rio, where he stayed briefly with his family before being sent to a boarding school in São Paulo. The schooling was arranged and paid for by Life.\u0026nbspParks maintained contact with Flavio after the boy’s return to Brazil, and in 1978, he published a book (Flavio) about the experience, which brought him back to Rio to gather material. Parks also visited in 1999 to film a documentary (Gordon Parks – Half Past Autumn). In each of those trips, the journalist saw that his subject’s struggles with poverty had never really abated.\u0026nbsp“As a photojournalist,” Parks wrote, with more than a tinge of melancholy, “I have occasionally done stories that have seriously altered human lives. In hindsight, I often wonder if it might not have been wiser to have left those lives untouched, to have let them grind out their time as fate intended.”Flavio himself, now retired from his job as a security guard, later reflected on the fact that, thanks to Parks, “people know more about my life than I do. I’m glad that I’m alive as a result ... (But) this story never made me feel either better or worse than anyone else.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The suits are then assembled – usually four months prior to flight.While there are no differences between a male and female spacesuit, female astronauts usually wear a smaller size.\u0026nbspBoth Ms Koch and Ms Meir are wearing medium-size suits, with Ms Koch’s spacesuit featuring red stripes.In a recent interview, Ms Koch spoke about the significance of this spacewalk, saying: “I think it’s important because of the historical nature of what we’re doing.“In the past women haven’t always been at the table.“It’s wonderful to be contributing to the space programme at a time when all contributions are being accepted, when everyone has a role.“That can lead in turn to increased chance for success. There are a lot of people who derive motivation from inspiring stories of people who look like them, and I think it’s an important story to tell.”Ms Koch, an electrical engineer, has been living in space since March while Ms Meir, a marine biologist, joined the ISS crew in September.Both are members of Nasa’s Astronaut Class of 2013.Ms Koch is more than 200 days into her mission and is slated to set a record for the longest single spaceflight by a woman – with an expected total of 328 days in space.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 220 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.120 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 220 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.“We continue to monitor it so we’re looking at the situation,” Peters said.“We’ll see those consumer-friendly ways to push on the edges of that.”Peters said the company didn’t have “big plans” to announce immediately.Password sharing has been a topic of interest in the streaming industry for some time.According to the research company Magid, 35 per cent of millennials\u0026nbspshare their passwords for streaming services, compared to 19 per cent of Generation Xers and 13 per cent of Baby Boomers.Overall, it is estimated by Magid that nine per cent of customers engage in password sharing. While that proportion doesn’t seem high at first glance, the practice can add up to millions of dollars.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 467 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.567 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1367 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1467 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1767 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2167 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2767 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2967 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3167 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs.On his debut album, the 24-year-old Collard mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto.   Dedicated covers the full, but generic, spectrum of relationships: dizzying love, lust, and break-ups. But whether she’s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger “Julien”, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single “Party For One” (“I’ll be the one If you don’t care about me Making love to myself Back on my beat”), the vibe remains positively jubilant.Getty Images for Spotify3667 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR“I don’t know where I’m going,” Tyler, the Creator begins on the song “I THINK”. “But I know what I’m showing.” The US artist’s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name. It’s been a long wait for Flying Lotus’s new album. In fact, the LA producer has been masterminding Flamagra for the past five years – snatching moments between collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly, directing and writing the comic horror movie Kuso, producing much of Thundercat’s Drunk and growing his Brainfeeder label.A heftier sound is never at the cost of melody, which shines through in Thomson’s vocals, the rest of the band’s backing falsetto, and the searing blues grooves stamped all over Future Dust. Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on “25”. “All Over Town” is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace.In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it’s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic. There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums.Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece.A revolving door of female vocalists (A-listers, indie darlings like Angel Olsen and unsung songwriters) deliver heartbroken lines over big, shiny beats and synths. The emotional cohesion the record loses in its shifting cast of singerssongwritersgenres it makes up in DJ-savvy textural variety. Help Us Stranger reaches all corners of guitar rock: funky Detroit garage (“What’s Yours Is Mine”) country soul (“Somedays (I Don’t Feel Like Trying)”) psych (a cover of Donovan’s “Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)”) blues and bluegrass (“Thoughts and Prayers”). A cornucopia of instrumentation is woven into its brisk 42-minute yarn.4367 Hot Chip - A Bath Full of EcstasyWhen Hot Chip achieved chart success with their second album, 2006’s The Warning, it seemed more like a happy coincidence than a sign they were conforming to current pop trends. Since then, they\u0027ve released a string of consistently great albums, from 2008’s Made in the Dark (featuring their only Top 10 single to date, “Ready for the Floor”) to this, their seventh and best record, A Bath Full of Ecstasy. The record frequently switches in tone: Banks can be both formidable and vulnerable, accusatory or filled with regret. “Gimme” demands sex and refuses to be shamed for it “Contaminated” mourns a toxic relationship that can’t be saved and “Stroke” is a bitter riposte to a man emulating the Greek figure Narcissus – laid over a funk guitar riff.4567 Mini Mansions – Guy Walks into a BarMikey Shuman shares vocal duties with Tyler Parkford his voice falls somewhere between the sleazy drawl of his QOTSA bandmate Josh Homme and Alex Turner’s more adenoidal tone on opener “We Should Be Dancing”. With tracks that frequently dart from sprawling, psychedelic pop to scuzzy post-punk and rock references, the record has a superb dynamic that holds the listener’s attention, while the band navigate through a single, tumultuous relationship. By the end of all that, you feel like they deserve a pint. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)Hackman’s debut album, 2015’s We Slept At Last, was a gentle, unprovocative affair –  though if you listened closely, the dark, sexual energy that convulses through her current sound was already there. Her second, I’m Not Your Man, was scuzzier and more explicitly queer – a road she continues down with Any Human Friend, a blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals.Frontman Corey Taylor, who had just emerged from a toxic relationship when recording this album, addresses feelings of belittlement and inadequacy with unflinching honesty and some of his best vocal work in years. Over the Celtic influences of “Solway Firth” (at one point, he seems to attempt some Cockney screamo) he issues a blistering riposte to the people he holds responsible for his negative mindset.There’s an increased anxiety, both corporeal and emotional, running through The Center Won’t Hold, a pent-up desire to break free from something – though they never seem quite sure what. “Disconnect me from my bones, so I can float, so I can roam,” sings Brownstein – her singular voice all yelps and creaks – on “Hurry On Home”. On “Reach Out”, Tucker begs, her voice a little sleeker than Brownstein’s but no less commanding, “Reach out and see me, I’m losing my head.” Quietly discordant piano ballad “Broken” pays tribute to Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused supreme court judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault: “Me, me too, my body cried out when she spoke those lines.”The overarching sound, production and instrumentation on Eve are outstanding. Produced by Rapsody’s long-time collaborator and mentor 9th Wonder, the record samples cuts from Herbie Hancock’s “Watermelon Man” (“Whoopi”) and Phil Collins’s “In the Air Tonight” (“Cleo”), offers a smooth R\u0026ampB joint with “Aaliyah” featuring the late singer’s ghostly backing vocals, and includes an interlude that is “an ode to the black woman’s body”. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as closer “Afeni”, are pure soul.  Swift has a habit of putting her worst foot forward. The album’s lead single, “Me!”, is peppy and poppy in all the wrong ways, a rictus grin of a song that rings hollow. Thank goodness that the rest of the album is nothing like that. Perky opening track “Forgot That You Existed” is a syncopated snigger, on which Swift shrugs off old grudges and breathes a sigh of relief in doing so. “Something magical happened one night,” she sings. “I forgot that you existed. And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn’t.” The title track, meanwhile, is poignant and unfussy, a reminder of Swift’s ability to distil infatuation into something specific and universal. (Alexandra Pollard)One could argue that there’s too much eclecticism here – that if this really is Crow’s final LP, she perhaps could have gone for something with a more singular sound. But then it wouldn’t be a Sheryl Crow album. She sings about the fear of the unknown on “Flying Blind” – her steely determination on this record has you believing that she’ll take the leap regardless. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)There’s more of a soul influence here – “HER Love”, the counterpoint to his 1994 track “I Used to Love HER”,  benefits from the gospel-like vocals of Daniel Caesar and Dwele, while “Memories of Home” skitters over a muffled bass and Common’s recollections of his past – including an incident where he was molested by a family member.This is Del Rey at her most assertive – personally, if not politically. Those hoping for a barbed protest record in keeping with Del Rey’s newfound public activism (last year she called President Trump a “narcissist” who “believes it’s OK to grab a woman by the pussy just because he’s famous”) will be disappointed. But it is gratifying to hear her take control. Aside from “Happiness Is a Butterfly”, that is. “If he’s a serial killer, then what’s the worst that can happen to a girl who’s already hurt?” she asks. Crikey.Assisted by veteran producer John Congleton (St Vincent, John Grant), he channels the spirit of David Bowie and Iggy Pop. He screeches over distorted “ooh oohs” via The Rolling Stones’s “Sympathy for the Devil” on opener “Calm Down aka I Should Not Be Alone”. “Transition from Nowhere to Nowhere” is sung in a Ziggy Stardust croon, while “Rated R Crusaders” shows Furman exploring his Jewish identity in the era of the IsraelPalestine conflict.If Brothers, their brawny album from 2010, turned the pair into serious rock contenders, then 2011’s El Camino cemented their reputation. Yet neither can claim to be as fiendishly catchy as Let’s Rock, a record that can scarcely sit still. On opener “Shine a Light”, the riffs are big, the momentum irresistible, with frontmanguitarist Dan Auerbach layering scabrous licks over ACDC-like chords. Backing singers Leisa Hans and Ashley Wilcoxson add texture to the grooving “LoHi”, while the languid “Sit Around and Miss You” is Stealers Wheels by way of the Deep South. Listen to the melodic harmonies in “Tell Me Lies” and it’s not just the lyrics that’ll remind you of Fleetwood Mac. The tones here are stark and bleak, compared to the claustrophobia of 2014’s Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes. You can hear his paranoia in the stuttering techno opener “Traffic”, which channels the heady grooves and pulses of electronic artist Floating Points (who, with his neuroscience background, seems like an entirely fitting reference point).There are plenty of surprises, like Swizz Beats singing on “Who Are You” against elegant violins that recall a Kamasi Washington composition. “Adult Film” features a gorgeous piano riff the Pete Rock-produced “The Art of It” has a delicious funk vibe “It Never Ends” comes full circle via a bright piano loop. Where a full album produced by Kanye West (2018’s Nasir) didn’t pan out – perhaps because West’s perfectionism was a bad fit for Nas’s penchant for procrastination – “You Mean the World to Me” sounds like it would have been a standout on that record had it not been abandoned on the cutting-room floor. Now it’s a standout on this album. For all the album’s eccentricities, the vibe is earnest fairytale rather than tongue-in-cheek – save for the sound of a strangled feline mirroring the lyrics “when you stepped on your cat” on “How Many Times”. Epic highlight “Electric Fire” and celestial album-closer “How Can a Head” capture Coyne at his most wistful. The latter is a wide-eyed, strings-laden gem, its childlike, questing lyrics poignant whatever your age. 5967 Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsGiven our current preoccupation with the Eighties, you could argue that Lost Girls is hardly breaking new ground – and yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. Three of her past albums have been nominated for Mercurys expect this to make it four. (Patrick Smith)6067 MUNA – Saves the WorldMUNA might not be a household name yet, but their influence runs through the charts like a stick of rock these days. Listen to Katy Perry’s summer smash “Never Really Over”, or Taylor Swift’s feminist clap back “The Man”, and you’ll hear the same dense, sticky synths and brawny beats that the emo-pop trio have been honing for the past three years. Their debut album, 2017’s About U, was raw, poignant and just the ride side of melodramatic, queering the mainstream, one sad-pop anthem at a time.6167 Pixies – Beneath the EyrieTales of witchy curses (“On Graveyard Hill”) and spirit reincarnation (“Daniel Boone”) feel like they’ve been dug up from ancient folklore, and capture classic-Pixies menace and ghoulish spirit. Over the album’s 12 tracks, ghostly organs and minor-key guitar-picked sequences help to conjure this dark, Gothic vibe. Yet for all its darkness, Beneath the Eyrie is brimming with the kind of melody that we expect from these indie-rock giants from the late Eighties. “Ready for Love” is a melancholy ballad with harmonising vocals from bassist Paz Lenchantin (Kim Deal’s now-permanent replacement), while lead single “Catfish Kate” – a tale of a woman battling a catfish in a river told by Black Jack Hooligan – is a rock hit in waiting. (Elisa Bray)6267 Jenny Hval – The Practice of LoveThis endlessly fascinating artist’s seventh, full-length, album The Practice of Love is just as considered as 2016\u0027s Blood Bitch, examining one’s role in humankind and on Earth, and probing that favourite of pop-song themes: love. But where the 2017 Nordic Music Prize-winning Blood Bitch was packed with visceral imagery and disarming sonics, the themes of The Practice of Love are encased in a warm cocoon of poetry, blissed-out circling synths and trance-like Nineties beats. (Elisa Bray)This is nomy at their most ambitious and pleasurably weird. As with the dreamy “Upset My Girlfriend”, which speaks of a man about to propose to his partner despite the fight they’re in, it’s an album stranded somewhere between pure joy and unexplainable sadness like slapping on a false smile despite feeling miserable, and recognising how much it helps in the moment. (Adam White)Listening on headphones, I was reminded of the late French designer Janet Laverriere. Born in 1909, she was still a powerful, playful force when I interviewed her for this paper in her eighties. She banged a cast iron radiator with a spoon to celebrate the echoes and curves of essential pipework: “I put all the hard plumbing on the outside. In kitchens, in bathrooms, I am feminist, evidemment!”Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)Why Me? Why Not. is enjoyably defiant, Gallagher embodying a settled and contented aura. “Gotta live for something besides yesterdays,” Gallagher snarls on “Be Still”. The downbeat “Once” forgoes easy Noel-bashing for a mournful glance at the years when the pair were still speaking (“I remember how you used to shine back then... but you only get to do it once”). And “Now That I’ve Found You” is even somewhat sickly-sweet in tone, a cheery tribute to his daughter Molly, whom he met for the first time when she was 21. “I know it’s late for lullabies, but the future is yours and mine,” he sings, alongside upbeat whoops and Radio 2-friendly guitars.The album takes a deep, contemplative breath on “Short and Sweet”, which is exactly what it promises, a Grace Jones-like ballad on which Howard’s voice takes precedent over inconspicuous guitar, and the background hisses like an old vinyl. On “He Loves Me”, she grapples with maintaining a relationship with God when she’s long since stopped going to church.  It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 467 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.567 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1367 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1467 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1767 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2167 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2767 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2967 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3167 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs.On his debut album, the 24-year-old Collard mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto.   Dedicated covers the full, but generic, spectrum of relationships: dizzying love, lust, and break-ups. But whether she’s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger “Julien”, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single “Party For One” (“I’ll be the one If you don’t care about me Making love to myself Back on my beat”), the vibe remains positively jubilant.Getty Images for Spotify3667 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR“I don’t know where I’m going,” Tyler, the Creator begins on the song “I THINK”. “But I know what I’m showing.” The US artist’s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name. It’s been a long wait for Flying Lotus’s new album. In fact, the LA producer has been masterminding Flamagra for the past five years – snatching moments between collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly, directing and writing the comic horror movie Kuso, producing much of Thundercat’s Drunk and growing his Brainfeeder label.A heftier sound is never at the cost of melody, which shines through in Thomson’s vocals, the rest of the band’s backing falsetto, and the searing blues grooves stamped all over Future Dust. Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on “25”. “All Over Town” is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace.In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it’s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic. There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums.Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece.A revolving door of female vocalists (A-listers, indie darlings like Angel Olsen and unsung songwriters) deliver heartbroken lines over big, shiny beats and synths. The emotional cohesion the record loses in its shifting cast of singerssongwritersgenres it makes up in DJ-savvy textural variety. Help Us Stranger reaches all corners of guitar rock: funky Detroit garage (“What’s Yours Is Mine”) country soul (“Somedays (I Don’t Feel Like Trying)”) psych (a cover of Donovan’s “Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)”) blues and bluegrass (“Thoughts and Prayers”). A cornucopia of instrumentation is woven into its brisk 42-minute yarn.4367 Hot Chip - A Bath Full of EcstasyWhen Hot Chip achieved chart success with their second album, 2006’s The Warning, it seemed more like a happy coincidence than a sign they were conforming to current pop trends. Since then, they\u0027ve released a string of consistently great albums, from 2008’s Made in the Dark (featuring their only Top 10 single to date, “Ready for the Floor”) to this, their seventh and best record, A Bath Full of Ecstasy. The record frequently switches in tone: Banks can be both formidable and vulnerable, accusatory or filled with regret. “Gimme” demands sex and refuses to be shamed for it “Contaminated” mourns a toxic relationship that can’t be saved and “Stroke” is a bitter riposte to a man emulating the Greek figure Narcissus – laid over a funk guitar riff.4567 Mini Mansions – Guy Walks into a BarMikey Shuman shares vocal duties with Tyler Parkford his voice falls somewhere between the sleazy drawl of his QOTSA bandmate Josh Homme and Alex Turner’s more adenoidal tone on opener “We Should Be Dancing”. With tracks that frequently dart from sprawling, psychedelic pop to scuzzy post-punk and rock references, the record has a superb dynamic that holds the listener’s attention, while the band navigate through a single, tumultuous relationship. By the end of all that, you feel like they deserve a pint. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)Hackman’s debut album, 2015’s We Slept At Last, was a gentle, unprovocative affair –  though if you listened closely, the dark, sexual energy that convulses through her current sound was already there. Her second, I’m Not Your Man, was scuzzier and more explicitly queer – a road she continues down with Any Human Friend, a blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals.Frontman Corey Taylor, who had just emerged from a toxic relationship when recording this album, addresses feelings of belittlement and inadequacy with unflinching honesty and some of his best vocal work in years. Over the Celtic influences of “Solway Firth” (at one point, he seems to attempt some Cockney screamo) he issues a blistering riposte to the people he holds responsible for his negative mindset.There’s an increased anxiety, both corporeal and emotional, running through The Center Won’t Hold, a pent-up desire to break free from something – though they never seem quite sure what. “Disconnect me from my bones, so I can float, so I can roam,” sings Brownstein – her singular voice all yelps and creaks – on “Hurry On Home”. On “Reach Out”, Tucker begs, her voice a little sleeker than Brownstein’s but no less commanding, “Reach out and see me, I’m losing my head.” Quietly discordant piano ballad “Broken” pays tribute to Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused supreme court judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault: “Me, me too, my body cried out when she spoke those lines.”The overarching sound, production and instrumentation on Eve are outstanding. Produced by Rapsody’s long-time collaborator and mentor 9th Wonder, the record samples cuts from Herbie Hancock’s “Watermelon Man” (“Whoopi”) and Phil Collins’s “In the Air Tonight” (“Cleo”), offers a smooth R\u0026ampB joint with “Aaliyah” featuring the late singer’s ghostly backing vocals, and includes an interlude that is “an ode to the black woman’s body”. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as closer “Afeni”, are pure soul.  Swift has a habit of putting her worst foot forward. The album’s lead single, “Me!”, is peppy and poppy in all the wrong ways, a rictus grin of a song that rings hollow. Thank goodness that the rest of the album is nothing like that. Perky opening track “Forgot That You Existed” is a syncopated snigger, on which Swift shrugs off old grudges and breathes a sigh of relief in doing so. “Something magical happened one night,” she sings. “I forgot that you existed. And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn’t.” The title track, meanwhile, is poignant and unfussy, a reminder of Swift’s ability to distil infatuation into something specific and universal. (Alexandra Pollard)One could argue that there’s too much eclecticism here – that if this really is Crow’s final LP, she perhaps could have gone for something with a more singular sound. But then it wouldn’t be a Sheryl Crow album. She sings about the fear of the unknown on “Flying Blind” – her steely determination on this record has you believing that she’ll take the leap regardless. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)There’s more of a soul influence here – “HER Love”, the counterpoint to his 1994 track “I Used to Love HER”,  benefits from the gospel-like vocals of Daniel Caesar and Dwele, while “Memories of Home” skitters over a muffled bass and Common’s recollections of his past – including an incident where he was molested by a family member.This is Del Rey at her most assertive – personally, if not politically. Those hoping for a barbed protest record in keeping with Del Rey’s newfound public activism (last year she called President Trump a “narcissist” who “believes it’s OK to grab a woman by the pussy just because he’s famous”) will be disappointed. But it is gratifying to hear her take control. Aside from “Happiness Is a Butterfly”, that is. “If he’s a serial killer, then what’s the worst that can happen to a girl who’s already hurt?” she asks. Crikey.Assisted by veteran producer John Congleton (St Vincent, John Grant), he channels the spirit of David Bowie and Iggy Pop. He screeches over distorted “ooh oohs” via The Rolling Stones’s “Sympathy for the Devil” on opener “Calm Down aka I Should Not Be Alone”. “Transition from Nowhere to Nowhere” is sung in a Ziggy Stardust croon, while “Rated R Crusaders” shows Furman exploring his Jewish identity in the era of the IsraelPalestine conflict.If Brothers, their brawny album from 2010, turned the pair into serious rock contenders, then 2011’s El Camino cemented their reputation. Yet neither can claim to be as fiendishly catchy as Let’s Rock, a record that can scarcely sit still. On opener “Shine a Light”, the riffs are big, the momentum irresistible, with frontmanguitarist Dan Auerbach layering scabrous licks over ACDC-like chords. Backing singers Leisa Hans and Ashley Wilcoxson add texture to the grooving “LoHi”, while the languid “Sit Around and Miss You” is Stealers Wheels by way of the Deep South. Listen to the melodic harmonies in “Tell Me Lies” and it’s not just the lyrics that’ll remind you of Fleetwood Mac. The tones here are stark and bleak, compared to the claustrophobia of 2014’s Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes. You can hear his paranoia in the stuttering techno opener “Traffic”, which channels the heady grooves and pulses of electronic artist Floating Points (who, with his neuroscience background, seems like an entirely fitting reference point).There are plenty of surprises, like Swizz Beats singing on “Who Are You” against elegant violins that recall a Kamasi Washington composition. “Adult Film” features a gorgeous piano riff the Pete Rock-produced “The Art of It” has a delicious funk vibe “It Never Ends” comes full circle via a bright piano loop. Where a full album produced by Kanye West (2018’s Nasir) didn’t pan out – perhaps because West’s perfectionism was a bad fit for Nas’s penchant for procrastination – “You Mean the World to Me” sounds like it would have been a standout on that record had it not been abandoned on the cutting-room floor. Now it’s a standout on this album. For all the album’s eccentricities, the vibe is earnest fairytale rather than tongue-in-cheek – save for the sound of a strangled feline mirroring the lyrics “when you stepped on your cat” on “How Many Times”. Epic highlight “Electric Fire” and celestial album-closer “How Can a Head” capture Coyne at his most wistful. The latter is a wide-eyed, strings-laden gem, its childlike, questing lyrics poignant whatever your age. 5967 Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsGiven our current preoccupation with the Eighties, you could argue that Lost Girls is hardly breaking new ground – and yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. Three of her past albums have been nominated for Mercurys expect this to make it four. (Patrick Smith)6067 MUNA – Saves the WorldMUNA might not be a household name yet, but their influence runs through the charts like a stick of rock these days. Listen to Katy Perry’s summer smash “Never Really Over”, or Taylor Swift’s feminist clap back “The Man”, and you’ll hear the same dense, sticky synths and brawny beats that the emo-pop trio have been honing for the past three years. Their debut album, 2017’s About U, was raw, poignant and just the ride side of melodramatic, queering the mainstream, one sad-pop anthem at a time.6167 Pixies – Beneath the EyrieTales of witchy curses (“On Graveyard Hill”) and spirit reincarnation (“Daniel Boone”) feel like they’ve been dug up from ancient folklore, and capture classic-Pixies menace and ghoulish spirit. Over the album’s 12 tracks, ghostly organs and minor-key guitar-picked sequences help to conjure this dark, Gothic vibe. Yet for all its darkness, Beneath the Eyrie is brimming with the kind of melody that we expect from these indie-rock giants from the late Eighties. “Ready for Love” is a melancholy ballad with harmonising vocals from bassist Paz Lenchantin (Kim Deal’s now-permanent replacement), while lead single “Catfish Kate” – a tale of a woman battling a catfish in a river told by Black Jack Hooligan – is a rock hit in waiting. (Elisa Bray)6267 Jenny Hval – The Practice of LoveThis endlessly fascinating artist’s seventh, full-length, album The Practice of Love is just as considered as 2016\u0027s Blood Bitch, examining one’s role in humankind and on Earth, and probing that favourite of pop-song themes: love. But where the 2017 Nordic Music Prize-winning Blood Bitch was packed with visceral imagery and disarming sonics, the themes of The Practice of Love are encased in a warm cocoon of poetry, blissed-out circling synths and trance-like Nineties beats. (Elisa Bray)This is nomy at their most ambitious and pleasurably weird. As with the dreamy “Upset My Girlfriend”, which speaks of a man about to propose to his partner despite the fight they’re in, it’s an album stranded somewhere between pure joy and unexplainable sadness like slapping on a false smile despite feeling miserable, and recognising how much it helps in the moment. (Adam White)Listening on headphones, I was reminded of the late French designer Janet Laverriere. Born in 1909, she was still a powerful, playful force when I interviewed her for this paper in her eighties. She banged a cast iron radiator with a spoon to celebrate the echoes and curves of essential pipework: “I put all the hard plumbing on the outside. In kitchens, in bathrooms, I am feminist, evidemment!”Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)Why Me? Why Not. is enjoyably defiant, Gallagher embodying a settled and contented aura. “Gotta live for something besides yesterdays,” Gallagher snarls on “Be Still”. The downbeat “Once” forgoes easy Noel-bashing for a mournful glance at the years when the pair were still speaking (“I remember how you used to shine back then... but you only get to do it once”). And “Now That I’ve Found You” is even somewhat sickly-sweet in tone, a cheery tribute to his daughter Molly, whom he met for the first time when she was 21. “I know it’s late for lullabies, but the future is yours and mine,” he sings, alongside upbeat whoops and Radio 2-friendly guitars.The album takes a deep, contemplative breath on “Short and Sweet”, which is exactly what it promises, a Grace Jones-like ballad on which Howard’s voice takes precedent over inconspicuous guitar, and the background hisses like an old vinyl. On “He Loves Me”, she grapples with maintaining a relationship with God when she’s long since stopped going to church.  The group were on the show to perform “Flowers”, a cover of the Sweet Female Attitude single, which appears on the forthcoming compilation album Garage Classic.The track marks the first official release by the band since they once again assumed the Sugababes name after several years recording as Mutya Keisha Siobhan.The group recorded an ultimately unreleased album in 2011 and 2012, but only managed to release one official single, “Flatline”, in 2013.Sugababes, who became infamous for their endlessly rotating band members, at one point featuring no vocalists from the band’s original line-up, achieved six Number One hits during their heyday.Their most successful singles included “Push the Button”, “About You Now”, “Overload” and “Freak Like Me”.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They were winning ever greater support but, somehow, still appearing to lose the battle.Record-breaking crowds had turned up for the Put It To The People rally in the capital in March. Increasing numbers of politicians and experts – and Gary Lineker – were throwing their weight behind the idea. An online poll asking for Article 50 to be revoked had just topped 4 million signatures.Yet somehow, despite all this – or perhaps because of it – this mass movement was being characterised, with some success, as representing the views of only a minor metropolitan elite.It did not, its critics said, understand the midlands or the north. It did not understand small towns. It did not understand the working class.“Have these people ever even been in a Wetherspoon’s?” Martin Daubney, now a Brexit Party MEP, asked me in Wolverhampton in April. Raise the idea of a second vote in there, he added, “and see how it goes down”.By May, on the back of such claims, his group had won 29 out of 71 seats at the European Parliament elections – including almost half of those available in England outside of London.Created with Sketch.Best pictures from Final Say Brexit march Show all 32Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with

for a second referendum was strong all over the UK, and certainly so in the north.Government can’t ‘play Santa’ with firms after no deal, report warnsSketch: Brexit is in the hands of the idiots, and

It wasn’t true then and it isn’t true now. So we realised we needed a platform to challenge that myth.”And now, as campaigners prepare for what could become one of the biggest marches ever held in the capital on Saturday, it is perhaps safe to say that challenge has been met and that myth busted.More than 175 coaches will make their way to London from towns and cities across the UK, full of people asking to be asked again. Underground users have been told to expect large crowds around St Pancras, King’s Cross and Euston – the stations that connect London to the north and Midlands.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In supposed\u0026nbspLeave-strongholds, such as Sunderland, Derby and Newport, hundreds turned out. In Brighton, 5,000 supporters attended a beach-front Let us Be Heard rally. In Leeds, campaigners cheered as footballing legend Peter Reid dispensed with niceties: “shambollocks”, he said when asked to describe the last three years in a single word.“There was a feeling that yes, big London marches are massively important in helping create real political pressure but we also had to be out in the regions showing what we already knew: that there was mass support for a second vote – everywhere,” says Mr Keith. “This idea that Sunderland, for instance, had become a no-go area if you wanted a second vote – it’s just a lie. Sunderland is going to be one of the cities hit hardest by Brexit and there is huge hunger there for a chance to have another say.”Curbishley, Alastair Campbell, Peter Reid and Garreth Carvell during June’s People’s Vote rally in Leeds (PA)Among the activists at the Stadium of Light that Sunday afternoon was Louise Brown, a committee member with North East for Europe. “A lot of us will stand on stalls in town centres and it’s hard work because not everyone agrees with what we’re trying to do,” she told me as the day’s audience filed past, all EU flags and Bollocks to Brexit stickers. “But when you come to an event like this, it drives home how devastating leaving the EU will be and how important what we’re doing is.”The devastation spoken about differed from region to region and depended on what calamitous no deal revelation had been brought into the open that particular week but concerns generally riffed on similar themes: economic deprivation, job losses, an NHS vulnerable to predatory privatisation, a country less able to protect itself against terrorism, climate change and cyberattacks.“The scale of just how bad a no deal would be was emerging constantly over the summer,” says Mr Keith. “And I think that naturally brought more people to us. What we noticed anecdotally was that we were getting more and more Leave voters supporting us because there was a growing realisation that the Brexit we were told would happen in 2016 never really existed.”At each event, an ever-rotating list of political speakers – Tories, Labour, Anna Soubry – were joined by comedians, sports stars and business people.\u0026nbspThe Derby rally may be the only place Michael Heseltine and Margaret Beckett have ever shared a stage. Almost certainly, these events showed footage of the one time you’ll ever hear erstwhile Coronation Street star Denise Welch ponder international import and export tariffs. “Where are all these trade deals?” she wondered in a video message.Boris Johnson’s Brexit plans receive crushing blow from DUPIn Edinburgh, Alistair Campbell played Ode To Joy on the bagpipes, while in Leeds John Barnes compared Brexit to a bad VAR decision. Let’s replay it, he suggested, and get it right.“I think there’s no doubt this is one of the most varied political campaigns in recent decades,” says Richard Brooks, the 27-year-old co-founder of For our Future’s Sake, ostensibly the movement’s youth wing. “The people who come can’t be pigeon-holed – they’re young, old, middle class, working class. It goes across so many spectrums. We’ve had events where there’s been a 20-something Northern Irish apprentice on stage with someone who’s been a member of the Tory party for decades. We’re uniting people constantly.”Critics would say, of course, that these are still relatively small numbers.A ComRes poll published on Wednesday showed that, overwhelmingly, people wanted to honour the results of the original referendum. Fifty-four per cent of those questioned said the UK should leave the EU. Only 32 per cent said it should not. All regions had a Leave majority\u0026nbsp– save for London, Scotland and Northern Ireland. In a similar survey carried out by BMG between July and October, fewer than one in five people said they wanted another referendum.And, yet, as the political landscape has changed on an almost daily basis – the first northern rally was held way back in the era when Theresa May was still prime minister before Yellowhammer was revealed when the prorogation of parliament was not yet a twinkle in Dominic Cummings’ eye –\u0026nbspand politics has mutated, something remarkable has happened. Support for a People’s Vote – a consistent, accessible plan to move things forward – has kept gaining momentum.Hilary Benn – who, whatever happens next, may come to be considered one of his generation’s few politicians of stature – came on board, despite previous reservations. Every opposition party, bar one, has now said they favour a second vote. Labour’s position may still remain ambiguous under Jeremy Corbyn, but, if rumours are to be believed, it won’t stay that way if chancellor John McDonnell gets his way.And now, on Saturday: a new London march, which organisers say could attract up to 1.5 million people from all corners of the UK.“Only an idiot would dismiss that as anything other than a mass movement,” adds Mr Keith. “I compare this to a journey where it’s not just the landscape that’s constantly changing but even the road you’re driving on keeps moving about.“But if you have your destination in mind – a final vote – it’s just a case of keeping your sights steady, holding your nerve and doing your best to get there. I believe we’re closer now than we ever have been. The country needs it. One way or another, it’s the only possible way out of this mess.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The researchers point to previous work by the OECD showing that some people with health issues or a disability would be able to work if arrangements such as flexible hours or remote work were an option.In contrast, UK government statisticians treat those two types of the “hidden” jobless as economically inactive rather than unemployed, without distinguishing why some people are not looking for work.“When the hidden unemployed are added to official unemployment statistics, the number of working-age jobless people not in education is estimated to jump from 4.6 per cent to 13.2 per cent,” the Centre for Cities said on Thursday.“This challenges the claim that Britain has experienced a job creation miracle in recent years.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Britain\u0027s Prime Minister Boris Johnson shake hands during a news conference after agreeing on a Brexit deal, in BrusselsA man walks his dog through the fallen leaves in Clarkes Gardens, Allerton in LiverpoolPolice officers carry away an activist as Extinction Rebellion protesters block a road with a caravan in central LondonQueen Elizabeth II sits with Prince Charles on the Sovereign\u0027s throne ahead of delivering the Queen\u0027s Speech at the State Opening of ParliamentGreat Britain\u0027s Joe Fraser competes on Parallel Bars during the World Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart, Germany.

The authors used that figure because other data in the report is also from 2017.In cities with weaker economies, such as Liverpool, Dundee and Sunderland, the jobless rate that includes the “hidden” unemployed reaches nearly 20 per cent, according to the report.“This research suggests that people in cities which have struggled to recover from the deindustrialisation of the 20th\u0026nbspcentury could be dealt a second blow as they are ill-equipped to respond to automation,” said Andrew Carter, the chief executive of the Centre for Cities.In another change from official statistics, the researchers excluded from their calculation of the overall unemployment rates people who are inactive by choice or for other non-economic reasons – specifically, students, early retirees and people looking after children, relatives or a home.“Being a student, retiring earlier and looking after family or home are not necessarily directly linked to the economic performance of the local area where people live and work,” they wrote.For example, most early retirees have probably left work because they can afford it, the authors note.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It shows how a black market has been set up to off the most wretched in Russian society – using unregulated social media platforms to connect buyers to sellers via unscrupulous agents.\u0026nbspThe exact scale of the illicit trade is unclear, but evidence points to an unhealthy demand. Every month, the most popular Russian search engine registers 85,000 searches of the term “buy a child” in Moscow alone.\u0026nbspFor some, no doubt, it is a way to cut out three years of red tape and complicated adoption law. Often, the women involved are in desperate situations. But the opportunities for abuse of the most horrific kind are also obvious.\u0026nbspThe prices quoted depend on the region and the child’s characteristics, the publication said. Non-Slavic children from the more underdeveloped regions of the Russian Federation are the least expensive. Slavs in Moscow and St Petersburg – the most. Court documents showed that in one case just 5,000 roubles (£60) swapped hands.\u0026nbspThe journalists were offered well-worked schemes to get around social services checks.\u0026nbspVladimir Putin to sign bill banning Americans from adopting RussianFor suspicious-looking men like the imagined Pavel Sarychev, the suggested route was getting the father of an abandoned baby to sign off on the adoption. For women, other options were suggested, including switching babies in the maternity ward under the watchless eyes of corrupted nurses.\u0026nbspThere was little need to worry about being caught, agents said. With corrupted people in all parts of the system working for them, not even a DNA test would stop the trade going through.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But convictions for child trafficking remain rare – only three dozen such cases in the last eight years.\u0026nbspCritics of the Kremlin’s approach to children’s safety also bring attention to the introduction of the infamous Dima Yakovlev law in 2013.\u0026nbspNamed after a Russian child who died in the United States after his adoptive father accidentally left him in a car, the measures banned all adoptions to the United States. Hundreds of adoptions were cancelled at the last minute, with children and families left in the lurch. The Kremlin said it was only acting in the interests of children, but with terrible geopolitical relations in the background, they convinced few people.\u0026nbspThe seemingly unfazed adoption agent quoted by The Insider emphasised this was one law he would never break.\u0026nbspHe would never work with foreigners, he said – out of principle.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But, perversely, it may have also cost them the game.There are not yet specic punishments in place for breaking the racism protocol but Uefa’s Disciplinary Regulations  state: “If a match cannot take place or cannot be played in full, the member association or club responsible forfeits the match.”So it could have been perceived as a home win for racism and defeat for England.Uefa’s woefully inadequate response to a litany of previous racist incidents meant it was left up to Tyrone to make a call.Cool-headed England manager Gareth Southgate later said all his players wanted to carry on.If Uefa bosses had spines, they should have abandoned the game and given the points to England.Players should be able to walk out on a game where mass racism is taking place without risk of forfeiting the match. If nations such as Bulgaria can’t police and steward racist fans, then Uefa should force them to play behind closed doors or exclude them from tournaments until they can.In the build-up to the game, the Bulgarians pointed out the English could hardly occupy the moral high ground.There have been a number of reports of players being racially abused at games here this year and stars are regularly subjected to racism on social media.I have reported on England games for The Sun for the past  years and the dedicated fans are a friendly and welcoming bunch.Most use the opportunity of foreign games for sight-seeing and immersing themselves in local culture.Yet a “stag do” following of younger yobbish fans attaches themselves to Three Lions away games in party destinations such as Amsterdam, Porto and Prague.Booze and drugs are swilled down and continental squares echo to the sound of Ten German Bombers and splintering glass.A minority of fans it may be, but they are still intimidating to locals and families. We have our own house to get in order, too.After the final whistle Tyrone stated that he believed England’s collective decision to stay on was the correct one, saying he was “proud of how we dealt with it”.Dignied in stark contrast to the far-Right nasties who had hounded him.His cry of “Hey, did you hear that ” must surely now be acted upon in football’s corridors of power.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I cant give up the responsibility my father has given me and worked so hard for. The Guzman era continues to reign.“I want to make it very clear, theres no successor to my father, not just anyone can fill these shoes. He is still giving orders.”The -year-old was the second of four children born to El Chapo’s first we María Salazar Hernández, but older brother Cesar was killed by a rival cartel in .A self-confessed playboy, Ivan constantly gloats about his party lestyle, surrounding himself with scantily-clad girls and posting pictures from exclusive nightclubs.On one picture, in which he is boarding a private jet, he wrote: “I distract myself with women, but always on top of business.”In another, the bachelor – dubbed “Ivan the Terrible” by one follower – crouches down in front of a silver Mercedes hugging a pet lion.Recent posts include a bottle of £ liqueur Don Julia , a £, Jeep Cherakona and a fleet of supercars with the caption Always thank God for everything he gives you.The swaggering crime boss is rivalled in his luxury lestyle by younger brother Jesús Alfredo Guzmán Salazar – known as Alfredo or Alfredito.Alfredo recently posted a picture of himself flying a private jet with the caption: “Ok plebs, Im leaving you behind.”He also posts pictures of his pet lion cubs with one sitting on the boot of his red Bentley.Like his brother, Alfredo is fond of weapons and posts pictures of guns as well as heavily-armed members of the cartel.In one, he holds an arsenal of weapons with the caption, “for those who want to step onto my turf, I give them my army”.In another, he took a gun to the cinema, posting a picture of popcorn and a gun with the caption, “Ive got my toy with me in case anyone wants to make things exciting.”Alfredo was indicted for drug trafficking in Illinois in  and in , he was kidnapped by a rival drug gang who held him at gunpoint in a restaurant before marching him out.El Chapo’s daughter, Alejandrina Gisselle, is staunch defender of her cocaine baron dad and once boasted, “Im beautul because of my mother, intelligent because of my father, and a murderer because of me”.In the week her father was sentenced, Alejandro launched her new line of clothing and accessories named El Chapo , featuring his face on ious T-shirts and tops.On her website she insists her father is “a friend of everyone,” a “willing leader” and “a humble orange vendor with many goals and great ambition.” El Chapos second marriage, to wanted drug runner Griselda Lopez Perez, produced three boys, Edgar, Ovidio and Joaquin.Although not his oldest son, Edgar was his fathers chosen successor but was kept out of the family business until he finished school.But at , against his fathers wishes he travelled to Chicago on a drug deal and on his , attempted to sneak back into his fathers compound in Culiacan in a red SUV.The car was reportedly fired on by El Chapos own men, as it wasnt recognised, and took  bullets, killing Edgar and his friend instantly.Like his half-brothers, Joaquin - who calls himself El Chino Anthrax - loves the high le.In one Twitter post he is pictured with Paris Hilton with the hashtag El Chinos babes.Another has a picture of a gold-plated, diamond-encrusted hand gun and he often posts pictures of himself clubbing as well as his pet tiger chained to the back of his luxury x.In contrast, Ovidio - whose arrest caused the eruption of violence this week - prefers the quiet le.His Twitter profile says: I am not into luxury and sports cars, I like horses and fine roosters.But he continues to be heavily involved in the cartel and often posts messages from the ranch in Culiacan showing a semi-automatic in his SUV, with messages like: Lets go to work because there are dogs that want to get to the ranch.He recently retweeted a message from the family business suggesting El Chapo still pulls the strings.It read: That the lord is confined does not mean that he does not continue giving orders.El Chapo’s third we , former beauty queen Emma Coronel Aispuro, married El Chapo in  and stood by him at his trial.The mother of twin eight-year-olds, Emali and Maria Joaquina, she frequently posts pictured of exotic holidays on her Instagram and recently threw a lavish barbie-themed party for the girls.Calornian woman Rosa Isela Guzmán Ortiz is widely believed to be El Chapos oldest daughter, born from an affair with a woman in Jalisco, according to his mother.Rosa has claimed that El Chapo visited her in the US twice and writes to her from prison.But, judging by his childrens lestyle, theres still plenty to go round. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" Credit: AP:Associated PressEl Chapos weand twin daughters at the New York trialOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I used to think doctors were second only to God. That belief was shattered when I was told by the NHS that saving my daughter was ‘futile’.”Tafida had a rare condition, known as an AVM, which caused a massive bleed inside her head in February.She was on le support at the Royal London Hospital in East London since suffering the brain injury, and health bosses tried to block attempts to take the little girl to the Gaslini children’s hospital in Genoa.Today Shelina and her husband Mohammed share with Sun readers the inside story of Operation Tafida, the mercy flight that this week had the world watching and praying.Our exclusive pictures, taken by her relieved parents, show Tafida staring at her mum on the intensive care ward at Gaslini.As doctors carried out a series of tests on the little girl, Shelina gently explained to her: “We have come to Italy, Tafida, where your journey begins. The people here will make you better.”Shelina, who turned  on Thursday, added: “I’m sure it won’t be long before we can get her out of bed and into a wheelchair and begin to stimulate her brain by showing her new things.“All she has seen since she first became ill is a hospital ceiling.“The most important thing for me is that all the nurses and doctors here are so positive.“Tafida’s story has been carried on the news in Italy for weeks and it seems everyone knows who she is and wishes us well.“I know I am leaving my family behind and it will be a completely dferent way of le for us, but I also know in my heart that this is where she will begin to get better.“I always said that the miracle would comeshe was given time. Here, she has time to improve.“We can wait as long as it takes. I have the best present I could ever wish for here in this hospital. The doctors are so positive and are willing her to get better.“A massive weight has been lted from our shoulders.”Scans of Tafida’s vital organs taken in the last few days by medics in the intensive care ward show her heart and lungs have not suffered from spending eight months on le support in London.In the coming days she will have a tracheostomy operation that will free her from being attached to a machine. She will no longer have to have a breathing tube in her nose.Her dad Mohammed said: “This journey to Italy has given us hope, hope that Tafida will have the best le that we can give her. We are convinced that with the treatment available at the Gaslini hospital, Tafida will improve dramatically in the coming weeks and months.”He praised his we, a solicitor, for directing the court battle against the NHS.Mohammed, , a construction consultant, said: “Nobody expected us to win. But we did and she is now in a place where she will be looked after and her le cherished.” The Italian doctors believe that what Tafida needs most is time for the brain to repair itself.While many of the medics at the Gaslini have worked in the NHS and speak good English, Genoa is not a major tourist area.Mohammed, who like Shelina does not speak any Italian, has been communicating with locals through a translation app on his phone to buy food and supplies for their stay.Tomorrow, some of their family will fly in to visit Tafida and the following week her -year-old brother will stay there for half-term.Since June, the family was locked in a battle with doctors at the Royal London Hospital, in Whitechapel, who wanted to turn off their daughter’s le support machine.But two weeks ago they won a landmark case at the High Court when a judge decided they could take their daughter to Italy.After days of planning, the mercy flight to collect Tafida almost did not get off the ground because Genoa was hit by torrential rain and gale-force winds.But just before lunchtime on Tuesday, a Lear jet air ambulance from Italy finally landed at Biggin Hill airfield in Kent.Dr Andrea Moscatelli, director of the Gaslini’s neonatal department, Stefano Pezzato, an expert in resuscitation, and nurse Monica Faggiolo, a specialist in mercy flights, took a private ambulance to the Royal London Hospital, which is run by Barts NHS Trust, to get Tafida.On the sixth-floor ward where she had been confined to her bed, the Italian medical team prepared her for the two-hour flight to Genoa.Barts Trust chief medical officer Dr Alistair Chesser said: “This has been a dficult few months for everyone involved.“I pay tribute to our staff for maintaining high standards of care with the utmost professionalism throughout this period. I am also grateful to the Gaslini team for their co-operation and skill in managing the transfer. Above all, we wish Tafida and her family well for the future.”Mohammed had said his goodbyes on Monday night and was already on a scheduled flight to Genoa with four huge cases packed with enough children’s clothes for the six-month stay and dozens of toys from well-wishers.On the plane he flicked through dozens of photos of his daughter before and after her illness. One of his favourites is a picture taken in the snow the year before outside their home in Plaistow, East London.Shelina finally left the hospital at .pm on Tuesday without even being able to properly thank the nurses who had cared for her daughter round the clock.She was in a car with family, including her -year-old son.On the tarmac at Biggin Hill, Shelina was reunited with her daughter, who was already on board the plane. She said: “Tafida was laying on a stretcher looking around her at everything that was going on.”Two hours later the jet appeared out of the sunset above Genoa’s Christopher Columbus airport and landed. As the plane taxied towards a huddle of waiting dignitaries, Mohammed was whisked to the plane in a minibus.Delighted to see his daughter safely on Italian soil, he left it to the medics to transfer her to a waiting Red Cross ambulance.Tafida was already in bed when Shelina and Mohammed later walked into the intensive care ward.A large group of hospital staff, including the ambulance men in their red suits, stood outside the door like expectant parents waiting for news. Shelina said: “She was fully awake, looking around, thinking ‘Where am I ’.”The future is still uncertain as the family face medical bills of £, on top of court costs of £,. Their appeal for funding has so far raised £,.Her parents will soon be taking their daughter outside to enjoy the warmth of the sun.Mohammed said: “A new chapter has begun for all of us, with hopefully a happy ending when we can take her home.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is remarkable that Boris Johnson is so close to winning this vote.When the Chief Whip Mark Spencer went through the numbers with the Cabinet on Wednesday, he had the Government succeeding by one vote with the support of the DUP’s ten MPs. But they are now voting against the deal.When Cabinet met again yesterday afternoon, Spencer “scrupulously avoided giving any numbers”, according to one of those present.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, who did the numbers for Boris’s leadership bid, said the Government couldn’t afford to lose more than two or three of its own Brexiteers. But with them on board, victory was possible.Without the DUP’s support, which is gone despite Boris Johnson’s belief that they can still be won round, the Government will need the backing of  MPs who were elected as Labour in .Cabinet opinion is split on whether they can get this number. One Cabinet minister intimately involved in the bid to woo Labour MPs thinks they are going to get there.“We’re going to win”, this Secretary of State declares. Others in Cabinet are more sceptical though.One tells me: “I’ll believe it when I see it”, pointing out that Theresa May thought she would do better with Labour MPs on every meaningful vote than she actually did. This minister’s view: “We’re going to fall just short.”Another group whose position is key is the  MPs who lost the Tory whip for voting for the Benn Act, which forces the Government to ask for a Brexit extensionMPs don’t back this deal. Downing Street calculate that  of this group will vote for the deal.Three Cabinet ministers — Nicky Morgan, Michael Gove and Robert Buckland — met with a chunk of the  on Thursday afternoon. One of those present tells me: “It wasn’t great. Hammond was particularly dficult.”This source says that watching Hammond, he thought that the former Chancellor “can’t see past that hatred” he has for Boris Johnson.I suspect that most of the  will back the Government, most of them want a deal and many of them want the whip back so they can stand at the next election.As one senior Cabinet minister tells me: “Voting for us is the way back in. We need to be able to count on them for the WAB”, the Withdrawal Agreement Bill.Then, there are those so-called Spartans — the Tory Brexiteers who wouldn’t vote for May’s deal even at the third time of asking. Downing Street is confident that pretty much all of them will back the deal.I understand that David Trimble, the former Northern Ireland First Minister who won the Nobel Peace Prize for the Good Friday Agreement, will attend this morning’s meeting of the hardcore Brexiteer European Research Group to explain why the deal is in line with the Good Friday Agreement, contrary to what the DUP say.Today, MPs have a chance to honour the referendum result. To vote for a deal that will deliver a smooth, orderly and amicable departure from the EU.If they vote to block it, then they will have shown that they are just determined to stop Brexit and that all those promises to respect the referendum result were made with their fingers crossed behind their backs.THERE’S always a twist with Brexit and today’s is something called the Letwin amendment.If it passes, it would prevent a clean up or down vote on the deal. That would have to wait until a second reading on Tuesday.Instead, the Letwin amendment would force Boris Johnson to request an extension regardless and the Commons would only vote on his deal once all the relevant legislation is through.As one exasperated ally of the PM puts it, the vote on the Letwin amendment is “almost as signicant as the vote itself”. The Letwin amendment is just a preview of the parliamentary mischief to come.As the Government tries to get the Withdrawal Agreement Bill through, MPs will try to add all sorts of things to it.Expect amendments trying to compel the Government to negotiate a customs union with the EU or follow EU rules on things even after Brexit.In a way, these amendments won’t matter. They won’t change the content of the treaty the UK has signed with the EU.But they will impose legal obligations on the Government. Now,Boris won a majority in an election, he could override these changes.But the danger for him is that Nigel Farage and the Brexit Party could attack him in the campaign for having passed a deal that has had all these horrors added to it.WE may have a sensible chief medical officer at last.After Sally Davies – who wanted a ban on eating and drinking anything other than water on public transport – we have Chris Whitty.In his first public outing this week, he argued that people should exercise more, stop smoking and keep talking to slow the aging process. Sensible, commonsense advice.Whitty, who was the force behind tackling the  Ebola outbreak, is a pleasant change from the lecturing of the past few years.NUMBER  are oddly relaxed about whether the deal passes today or not. One of the Prime Minister’s most trusted confidants describes it as, “an each-way bet for Boris”.Why, because – in his words –voters, “learn on Saturday that the deal has been voted down, who are they going to blame: Boris or the MPs They’ll blame the MPs”. Inside Number , they think thatBrexiteer MPs back the deal and Remain MPs block it, they can have A CAKE AND EAT IT election strategy.In Labour Leave-supporting seats in Wales, the West Midlands and the North East, they can say: “Your MP is blocking Brexit, vote for us to get it done.”While in the seats they are defending against the Liberal Democrats that are more nervous about Brexit, they can say: “Back us and the UK will leave in a smooth and orderly fashion:This two-pronged message would be electorally potent. It would give the Tories a chance of winning their biggest majority in more than  years.Number  are determined to keep trying for an election despite the Commons blocking it. One source jokes that MPs will be “voting on an election every day until they crack”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That’s not an easy tightrope to negotiate, and this wasn’t a simple tour for Kate or William for so many reasons.Obviously, security has had to be incredibly tight, far more so than even they are used to, and both of them will have had a full, and possibly rather alarming, briefing from British security services.Then there’s the bittersweet emotional impact on William, who has been retracing his mother’s footsteps during this trip.Diana visited Pakistan several times as a guest of the now Prime Minister Imran Khan and his then we Jemima Goldsmith. She also fell deeply in love with Pakistani-born surgeon Hasnat Khan, and the country and its people always held a special place in her heart.William would have felt very close to his mum as he reconnected with Imran Khan and then went to the same cancer hospital in Lahore that Diana visited just a year before her death.Kate paid her own tribute with a series of stunning outfits subtly taking inspiration from Diana. It’s at times like these that William must miss his mum, and all credit to him for being able to remember her with love and affection, rather than sorrow and trauma.The show-stopping moment for me was when the royal couple emerged from a highly decorated tuk tuk for a glittering reception in Islamabad.Kate was wearing the most stunning emerald gown I think I have ever seen.It was Oscar red carpet-worthy, andthere aren’t copies on the high street for our Christmas parties very soon I will not be best pleased.She looked equally gorgeous a couple of days later playing cricket while wearing a cream shalwar kameez and white trainers.Kate has quietly and effectively emerged as the Queen’s top asset in the Royal Family.Camilla will obviously never have anything like the same respect and affection as Her Majesty, but skipping a generation, Kate has all the attributes to be a very effective Monarch one day at William’s side. She’s bright, beautul and has a big big heart.Since becoming a mum of three, Kate is a much more confident charity ambassador and public speaker, and she’s developed a real connection with all of the children she meets, putting them at ease and making them smile.If the Royal Family is to survive it will all be down to this quiet but determined woman. It’s a heavy burden to place on such slim shoulders, but Kate is more than up to it.THE late Leah Bracknell might have had terminal cancer, but she lived le to the full.The Emmerdale star, who played Zoe Tate for  years and whose death was announced this week, laughed, loved and seized the day.She didn’t do many interviews, but came in to talk to me on my show a couple of years ago after her diagnosis.Leah was funny, brave and determined not to be defined by her illness. She described herself as a “cancer rebel” and we were overwhelmed with ­messages of support and respect for this remarkable woman.She lived and died on her own terms and will be sadly missed.It will be incredible to have the teeniest, tiniest idea of what incredible people such as Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and our own Helen Sharman and Tim Peake experienced.For a lelong space geek like me, who watched the moon landings and wanted to be part of the crew of Star Trekthis is the trip of a letime.Will tell you all about it when I’m back.WHAT the hell do these clowns calling themselves environmental “warriors” hope to achieve by targeting hard-working people trying to get to work in the morning Scenes on the London Tube this week were deeply disturbing and frightening, andExtinction Rebellion don’t get a grip, someone is going to get seriously hurt – or even killed.At least they have admitted it was a spectacular own goal to pick on the eco-friendly electric underground, especially during rush hour.They know full well such stupidity has alienated many potential sympathisers.Violence can never be condoned, but I completely understand the sheer frustration of men and women who just wanted to get to their jobs on time, and who took action by pulling a demonstrator off the roof of a train as he kicked out.At one point it was like a chilling scene from a horror film.Most of us agree we need to take action to reverse the effects of climate change before it’s too late, but these sorts of daft demos are not the way to win hearts and minds.As well as being disruptive for the sake of it, such inflammatory actions are potentially extremely dangerous.Believe me, there IS such a thing as bad publicity and although we might be talking about Extinction Rebellion, we aren’t discussing the importance and far bigger picture of global warming.I just don’t expect to see such toxic scenes in the UK, and far from being “warriors”, these idiots are best described as another word beginning with W. And I think we all know which one that is.There are many twists and turns, but suffice to say Arnie is back with some hilariously deadpan zingers, the special effects are in a league of their own, andyou don’t shed a tear at the end you are an unfeeling terminator machine.SCOTT MITCHELL is one of the loveliest men in all of the world. He is having to watch his beloved we Barbara Windsor slowly dissolve in front of his eyes due to the s****y disease that is Alzheimer’s.He has been by her side every step of the way and is now full-time carer for a woman who was once the epitome of independence and the le and soul of the party. This week Scott confessed that he feels “racked with guilt”he leaves his beloved Barbara alone even for a few hours.Scott is fiercely protective of the woman he adores and so patient when the illness has her confused and endlessly repeating herself. He and Barbara have raised thousands of pounds for Alzheimer’s charities as well as vital awareness of the disease.I really just want to give Scott a massive hug, tell him he’s doing a brilliant job and he has absolutely nothing to feel guilty about. Obviously It’s desperately sad that our Barbara is going through such a hellish time, but she struck gold when she met and married her Scott.Vile trolls sending death threats to head judge Shirley Ballas after Radio  DJ Dev was booted off the show last weekend really need to take a long, hard look at themselves.You might have vehemently disagreed with their decision and thrown your popcorn, crisps and prosecco at the TV – or was that just me  – when Dianne and Dev danced their last, but can we just hold on and try to put it all into perspective  It’s a wonderful, warm, fuzzy show that is supposed to be pure entertainment.What in the name of Len Goodman is going on when a couple being voted off a TV show ends up causing such pain and distress to a lovely woman like Shirley Strictly stupid, silly and sad.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But we all know the votes on that legislation will be tight.“The PM has a strategy, I fully accept that. Its that he wants to say to any waverers it’s my deal or no deal, vote for the implementing legislation or we crash out.

been such a sticking point Follow our live blog for latest updates from Saturdays emergency Commons sitting to vote on Boris Johnsons Brexit dealThe Irish backstop is essentially a safety net that would prevent the reintroduction of a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit.Under the agreement negotiated by Theresa May, the UK would enter a transition period after officially leaving the EU during which it would remain a member of the bodys economic zones, namely the single market and the customs union.This would give the Government time to agree the details of our new trading relationship with the European Union and businesses time to adjust with minimal disruption.The backstop would only come into effect once the transition period ends, before all the details of the new relationship had been worked out.In the event the backstop came into force, Northern Ireland would remain a member of the single market until a trade agreement had been reached to keep the border effectively invisible.That would mean goods crossing the Irish border would not be subject to checks for customs or product standards.The whole of the UK would also remain in a common customs territory with the EU, meaning there would be no tarfs, quotas, rules of origin or customs processes applied to UK-EU trade.The arrangement would keep the Northern Irish border open and minimise economic damage, but would also mean the UK would temporarily have to go on following the EUs rules and regulations without having a say in deciding them.The near-invisibility of the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland was a major achievement of the peace process that brought the Troubles to an end.Communities on both sides of the border worry that theof border checks could revive social, cultural and religious ides that have been fading in recent decades.During the Brexit negotiations, the European Union listened to the Irish government about what theof a hard border would mean, and has insisted that any withdrawal agreement should include a backstop.The backstop became a major sticking point when Theresa May was trying to get parliament to back the withdrawal agreement she had negotiated.Many Conservative MPs refused to vote for Theresa Mays deal because, were the backstop ever to come into force, it would leave the UK without a vote in deciding the EUs rules and regulations but still temporarily subject to them.The DUP, a Northern Irish unionist party that currently has  MPs in the House of Commons, refused to accept the backstop because it might leave Northern Ireland in a dferent customs arrangement to the rest of the UK.It was also feared that the backstop could remain in place indefinitely, which could make it dficult for the UK to strike its own trade deals with other countries outside the EU.Boris Johnson twice voted against Theresa Mays deal in Parliament, in part because he objected to the backstop, but decided to back it the third time May put it before the Commons.He repeated his criticism of the backstop while running for the Conservative leadership, and since becoming Prime Minister has said he would not agree a deal that included a backstop.He has said the backstop could be replaced by alternative arrangements to avoid the need for physical checks on the Irish border, though hasnt specied what those arrangements would be.Boris Johnson has opposed the backstop saying it is antidemocratic and could trap the UK in the EUs customs territory.Under the Prime Ministers plans, checks would take place away from the actual border.He has suggested that physical checks would only be required on a small proportion of trade and most checks would take place on the premises of the trader.This would be similar to the arrangement Norway and Sweden have and allow inspectors from each others jurisdictions to carry out checks anywhere on all of Ireland.Mr Johnsons plans have some similarities to the backstop idea.Northern Ireland would continue to follow EU regulations on areas such as agriculture, food safety and industrial goods, while the UK would not be obliged to.But with Mr Johnsons idea Northern Irelands Executive and Assembly would have to approve following the single market arrangement.Then Stormont would have to decide whether or not it wanted to continue following the rules or side with the UK every four years.On October , , the PM unveiled his five-point plan to end the Brexit deadlock.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said the latest Brexit proposals from Mr Johnson do not fully meet the agreed objectives of the backstop.A spokesman for the Irish government said a conversation between the two leaders  was constructive and useful but added there was more work to be done.Mr Varadkar indicated that he would study the proposals in further detail, and would consult with the EU in the coming days.A spokesperson for Fianna Fail said the plans were not realistic and fall very far short of what is required.Labour leader Brendan Howlin said it was hard to see how the Ireland-specic Brexit proposals could workthe UK departs from EU standards and rights.Our journalists strive for

For the first time since , Parliament is sitting on a Saturday to consider Boris Johnson’s controversial Brexit withdrawal agreement. The vote could be a total damp squib after MP Oliver Letwin tabled an amendment that will force a delay, win or lose - which many expect will narrowly win. That prompted No to threaten to pull or sit out the vote to avoid handing a symbolic victory to the expelled Tory and his Labour allies.Ironically, that will mean Boris Johnson has to request a delay to the October  deadline by pm tonight. Today’s vote was already on a kne edge as victory hinged on just a few Labour MPs in Leave seats. Last night Boris Johnson unveiled a last-minute offer on workers’ rights after his deal watered them down. But it was slammed by Labour’s leadership and the TUC as not worth the paper it’s written on. Jeremy Corbyn vowed to defeat the Prime Minister, saying Labour could not back a deal that was even worse than Theresa Mayaposs - which was rejected three times by MPs.

Phil and Vikki Kemp were unable to go on their luxury honeymoon to the Dominican Republic after consuming the treacherous food at their luxury wedding reception in Warwickshire. A pregnant mum and eight-year-old girl were among the  wedding guests struck down by the bug after the wedding in October  , reports Birmingham Live. Catering company Galloping GourmetLtd pleaded guilty to two breaches of health and safety at Cannock Magistrates Court today and were fined £, and told to pay court costs of £,. Mr Mark Jackson, prosecuting on behalf of Lichfield District Council, said the environmental health department was contacted by Mrs Kemp two days after her wedding saying guests had been complaining of suffering from gastric illness symptoms including nausea, diarrhoea and abdominal pains. One man had been hospitalised.    Investigations traced the cause of salmonella from a hog roast which hadnapost been cooked to a temperature beyond  degrees which would have killed off salmonella. When environmental health inspectors visited the premises days later they discovered food out of date, mould in the fridges, and raw meat chopping boards were being mixed with other foods. Mr Christopher Russell, representing Galloping GourmetLtd, said: The company has no previous convictions and has a five star rating at its other nine sites. Further improvements and safeguards have been made to ensure this never happens again. The company would like to apologise for what happened to Mr and Mrs Kemp and their wedding guests. Kevin Grego, district judge, said: This had a devastating affect on Mr and Mrs Kemp on their wedding day. In total  guests were affected by salmonella poisoning. Records involving the hog roast were not proper, in fact fraudulent. The hog roast should have been heated to over  degrees but it wasnapost and this caused salmonella to be present.    In a statement released by solicitors Irwin Mitchell, Mr Kemp said: “The wedding had been a really fantastic day and everyone had enjoyed it so much but I couldn’t believe it when I started to feel unwell. It got to the point where I had to go to a local walk-in centre and after tests I was told I had salmonella – I just couldn’t believe it. “My illness lasted around  days all in all, but the symptoms were so bad that we had no option but to cancel our honeymoon to the Dominican Republic. I was totally devastated and we never got any money back from the tour operator or insurer in relation to it. “We did go away eventually, but this was obviously an extra cost on top of everything we had already paid. It was heartbreaking. Other guests affected by the illness problems have gone on to suffer issues including irritable bowel syndrome and psychological conditions as a result of what they have been through. Phil added: “News of today’s prosecution is very welcome and I hope that it is an outcome that caterers across the country pay attention to and learn from.

She broke with royal tradition that tended to dictate a visiting royal would do little more than receive bouquets from the kids and smile while retaining a regal, dignied posture and facial expression. The memory created in the people they met was more one of having seen a very special, high-status person. Diana’s techniques of self-lowering, such as diminishing her own status, signals to make people feel at ease allowed both Kate and Meghan to reach out to children at their own level instead. Mirroring techniques    Both Kate and Meghan employ some very clever mirroring techniques with the children they meet to allow for a more natural and less over-awed response. Meghan’s tour even involved some mirroring with her clothing, opting for denims and casual wear rather than a more formal, regal look. Once she learns the steps of the dancing the girls are doing in these clips she mimics their steps with a lack of inhibition to allow them all to be enjoying the same experience at the same time. Kate dips down to the same level as the smaller children she is meeting and we can see her mimicking their ‘baby wave’ rituals, with a low, childlike wave ritual as she approaches and leaves them. Status-swapping    Kate and Meghan both lower their own status and power signals to raise the confidence levels of the children they meet. Meghan approaches the dancers with a head-tilt and slightly shy smile, carefully watching and eye-checking the dancers before picking up their steps. She allows them to teach her and in both these clips she is taking her learning seriously, putting the power in the hands of the children. Kate is seen playing with some children at a table and again she is watching them and appearing to learn from then rather than the other way round. When she approaches the group of children that are standing to meet her she immediately uses self-diminishing techniques to lower her own status with them, pulling her arms into her body and lowering to their height. All this body language self-lowering would have the effect of boosting the young childrens’ confidence.

Bamber, , has found a phone log he says proves he did not shoot parents Nevill and June, model sister Sheila “Bambi” Caffell, and her six-year-old twin sons Daniel and Nicholas in August . Bamber is serving a full le tarf for the massacre at White House Farm in Essex. His legal team say a police record referring to a call made by Bamber on the night of the White House Farm massacre in  proves he was not there at the time and could form the basis of an appeal. They say it backs up the theory that Bamber’s sister Sheila Caffell, , murdered their parents Nevill and June, both , then shot her own sons, twins Nicholas and Daniel, six, before killing herself.    Bamber’s lawyer Mark Newby said: “The evidence strongly suggests the chain of events could not have been what the prosecution alleged.” The phone call evidence forms one element of a huge bundle Bamber’s team will soon submit to the Criminal Case Review Commission. The previously unseen police document appears to back up Bamber’s story that two calls were made to police on the night of the murders, one from his father and one from him after Nevill rang saying Sheila had “gone crazy”. At his trial, the prosecution said only one call was made to police – from Jeremy Bamber at .am from the crime scene, White House Farm in Tolleshunt D’Arcy, Essex. But the new document describes a call to police from Jeremy Bamber timed at “approx .am”. His legal team argue it shows Bamber could not have made the .am call from the farm and ed to his home . miles away in Goldhanger to make the second call.    The “.am” note came from an interview with a PC Myall, of Essex Police, during the Dickinson Inquiry into the force’s handling of the case after Bamber’s conviction in November . The note was found by Bamber among thousands of police documents released to him in . PC Myall is noted as telling Dickinson: “We received a telephone call at the P.Stn .The officerat CD Controlwas on the phone and told us that he was relating information to us and still had the informanton the other telephone.”  The trial judge had instructed the jury to disregard Bamber’s claims that he had called police from his home at .am. And prosecutors told the trial Bamber had invented the call from Nevill to lay the blame on schizophrenic Sheila, known as Bambi when she worked as a model. Bamber was convicted by a - majority of murdering his family to claim a £, inheritance. He was initially sentenced to five le sentences, to serve a minimum  years, but that was increased to a whole le tarf in . The Mirror revealed in  how lost phone logs showed it was Nevill who called police at .am.  A further record submitted to the Criminal Case Review Commission in  showed a .am call to police from Jeremy Bamber. But the CCRC ruled the .am call was noted in error and that there was just one call, from Jeremy not Nevill, made at .am from White House Farm scene. The new “.am” note is said to prove the existence of the second call. ITV last week announced a drama about the murders next year, with Freddie Fox as Bamber, who is in Wakefield jail, West Yorkshire.Bamber was famously pictured with girlfriend Julie Mugford, , struggling to contain his grief walking behind his parents’ coffins at their funeral. After Julie found he had cheated on her, she told police Bamber had talked of hiring a hitman to kill his parents.  A blood-stained silencer was also found at the farm by Bamber’s cousin. Bamber’s team say they now have evidence of two silencers examined by police, both believed to contain blood that could belong to Sheila or now-deceased cousin Robert Boutflour. They say a forensic report has been given to the CPS about this evidence. Bamber believes police always had evidence that would have cleared him, but failed to disclose it at his trial, his first appeal in  or second in . Between  and , Bamber made three CCRC submissions in a failed attempt to get his case back to the Court of Appeal. He has also made appeals against his whole le tarf.

Mike Thomas created the fallout shelter, capable of withstanding a bomb  times bigger than Hiroshima, to protect his loved ones. The  square foot cavern had  inch thick concrete walls and enough food and water to sustain his family for a month. Mr Thomas built it in  when tensions between Russia and the West were at their peak. He said at the time: I built the shelter because I was concerned about the threat of a nuclear attack. Who knows what will happen in the future  It wouldnapost surprise methere a terrorist nuclear attack within the next  years. aposaposThe room is incredibly strong and has everything you need inside. If the worst did happen it is exactly where you would want to be.The man, who worked as an electrical engineer, became concerned at the nuclear threat when he served as a member of the Royal Observer Corps, Plymouth Live reports.   He built the shelter, which took six months to complete and cost £,, to keep his family safe at their home in Kingswear Road, Brixham. The bunker, which did not require planning permission because it is underground, has two entrances: a shaft from the kitchen or through a fake wardrobe in the study. Both entrances are protected by huge steel blast doors and there is also an emergency exit in case the main doors are welded shut by the blast. The shelter, which has six bunk beds, has its own ventilation system and power supply with a diesel-powered generator and numerous batteries.  Its floors are covered with carpets and plywood sheets line the walls. The temperature inside remains a constant C. The hideaway is lined with angle girders filled with hundreds of tons of concrete and steel reinforcing bars to create walls up to  inches thick. It features a ,-litre water tank, toilet, a small hand basin, and a phone line. Mr Thomas also stocked the bunker with enough tinned and dried food to feed his partner and son Daniel for a month.    Other facilities include a TV and DVD player, a microwave and a range of board games and books to pass the time. The man designed the shelter to ensure it would withstand an atomic bomb attack on the nearest potential military target, the Royal Naval College at Dartmouth less than two miles away. In  he was selling up so he could downsize to a smaller property, and because he no longer believed a nuclear attack was imminent. He said at the time: When I built the bunker I was a young man with my whole le ahead of me. I wanted to make absolutely sure my family was safe.

Describing it as the most horric day, the tragedy happened in  when the tired mum, from Chesterfield, Derbyshire, fell asleep while feeding Arthur at night.When she woke up in the early morning hours, her baby was leless and nothing could be done to save the newborn, who died of sudden infant death syndrome , also known as cot death, DerbyshireLive reports.In the following days, she wouldto the hospital mortuary to cuddle his cold body, and she has since gone on to have another son.    Ms Woodruff is now appealing for parents not to co-sleep with their babies. She said: It was the most horric day and I felt asI were living in some kind of cruel nightmare.” None of it made sense or seemed fair. The ambulance ride on the way to the hospital was the most awful experience ever - by the time we reached Sheffield Childrenaposs Hospital, he was pronounced dead.    It was later confirmed that Arthur had died of SIDS, the sudden, unexpected and unexplained death of an apparently healthy baby. Arthuraposs death sent Ms Woodruff into a spiral with days that were dark and desperate. She said: The grief did strange things to me, but a few magical things happened to me in the following days. I went to see Arthur every day in the mortuary at the children’s hospital before his funeral.  My family members told me that I should probably stop going so much, and so I had a break for two days from visiting him and cuddling his cold body. I knew he was gone but I still needed to be near him. The mum said she will never get over Arthuraposs death, but in the passage of time she has found it possible to move on and come to terms with her grief. She said: It gets easier over time. But you should never expect to be your normal self right away.  Ms Woodruff told how she was overwhelmed with joy when Arthur was born and she saw his first smile. She said: I just couldn’t believe it. Most days I would just stare at him. It was love at first sight.” After the babyaposs death, family and friends supported her through the worst time of her le. She said: Arthuraposs dad was really good. I know at times I could get upset and act badly to those around me.  To the family and friends of someone who is suffering from this, try to understand that this person is upset and might not act like themselves. She has since gone on to have another boy, Henry, who is now aged two and the spitting image of his late brother. In that time she has come to think that her tragic experience happened for a reason and she has set out to support other parents and bring a warning to mums and dads. The NHS says more than  babies in the UK die suddenly and unexpectedly every year in a tragic phenomenon sometimes known as cot death. The term Sudden Infant Death Syndromeis used to describe the sudden, unexplained death of an apparently health baby, usually within the first six months of its le.The NHS infants born prematurely or with a low birthweight are at greater risk, and SIDS is slightly more common among baby boys. SIDS usually happens when a baby is asleep, which is how it came to be known as cot death. The NHS says there can be contributing factors, such as a parent smoking, a minor illness or breathing obstruction. There is also a link between co-sleeping and SIDs, and the NHS recommends not sharing a bed with your baby. NHS tips for ways parents can reduce the risk of SIDS:Do not smoke while pregnant or after your baby is born Do not sleep on a bed, sofa or armchair with your baby especiallyeither you or your partner smoke, drink or take drugs Do not let your baby get too hold or cold. The room temperature should be C-C with lightweight bedding Place your baby on their back while they sleep Let them sleep in the same room as you for the first six months Ensure their sleep environment wonapost cause your baby to become tangled in bedding Use a mattress thataposs firm, flat, waterproof and in good condition Place your baby in the feet to foot position with their feet touching the end of their cot, Moses basket or pram Keep your babyaposs head uncovered - their blanket should be tucked no higher than their shoulders Breastfeed you babyyou canIf youaposre worried about your baby at any point, see your GP or call NHS  for advice.

An NHS Grampian spokeswoman said: We are currently working with partners to investigate a single case of measles in an adult. Measles is a highly infectious viral illness which causes a range of symptoms including fever, coughing, and distinctive red-brown spots. The infection is easily spread and you can catch measles through direct contact with an infected person, or through the air when they cough or sneeze. Measles is most common among young children, but anyone who has not been fully immunised can catch it. The safest and most effective way of preventing measles is the measles-mumps-rubellavaccine. Two doses of MMR vaccine are required to ensure full protection. We would encourage everyone to make sure their vaccinations are up to date. Itaposs never too late to get vaccinated. You can check with your GP practice to find out what vaccinations you may be eligible for. Captain John Strathearn, operations director for Serco NorthLink Ferries, said: We are following NHS protocols and instructions. We are working closely with the NHS, which is informing all relevant passengers and crew to ensure they have the required information.

Despite the cruel insults, Sophie is determined not to let the medical issue define her. The East Dunbartonshire, Scotland teen has spoken publicly about her experiences in the hope others can draw strength from it.    Itaposs been so dficult, especially in my younger years, she said. The pain and suffering that came with thinking about what my diagnosis would mean for my future was overwhelming and made me feel like I had absolutely no control over my le. I was bullied at school quite badly. It was really tough. People from my school trolled me anonymously through chat websites, calling me things like aposfat thighsapos and aposfat legsapos. It affected me a lot mentally. You get that way where you think no-one likes you and people think you’re embarrassing because of the bag. I eventually learnt just to get on with it and accept that my bag is now part of my le. Having left her dficult school years behind her, Sophie is now studying at childrenaposs nursing at Edinburgh Napier University.   She recently shared her experience with a bladder bag through a Facebook post.She wrote: I have realised that it is not something I should be embarrassed by. Le is too short to have others decide your strength. Going through everything I have been through has also made me realise who you really need in le. I went through my teenage years reaching out to people who aren’t in my le now, because when you grow up you realise who truly cares and who is really there for you. My disability has only made me stronger through the years.

success in the league at Livingston.They drew - at home to St Johnstone and Hibs and - with Hearts in the Betfred Cup quarter-final before losing - on penalties – with the most disappointing result being the -

In terms of the result against Rangers that was a huge disappointment.“That was the worst result we’ve had since I’ve been at the club.“When you have a performance like that and a result like that there is always going to be criticism.“I think you have to accept that as an Aberdeen player. The expectation is high and you will get criticised and rightly so – I think people were entitled to have a pop at us after that performance and result.“It was a time for the players to look at themselves in terms of how we approached that game.“We showed a response against Hibs and certainly the way the game went with some decisions against us, a - draw with nine men wasn’t a bad result.“Before the game, with Hibs struggling a bit, we wanted to win the game. But the way it panned out I think we can take positives from that.“We know that our performances and results can improve a lot and we’re looking to do that.“Having been through a dficult spell, we’re not in a bad position.“We would love to still be in the League Cup and we were a last-minute equaliser away from being in the next round.“But we’re not in a terrible position given the sticky spell we have gone through.”As Aberdeen captain, Lewis feels a responsibility to try to lt the team after frustrating results.But the former Cardf, Peterborough and Blackpool custodian says there are others in the Pittodrie dressing-room who can help the recovery after poor results.He added: “After disappointing results you try to pick the lads up.“Everyone is going to be disappointed after poor performances and poor results.“It’s tough in the following week to put that behind you and you have to keep it in mind.“You know that it wasn’t acceptable and you need to improve – but you also need to focus on the next game.“We have a lot of senior lads here. Andy Considine has been around for ages, Niall McGinn has a lot of experience, Scott McKenna and Mikey Devlin are good lads in the dressing room, Shay Logan is always positive.“So we’ve got a lot of players in the dressing room who are experienced enough for us to move on from bad results and show what we’re capable of.”Motherwell have enjoyed a good start to the season, with Stephen Robinson’s Steelmen taking  points from their first eight games.Lewis said: “They’ve started the season well and since I’ve been here they’ve always been a strong physical team.“I think they’ve been a bit underrated in terms of what they can do technically as well.“The manager has done a good job with them there. They can rough it and be physical, but they can do the other side of the game as well and we need to be ready for that.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/10/5daaa4e74570b1.36015406-812x564.jpg ","title":"aberdeen community projects over the moon with 25 000 fund1","story":"Projects in three communities across Aberdeen have been awarded essential funding.Residents living in Powis, Sunnybank and Froghall were invited to take part in the latest round of Aberdeen City Council’s UDecide participatory budgeting funding initiative.A total of £, was up for grabs, which was distributed to the community groups in an event this week.A range of groups and organisations put their ideas forward for initiatives which would benefit people in the three communities.They were invited to a publicly held event to give a short presentation outlining their project and how it would benefit the area, with members of the public voting on the schemes they thought should receive money.One of the groups to receive funding was the Froghall Community Centre, which was given £, for ious projects.These include the Froghall community garden, chair yoga for seniors, its youth club, make and mend group and initiative CRE-ART-IVITY.Dawn Presslie-Bell, secretary for Froghall Community Centre Association, said: “We are absolutely delighted.“We put in five applications for funding and we got them all, and we were the people’s vote.“We are made up of volunteers and the funding will allow us to run more activities and buy resources for people in the community to use, such as getting sewing machines and painting easels.”Powis Community Centre also received money for a few projects, with £, in funds going towards its games club, Powis over- group and a basecamp trail.Stephen Clarke, a volunteer at the community centre, said: “We’re over the moon to have received the funding.“It will have a big impact for people in the community because we have a wide demographic, from children to the elderly, who come into the centre and there is nothing that caters for them all at the moment.”Other groups benefiting were the SZTUKA Art Agency for its Aberdeen Drumming United classes, Parent Voice at Sunnybank Primary School for its gardening club, Sunnybank Community Centre for its international cooking programme and Kittybrewster Congregational Church for its le skills project.Friends of Sunnybank Park and Community Action Group in Partnership, an Aberdeen City Health and Social Care Partnership programme, also took home money, as did Froghall Residents Group for its Froghall Footie.Aberdeen City Council co-leader Jenny Laing, who is also chairwoman of the Fairer Aberdeen board, attended last weekend’s event.She said: “I thought the event on Saturday was incredibly successful.“The range of projects that were picked were really good.“It was clear that there was something for every age group in the communities.“I was delighted that so many projects received funding from the £,.“I spoke a bit about how heartening it was to see the work going on in communities and how people are choosing to come together to benefit people as a result of the event.“It was a great event.

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.

Two men were paid to accompany Patrick the Fool on his journey from England to provide entertainment for the King and his guests while residing at Tarbert.Also recorded is a figure for #making a suit for the King at Tarbert#.  Bruce visited Tarbert on many occasions. His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction. Whilst this work was underway, James summoned parliament to meet him here to discuss matters local to the area. This meeting took place on July  .Over the years, many travellers of note have passed this way and commented on Tarbert and its scenic surroundings.In  Thomas Pennant arrived by sea at East Loch Tarbert and described the scenery as #picturesque#.CGS Teighnmouthpassed through the Kyles of Bute in  and commented that #it offers no scenery worthy of notice#. He continued to note that #the romantic little harbour of East Loch Tarbert – with the overhanging keep of its ruined castle # form a scene singularly picturesque#. He became a frequent visitor to Tarbert.In  Lord Cockburndescribed the Kyles as #rugged and picturesque# but, arriving at his destination, exclaimed: #But Tarbert! East Tarbert! How is it that I had never even heard of that curious little bay. There it lay, calm and silvery, like a scene from a theatre. A striking and beautul spot.#In the modern era, many thousands of tourists visit Tarbert each year.

Around  resident berth holders and more than , visiting leisure craft during the sailing season add considerably to the numbers who arrive at Tarbert and appreciate the attractive surroundings.The present plans for the power line, however, as exhibited by SSEN, will present a view on entering the harbour despoiled by a line of monster pylons.The current proposal suggests that four or five of the -foot pylons will dominate the western skyline. The visual impact of this scheme as presently proposed will have a negative effect on the experience of everyone who lives in, or visits, Tarbert.Tarbert was designated as a conservation area in the s.

Through Debussy’s impressionist piece, Rinaldo Hahn’s Operatic journey and into Du Parc comforting his love with a dream like harp created by the piano.The duo then gave us a contemporary piece by Joseph Horowitz which comprised of snippets from the monologues of Shakespeare’s Lady Macbeth and the music tracks her descent into madness.

Perceptive, spirited and loving.\"Photographer Allan, who has been publishing his work since the s, spent decades in locations such as Vietnam, Morocco, Libya and Australia to produce unforgettable images.Since ing home earlier this year he has released photographic titles, Vintage Tractors and Scotlands Islands, before putting the final shots together for Edinburgh.Allan admits that Gerdas involvement has taken the publication to a new level. He said: \"My initial concept was to produce a comparatively modest format, aimed at the photographically conscious visitor.\"By good fortune however, in engaging with Gerda as co-author, the scope and spirit of the work has been widened and deepened.\"The poems featured in this book have interacted with my images penetrating the veneer that can often dominate the city.\"All those prestigious castings and fine masonry may, collectively, have created one of Europersquos most beautul cities, but there were struggles in its making, and so often a human price was paid.\"I hope, therefore, it proves thought provoking at the very least.Gerda, who is an award-winning actor, songwriter and director as well as a writer, added: \"This has been a fascinating and welcome collaboration ndash an opportunity to reacquaint myself with my beloved home city, and its many contradictions.\"Irsquove relished both the process of responding to Allanrsquos vibrant images, and the way in which the project unexpectedly developed: finding myself writing additional poems about aspects of the city which Allan then went out to photograph.\"The journey towards finding a visual and poetic narrative

Assisted by Scott Souden’s low cross from the left flank, the substitute striker guided a delightful flick into the net beyond the Glynhill keeper. Taking on the role of target-man with gusto, Radecki played a big part in the Feathers-sponsored Pupils’ fourth goal, when he held off a defender down the right wing and crossed to substitute Calum McKillop, whose back-heel flick found Souden at the penalty spot, and the -year-old winger, making the journey home from Edinburgh for a game, passed the ball into the net with ease to complete the scoring.The game became a procession in the closing minutes with man-of-the-match Crossan, the midfield linchpin alongside the impressive Liam Renton, orchestrating some controlled possession football, but there was some trouble on  minutes when a malicious foul on ex-Dumbarton man D McCallum sparked into a melee with players from both sides involved. It resulted in a second booking for Kenny Kerr, a yellow for J McCallum, and a red card for the original Glynhill culprit, as well as yellow for the visiting keeper from referee Jimmy Litster, after charging from his own goalmouth to become involved.Undeterred, the Pupils settled back down to seal a richly deserved victory,achieved through a disciplined and determined performance.The Kintyre Park side will now enjoy a free week, with ato action scheduled for Saturday October , opponent to be confirmed.For fixture updates, and to see second-half action and goals from last Saturday’s match, see Campbeltown Football on Facebook, or @PupilsAFC on Twitter."},{"url":null,"title":"dramatic final minute sees young pupils take points","story":"With a dramatic finish to the game the Pupils Youth Under s ed to Kintyre with all three points after a tight encounter played at Glasgow Club Milton on Sunday.This was the first time the sides had met and the Pupils knew they would be in for another tough test on the road playing against a side which won the GADYFL B Division last season.The visitors showed no signs of their early journey to the north end of Glasgow as they started brightly and enjoyed the majority of possession early in the game. However, it was the home side that took the lead on the nd minute when Ashfield’s centre forward cut in from the left before sending an unstoppable shot in to the top corner.A test of character was required from the boys as they fell behind and with five minutes of the half remaining they were rewarded after a corner dropped to Stuart Phillps in the box.

A long clearance by Ashfield was misjudged by the Pupils defence to allow Ashfield’s player in with a chance of his hat-trick but the youngster scuffed his shot into thankful hands of Pupils goal-keeper Lorne Paterson.Knowing it was the final minute, Paterson tried to kick the ball up the field as quickly as possible only for it to cannon off the back of Euan O’May’s head!

That race took place over the course of last weekend.The series featured five rounds at dferent venues, and each race was set up like a car rally, with untimed uphill transition stages leading to ious timed downhill sections, the results of which were amalgamated into an overall race time. The stages ied massively in , from as little as  seconds to an absolute behemoth we endured at Laggan in April which took us  minutes to ride! The topography and trail surface dfered wildly from venue to venue but also from stage to stage, and the taped trails we raced down last weekend at Fort William epitomised this eclectic set-up.Stage  was the easiest and least technical track we have raced on all year, an entirely man-made sprint through flowing banked corners coated in compacted quarry dust. Of course you had to be careful you didn`t push too hard, it is all too easy to wreck a race run by hitting the deck on an easy stage. We assumed that the organisers were trying to lull us into a  sense of security with stage #and we were so right!Stage  started halfway down the legendary World Cup track , channelling riders through some savage rock gardens before cutting off to the right along a lung-busting fireroad before descending into another sculpted hardpack track which then erted down a horrendously muddy, freshly cut chute that was littered with roots big enough to swallow a bike wheel whole. Even walking down it was impossible.A big transition ride towards Torlundy took us to the top of stage , which was the famous Blue Crane trail running into Ridgeline. Both of these tracks are black-graded on a good day, but there is a huge dference between trying to ride these ‘for fun’ and then trying to race on them once  people have spent a whole Saturday skidding them to bits in the tipping rain! A lot of people fell foul of this stage, but we survived and we absolutely loved it.Stage  was a dferent animal altogether. We had tackled it fairly early on practice day and hadn`t had any issues with it, but the swarm of maniacs who had ridden it in the rain since our earlier visit had turned it into an absolute swamp and the ruts were so deep that I found it almost impossible to negotiate with my limited skills. Dave telling me afterwards that he had romped it didn`t help my mood one bit!The last  stages were so high up the mountain that we needed a trip on the gondola to get to them. The black graded Top Chief track is a fearsome animal that follows the best twisty bedrock line around the hill before plummeting several hundred feet straight down off it into the tree line below, where it once again becomes sanitised into a flowing, twisty and utterly hilarious serpent of a trail that had riders drting and whooping all the way to the carpark. The organisers had cleverly split the Top Chief track into two stages, as there is a long section of perched wooden boardwalk high up on the mountain that is great fun to ride but would be far too dangerous to race on. Stage  was therefore very short -taking most riders about  seconds to ride- while stage  was a  minute monster. What a way to finish a season!So how did we do David was fastest of the three of us, as he has been all season. He finished in a time of  minutes,  seconds. He races in the Senior category , so it is a tough school littered with sponsored riders and crazy kids. He finished th in seniors on the day, and th overall out of an entry of  riders. Having failed to finish the race at Laggan earlier in the year due to a mechanical breakdown, David has been constantly playing catch-up but he still managed to finish in a brilliant nd place overall in the seniors category for the season.Alex has ridden consistently all year and has managed to tread the fine line between wrecking and ruling perfectly at every round. He had one of his very few crashes on the last stage at Fort William which cost him a few seconds, but he still ed a very respectable time of : to finish nd in the Masters category. The Masters section almost always attracts the largest entry and it is full of well-heeled chargers on very expensive steeds, so for Alex to finish in th place in that championshipin his first full season is a highly respectable result.I have continually been either on par or just slower than Alex on nearly every stage of the year, and nothing changed here. I knowI`ve kept within a few seconds of him I have done just fine, and I managed my ride to achieve this perfectly right up until the last stage where a cruel puncture right on top of the hill put paid to any chances of a good result to finish the year. With  top s already in the bag for the season though , I managed to hold onto th place in the Grand Veteran`s championship which was some consolation for a day that finished with me feeling, well, a bit deflated.Competing in this series has been a brilliant experience for us. We have had some hilarious times racing our bikes through some of Scotland`s very best scenery, and we have loved camping out of the back of vans. The organisers at No Fuss Events have done an outstanding job of setting up a professionally run race series in some dficult locations and have always managed to tread the right side of a precarious line, providing us with stages that have been just barely on the rideable side of ridiculous!David Muirhead leads Alex Dickson down the rocky Top Chief track during Saturday#s practice.

A high-energy showing in Paisley saw the McFadyens-sponsored side run out convincing winners.With the match going ahead at the Kibble’s grass park despite the heavy rain overnight and during the week leading up to the game, the surface was in surprisingly good condition, allowing the Pupils to get into their attacking flow early on.Up against a home side not lacking in height and physical stature, the Pupils had to be ready to contend with some lofted early balls from back to front by the hosts, whose game plan seemed to be to get the ball to their forwards as quickly as possible, but the Pupils# defence of Fraser Wylie, Ross Souden, Ryan McConnachie and Stuart Crossan, stood up to the task well.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils quick passing and inidual pace and skill in the final third caused the hosts problems early on, and Ryan Gilchrist and Gregor McFadyen, and both had almost identical attempts to score, but snatched at their shots at the vital moment.However, the Kintyre Park side would not be denied for long, and scored after  minutes through a sharp passing move that released Gregor McFayden, who buried an arrowed shot from the edge of the box to continue his excellent goalscoring form.Then, the visitors made it - after  minutes, when an enterprising move out of defence found right-back Crossan, whose ball through to Johnny McCormick allowed the right winger to cut inside onto his left foot and release a thunderous first-time drive into roof of the net for a great goal, his second of the season.After seeing their deficit doubled, Carlton for their part put their Kintyre visitors under a bit of pressure from several corners and free kicks, but the Pupils’ defensive discipline continued to win over.Into the second half, the Pupils made it - when Donald McCallum scored another great goal, in a move started by Liam Renton, whose in-swinging corner was cleared to the edge of the penalty box where the ex-Dumbarton man McCallum made space to drive a deflected shot into the top corner of the net.At this point in the match, all three subs were used, with Ellis Robertson and Michael McKinlay replacing the excellent deep-lying midfield pairing of Ryan Gilchrist and Liam Renton, and Ross Brown entering in the fray in a direct swap with winger McCormick.The youngster Brown quickly got involved to create the Pupils# fourth goal, outpacing the Carlton full-back to draw out the last defender and square the ball across for Scott Souden to cheekily chip the ball over the home keeper into the net.The rampant Pupils completed the scoring in the th minute after hesitation between a Carlton defender and his keeper allowed McFadyen to nip in, touch the ball round the keeper to score a simple but well-earned second goal, for his brace on the day, and his fourth of the season.At the other end, the Pupils were determined to get their second consecutive clean sheet in league action, and while young keeper Alistair Ferguson spilled a deflected free kick in the latter stages, he bravely ed at the feet of the striker to smother his effort. The Pupils management noted how Ferguson’s kicking and distribution was first-class throughout the match.A Pupils spokesman said: ‘It was a great team effort, with our attacking players working together to cause problems all game.

George remembers that he shook hands with the Queen and spoke with the Duke of Edinburgh. He said: ‘Only those invited could speak to the Queen, but the Duke moved among the gathering and spoke to some of the councillors. I was a coal miner at Machrihanish at that time and he asked me and some other miners about our work.’He continued: ‘The food and drinks were served on silver trays by waiters in tails and bow-ties.

And the decision has brought angryreaction from the local community, who opposed the substation plans in the first place but were overruled by the Scottish Government.Scottish Ministers called in the substation plans after ruling the project to be of ldquonational importance last year, taking the decision out of the hands of East Lothian Council, the planning authority.Despite local representations opposing the substation, Scottish Ministers gave it the go-ahead in February amid claims it was necessary to move quickly to meet the deadline for the UK Government funding.But the UK Government announced its grants late last month and ICOL was not included in the list of successful projects, leaving the firm to rethink its future.East Lothian MSP Iain Gray said it appeared Scottish Ministersrsquo decision to ldquoride roughshod over local feeling ldquomight all have been for nothing.The former power station site was bought by the council last year and the local authority is marketing the land for economic development.However, the council was forced to reach an agreement with ICOL over a section of the site after the Scottish Government gave the substation the go-ahead.Mr Gray said: ldquoThe immediacy of the UK Government funding decision was the Scottish Governmentrsquos justication for riding roughshod over local decision-making and calling in the substation application in the first place.ldquoI opposed that decision to call in the application as unnecessary and anti-democratic and made the case for it being left in the hands of local people and their representatives.ldquoHowever, having put the local community through such uncertainty, it now appears that the Ministerrsquos heavy-handed interference in the sitersquos future might all have been for nothing.

We still recognise that as we have always said these interventions have to be considered part of a live trial and very much hoping it has a positive impact on the beach.ldquoFor residents and visitors, the beach has historically been a real draw.ldquoI think everybody who has been involved recognises that it has a very signicant economic value to the town."},{"url":null,"title":"hygiene-order-served-business","story":"East Lothian Council environmental health officers served a hygiene emergency prohibition notice on Stirling Stewart, operator of a food preparation unit at Halfland Barns Industrial Estate, to the south of the town, on August , resulting in the immediate closure of the premises.The premises were not known to environmental health prior to visiting following a complaint from a member of the public.Derek Oliver, service manager, protective services, said: ldquoOfficers found the premises in such a poor condition that it posed a serious risk to public health and they immediately closed it.ldquoThe premises were filthy with a build-up of dirt and food debris, unclean food equipment, accumulation of waste and poor drainage.ldquoThe food unit was being used to supply other food businesses operated by Mr Stewart in North Berwick.In a hearing at Edinburgh Sherf Court on Tuesday, the Sherf upheld the action of the environmental health officers and confirmed the actions to immediately close the premises were legally correct.Mr Oliver added: ldquoEast Lothian Councilrsquos environmental health officers will exercise their legal powers to protect public health within the county.ldquoWe routinely inspect all food premises and expect them to comply with food hygiene regulations.ldquoIn this case the premises were so dirty and structurally poor that they required to be closed immediately as they fell far below the legally required standards."},{"url":null,"title":"positives-negatives-plans-haddington-town-centre-says-group","story":"Proposals were revealed by the Courier last month that would see a complete revamp of Haddington town centre.Dozens of spaces could be removed from High Street and Market Street, with the introduction of cycle lanes, wider footpaths and a communal space on High Street.The proposals have been met with concern by businesses in the town centre, who fear that the removal of up to  spaces ndash and the introduction of a car park of more than  spaces on Whittingehame Drive ndash could have a negative impact on their way of le.Haddington and District Community Council heard from both Haddington Business Community Partnershipand residents last Tuesday before asking non-community councillors, including the Courier, to leave to discuss the proposals in private.Now, a sub-group ndash made up of community councillors Jan Wilson , Fiona McEwan , Paul Darling , Pat Lemmon and Jack Worden ndash is to meet to draft a letter to East Lothian Council outlining concerns and any positives regarding the scheme.Mrs Lemmon said: ldquoAll community councillors managed to finally see the draft plan that has already been submitted to Sustrans.ldquoThere are some positives but there are also negatives.ldquoSo the community council has formed a sub-group, which is meeting on Tuesday to draft a letter to East Lothian Council.

Why would they  Ms Sturgeon has been consistent from the outset: her party will not vote for any deal that takes Scotland and the UK out of the single market and customs union, causing untold damage to the Scottish economy. And since the current prime minister favours a harder, more isolationist and ideologically right-wing Brexit than even that fashioned by Mrs May, it is surely incumbent upon all UK opposition parties to fight tooth and nail to save the country from such a disastrous and isive path.Thatrsquos why they have no option but to vote down Mr Johnsonrsquos deal and force a general election, the circumstances of which will be vital in determining how it can be framed.

The UK Supreme Court had earlier ruled that secession was illegal, and that by supporting it, the Scottish Government, which has been disbanded, had committed a crime equivalent to a declaration of war against the UKThe European Union has refused to comment on the imprisonment of the Scottish nationalists. A Brussels official said it was ldquoan internal matter for the United Kingdom...Incredible  Fantasy  Of course. We donrsquot behave like that in Britain ndash at least we hope not. But thatrsquos exactly what has happened in Spain. For the first time since the death of the fascist dictator General Franco, elected politicians have been seized, tried and imprisoned, with draconian sentences, for the crime of democracy. For organising a peaceful referendum in .:Protests erupt as Spain convicts leading Catalan separatistsThe democratically-elected Catalan President, Carles Puigdemont, is in Belgium fighting attempts by the Madrid state to extradite him. Nine Catalan politicians and independence activists have been sentenced in Madrid to between nine and  years for the archaic crimes of sedition and disobedience. The government of Catalonia, elected in a free and fair election, has been suppressed.The Catalan independence movement, like its counterpart in Scotland, has been entirely peaceful and democratic. Yet it has been subjected to some of the worst police violence seen in Europe for decades. Approaching , demonstrators were injured during the suppression of voting in . Another  independistas were injured on Monday.The European Union appears to have washed its hands of Catalonia. Brussels regards it as an internal matter. The outspoken Guy Verhofstadt, who has not been slow to comment on the ldquointernal affairs of authoritarian countries from Hungary to Hong Kong, has been silent on the most egregious violation of basic civil rights seen in Europe since the creation of the EU.The EU is supposed to uphold the European Convention on Human Rights. Its own Charter of Fundamental Rights includes, under Article , on political freedom: ldquothe right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association at all levels, in particular in political, trade union and civic matters.The imprisonment of elected politicians, who have never incited violence, is an offence against every citizen of the EU. These sentences should be overturned in the European Court of Justice in Strasbourg, and hopefully, they will be.But today there needs to be more than head-shaking by leaders of other EU countries. Politicians who routinely condemn Vladimir Putin seem unable to see the hypocrisy in failing to condemn Madrid. Liberal newspapers like theshow their ambivalence by reporting the fate of Catalan political prisoners as ldquoa warning to Scottish nationalists.Seriously  A warning of what, precisely  They are surely not suggesting that an unlawful Scottish referendum could result in anything remotely similar.:Former Catalan leader Oriol Junqueras jailed over independence referendumWhat should be deeply worrying to the UK Left is that the imprisonment of the Catalan independistas has been condoned by the Socialist Prime Minister of Spain, Pedro Sanchez. The reason: he canrsquot interfere with the law of the land. One hopes that the silence from Mr Corbyn does not indicate any solidarity with Mr Sanchezrsquos rigid adherence to undemocratic laws.Indeed, Spain is a lesson for radical politicians in the UK not to place too much faith in the efficacy of Supreme Courts. Those at the SNP conference whorsquove been talking about pursuing independence through the courts should take note. The law is politics by other means, and Supreme Courts are supremely political institutions.The fact that Lady Hale gave Boris Johnson short shrt over proroguing parliament doesnrsquot mean that the Supreme Court is going to be kind to Scottish nationalism. In , the UK Supreme Court dismissed out of hand the Sewel Convention ndash the right of Holyrood to withhold consent to any laws passed by Westminster that cut across the powers of the Scottish parliament. When the chips are down, the UK Supreme Court will always see the integrity of the United Kingdom as its first priority.:Letters: The EU needs to help Spain and Catalonia find peaceThe same goes for Brussels. Ms Sturgeon has condemned the behaviour of the Spanish government, but she should also be making clear her discontent with the EU. Brussels is deeply ambivalent about state repression, whether in France against the Gilet Jaunes, or against the Catalans in Spain. Even when the UK is out of the EU, it is naiumlve to expect that Brussels will necessarily support Scotlandit comes to a constitutional breakdown with Westminster.These are dark times. All the more so because of the double standards of liberal opinion in the UK. We continually hear warnings about impending fascism in Britain. Columnists warn about the threat to democracy from Tommy Robinson, from Boris Johnson, from Brexiters. But here is real fascist repression taking place right now in one of the largest countries in the European Union.Itrsquos time for European governments to condemn this wilful regression to authoritarianism. The Spanish state should be diplomatically shunned by the British Government until it releases these political prisoners, just as countries like Russia are shunned. Madrid must be made to realise that this kind of repression cannot succeed.By reviving the spirit of Franco in st century Europe, Spain has squandered any sympathy for its centralist cause. It is legitimate to argue against Catalan independence it is legitimate to fight elections opposing it. But by breaking heads, dismissing elected governments and then imprisoning peaceful politicians, Madrid has acted in defiance of international law. And it has made the case for Catalan independence unanswerable."},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  A chance to make history but the Booker judges blew it","story":"I doubt the Booker organisers are so ecstatic. Since its inception in , the award has only twice before been shared. First was in , when Nadine Gordimer and Stanley Middleton were twinned, and again in , with Michael Ondaatje and Barry Unsworth. After that regrettable outcome, whereby both writersrsquo thunder was stolen, the rules were changed, vetoing this ever happening again.During rsquos final meeting, Florence and his team ndash Liz Calder, Xiaolu Guo, Afua Hirsch and Joanna McGregor ndash were reluctant or unable to make a clear-cut decision. Asking for advice, they were reminded of the rules. Gaby Wood, of the Booker Prize Foundation, reported that, ldquoThey were not so much ided as unwilling to jettison any more when they finally got down to two, and askedthey might split the prize between them. On being told that it was definitively against the rules, the judges held a further discussion and chose to flout them. They left the judging room happy and proud...Should they be proud  I donrsquot think so. That rule was in place to prevent exactly what is already happening. The impact on an author of winning this prestigious title can be dramatic, as last yearrsquos laureate, Anna Burns, made clear in her speech to the literati in Londonrsquos glitzy medieval Guildhall. Gaining the imprimatur of the Booker brings a blaze of international attention, and a Himalayan spike in sales that no sensible novelist would dare dream of, for fear of waking up to the grim reality of meagre royalties that make the living wage look like a Euro Lottery windfall.Margaret Atwood, a previous winner, hinted as much when accepting the accolade. More than anyone, she understands the stakes. This was attention she does not need, her career already illustrious, and she was gracious in acknowledging that. Perhaps she also knows The Testaments isnrsquot in the same class as some of her earlier work. It is not one of the best books Irsquove read this year, although one that is ndash Lucy Ellmannrsquos Ducks, Newburyport, which was shortlisted ndash was a strong contender for first place.Atwood, to my mind, was given her share of the trophy because of the hype around her long-awaited follow-up and its cult following, thanks in large part to the recent television series. But even had it been her finest novel yet, the judges have been cruel to Bernardine Eisto. She is the first black woman to win, a good news story by any standards. That triumph should have been shouted from the rooftops. What a great statement it would have been for her to have been selected, head and shoulders above the rest. Instead, a  that consisted of four women and one man did a disservice to a writer who deserved the full glory, and the full commercial boost, that this distinction brings.The make-up of the judging  is interesting, reflecting the need for greater ersity, and less male dominance, in literary decision-making. And yet this predominantly female group, drawn from a iety of backgrounds and disciplines, blew it. What might have been a historic moment, representing a signicant cultural turning point, has had its impact blunted, its signicance diminished.The reasoning behind this is hard to understand. With five members, it cannot be impossible to have a majority for one particular title. A resolute chair would usually insist on that, gradually eliminating books to reach a single choice. Previous judges have spoken of the angst and turmoil in that final meeting, as the clock ticks down to the ceremony that evening. Last-minute deals are struck, compromises conceded, arguments clinched. For the chair especially, blood pressure mounts at the thought of facing the cameras with a speech when as yet no name has been picked.The reasons for deciding the award on the day of the ceremony are obvious: fear of a leak ruining the live announcement. Yetit is possible to sign waivers in order to get hold of embargoed books ahead of publication, as happened with The Testaments, which was shrouded in Harry Potter-style secrecy, Bookerrsquos organisers can surely bind the judges to keep their choice under wraps overnight. If the final meeting could instead be held without a gun to the head, in itself a form of literary roulette, cooler heads and better counsel would prevail. Perhaps, like a jury in a murder trial, the five could be holed up incommunicado in a hotel until the award night arrives. Better still, they could simply promise to say nothing and then, for the space of  hours, keep their word. How novel would that be What this split decision suggests is that in the judgesrsquo minds, the entire shortlist was worthy of the prize, and they wanted to show as little favouritism as they could. Yet what is the point of a le-changing pound, rewardnot to anoint a standout victor  In effect, this attitude is an echo of the ideology that says we are all successes, and nobody should ever be declared a runner-up or loser in a race or an exam. By insisting on a double honour, ostensibly for big-hearted reasons, the judges have in fact ducked the tough responsibility with which they were charged.Whatever its impact on Atwood and Eisto, this two-hander feels horribly, tediously familiar. Just picture the scene, as the adjudication meeting dragged on for hours. Indecision, a mounting sense of impasse, endless, increasingly feverish discussions, and a leader who could not or would not break the deadlock. After this, a last-ditch soliciting of professional opinion, followed by a flagrant breaking of the rules. In this sense, at least, Booker rsquos unsatisfactory outcome is very much a story of our times."},{"url":null,"title":"no-deal-brexit-scottish-housing-shortage-follow-eu-exit","story":"More than half a dozen councils in Scotland have claimed that house building targets and ongoing development could be in jeopardya No Deal Brexit were to go ahead.Loss of labour from the European Union, reduction in EU funding and increases in the costs of supplies used in property development could put plans to build thousands of new homes across the country at risk.Council bosses in West Lothian, Perth and Kinross and Edinburgh are among those who included the warning in their risk assessments ahead of the UKrsquos exit from the European Union.Housing association bosses in Scotland say that many programmes are currently on hold as questions remain over future funding, asking for the Scottish Government to come forward with a long-term commitment.:How a No Deal Brexit will affect me: Scottish councils fears for EU exit revealedSally Thomas, chief executive of the Scottish Federation Of Housing Associations, said: ldquoAt present, some social housing providers have put development plans on hold, because the Scottish Government is yet to commit to affordable housing investment after the current programme ends in .

The future direction of the UK, and with it the unavoidable consequences for our most disadvantaged communities, lie in their hands.Mr Johnson, at the behest of his puppet-master, Dominic Cummings, insisted on describing the Benn Act, which required him to seek an extension to the Brexit withdrawal date in the event of no deal, as the Surrender Act. The PM, though, has now produced the Surrender Deal, in which he has meekly relinquished the red lines of Theresa May, cheerfully defenestrated the Ulster Unionists, and coughed up a substantial orce settlement he once famously pledged never to contemplate.At any other time the SNP could put its feet up and enjoy the spectacle of Britainrsquos political establishment committing Seppuku. All that it would be required to do was nimbly avoid the ambuscades and dutully vote to reject the Johnson deal as being bad for the UK and Scotland. What should it matter to it whether Britain remains within the EU  It is pledged to leave the UK and the conduct of Britainrsquos most implacable Brexiters has helped its cause immeasurably. Independence having been secured, it could thereafter consult with the Scottish people about our future trading relationship with the EU. The SNP, though, seems intent on wasting the opportunities granted to its over the last three years and committing its own act of self-immolation.Its leader, Nicola Sturgeon, has warned rebels within her own party of walking into a Unionist bear-trap. Perhaps she ought instead to be assessing the potential damage from the recent own goals contrived by her own party. The most lamentable of these has been the high-handed refusal by the party executive to entertain any semblance of a debate about an independence Plan B. This is exacerbated by its failure to produce a coherent tactical strategy for exploiting the Brexit convulsions of the British political establishment. It has also permitted a poisonous fringe of trans-gender activists to enter its bloodstream.The SNP womenrsquos group which emerged last week was formed partly as a response to the threats and intimidation many of them have recently encountered by trans-gender activists. Two of their guiding lights are Joan McAlpine MSP and Joanna Cherry MP, committed feminists both and two of the brightest talents in the party. Simply for questioning the SNPrsquos official position on self-ID in the gender debate, they have been abused and bullied amidst moves to have them de-selected by a tiny but curiously influential group attached to the partyrsquos scarecrow youth wing.Entryism in the political sphere isnrsquot merely about pursuing a narrow agenda. It occurs when an unrepresentative group of people, in the face of overwhelming public rejection of their views, are happy to damage an entire cause and its chances of success in pursuit of these. In seeking to destroy the careers of some of the SNPrsquos brightest and best theyre doing much more damage to the prospects of independence than any Tory. They are enemies of the Yes movement.On Brexit, according to a rigorously scientic and wide-ranging Panelbase Poll conducted by the influential Yes website, Wings Over Scotland, a clear majority of the SNPrsquos own supporters oppose the partyrsquos Brexit strategy of outright opposition. This merely confirmed the wrinkles and nuances which the EU referendum produced among SNP voters in . The party needed to be adroit here, paying heed to the emerging view that Brexit will make independence more likely while not alienating the majority view among its own supporters who favour soft-Brexit above stopping it completely. Instead, the Holyrood leadership, where all power in the party resides, has performed a series of contortions to support a Peoplersquos Vote while also desperately seeking an early General Election for no other reason, it seems, than to avoid any collateral damage from the forthcoming trial of its former leader, Alex Salmond. The decision to crush all dissent over an independence Plan B is the culmination of three years of missed opportunities in the course of Brexit.The SNP commands all that it surveys in Scotland, an anointed position it continues to enjoy mainly because of the abject failures of leadership in the Labour Party in Scotland. Since , though, the main theatres of politics have been in Westminster and Brussels, places are populated by political royalty who can claim lineage to the English civil war and the origins of the Hapsburg Empire. They have been moving the pieces on Europersquos chessboard for centuries. To gain any idends for your cause you need to move among them and learn their ways. Mr Salmond was at home in this environment, making alliances and using Scotlandrsquos soft power ndash its scenery and natural produce ndash to make alliances and friends across nations and political boundaries.Itrsquos inconceivable that he would have allowed the Brexit chaos to pass without exploiting it in the cause of Scotlandrsquos independence. In this he would surely have deployed the considerable leverage of the SNPrsquos Westminster contingent to secure movement on a Section  order long before now. In these last three years though, the SNP has effectively split into two separate entities who barely acknowledge each other: Holyrood and Westminster. The Holyrood leadership are strangers to the men and women who control Europe and the UK, these shadowy puppet-masters who make things happen. Instead, shady chancers within the SNP ndash and known to the leadership ndash have been given licence to target Joanna Cherry, a politician who is widely respected in these circles. Misogyny and deep envy are at the root of this.After all of this the SNP is now, yet again ldquodemanding that a Section  order be granted. Just like that. Yet again it will be refused. And not for the first time you begin to wonder how sincerely it wants it. Twelve years in devolved government, with the virtual guarantee of another seven, is making some personal pension plans dance and stimulating the second-homes market on Scotlandrsquos wee bit hill and glen.

Though not necessarily in this case where the forms that cling to him rot away in their own stew pot of fevered jostling for position.I think of the minor players like Mark Francois, Steve Baker, Bill Cash, Andrew Bridgen, Nigel Evans, Liz Truss ndash I could go on and on ndash who have shouldered their way before the TV cameras, glowing with their moment of fame infamy.They often parrot sheer nonsense which will have been disproved before their words fall to the stage.I want to shout: lsquoWe see you. We see you.rsquo For do these fools not realise we are in the age of instant checks, instant playback, instant tick sheets where past words are transmitted within seconds The so-called official opposition, the Labour Party, is little better. Its leader twists, turns, dissembles, gazes rheumy eyed into a socialist world that can only be born of the destruction of the present system, and like Johnson, turns for advice to a shadowy, hollow-eyed, grey faced so-called mastermind.And Jo Swinson. Ah. We instinctively know that with her earnest faux-smile and accent she will swim around the political shallows, weaving ever downwards and closer to the bigger fish who will swallow her as a canapeacute to their dubious main course.And so, to the SNP. They have two formidable politicians who happen to be women ndash Joanna Cherry, QC and Nicola Sturgeon.I am not of the school that believes that women are far finer creatures than men and would bring the world into a glorious, happy clappy future.Priti Patel for starters. Kate Hoey. Andrea Leadsom, etc etc. Need one say more I know women are deadlier than the malehellip.all secret services advise: shoot the woman first.But these two, along with Anna Soubry, Jess Phillips and Yvette Cooper at least face the camera with a clear gaze and an answer to any question posed.They do not play the public for fools they still hold to their own bedrock but above all, respect the electorate, not use them in an inter-house competition where winning is all.As I write the FM is giving her conference speech. She tells her audience lsquowe will not win independence the Brexit way.rsquo It will be done by inspiration and persuasion.Already my twitter feed is filling up from all corners of the UK and further afield with admiration for her. Many, mainly from England, say: we need a Nicola Sturgeon.They say it, obviously with no love or interest in an independent Scotland, but because they like her straight, non-dissembling replies in interviews. She answers the questions put to her.With the charlatans in power and opposition, theyrsquove forgotten that questions can actually be answered. Itrsquos refreshing and reminds them that politics can be again what they once believed it was.Behind stage it is clear that there are disputes and ergences of opinions of the way forward. Bitter words have been uttered. There are many, within the party and within the public, who are deeply ided by the FM.That is fine. That is healthy argument. Brexit surely has shown that it is not simply lsquomy party, right or wrong.rsquo Not even lsquomy country, right or wrong.rsquoI donrsquot know where wersquoll be when you read this. How often have I written this these turbulent months  The fat lady may have retired, once again, to the wings, or shersquos finally singing her aria on stage.The FM may have have calmed her fractious, headstrong wings hellip she may not.Jo Swinson may still be shuffling to get into place beside Johnson and Farage will be erupting ndash of that we can be sure.One thing only is certain. For the public, when innocence is lost, a bitter taste is left and contempt seeps through, infecting all parties, all ideologies.When the bedrock is cracked open hellip the real nasties crawl out.

The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has admitted there are “known errors” in the RPI system and last year called for the UK Government to stop issuing bonds linked to it.But that advice has come too late for many local authorities in Scotland which are now shelling out millions more in costs for schools that were built under private finance initiatives.Costs of other Scottish PFI schemes, from prisons to hospitals, have also been rocketing since the deals were agreed.A Scottish Government spokesman said PFI had left “taxpayers in Scotland liable for a £ billion legacy of payments”.He added: “The annual PFI repayment bill now exceeds £ billion – nearly five times more than the Non-Profit Distributingprogramme which we introduced and is proving far better value to the public purse.“The funding of public infrastructure has vastly improved since . “We are working to ensure PFI contracts which have been inherited provide the best value for money for the taxpayer – and to ensure savings are achieved from existing contracts, wherever possible.”The Scottish Government is understood to be eyeing a model of public-private partnerships pioneered by the Welsh Government.Like PFI, the so-called Mutual Investment Model sees private partners build and maintain public assets for a fee.But the deals do not include services like cleaning, which have proved costly through PFI. The model also involves the public sector as a minority co-investor, taking a share of the profits.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.donsidepiper webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Figures published by Facebook show that #. million was spent on political ads on Facebook or sister site Instagram.\"  Thousands spent on targeted Facebook adverts by Scottish politicians viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DONS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DONS | Article Teaser\"Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard has pledged to ban any further public-private finance dealshis party takes power.“Scotland’s historical PFI deals have put unnecessary pressure on our NHS, our local government services and right across the public sector,” he said.“That is why I have been clear that the Scottish Labour government that I lead will introduce a ban on new PFI PPP NPD deals.“We will also take private contracts back in-house at the earliest opportunity to save the taxpayer money in the long term.”The JPI Media investigations team has been looking into PFI contracts across the UK.According to figures obtained from hundreds of public bodies, rocketing inflation and extra costs are set to add at least £ billion to the overall price tag of PFI schemes.Among its findings, the team found that:• An NHS maternity unit built and run by a private company was closed after just  years but is still costing the taxpayer millions of pounds• A police force is trying to think up new uses for a mothballed custody suite it is still paying for• Expensive maintenance contracts have seen one police force billed £ for an extra chair.Trade union leaders have called for urgent action.Unite assistant general secretary Gail Cartmail said the escalating costs of PFI were a “national scandal”.She said: “The money that has poured into the pockets of profit-hungry financial institutions and private companies could have been much better spent directly on public service projects and infrastructure. “PFIs are a rip-roaring example of out-of-control ‘bandit capitalism’.”"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : pmOrkney Islands Council has issued a safety reminder after a number of maritime distress flares were dumped at St Margaret’s Hope household waste and recycling centre.

As is tradition, an ensign, which has been tied to the wreck of the battleship was presented to a family member of one of the crewmen.

It will also give people an extra incentive not to litter.Zero Waste Scotland, who helped the Scottish Government design the scheme, is especially interested to hear from islands-based drinks producers, retailers, hospitality businesses, and other key stakeholders, such as tourism businesses.The draft regulations laid before the Scottish Parliament in September include a target of capturing  per cent of all scheme containers. Achieving that requires making the scheme accessible and practical for everyone in Scotland.In addition to this and six other island engagement events, the Scottish Government will complete an Islands Impact Assessment to ensure that any signicant unique impacts on island communities are captured and mitigated against. A webinar will be held after the final event to give people that could not attend a chance to learn more about the scheme.Jill Farrell, chief operating officer, Zero Waste Scotland, said: “We want to make sure that Scotland’s Deposit Return Scheme works for the whole of Scotland. That’s why we are visiting Orkney to speak with residents, businesses and stakeholders. We want to benefit from their insight into how this will work for the islands.“Making the scheme a success in Orkney will require dferent approaches from in Scotland’s cities. From logistics and transport, to cash flow and tourism, we look forward to discussing how we can work together to deliver a world-class scheme.”Alastair Nicolson, programme manager at Highlands  Islands Enterprise, said: “This is a very ambitious scheme that aims to make a real dference to people and communities in every part of Scotland.“For the scheme to work effectively, dferent approaches will need to be worked out and applied. Models of recycling that work well in large towns and cities won’t necessarily bring about the desired results in rural areas, including islands and remote mainland communities.“It’s great that the needs of islanders are being recognised at this early stage of the Deposit Return Scheme through this programme of events on the ground and online.”The Orkney engagement event will take place at The Orkney Hotel, Kirkwall, on Thursday October , from am to pm.To sign up to take part, visit http:bit.ly DepositReturnOrkneyA webinar will be hosted by Zero Waste Scotland following its series of island engagement events.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Competitive pricing from hotels and other accommodation providers in Aberdeen has undoubtedly contributed to this, but that also acts as reassurance there are other options available for those who need it. Bookings are not being taken beyond the end of October, which is the intended date of closure subject to the outcome of our consultation with affected staff.“We will continue to offer other British Red Cross services from other locations in the city.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The crowds are planning to converge on Parliament Square as legislators are voting on Brexit departure plans put forth by Conservative British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Many carried signs calling for a halt to the Brexit process that started with a  referendum in which British voters narrowly backed taking Britain out of the -nation bloc. Protester Bruce Nicole, a vicar from Camberley southwest of London, said the Brexit deal would harm Britain. He says \"I fervently believe that we should remain in the EU.\" He adds \"I am British but I am also European. I dont believe the current deal offers any benefits at all.\" : Brexit deal vote: Brexit weariness is no excuse for weakness, DUP tells Boris Johnson​: Peoples Vote march: Thousands to take to streets as MPs set to vote on Brexit dealamOpposition leader Jeremy Corbyn has told Parliament that the Brexit deal on which lawmakers are voting risks jobs, rights, the environment and the health service. The Labour Party leader told Parliament Saturday that Prime Minister Boris Johnsons new deal is substantially worse than the one it replaces, which was voted down three times. Corbyn says it removes protection for workers rights and the environment and replaces them with empty promises. He says it would also reduce Britains commitment to fighting climate change. He also warns it would hurt British manufacturing. --- :amBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson has told Parliament that his new Brexit deal can heal the rt in British politics and unite warring factions. He used a rare Saturday session to plead with lawmakers to back the new plan. He says it would \"take back control\" of Britains borders, fishing and trade and preserve the gains of the Good Friday agreement that helped end violence in Northern Ireland. Johnson faces a close vote on his plan with opposition parties determined to block it. --- :amPrime Minister Boris Johnsons plan to get Parliament to approve his Brexit deal with the European Union has been thrown into doubt. Lawmakers will first vote on whether to withhold approval until legislation to implement the agreement has been passed. That would bring another law into play that would force Johnson to seek a Brexit delay from the European Union. House of Commons Speaker John Bercow said would allow a vote on an amendment that essentially puts the vote on the deal off until another day. Those behind the amendment say it will remove the risk that the U.K. could stumble out of the bloc without a deal on Oct.  because the law is not in place. The vote is due later Saturday. --- :amPrime Minister Boris Johnsons Brexit plan faces what is expected to be an extremely tight vote as Britains Parliament prepares for its first Saturday session since the  Falklands war. At stake is a new orce plan agreed between the British government and the other  European Union nations at a summit Thursday. Johnson hopes for success in getting a fractious Parliament to back the deal after his predecessor, Theresa May, failed three times to get lawmakers behind her plan. Johnson does not have a parliamentary majority but he is hoping to woo some opposition Labour Party lawmakers to his side. He said in The Sun newspaper on Saturday that a vote for the plan would bring a \"painful chapter in our history\" to an end.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"our flat is worth nothing potentially hundreds of scottish properties unsellable due to lack of cladding certification post grenfell","story":"Owners hoping to sell or remortgage such properties, including luxury apartments worth hundreds of thousands of pounds, have been shocked to be told that they currently have ldquozero value.The development comes more than two years after the Grenfell disaster in which  people in a west London tower block lost their lives as flammable cladding caused fire to spread.Mortgage lenders recently issued new guidance that properties over  metres high with any cladding must now provide written confirmation that they meet fire safety standards set out by the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government, relating to external wall systems after Grenfell.While properties built in Scotland in the last  years comply with high safety standards, without the specic documentation required they cannot meet the conditions lenders are imposing.As a result, surveyors instructed to compile home reports in recent weeks have imposed ldquonil valuations.The issue has come to light after some owners tried to put flats on the market, unaware that the new requirements make them unmortgageable and therefore virtually impossible to sell.A solution is yet to be found as those involved in the selling process, including solicitors, say they have had no clear guidance as to what tests are required or who is authorised to carry them out. gtgt Landlord slapped with £, fine over sham holiday let for Warriston flatThose wishing to sell have therefore been left in limbo.Transactions for some flats that were given home report valuations prior to the new policy have fallen through in some instances because prospective buyers were unable to secure a mortgage.Meanwhile, cash buyers not requiring a mortgage have been put off from purchasing until the issue has been resolved.It also affects those wanting to remortgage their homes, who have been unable to switch to cheaper products.Flat owners are likely unaware their properties are unsellableThe majority of high rise flat owners are likely unaware that their properties are currently effectively unsellable. Properties affected include some in Edinburghrsquos luxury Western Harbour development.Although the issue affects the whole of the UK, it is thought to have become apparent in Scotland first because of the requirement for home reports north of the border, which means valuations are called for far earlier in the sale process.gtgt Wetherspoon pub at Edinburgh Airport opens after major £m refurbishment - with several Scottish references hidden insideA summit, organised by Andy Wightman, the Scottish Green Party MSP for Lothian, took place in Edinburgh after he received more than a dozen emails from affected constituents.Representatives from UK Finance, the trade association for the UK banking and financial services sector Homes for Scotland, the house building trade body the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyorsthe Edinburgh Solicitors Property Centreand Edinburgh Conveyancers Forum attended along with estate agents and surveyor firms.Mr Wightman said: ldquoWe have had higher building standards since , since the Fire Scotland Act, and we are not allowed to have buildings more than  metres that have got combustable material on the outside.ldquoWhat is concerning my constituents is that the flats that they are trying to sell should comply with building standards - yet they are at a standstill.ldquoIrsquove one constituent says she has bought somewhere and she is due to move in in ten days but the salelooks like itrsquos fallen through.Grenfell triggered extra caution over cladding Paul Hilton, chief executive of the ESPC, said that in light of Grenfell it was right that there should be a ldquohigher state of awareness around potential issues with cladding.However, he said the new guidance to surveyors had resulted in ldquochallenges getting safe properties on to the market.Although the properties have already been passed by council-run building control as fit for habitation, surveyors would not commit to a valuation without a seeing a report on the cladding.He said properties listed before the change in guidance were hitting another ldquobottleneck when buyers were found as lenders called for certication to give the all-clear. gtgt Hundreds of jobs lost as Watt Brothers collapses into administrationHe said: ldquoAs far as we are aware, there is no building at the moment that we think there is an issue with, particularly in and around Edinburgh where we operate. We are convinced they will get a clean bill of health but until itrsquos in writing from someone thatrsquos approved by the lenders there lies the bottleneck and thatrsquos what needs to change.ldquoThe safety first approach is the right one but I think we need clarity in to exactly what is the standard thatrsquos required and who is allowed to do these reports.ldquoThe ideal outcome is that we get the guidance and then each block has this certication done and that sits somewhere centrally so that any buyer or buyerrsquos solicitor can look it up.Property solicitor Dot Mullally, a partner with Edinburgh-based law firm McDougall McQueen, said: ldquoThis is an extremely concerning development for owners of high rise flats and we have a great deal of sympathy for our clients who find themselves in this dficult situation.ldquoWe are working along with our clients to try to get the necessary reports to establish that they are safe and remain suitable for mortgage lending.A UK Finance spokesperson said: ldquoAs with any mortgage application, each lender will consider whether to lend on a case-by-case basis. UK Finance is working with RICS on guidance on this issue which is due to be published shortly.Edinburgh resident says her flat is worthlessA woman has warned other property owners and buyers after her flat was deemed ldquoworthless amid the recent cladding certication crisis.Nickie Eden lives in a flat with her husband in Western Harbour Bay in the Capital. The couple were in the process of selling it, but have been told itrsquos of no value due to a lack of certication over cladding.ldquoItrsquos completely bonkers, Mrs Eden said. ldquoBecause we donrsquot have this certication, which doesnrsquot appear to exist in Scotland, our property is worth nothing and we canrsquot complete the sale.Mrs Eden said her solicitors at Moving Eight alerted her to the issue last week. Her buyers were due to move in on November  as their current lease runs out in a couple of weeks. But with the demand for an official document assuring lenders - in this case NatWest - of cladding safety, the move has been put on hold and the buyers and sellers are in limbo.gtgt Edinburghrsquos new St James Centre: a North Sea Dubai or better than Buchanan Galleries  ndash John McLellanldquoThe banks are just very risk averse, which is understandable since Grenfell, she continued. ldquoBut the worry thing thing about this is that there are no parameters in place in Scotland for cladding safety checks, so what are we supposed to do ldquoIt must be for safety, which I am really in favour for, but one size doesnrsquot fit all and itrsquos just completely bought everything to a standstill with regards to selling a flat in this building.Official response has been slow The area manager at LrsquoOreal said since raising the issue with the government, little has been achieved. \"Its really worry for owners in this situation who are wanting to sell because surveyors are going round and saying some of these properties are zero value,\" she added. In an email from Andy Wightman to Mrs Eden seen by the Evening News, the MSP says: ldquoI convened a meeting of surveyors, solicitors and other professionals involved in building, conveyancing and valuation on Friday  October. The meeting was attended by a representative of the Scottish Government. ldquoIt was a very useful meeting and we will be meeting again towards the end of November.But given Mrs Edenrsquos original moving-out date, shersquos been left feeling helpless. ldquoNo one seems to be treating it with a matter of urgency, but itrsquos a serious issue. This poor couple due to move in could be homeless because of this.ldquoLuckily we reserved the place wersquore buying. Itrsquos a new build and the builders are being very patient, and in the worst case scenario we can just stay here. But I really feel for the new couple.ldquoI was talking with my solicitors and they said about  percent of Scotlandrsquos property market could crash because of this. Edinburgh might be on its knees soon.New buyers are left with nowhere to live Robyn Deeley, who was due to move in to the Western Harbour home with her boyfriend said she ldquohad her heart set on the flat.ldquoWe had been searching for ages and were so relieved when we found this place, she said. ldquoNow we just donrsquot knowitrsquos actually going to go through or not, itrsquos unsettling.ldquoIt seems a bit ridiculous that all this is put on hold due to a piece of paper.Ms Deeley said there has been little communication about how to receive help in this situation. She said: ldquoI have tried to Google this cladding issue and only saw one article about it and there isnrsquot really any guidance on what to do. We have booked to stay in an AirBnB in the meantime, but itrsquos coming up to Christmas and prices are skyrocketing so itrsquos a bit concerning, I donrsquot know what we are going to do.A NatWest spokeswoman said: ldquoWhen making lending decisions, in part we rely upon the professional advice of independent valuers. The valuer must assess each case in accordance with the RICS Valuation Standards.The uncertainty around the performance of cladding materials in a fire is proving a challenging issue UK wide. We are currently working with ious industry bodies to understand best how to support our customers.A Council spokesperson said: ldquoWe sympathise with the dficulties people selling their properties are finding themselves in.

It states that rural and remote areas, especially those in The Highlands and Islands, have signicant populations at risk from the fallout of leaving the EU – with or without a trade deal.The report considers community access to services, working-age population, income deprivation, workers in #Brexit-sensitive# industries, EU worker migration and how many EU payments are received.Highlands and Islands representative Ms Todd said: “We always knew that Brexit would be damaging to Scotland but this new analysis really hits home the devastating impact that Brexit will have here in the Shetland Islands.“Families across Shetland will feel the impact of Brexit, with up to  per cent of the local population most vulnerable to the potential economic shock.“The SNP government will continue to do what it can to mitigate and minimise the impact on our most vulnerable communities, but this study lays bare the recklessness of the Tories in their blind determination to pursue Brexit at any cost.“Scotland never voted for Brexit and certainly not for the reckless extreme version now pursued by the UK government. It’s essential that we stop Brexit and go back to the people.”Ms Todd added that a report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies , also published this week, #found the UK is already £ billion worse off as a result of Brexit before we have even left the EU – with the UK economy .- per cent smaller than it otherwise would have been.#Over a million voters in Scotland voted for BREXIT, % of Shetlanders voted to leave, are their votes to be ignored  As a UNITED Kingdom we operate as a single unit well we did during two world wars. I find that Maree Todd’s concern about the potential economic effect that BREXIT could have upon Shetlanda bit of a cheek, coming from a party that currently has chalked up a deficit of £ billion for Scotland, due to irresponsible spending policies.Brexit, is nothing more than for the Tories to distance themselves from the EU, and to have a trade deal with the USA, and the, most likely, mass privatisation of most government responsibilities and duties of care going to US companies, where the Tories will benefit as shareholders of such companies. It is so typical of the Tories to put themselves first regardless to the devastating consequences of their policies and selfish agenda#s onto the people of the UK, especially those in society who struggle as it is. It will be a society of those who have and those who do not have. Where profit is the dominating principle which governs and controls those in power. Brexit, will make the UK, very much an unfair, unjust society for the majority of people. It will also have a great impact on smaller communities where the work-force is from the EU, and the economic circumstances putting many jobs and businesses at risk.Brexit, in all its forms, will cause more harm than good####not to mention poking the fires of xenophobia and racism in its wake.If Shetland is #among the most vulnerable to Brexit#, then presumably, it will also be #among the most vulnerable to Scexit# as we are guaranteed to be out of the EU with No Deal, should the SNP#s policy of Scottish independence ever become reality Tulloch undermines himself.

You, at last, you admit to talking from your rear end!! Now it all makes sense.No Peter, it is the Tories. As I have previously mentioned, their agenda is nothing more than to privatise and hand control of the UK#s Health Care and and other Infrastructure to US companies, where the Tories will benefit mostly. The cost of living under Brexit, will most certainly increase, and the people most affected by it will struggle even more.The Tories, as they have always done, have only thought of themselvesand what they can gain regardless to the damaging consequences upon everybody  in society.Their policies and political motives are highly isive, and generally do more harm than good to society as a whole.Bad enough we have London Europe bleating how they will sufferwe leave EU, when frankly none of them venture beyond the M wall to see England.

Typically dark , with intricate patterns, thebird is dficult to spot with the naked eye during the day. However, once aerial, with its buoyant but erratic flight, this bird is most conspicuous.One of those who had the opportunity to view the bird last week was RSPB site manager, Brad Robson.He said: “It really is a fantastic bird. It sits on branches during the day and then at night it flies about hunting insects.“To see a Common Nighthawk is very rare indeed in fact it is the first one recorded in Northern Ireland. There have been sightings in Ireland on just a couple of occasions.”Its appearance in Ballymena has generated huge interest with bird watchers coming over from the UK to see it.Brad went on to explain that the bird is likely to have ended up in Ballymena due to the recent Storm Lorenzo.He said: “The Common Nighthawk breeds across North America and then they migrate to warmer parts of South America.“During that migration some will fly out over the coast. However, when you get these big powerful weather systems which you see across the Atlantic at this time of year some of those birds can get caught up in the storms. They are then whisked off across the Atlantic and one of their first landing stops can be Ireland.“When a bird is travelling in a weather system it cannot feed so the faster the weather system is across the Atlantic the more chance of it surviving the journey. Some birds will often rest on ships, however, that is unlikely to be the case with this bird.”Brad said that whilst the sighting in Ballymena is “very rare” the storm did bring a some American birds to Europe, causing a lot of excitement among bird watchers.He added: “It was great to see the Common Nighthawk flying about hoovering up the insects and I think everyone there was pleased to be able to see it so easily.”According to nibirds it is now believed that the Common Nighthawk is an adult male due to the bright white throat, the thick white bars near the base of the primaries and the blackish primaries and has been present in the area since September . The common nighthawk measures . to . inches long and displays a wing span of to  inches. During migration, common nighthawks may travel , to , kilometres . According to nibirds it is now believed that the Common Nighthawk is an adult male due to the bright white throat, the thick white bars near the base of the primaries and the blackish primaries and has been present in the area since September . The enormous distance travelled between breeding grounds and wintering range is one of the North Americas longer migrations. The northbound journey commences at the end of February and the birds reach destinations as late as mid-June. The southbound migration commences mid-July and reaches a close in early October.While migrating, these birds have been reported travelling through middle America, Florida, the West Indies, Cuba, the Caribbean and Bermuda, finally completing their journey in the wintering grounds of South America, primarily Argentina.

Work was due to begin on the £.million project in August, but campaigners had occupied the green for over  days in a bid to block the development. Since , Friends of Glassmullin Open Greenhave campaigned against the facility, which is funded by Education NI for De La Salle College.In recent days, however, through consultation and engagement, the school and local community representatives have reached an agreement that will pave the way for the new G pitch. Amongst the terms of the agreement is a commitment that there will be no floodlights and a fence will not exceed . metres at the facility.The resolution will further ensure that there will be no infrastructure put in place for the installation of floodlights at a later date.A seven-person committee made up of school representatives, residents, and an independent chair will now be appointed to manage the facility.Local residents, Martin Derby and Anthony Marron, commented: “We have agreed, in good faith, a pathway to allow for the construction of the De La Salle Sports Facility to commence. Recently we have been part of positive and open discussions with the college and the outcome is a cohesive proposal that benefits all parties involved. This proposal has now been accepted and we will work closely together through a newly formed committee for the project delivery. We will continue to act with the community and our young people at heart throughout the forthcoming process.”Claire White, Principal De La Salle College, said: #The school is delighted to have worked in partnership with local residents to reach a mutual agreement thus allowing for the construction of the sports facility to begin. The facility will provide much needed sports amenities for the pupils of De La Salle College as well as for young people within the community. We are excited to see the project come to fruition and are looking forward to participating and working with the newly formed committee to ensure community cohesion.#Construction of the facility is due to start imminently partnered with ongoing engagement across residents and interest groups via the newly formed joint committee."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"decision due on casement in month","story":"WEST Belfast MP Paul Maskey has said that a decision on the planning application for the redevelopment of Casement Park could be reached in the next month.The £ million redevelopment plans had previously faced setbacks due to safety concerns linked to the size of the stadium.Planning permission was granted for a , capacity stadium in , but in  approval was quashed in a High Court legal challenge brought by Mooreland # Owenragh Residents’ Association .New plans to build a , capacity Casement Park were submitted by Ulster GAA in February .Mr Maskey, who recently met with planners at the Department for Infrastructure , said that, while some information regarding the decision was still outstanding, a decision on the application is imminent.“The department are still waiting on some information coming back to them from DFI roads,” he said.“Obviously when they get that back they’ll have to go through that with due diligence.“When they get that information, which should be within the next month, then hopefully they will be able to make a decision. I hope that they will make that decision as soon as possible.“There have been other large-scale applications that have been submitted after Casement Park, which have already been decided. So once they get that information from DfI Road they should make that decision without delay.”Meanwhile MORA has written to the DfI Planning to object to the new stadium proposals.The letter, which has been seen by the Andersonstown News, states that “Further Environemtal Information” provided by Ulster GAA in July “fails to allay” concerns about development of the stadium “to an oversized capacity”.The residents’ association insists that the redevelopment would have “unacceptable impacts” on people in the area including “excessive over-shadowing and loss of daylight”, air pollution, as well as “noise, disturbance and safety issues” should proposals for three major concerts a year at the stadium be given the green light.“In addition, the applicant has been unable to demonstrate that the road network can safely handle the extra vehicular traffic that would be generated by sporting and concert events,” the letter reads.“The applicant’s proposals for safe evacuation, which now extend to the Stockmans Lane roundabout, also give rise to serious concern and demand for more rigorous scrutiny.”A spokesperson for Ulster GAA said: “Within its planning application, including its Further Environmental Information submission, Ulster GAA has comprehensively addressed all factors relating to the stadium’s operations and impact, with the Safety Technical Group having unanimously supported the project plans.“As the stadium plans are currently under consideration by the Department for Infrastructure it would be inappropriate to comment further on the live planning application.”The Safety Technical Group comprises representatives from Sport NI Belfast City Council, the PSNI, the NI Ambulance Service the NI Fire and Rescue Service Sports Grounds Safety Authority and the GAA’s ground safety management."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"playboy as relevant today as it ever was","story":"One of the most iconic plays of Irish theatre has been reimagined for our times and received a standing ovation at the Lyric Theatre during its opening night.Running until November , JM Synge’s The Playboy of the Western World tells the story of Pegeen Mikewho is tired of her le, working in her father’s pub in a small village in rural Ireland, where she isbetrothed to the dull Shawn Keogh, only for stranger Christy Mahonto walk into her le with a story that sets the whole village talking.While all the women in the village have their heads turned by Christy, whose dark secret makes him all the more attractive, the playboy’s past threatens to catch up with him and it surely does.First performed in , the play is as fresh today as it was when it caused riots in Dublin on its opening night.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

Previously on August , there was an arson attack at a tyre company owned by Tony Lunney in Ballyconnell.In the letter the QIH chairman was critical of the response to the continuing violence and warned of the boards fears that the escalating violence \"will result in serious injury and or loss of le\".In the letter, Mr Barden wrote: \"Minister, it would be a gross failure of the States justice systemdeath or serious injury were the yardstick for State intervention to protect its citizens against persistent criminality.\"One can only speculate that this situation would not be toleratedthese attacks were perpetrated against the senior executives of FDI led companies such as Microsoft or Apple.\"As a major employer the safety of our  staff in this border region remains our priority at a time when management time should be focused on the impact of Brexit for our operations on both sides of the border.\"The letter finishes with a request to meet the Commissioner: \"Given the serious issues involved the Board have requested me to arrange an urgent meeting with your office and the Garda Commissioner at your earliest convenience.\"The letter was sent by email cced to Irish enterprise minister Heather Humphries who represents the Cavan Monaghan constituency, as well as the Commissioner.

The publication was produced by the Department for Communities Historic Environment Division .The report details how a “large enclosure” was uncovered within a housing development off the Skeoge Link Road in the Ballynagalliagh area of Derry. It was located on a relatively steep, south facing slope.The enclosure was constituted of  post holes with  posts forming a separate arc in the north-west corner of the site. The majority of the post holes were of considerable size, with half of them producing broken bits of pottery, also known as sherds, within their fills.Some of these have been identied as belonging to the Vase tradition of Bronze Age pottery and other sherds have been identied as coming from the Cordoned Urn tradition. The general date provided for the use of the site is – BC.A substantial rectangular Neolithic house was identied at Turmeel townland, Co. Derry during the archaeological investigation of the A road near Dungiven.It measured approximately m long and m wide and contained almost  sherds of Neolithic pottery. The building was constructed during the period when farming and agriculture were introduced almost , years ago.At the Glenshane Road near Claudy a Late Neolithic ritual site was discovered during a quarry extension. This consisted of a timber circle – large wooden posts with an outer fenced forecourt – which dated to circa  BC.Timber circles are likely to have been the focus of elaborate ritualised activities attended by large numbers of people.HED Senior Archaeologist Andrew Gault said: “These excavations have resulted in exciting and important new information about our past, from evidence of the homesteads of some of the first prehistoric farming communities in Northern Ireland to more recent urban archaeological remains and industrial heritage.“It is intended that ‘Unearthed’ will continue as a regular annual bulletin of the most signicant archaeological discoveries arising from development-led archaeology in Northern Ireland.”Discoveries in other parts of the country include a Bronze Age roundhouse at Rasharkin solar farm. It consisted of a post-ring, an internal heath, areas of stakeholes, and a segmented enclosure.Enclosed houses generally date to the Middle Bronze Age, c.  BC. Finds included a possible rubbing stone and several sherds of Late Bronze Age coarseware pottery.An th th-century tannery, a place where animal hides are tanned, was discovered within the centre of the site at Royal Exchange in Belfast. This site is located within what would have been the th-century core of the city, an urban industrial operation where leather would have been produced commercially.This was represented by a series of  tanning pits, the majority of which were constructed of wooden planks joined together by wooden dowels.Mr Gault concluded: “These new discoveries highlight the importance of archaeological mitigation in advance of development, as well as the signicant contributions made by developers and archaeologists in unearthing these new archaeological sites for the benefit of all in society.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPhoto: Excavated Enclosure at Ballynagalliagh in Derry."},{"url":null,"title":"broomsticks ready spellbinding halloween fun foyleside shopping centre","story":"Feeling frightful about what to do this Halloween  Fear not, as Foyleside Shopping Centre has plenty of spellbinding family activities to keep you spooked from this Saturday th right through to the st October.To be sure to terry the whole family – there will be an array of ghoulish Halloween games, chilling treasure hunts and “‘”trick or treat’” challenges to sink your vampire teeth into.Or you can unleash your inner beast by mucking in for the monster soft clay workshop.Why not quench your bloodthirst with chocolate apple and pumpkin decorating  Oryou’d rather rise from the dead for the occasion, visit our professional Halloween makeover and face painting stalls!

When funding for the bypass has been confirmed, the piece of art will be fabricated.The news comes after it was confirmed recently that the Department of Finance is expected to approve the new roadrsquos economic appraisal by December which is viewed as a critical step in the process ahead of the required capital funding being released.While the required funding has not yet been made available, local politicians are hoping that it wonrsquot be long before contractors are on site.The Department of Infrastructure says the preparation of the schemersquos economic appraisal report is continuing with Department of Finance approval for the document due to be sought before the end of the year.In order to advance the bypass schemersquos state of readiness, preparatory work on contract documents is ongoing in a bid to minimise the time required to initiate a procurement competition, should funding become available for construction.As part of the proposed multi-million pound development, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road. A new bridge will be constructed over the Moss Road.It is also proposed that a section of the bypass will pass under part of the Crossgar Road with a  metre long bridge constructed to take traffic over Ballynahinch River.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the bypass where the major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.The bypass mdash which would be the single biggest road scheme ever constructed in the district mdash is expected to take in excess of  months to build, with roads officials insisting it will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety.Roads officials are also confident that the schemersquos economic assessment demonstrates the bypass would provide a good economic ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Children.jpg","title":"Children from integrated schools listen talk  ","story":"A BALLYNAHINCH school played host to a conference to mark World Mental Health Day last Thursday.Over  young people from  integrated schools across the province converged on Drumlins Integrated Primary School to take part in lsquoListeningrsquo mdash an event organised by the Integrated Education Fund.The compere was BBC presenter Jo Scott ands guest speakers included Mr Richard Pengelly, Permanent Secretary at the Department of Health, and Kate Beggs, from the Northern Ireland Director of National Lottery Community Fund.Mr Pengelly said afterwards: ldquoYoung people are faced with a number of pressures including social media influences. Online bullying and exam pressure have all contributed to rising levels of anxiety and stress.ldquoIt is important we equip and educate our young people to deal with these issues and to look after their mental health.ldquoThere is support and help available for young people and their families and I urge them to avail of these services.Following talks delivered by young key note speakers, pupils discussed their views on the stresses and anxieties faced by young people.Participants were facilitated in small groups to share their thoughts and generated ideas to help develop support within their schools.Among those taking part were Kori Colgan-Murphy, a GCSE student at Shimna Integrated College in Newcastle, who has been a member of the schoolrsquos Gender Sexuality Alliancegroup for a number of years.ldquoThe GSA is open to all students including LGBTQ students and their allies, she said. ldquoIt is a place where students can come together to socialise, discuss issues, and support one another.Paul Collins, campaign fundraiser with the Integrated Education Fund, said: ldquoSchools in Northern Ireland have seen a dramatic increase in the number of young people with mental health issues.ldquoThese could be anxiety or panic attacks, stress and depression, eating disorders and even, as we sadly know suicidal thoughts.ldquoThe aim of this conference is to provide an open environment to listen to children and young people.ldquoTeachers and parents need to find out what mental health issues are affecting young people in order to provide them with access to the right type of support.ldquoOn the basis of the group discussions, we hope to develop and deliver a plan that can help to address the mental issues impacting on our young people and their wellbeing..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Dads.jpg","title":"Dads helping autistic children enjoy their favourite sports with new project  ","story":"FOOTBALL is often a rite of passage sport for many young boys and girls but for children with autism, taking part in mainstream clubs or school activities can be overwhelming.Two local fathers are trying to make participation a lot easier and stress-free for their children to enjoy this team sport.Gerard McCartan and Daniel Craig from Downpatrick are just two of the many fully involved members of Downpatrick Autism Family Support Group.They have been taking a group of  local children aged between six and with autism for a specially adapted football course for the last three weeks at the Ballymote Sports and Wellbeing Centre.Devised by Gerard, who works for Disability Sport NI, the course aims to build skills in incremental levels in a way which focuses on enjoyment.Gerardrsquos eldest child Cahaacuten, , has autism and was diagnosed just before he went to primary school. He and his we, who are committee members of the support group, have have always tried to integrate activities and sports for all of their three children.ldquoI didnrsquot want football to be a negative experience for my son or any other child, said Gerard. ldquoTeam sports such as football can be overwhelming for children with autism either in school or any local clubs but that doesnot mean they should not be able to participate.Gerard said that he has devised the five-week course which helps build up football skills at the appropriate level for each child.It will finish with a match of children playing against their parents in two weeks time.ldquoNinety-two percent of children with autism have a sensory processing delay so as coaches being able to communicate effectively to the children in a way that they can understand is important, explained Gerard. ldquoWe give the kids reward cards so they and their parents can see their progression which builds up to the match.ldquoThe parents are a brilliant support as some of the children would get very anxious but to have their parents there beside them makes it possible. With the added bit of theatre and drama we try to instil, it heightens the whole experience for them and helps to make memories for both.Gerard hopes to devise further sports courses for autistic children such as boxing.Aacuteine Sloan, chairperson, of the group, praised the contribution of the fathers, not just for helping their own children but for other local children with autism whose parents are members.She said: ldquoNot only is it fantastic that a programme of its kind is now available locally but that itrsquos down to two dads who took it upon themselves to fill the gap.ldquoDownpatrick Autism Family Support Group is % run by parents. Wersquore delighted that Gerard and Daniel have developed this programme so our children can have the same opportunities as their peers. The children can enjoy football in a relaxed and non-judgmental environment.Ms Sloan said that many children on the autism spectrum cannot attend the usual football sessions due to crowds, noises, dficulty following instructions and other considerations.She added: ldquoThis now gives these children the same chance as their peers.This is just one of the many programmes we have running at the minute. We currently have Lego therapy, pony therapy, occupationaltherapy and ious parent training nights.ldquoWe would urge any local families pre and post diagnosis who need some extra support to get in touch via our Facebook page at Downpatrick Autism Family Support Group..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Down.jpg","title":"Down Leisure Centre goes from strength to strength  ","story":"THE success story at the new Down Leisure Centre continues with ious user targets set ahead of its official opening almost one year ago being smashed.Local council officials have revealed that user numbers are ldquoextremely high with membership of the fitness suite particularly impressive.However, the huge demand to use the ultra-modern poundm facility is causing problems for council officials. One of the issues which has arisen is the number of classes it can host and the number of people who can be accommodated in each.Council officials are going to examine the issue, alongside extending the hugely popular leisure centrersquos opening hours.In addition, they are also going to focus on expanding the health referral service which enables GPs to refer people to the leisure centre to engage in fitness-related activities.Over recent months, the local authorityrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Department has been liaising with the Public Health Agency and local health trusts to look at helping address key areas including diabetes prevention.New staff are to be appointed with the posts jointly funded by the health trusts and local authority.

To allow school use of the pool the running costs would jump from pound, to pound, and receipts would only normally be expected to rise by pound,, leaving an additional deficit of pound,.Negotiations are currently in progress with the South Eastern Education and Library Board but councillors are clearly determined not to allow school use unless the Board agree to pay the additional pound, deficit.If the Board agree to pay for school use the pool will open each morning, otherwise it will be open only in the afternoons and evenings.The councilrsquos recreation committee has already accepted a timetable for pool openings and have agreed to open doors from .pm to .pm on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursday and Fridays.On Wednesdays it will open from .pm to .pm for public use and will re-open between .pm and .pm for the use of recognised swimming clubs.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Ballynahinch Business and Professional Womenrsquos Club have written to South Down MP Enoch Powell in connection with the proposed changes in immigration procedures.The club, having been informed through the United Kingdom Federation of B and P Clubs, who were told by Baroness Lockwood of the Equal Commission, want action taken before the proposals are passed by the government.The proposals, that British women wishing to marry foreigners will have to live abroad whilst British men will still be able to marry foreign girls and live in Britain with them, were discussed at greatby the meeting, before it was decided that the secretary should contact Mr Powell.The guest speaker at the clubrsquos recent meeting was Mrs A Nixon, who gave a talk on lsquoHow to be a Good Hostessrsquo.ARDGLASS mdash Ardglass Castle has been put on the market and the asking price is around pound,.The castle, which is believed to have been built in the th century, has  bedrooms and it is thought that one of its guests was the famous songwriter and painter Percy French.Many believe that the talented Frenchman painted several views of Ardglass harbour from the Castle.Other interesting guests, this time more recently were an order of monks who stayed in the castle in the late s and early s.The current landlords, Sean and Bernadette Tracey, and their three children are sorry to be leaving the castle. Sean had ideas to convert it into a hotel and restaurant and there is already planning permission for such a venture.The Fermanagh-born hotelier is moving his interest to another establishment although this time he is tight-lipped about its whereabouts.Sean is aware that most castles are expected to have at least one respectable ghost and he admits that there are many stories locally about ghosts in the castle but during his time living there he never heard had any experience of them.ldquoAlthough the premises are licensed for spirits mdash I think they are of a dferent kind, he

in the new year, said Jim.ldquoThese will again be dferent bloodlines as a follow up to the making of a small but very well bred herd.ldquoCrossed with our own native goals they will produce a very tough healthy race of goats capable of yields upwards of two gallons, which is certainly well worthwhile.Jimrsquos present stud goat, Swaffham Salvador, was a reserve champion out of an entry of  goals at the Royal Norfolk Show.Jim has also imported a Soanen male whose dam was a Q Star goat breed champion.His other stud is a British Soanen bred over a gallon of milk with a minimum fat content of % in less than  hours.ldquoOne of the big markets has come from the growth of health food shops who are creating a demand for goals milk, said Jim.In charging pound stud fees, Jim believes that it

As you would expect, the course had become a virtual mud bath by that stage and there was a lot of fallers.Finn Gibney ran well to take th place in the same boysrsquo race, which had a field of  finishers and Ky Murray also did well to take th place out of  finishers in the girlsrsquo race.Masters trialsThe weekend saw the Masters cross-country trials take place at the Queenrsquos playing fields. The weather was almost too good for it to feel like cross country with brilliant sunshine and little wind.The well kept grounds enticed one runner to go barefoot which was slightly disconcerting for the remainder wearing spikes, but maybe that was a tactic to get clear passage as the others were afraid to cause him injury.The conditions underfoot may have been kind, but the course was taxing with four long loops and a few rises and s where tactics played a part.Mark winsIt was no surprise to see Mark McKinstry, from North Belfast, surge into the lead from the go, given his recent form, but it was still impressive to watch how hard he continued to push despite the clear gap.Second overall was Eamon White, from the same club, with Glenn Donnelly, of Acorns AC, in third. As this race was a trial for selection for the NI team for the British and Irish XC International in Southport in November, all were out to seethey could do well enough in their age groups to merit a place.Three EDAC runners were in the mix. Neil Curran ran a great race, going out hard and hanging on mdash a tactic which worked extremely well. He was th overall and fourth in his age category, so stands a good chance of making the team.Martin Willcox, a previous NI team member at the international event, also put his hat in the ring with a gutsy run, coming th and third in his category which should see him nominated to race.Confirmation was not out at the time of writing, but we will keep our fingers crossed for them both. Gareth Reilly was th overall, getting his cross country season off to a solid start.Soggy SaintfieldAs rain swept in overnight and just kept coming, there was the danger of a wash out for the long awaited Saintfield  k, but runners are a resilient lot and so they turned up nonetheless, ready to enjoy the carnival atmosphere laid on by the hardworking members of Saintfield Striders and other coned volunteers.It was no secret that this is a tough route. Described as a challenge, the k started outside the cricket club, rises up into the town, rises again up Main Street and rises yet again after the left turn which takes the runners out into the countryside.Asthat wasnrsquot enough, there are at least three more hills which take their toll, but there are occasional down hills to catch your breath and the biggest compensation of all is the final mile and a half which drops down into the finish.Edie in frontThe pacers were encouraging and the marshals were cheery, so there was plenty to keep runners on track, whether they were chasing a time or just hoping to finish.EDAC had a small, but determined army. First home for EDAC was Edie Carroll, who thoroughly enjoyed the run and finished th overall and eighth female in a time of . which is more than respectable on that course.Kevin Kelly, who has racked up some great racing en route to Dublin Marathon, ran a PBwhich is a real boost in these last couple of weeks of his prep.Clare Carson, also in taper, produced a good time of ..

to -.That victory ensured Downpatrick of a play-off spot and also ped Bryansford into the relegation mire mdash Bryansford won their first meeting at St Patrickrsquos Park - to -.Saturdayrsquos confrontation will be a no holds barred confrontation.Derby affairs between these two old adversaries are always tasty and no quarter will be asked for or given at the weekend.Bryansford will rely heavily on the experience of Davy McKibben, Conor Maginn, Ruairi Wells, Danny Savage and Timmy Hanna, with Downpatrick looking to Gerard Collins, the Turley brothers, Peter and Damian and Jarlath Branagan.Downpatrick received a massive boost last week when Conor McGrady, who was expected to miss the rest of the season, made a remarkably early comeback as a substitute in the game against Bryansford mdash his appearance from the start could be a game-changer on Saturday.Meanwhile, Downpatrickrsquos close neighbours will take on Saval in a Division  relegation play-off, also on Saturday at St Malachyrsquos Park and will act as a curtain-raiser to the ACFL  clash.Saul looked destined a few weeks back to join Tullylish and one other team in Division  next season, but last-gasp victories in recent weeks over Saval and then Darragh Cross on Saturday have given Ronan McCartanrsquos side a leline.Darragh did Saul a favour last Wednesday night when they beat Liatroim, effectively condemning the Fontenoys to Division .Saul mdash in their first season in Division  mdash have a mixed bag of youth and experience, but could well have to beat Saval without the services of the talented Cormac Byrne, out with a knee injury.However, in Cathail Arnold, Lorcan and Ciaran Harney, Pierce Laverty and Rory Mullen they have the players capable of producing the goods when it matters most.Elsewhere, Dromara play St John Bosco tonight in a Division  relegation play-off at Tullylish with the losers joining Glasdrumman in Division  next season.Bright embark on their initial Ulster Club Championship odyssey with a game against Cavan JFC winners Killinkere at Kingspan Breffni on Sunday andthey can replicate the form shown against Aughlisnafin in the JFC final.To complete a hectic weekend, the action s to Pairc Esler on Sunday where the MFC final replay between Kilcoo and Burren takes place with a .pm start..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Kilcoo.jpg","title":"Kilcoo recapture Frank O’Hare Cup  ","story":"CILL Chua regained the Frank OrsquoHare Cup at Pairc Esler on Sunday with a relentless and masterful display of controlled football.The hurt of last yearrsquos defeat to Burren was confined to history as the Kilcoo players and supporters celebrated with unbridled joy on the final whistle.All credit to Warrenpoint for playing their part in an intriguing contest that so could easily have gone either way, but they were made to pay for registering  wides over the hour.As expected, Niall McAleenanrsquos side took the game to Kilcoo with real authority and at times threatened to destroy their vaunted opponents.However, you just canrsquot tie Kilcoo down and they steadfastly refused to be dominated for long periods.With just two minutes on the clock Ryan Mallon gave Warrenpoint the lead with a point from play after some patient approach work. The same player then had a glorious chance for a goal when he got in behind the Kilcoo full back line, but lsquokeeper Martin McCourt made a brilliant save.The lsquoPoint continued to see plenty of the ball with corner forward Aron DrsquoArcy foraging deep, but they wasted a few kickable frees before Kilcoorsquos Ryan McEvoy brought the sides level with a free in the ninth minute.Ross McGarry then found his range and exchanged frees with Paul Devlin before the Kilcoo marksman punished Warrenpoint for another defensive indiscretion with his second point in quick succession.Ryan Johnston started seeing a lot more of the ball for Kilcoo, but it was Warrenpoint who drew level the th minute with a well-taken score from Ruairi McCormack.McGarry pointed Warrenpoint into a - to - lead after  minutes, but Kilcoo responded immediately with a m free from McCourt.Ryan Johnston then went on a searing run down the right flank and bore down on goal, but flashed his shot wide of Gary McMahonrsquos far post when he really should have tested the lsquokeeper.Devlin and McGarry swapped frees as the interval approached, but their was still time for the energetic Aidan Branagan to bomb forward from his full back berth to point Kilcoo into a - to - half-time lead.Warrenpoint were certainly not overawed by Kilcoo and started the second half the same way they attacked from the opening whistle of the game, but it was Kilcoo who edged into a - to - lead after  minutes with another score from the rampaging Ward.A McGarry free quickly negated this score before Kilcoo received a bad blow when Darryl Branagan was black carded and replaced by Shealan Johnston in the th minute.McGarry converted the resultant free to bring the sides level, but the game was really opening up at this stage and McMahon prevented a certain goal at the other end when he saved from Aiden Branagan.Warrenpoint went straight back on the attack and McGarry gave them a - to - lead with  minutes remaining. Devlin then brought the sides level with a rsquo after a Jerome Johnston shot went perilously close.Ryan McEvoy and Anton Magill swapped scores to keep it all square going into the last  minutes, but Warrenpoint kicked for home when John Boyle majestically pointed his side into a - to - lead.Kilcoo responded with venom. Conor Laverty, who had been on the periphery of the game up until this stage, suddenly took centre stage.Nothing looked on when he received the ball about m from goal. However, he checked back inside his marker and somehow spotted Wardrsquos run from deep.An improvised flick-pass, albeit with the aid of a deflection, picked out the big midfielder and he made no mistake with an unerring finish past McMahon.That should have finished Warrenpoint off, but far from it.They immediately attacked in numbers and worked an opening for McGarry, but he sent his effort wide with the goal at his mercy.A McGarry free gave Warrenpoint some consolation and left a single point between the sides with  minutes played.The game was still anybodyrsquos, but consecutive scores from McEvoy and Jerome and Ryan Johnston seemed to put daylight between the entities with  minutes gone.Another McGarry free cut the deficit to three points as the game went into added time. Warrenpoint continued to bombard Kilcoo and further points from Donagh McAleenan and McGarry left a point in it, but Kilcoo won dirty ball when it mattered and ran the clock down to run out worthy winners.Kilcoo: Martin McCourt , Niall Branagan, Aidan Branagan , Niall McEvoy, Aaron Branagan, Darryl Branagan, Miceal Rooney, Ryan McEvoy , Dylan Ward , Anthony Morgan, Paul Devlin , Ryan Johnston , Eugene Branagan, Jerome Johnston , Conor Laverty.

It was crazy. Amber was born in her whole sac, she continued.ldquoI did what the midwives told me to do because she was in the water [the sac]. I was already in early labour when I went for a hospital appointment but while they wanted me to stay, I said that I would rather go back home as I wanted to do everything as natural.ldquoThey advised me not to come back in until my waters broke but they didnrsquot break. I came back around .pm and Amber was born two hours later.

The midwe had to break the sac but Amber also seemed to reach out at the same time with her hand. It was just so special to see.Amber, who is now six days old and is thriving well, is one of a number of famous people down through the centuries who share this honour of being born in the lsquocaulrsquo mdash the thin membrane which covers the baby and its amniotic fluid.Emperors and leaders such Alexander the Great, King Charlemagne, Napoleon, the poet Lord Byron and father of modern psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud, and the late flamboyant entertainer Liberace, are all reputed to have been born this way.Seen in many cultures as portentously luckyborn ldquowith a veil over the face, the child is meant to have a lelong affinity with water.A spokesperson for South Eastern Trust which manages the Lagan Valley hospital, confirmed the auspicious delivery.ldquoThis patient laboured naturally and her waters remained unbroken so as a result the baby was born in the amniotic sac.

He recalls that his mystical experience revealed to him that all people are mutually interdependent and all people are essentially good.Signicantly, the revelation led to him leaving his study of medicine and immersing himself in the study of psychology, social anthropology, sociology and African languages. And, during university vacations, Stan engaged in so-called participant observation research as a nursing assistant in psychiatric hospitals.He also played music with an African group known as lsquoThe Kirela Kidsrsquo, two of whose members, Robert and Joshua Sithole were proclaimed to be a foremost penny-whistler and second best guitarist in South Africa respectively at a jazz awards ceremony.It was through these musiciansthat Stan met his future we, Selin Mahlvane, who was herself a singer of traditional African music and a jazz singer.In , the author was awarded both BA and a BSc Science degrees, also receiving a bursary for being the top sociology student which resulted in his engaging in further studies, leading to him receiving an honours degree.After this, Stan engaged in further participant observation studies, this time as a lsquopretending patientrsquo in a mental hospital in Swaziland, subsequently writing this research up as a thesis, entitled, ldquoSituations: a model for the analysis of mental hospital practicesrsquorsquo. He received PhD degree for this research.While he was in Swaziland, Stan married Selin, a black South African. Such a marriage was illegal in South Africa and was banned under the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act. The couplersquos son, Kenneth, was born in Swaziland and was smuggled across the border into South Africa and itrsquos this backstory which forms the genesis of his new book.Already an acclaimed author, Stan argues that the reason psychiatric hospitals and psychiatry were so signicant was because the way hospitals treated patients was equivalent to the way black people were classied and dominated in apartheid South Africa.All this is described in his new book, along with a way to evaluate the therapeutic value or lack of value in staff-patient interactions.When Stan came to Northern Ireland, he became a clinical psychologist, working in psychiatric hospitals. He was also the co-founder of a self-help group for mastering anxiety, panic and stress.Some of the background to this group is contained in his new book, as well as in another publication entitled lsquoSoul On Firersquorsquo mdash a guide to mastering anxiety, which is also available on Amazon.Together with the process of mastering anxiety, Stan also engaged in research into overcoming depression, put together in a book entitled lsquoRising from the Deadrsquo and the process of recovering from alcohol and drug addiction, contained in lsquoVictory of the Spiritrsquo.All this, he says, forms part of an understanding of the radical alternative to psychiatric colonialism.ldquoThe worst part of psychiatry lies in its process of diagnosing so-called mental illness, along with its prescribing of drugs, supposedly for correcting and lsquochemical imbalance in the brainrsquo says the author.Dr Papenfus illustrates that such a chemical imbalance does not exist. In fact, he argues that the ldquofraud involved in creating and medical basis for psychiatry is no more than a myth and there is shown in great detail in the book.Also demonstrated in great depth is what the author describes as the ldquounscientic basis of pharmaceutical companies supposed lsquotestingrsquo of prescribed psychiatric drugs.ldquoThis fraudulence results in millions of peoplersquos lives being ruined, year after year and in one country after another, said Dr Papenfus.ldquoEven children are now becoming a huge market for prescribed psychiatric drugs and some of their extremely dangerous effects are described. The research involved in this exposure calls for a dramatic and urgent response. This is what lsquoRenewing our Livesrsquorsquo provides.Between  and , Dr William Barrington was the leading psychiatrist at the Downshire Hospital in Downpatrick. According to Dr Papenfus, it was during these years that traditional bio-psychiatry was replaced with social psychiatry.ldquoUnder his guidance therapy always included a social dimension, said the author. ldquoGoals were formulated and realised. The personal empowerment of patients included regular reviews of what was going on and how everyone was making sense of everyone .ldquoThe result was that the Downshire Hospital was widely regarded as the best psychiatric facility in Europe. Because Dr Barringtonrsquos way of working was still strikingly held by many nurses, social workers and others, this is what persuaded me to come to work in the Downshire in .But, when he arrived, the author claimed that the ideology of the medical model of mental illness was in force once again and ldquothe dehumanising processes of bio-psychiatry was prominent once more.Despite this, the author says a transformation was still possible ands this is the hope behind his new book.Two copies of the new book have been placed in Downpatrick Library and it is also available on order, from Amazon..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Roy.jpg","title":"Roy Living healthy life to win coveted NI fitness accolade  ","story":"PORTAFERRYrsquoS Roy Livingstone has won the Centra Action Cancer Endeavour Award at the Northern Ireland Health and Fitness Awards.The prestigious event sponsored by Centra mdash held at Belfastrsquos Crowne Plaza and attended by  guests mdash celebrated the outstanding achievements of the local health and fitness industry.The awards were presented by TV personality and fitness advocate Vogue Williams and Q Radiorsquos Ibe Sesay.Roy has gone above and beyond the call of duty to help raise much-needed funds for Centrarsquos charity partner, Action Cancer, cycling from London to Paris and, most recently, a -mile cycle in San Francisco.Congratulating the Portaferry man on his win, Jenner Morton, Centra brand manager, said that over the years, Roy ldquoreally has gone the extra mile when it comes to fundraising for Action Cancer.She continued: ldquoFrom his cycles in Paris and San Francisco alongside local events and initiatives, Roy and the wider team at Centra in Portaferry have made a real impact with the funds they have raised.ldquoFrom everyone at Centra, wersquod like to say a big thank you to Roy.Funds raised by Centrarsquos customers go towards funding the health action programme which educates children of all ages about leading healthier lestyles as well as Action Cancerrsquos so-called big bus which travels across the Province driving home early cancer detection..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Traders.jpg","title":"Traders offered input into Irish Street scheme  ","story":"BUSINESS owners in Downpatrick are to be given a key input into ambitious plans to redevelop the former Irish Street police station site and a number of adjacent empty buildings.Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Department for Communities are helping spearhead a an exciting retail and commercial proposal aimed at transforming the townrsquos economy, with both organisations working alongside the Provincersquos Strategic Investment Board.Last week, the Recorder revealed that a development brief designed to transform the sprawling town centre site as part of a multi-million pound investment was being progressed, with hopes that the document could be completed before the end of the year.During Mondayrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee,council officials confirmed that town centre traders, Downpatrick councillors and relevant public agencies will be involved in discussions to guide the development brief process.When the brief has been agreed, it will be advertised, inviting developers to come forward to transform the site to kick-start a signicant town centre economic regeneration initiative.A formal launch of the brief is also planned before Christmas.Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains are reported to be interested in opening new premises in Downpatrick and view Irish Street as an ideal location as there are currently no other suitable sites available.The development brief will outline what the local authority would like to see developed in Irish Street to maximise the potential of every square inch of available space.Permission has also been secured to purchase an outstanding piece of ground close to the Irish Street car park to allow the ambitious proposal to proceed.Itrsquos almost two years since it was revealed that the former police station site had been earmarked for a major economic regeneration initiative which could potentially include new housing.It is understood that as part of the regeneration scheme, the vacant buildings adjacent to the former police base will be bulldozed to open up a huge area. The development site also includes the council-owned Irish Street car park.However, the former police station mdash which enjoys protected status ndash will not be razed to the ground as part of the ambitious regeneration plan and is set to remain a key feature of the proposed redevelopment project.Downpatrick councillors Dermot Curran and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed progress on developing the brief for the Irish Street redevelopment.Cllr Curran, who has been asking for traders to be involved with helping shape the development brief, is delighted this is going to happen to help shape the future development of the Irish Street site.He said it is critical all key stakeholders are involved in what will be the biggest ever investment in the town centre.Cllr Curran believes that with everyone on board at this early stage, the planned new retail and commercial centre has a signicant chance of succeeding, providing a boost for all businesses in the town.ldquoThis planned development can act as a catalyst for additional town centre investment, increasing footfall and providing a boost for existing businesses who have been at the backbone of the townrsquos economy for generations, he said.ldquoWhile details of the Irish Street scheme were announced almost two years ago, signicant progress is now being made. I have no doubt that the opportunity to redevelop a major town centre will appeal to many in the construction industry.Cllr Curran said the importance of the townrsquos business community being asked for its input into the redevelopment plan which has the potential to attract more shoppers to the town cannot be overstated.Cllr Hanlon agreed that the redevelopment proposal will provide Downpatrick with a much-needed economic boost and welcomed plans to form a stakeholder group to feed into the development brief.She added: ldquoThis forum will be open to all Downpatrick businesses and I would encourage their participation and views to ensure that all ideas are heard and considered.

But such was his passion for Down that there was no way he was going to miss the game.ldquoFor me, that said much about the man he was. He ran the risk of maybe breaking down but through sheer willpower, courage and strength of character he came out triumphant.Doherty, one of the true GAA legends, said Eamonn Burns was never one to look for sympathy or seek comfort.ldquoHe stood on his own two feet and took what came at him. And when the going got tough he was always in there doing his bit for the cause. When you have a man like Eamonn in your corner, how could you fail to come out on top  he continued.Paddy Mo added: ldquoEamonn was a legend. Not just because he was a whole-hearted player who gave everything for the cause at club and county levels, but because he was as honest as the day is long.ldquoHe was a wonderful ambassador for our Association, honourable, dignied and respectful. In my book he was a true legend because of the person that he was. He has left a rich legacy both in a playing context and in the way he carried himself. His memory will linger on.Another colleague of the double All-Ireland winner, Conor Deegan, said he was left ldquonumb and devastated when he learnt of Eamonnrsquos passing.He added: ldquoWe are absolutely destroyed. Only a few weeks ago we were together at Croke Park. He took on the county job when it was not fashionable but nothing was ever about Eamonn there was just no ego with him.

There were breathtaking displays of riders with hoops and torches on fire, made all the more spectacular against the back of the floodlit castle.ldquoThe finale involved le-size inflatable horses, which were manipulated by dancers who moved with the music that filled the air. A spectacular display of culture for all to enjoy.On Sunday morning, the group viewed a historic presentation prepared by one of the historic and cultural associations in Lamorlaye.Ms Patterson explained: ldquoWe were then taken on a walking tour of the old Lamorlaye. The afternoon was free for the group to view a dressage display with ballet dancers at the Diane Stables. There was also a beautul show with Samurai warriors on horseback.ldquoThe activities just went on and on and the group was treated to a visit to a wine-making area in Gouvieux before being taken to the troglodyte quarter of Gouvieux and for a surprise dinner in a cave.The dinner was prepared by member of the committee and made all the more special because of the sing-song started by Herveacute Moula, chairwoman of the Lamorlaye Comiteacute de Jumelage, supported by Cllr Andrews and guests from Ballynahinch. The atmosphere was relaxed and this was the end to a lovely day.On the final day of the visit, the group was invited to view the facilities at the Golf du Lys, an exclusive golf course, which has facilities to host conferences, weddings and events, along with outdoor and indoor tennis courts, an outdoor pool and golf courses.Ms Patterson said: ldquoThe golf club has already hosted some players from Ballynahinch and they have asked uswe are interested in organising a reciprocal golf tournament with the local golf courses in Co Down.ldquoWe hope we will be able to take them up on this proposal when the French visit us in .ldquoOur final lunch was in a redundant factory complex which has been converted in to a stunning hotel and restaurant ndash testament to how an old property can be re-generated for the good of the community.ldquoThe programme for the weekend provided us with ample opportunity to meet up with those who had travelled over to Ballynahinch in July and to meet with some old faces from previous exchanges between Lamorlaye and Ballynahinch. It is our hope we will be able to sign a twinning charter with both the local council for the next five to ten years.Ms Patterson said that the two pilot exchange trips have shown the relationship is still as vibrant as ever, with new people getting involved on both sides.She added: ldquoWe are hoping to be in a position to host a small group over the St Patrickrsquos weekend and to take a small group out to Lamorlaye for the Bastille Day celebrations. We always welcome new families who would be interested in hosting French people and who would be interested in travelling out to France as part of the exchange.ldquoThose travelling pay for their own flights and the Rowallane and Slieve Croob Community Twinning Group has facilitated the visits through the generous support of Newry Mourne and Down Council. We would also like to thank Cllr Robert Burgess for helping us to revive the Lamorlaye Twinning Project and Cllr Andrews for representing the local council and accompanying the group to Lamorlaye and for his rendition of the Marseillaise in French..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/ource srcset=/resources/images/10532898.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"bandstand adam doherty","story":"What genre genres do you consider your music to be How long have you been performing Where do you perform What is your favourite song to play and why What has been your biggest gig to date Any funny gig rehearsal stories Who are your major influences Do you write your own songs  What inspires your songwriting What would be your dream gig Best moment as a musician so far What is the most unusual venue you have played What is your lsquogo-torsquo encore song Whatrsquos the best thing about performing Do you always perform solo or do you also play with a band Do you have any gigs coming up Any last words This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

For some reason I recall a middle aged woman in the packed crowd wearing a DUP , ,  sticker.The concept of giving Dublin a say in NI at a time when it was perceived to be doing little to stop a long terrorist campaign, was easy even for a teenager to understand.Yet I have only fully come to grasp the AIA’s signicance decades later, both the long-term intentions of the signatories, UK Ireland, and its impact.It also took a while to see what its signing said about the preceding failures of unionist leaders, and what the response to the AIA said about loyalism’s declining power.Not infrequently in  we report on developments that have their origins in , such as the recent episode in which the Taoiseach visited Hillsborough Castle without being hosted by a Secretary of State, days after the NIO advisor, Lord Caine, who had always insisted on such accompaniment, was not kept on his post.Despite the inappropriate circumstances of his visit, Leo Varadkar then used British state property to publicly attack a UK government that was not there to defend itself.As is the enduring pattern of NIO and British weakness in the face of such relentless Irish partisanship, London stayed politely silent in response to this subtle over reach.A well connected Westminster figure tells me that unionism, whatever its present dficulties, is in a better position than , when it had few friends in the House of Commons, hence why NI MPs were unaware of the coming Thatcher volte face.Kate Hoey: The Brexit plan ides the UK, so I will not be voting for it todayLord Empey: The Union is not safe in the DUP’s hands Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"There are now younger Tory MPs who grew up through the Troubles, or older ones who served here, who instinctively view NI as British.Another dference between the AIA and Boris Johnson’s u-turn is that two years ago, in the  backstop, London made clear its determination to avoid an Irish land border, so we have had time to get used to the risk of a sudden, forced Irish Sea one.But even so, there are key similarities with .In both cases, the climbdown was by two Tory prime ministers who had used emphatic language in defence of their full support for Northern Ireland’s undiluted place in the UK .In both cases, the number of Conservative MPs who were prepared to support unionists in defiance of their own prime minister was miniscule. In , a mere  Tory backbenchers rebelled against the AIA, out of Mrs Thatcher’s vast parliamentary reserves of almost  Conservative MPs.Today, we do not know how many Tories will reject the Boris Johnson Brexit plan, but it is expected to , or fewer than that, and not even all of them will do so on the basis of their support for the Union.This does not mean that Conservative MPs in  or today have been disinterested in the Union. To an overwhelming extent, they support it. But, when under pressurethere is only so far they will go to the wire to protect it.Both votes,  and today, also reflect a fundamental truth that no unionist should ever forget: our numerical near insignicance within the United Kingdom.Even the derisory Tory rebellion of  MPs in  is greater in number than there have ever been Northern Ireland unionist MPs, in any one Parliamentary session.Unionists are around .% of the population of the UK, and about .%of the population of the EU.There was only so long that unionist concerns were going to be allowed to hold up the might of Europe in its desire to strike a deal with a major nation state, the UK. But this latest political abandonment of unionists involves a factor that was absent previously: the views of Middle England.Middle England’s view of Northern Ireland has, perhaps mercully, never been put to the test before.It had not been asked whether or not it wants Scotland or Northern Ireland until the Scottish independence referendum of . I was alarmed by polls that showed % of English people wanted Scotland to stay. It was cited to encourage Scots to vote to remain in the UK, but it was in fact quite a lowish level of southern solidarity.Recently there were surveys that found that in a choice between Brexit and the Union, more people in England would choose Brexit.Parliament is sitting today, and last sat on a Saturday in  for the Falklands war. A task force was sent halfway across the world to defend almost uninhabited islands.The Troubles then was ongoing, and had been for  years, and would persist for another decade. Around , British servicemen were killed in the Falklands and NI, yet the UK public never rebelled against that sacrice.Now the population of England, which makes up the great bulk of the UK, and its establishment Tories, seems willing to make constitutional concessions over UK territory, on a scale that was resisted for decades despite relentless violence, all on behalf of a cause — Brexit — that had little traction a few years ago outside a eurosceptic fringe.As to the merits of this deal, I am still trying to absorb it. Respected pro Union voices including Lord Trimble, Ruth Dudley Edwards and the Spectator magazine think it is a good compromise for NI. Perhaps so. But it is a massive turning point in British history that will take decades to assess. I think, overall, it is a bit better than Theresa May’s deal. Yet there is no disguising the fact that soon we are likely to have a major, and probably permanent, internal border in the Irish Sea, something no other nation on earth would allow to ide its territory.Five years ago most unionists would have found that prospect unthinkable and appalling.• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editor©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"our single goal has been to secure the best possible brexit deal for agriculture ufu  ","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive any of the following newsletters from Belfast News Letter, via email Daily news, news features and service updates\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". ss+s+  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+]]]]]]]]]]]]]] initInArticleOnlySiteText, initArticleSiteText, isInArticleOnlyTemplateReady. s isArticleTemplateReady. s addCustomTextToSiteTemplate addSiteName.html  TriggerPrompt url  https:survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site_oqfshupypyivmsxzqude + url +  +:  + random + .getTime + afterel.setAttribute head  document[]  document[]headChildTriggerPrompt   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business Subscribe#jp #login-widget #login-flip.flip RegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Opinion Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Offbeat People Read This News Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health People Read This Sport Football Rugby Union Motorcycling More Sport Sport Opinion Whats On Arts  Entertainment Things To Do Nightle Lestyle Retro Cars Homes Must Read           Our single goal has been to secure the best possible Brexit deal for agriculture: UFUUlster Farmers Union president Ivor Ferguson.

Claims to have uncovered conspiracies involving the UFU are just plain wrong. We are all aware of the consequences of political failure, but not only are we not the cause, we are not even a remote part of the equation.“Our interests are firmly focused on what is best for the future of farming families. We have no control over how others choose to use our position for their ends.Not to have spoken out about a no-deal outcome and the catastrophic impact it would have on family farm businesses would have been a huge disservice to our members.” Mr Ferguson continued: “Brexit was never going to be easy. Unpicking the UK’s  plus years relationship with the EU is a huge challenge.It demands compromise from both the UK and EU. Despite claims by some that are wholly wrong, we have always called for a solution that allows farmers here unfettered access to the GB market, while maintaining long-standing trading relationships between NI and ROI. .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button “We represent , farming families with erse views and political affiliations. It is unrealistic to expect our members to agree on everything. Brexit is a contentious issue, and people’s view are not based solely on whether or not the EU delivers for farming. “We were clear from the outset that we would not tell our members how to vote. But we also said we did not see a compelling argument that farming would fare better outside the EU. We have robust, logical, democratic processes to establish positions on issues, and Brexit has been extensively debated through those processes.“Since the referendum result our single goal has been to secure the best possible Brexit deal for agriculture.

Part of the street was bombed in World War Two and only these few old houses remain. We learnt that the house is going to be torn down in the near future.“We ended up sitting in the neighbours’ house having tea. The hospitality has been amazing. This trip was to make Dora May’s dream come true. It’s been even more.”Her eldest son Steven said: “As a family we’ve often done cruises in the past, but this is a very special trip because we’re going back to our roots. It’s been an emotional five days.”Unable to make the trip this week were Dora May’s daughters Susan and the late Janet and sons James and Andrew.Her son Mark commented: “Some of us have a really strong interest in coming back. The people here take great pride in their beautul country.” Given that Hannah Mary had a lot of brothers and sisters who stayed in Northern Ireland the family are hopeful they may have more relatives here.

Ministers have attacked our independent judges. The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change. People are already suffering and nature, upon which we all depend, is collapsing. Governments need to be honest about this and act upon the crisis.ldquoWe were over the moon with the response from Penarth residents, who walked with us or cheered us on, the day really gave us hope that the message is seeping in and change can happen. Myself and others had been feeling quite down because climate change is scary, we are worried about our childrenrsquos futures. Lets hope this walk leads to more local action on climate change.The young people on the march also spoke about their concerns.ldquoI went on strike because people cut down rainforests just to be able to eat meat, said seven-year-old Mylo Kitchiner. ldquoIf we keep cutting down trees we wonrsquot have oxygen to breath.

Any proposals would be subject to full consultation, meaning all interested parties would have an opportunity to share their views before any decision is made.ldquoShould proposals progress, they would also be subject to separate planning consultation.ldquoThis would include consideration of highways and traffic concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have had nine spaces taken away, which means  cars will be battling for spaces.ldquoWe understand the need to reduce cars and danger in the area but the way itrsquos been done will lead to reductions in house prices and make parking dficult for current residents.

A former head of two other schools in Gwent, he is clearly proud of his school and all they have accomplished.ldquoItrsquos a wonderful school and everyone here has worked so hard to make it that way, he said. ldquoBut it does face challenges.Like other head teachers in Penarth, Mr Rees had signed the open letter to the Welsh Government calling for fairer funding for Vale schools earlier this year. He had discussed coming in to the school on weekends to clean the toilets himself to help balance budgets. But he is firmly optimistic.ldquoBetween kind donations and fundraising efforts from our PTA, renting out the school hall, and younger members of staff taking on some extra burdens we are just about able to balance our budgets, he said. ldquoTo be honest, next year might start looking grim, but wersquore keeping our heads high.ldquoWith that said, wersquove been working hard on incorporating new initiatives and the new curriculum, we have a great crop of pupils and staff morale is high. We are very positive here.ldquoItrsquos also our th anniversary this year, so we have loads of ex-staff and pupils coming through the doors to say hello, a celebratory PTA barbecue and more planned.Taking a tour around the school, this positivity is reflected in students and staff alike. Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This must be investigated.ldquoThis is a deliberate attempt to present a  equivalence between genuine political canvassing and those who would wish to scam vulnerable people.ldquoMany people will be deeply unsettled by this behaviour from Cairns at the same time as the Tories are attempting to suppress votes by making it a requirement to show ID at polling stations- a move that will disproportionately affect working class, ethnic minority and young voters.ldquoThis is not how politics should be done.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Also, many of the immigrant families are moving where due the uncertainty of their status on the outcome of Brexit.”However Mr Buckley said: ”It is very sad to see that unfortunately Richmount Playgroup has had to close its doors. I would like to pay tribute to the staff and community leaders who had the vision to open up the playgroup.“Having liaised and worked directly with the the Playgroup committee, parents and the education authority to try and save the playgroup it became clear that under the current low numbers it was going to be hard to sustain.“The committee took the decision to inform parents that the playgroup would be closing. I understand this has been dficult for parents and staff involved.“I must stress despite what is being reported, at no time was it indicated by the committee, parents or indeed the Education Authority that this decision was Brexit related.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals.

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.  Danske Bank’s Conor Lambe said there were still a number of possibilities for what might happen over the next  days, with the UK due to leave the EU on October . Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election. But predictions were \"incredibly dficult\", he said. \"Businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month,\" he said. The .% is down from the bank’s previous forecasts, delivered in June, that growth would hit % in  and .% in . In its latest Northern Ireland Quarterly Sectoral Forecasts report, Danske Bank said that the Northern Ireland economy likely expanded in the second quarter of the year, but the rate of growth over the first half of the year remained modest. “We have revised our forecast for economic growth in Northern Ireland downwards for both  and ,” he said. “This largely reflects the modest data for the first half of the year, increased Brexit-related uncertainty and the weaker global economic environment. “Assuming that a no-deal Brexit is avoided, we expect the Northern Ireland economy to grow by .% in  and .% in , below the .% we expect UK GDP to grow by in both years. “A combination of strong wage growth and more stable inflation is likely to lead to solid growth in consumer spending, but the lack of clarity around the UK’s future relationship with the EU is expected to continue holding back business investment.” It says the information and communication, and professional, scientic  technical services sectors are expected to be the fastest growing parts of the economy over the next two years. Meanwhile, output in the construction sector is forecast to rise by .% in  and .% in , while expected output growth in the wholesale and retail trade sector has been revised down to .% in  and .% in . Public administration and defence is continuing to have the weakest outlook of all the sectors of the Northern Ireland economy, with output expected to contract by .% in , and by a further .% in . “Over the coming weeks, a number of potential Brexit options are possible, including a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of the Article  period or a general election,” Mr Lambe said. “Predicting what will happen next in the Brexit process is incredibly dficult, but businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/BOI11_web.jpg","title":"bank of ireland uk empowering colleagues to support local communities","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by Ulster Business Paul Slevin, Alison Mitchell, Ian Sheppard, Sally Irvine, Christine Graham and Paul Magee With a purpose to enable customers, colleagues and communities to thrive, Bank of Ireland UK staff are building on a long history of supporting local charities and community organisations. Ulster Business speaks to Northern Ireland managing director Ian Sheppard, and learns more about how colleagues are being empowered to play an active role in the local communities where they live and work Bank of Ireland UK sees developing its colleagues and helping customers and communities to thrive as part of its DNA, according to Ian Sheppard, managing director in Northern Ireland.From key charity partnerships, to fundraising, volunteering, sponsorship and more, Ian says the desire for Bank of Ireland UK is to make a positive impact by empowering colleagues to make a dference.“When I speak to my colleagues, I hear how really active and involved they are in their own community,” Ian says. “There are so many examples and I never cease to be amazed by their passion and commitment.An important partnership for the bank is with Alzheimer’s Society, its flagship charity for the last two years. In that time around £, has been raised in Northern Ireland, but as Ian explains it’s about more than fundraising.“We realised that not only can we help them financially, but there are resources we can share and opportunities we can offer which can help to signicantly raise the charity’s profile and raise much needed funds.”One example in which the bank has supported Alzheimer’s Society in this way is through its own long-running partnership with Ulster Rugby.“We donated our advertising and promotion activity for a televised game at the Kingspan Stadium making the charity ‘Sponsor for a Day’. This included using their logo on the back of the Ulster Rugby jerseys, taking over the pitch side boards and inviting a group of people living with dementia, their family and carers to the game – helping to get their brand message out to not only a stadium with capacity of , people but to a much wider TV audience.”Alzheimer’s Society sees some fantastic people giving their time to help others. That’s no clearer than its Side by Side programme, which Bank of Ireland UK helps to fund.The photograph on the front of this edition of the magazine taken at the Grand Opera House in Belfast features Mary Dalzell a Side by Side volunteer, alongside Hazel Whiteside, who has been living with dementia for two years.They share a love of music, theatre and cinema and the Side by Side programme, which re-connects people with dementia to their communities by doing the things they love, has not only put a smile on both their faces but has had a positive impact on their lives.There are so many people impacted by dementia and Alzheimers in our local communities, and its touching so many people’s lives, taking this as our motivation, the bank now has almost , staff trained as Dementia Friends.The bank’s ‘Give Together’ programme means staff can take one day a year to spend the time working with a charity or community organisation of their choice. “This day can involve anything from gardening work to painting a youth centre,” Ian says“Beyond Alzheimer’s Society, colleagues are helping many other organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK through its Relay for Le Legenderry, the Wooden Spoon children’s rugby charity, and Space NI, which offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community.” You canabout some of the good work colleagues have done further on in this feature.“We are also committed to reflecting the community by developing a erse and modern workforce – which is part-and-parcel of a progressive company,” Ian says. “It’s something that current and future employees expect in their employer. For us its part of our DNA, something that’s always been there but we are now putting a clear and visible structure around it,” Ian says.This has included being a founding member of FuSIoN – the Financial Services Inclusion Network which drives to support and promote LGBT+ professionals across the sector, becoming JAM Card members – allowing staff to knowcustomers with a communication barrier need ‘just a minute’, as well as recently being awarded the Diversity Charter Mark.“Our community involvement is something we are very clear about - something I’m passionate about and it’s an easy ask to get staff engaged. It’s very natural, and it has always been developed from the ground up,” Ian says.He believes this contributes to the huge numbers of staff doing their bit – enabling their own local communities to thrive.  ALISON MITCHELLA customer service manager for Bank of Ireland UK in Londonderry, Alison has worked for the bank for  years, but her motivation for fundraising and support for Alzheimer’s Society began in , following her mother-in-law’s diagnosis with dementia. Alison trained at her local hospital to become a dementia volunteer and learned so much she asked Alzheimer’s Society to run similar sessions in her own branch to enable staff to better assist customers with dementia.Sadly, Alison’s mother-in-law passed away in May of this year but to mark her passing and to raise vital funds in her memory, Alison took part in Alzheimer’s Society Cupcake Day. Initial plans to simply sell cupcakes within her own branch changed rapidly as colleagues from nearby branches heard of the event and wanted to support both Alison and the charity.  Faced with orders for more than  cupcakes, Alison requested a Give Together day, which is time given by the bank to both iniduals and teams to give back to their communities. Alison says: “I was in the kitchen from am to pm baking and icing but it was worth it. The event raised £, which Bank of Ireland UK matched doubling the amount raised to £,. “I could not have achieved that without the support of family, colleagues and the wider business. I was proud to raise the funds in my mother-in-law’s memory and I am proud to work for an organisation that not only values our role in the wider community but supports it too.” CHRISTINE GRAHAMChristine Graham has helped to raise funds for Cancer Research UK through the Relay for Le “Legenderry” event held in St. Columb’s Park, Londonderry.The Derry-based senior business manager for Bank of Ireland UK has personally been touched by cancer as she lost two close family members to the disease. Her young great niece was also diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in  and is now doing well, but seeing the impact a cancer diagnosis has on a family inspired Christine to get involved with the Relay for Le event.“Our event truly is ‘legenderry’,” she says. It is a -hour relay race that brings the whole community together to celebrate the lives of cancer survivors, to remember those lost to the disease, to fight back by increasing our knowledge of cancer and by raising money to fund le-saving cancer research.”In just three years the event has raised over £, for Cancer Research UK with Christine helping to raise £, in  – not only the most successful Relay for Le event in the UK this year but all funds raised in Northern Ireland stays here.  Christine values the support she has had from the bank who promote the event to the wider community and from her colleagues who enter teams.“Relay for Le is for all ages and stages, all shapes and sizes,” she says. It’s cross community and intergenerational and the atmosphere every year is electric.”Plans are already underway for Relay for Le  which promises to be another massive event. PAUL MAGEEPaul Magee, associate director of the corporate banking team, became involved with the Ulster Region Committee for Wooden Spoon, the Children’s Charity of Rugby, five years ago after he successfully completed the charity’s Four Peaks Challenge, reaching the summits of the UK and Ireland’s highest peaks. He is now an active committee member for Wooden Spoon, helping to raise funds to provide le-enhancing experiences for disadvantaged and disabled children. “All funds raised in Ulster stay in the region and benefit the children here,” Paul says. “For instance, we provided £, to the Mae Murray Foundation to buy specialist equipment for the first fully accessible beach in Ulster at Benone Strand. When we created the access to the beach, one parent was very emotional as he watched his teenage daughter in the sea for the first time. It’s those occasions where we’re responding to a need within the community that makes the effort worthwhile.”Wooden Spoon has funded numerous charity projects, most recently £, for a new multi-sensory room at Parkview Special School in Lisburn and purchasing a horse for Riding for the Disabled Association in Coleraine, a charity that enhances children’s lives every day.  With his passion for and involvement in Wooden Spoon, Paul is grateful for the support Bank of Ireland has given him in his role with the organisation, specically the corporate banking team who value his dedication to making a dference. He says: “The bank has been fantastic – I appreciate the flexibility the team offers in the lead up to events and my colleagues often attend Wooden Spoon fundraisers. I’ve also benefited from the bank’s Give Together initiative, which offers days of paid leave that employees can use for volunteering. The bank’s support has helped facilitate my commitment to Wooden Spoon, where I can really see and be a part of the impact the charity has on the local community.” SALLY IRVINEOver the last  years Sally Irvine’s coffee mornings have become a highlight in the office calendar, in turn raising more than £, for MacMillan Cancer Support and funding  days of specialist nursing care for cancer patients across Northern Ireland.Sally, a business lending and credit governance manager at Bank of Ireland UK, arranged her first Macmillan Coffee Morning in  following a colleague’s cancer diagnosis. She found herself wanting to do something to help people living with cancer and so took the plunge and decided to be a host as part of Macmillan’s biggest coffee morning fundraising event. From the outset, Sally had tremendous support from her team members and the wider business, and this has contributed to the ongoing success of the event.The bank plays a huge part in ensuring Sally can deliver the event each year by giving her support through their Give Together scheme.Sally says: “The coffee morning has become a very special occasion and a great day of fun where people from across the bank come together to have a wee cuppa and a cake and take time to catch up while raising money for a really important cause. One in two of us will face cancer at some time in our lives and I am passionate about continuing to fundraise to provide the specialist nursing care that’s so vital for those living with cancer.”Plans are already underway for this year’s Macmillan Coffee Morning and Sally is hopeful the annual fundraiser will continue to hold a special place in the office calendar. PAUL SLEVINBranch manager at Bank of Ireland UK in Newry, Paul Slevin is someone who embodies the bank’s ethos of community involvement through his role with the charity Space NI.  Space NI offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"We’ve got a great new deal that takes back control — now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.\" Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said: “This agreement is a fair compromise between the EU and the UK. It is testament to the commitment and willingness of both sides to do what is best for EU and UK citizens. We now have a newly agreed Protocol that protects peace and stability on the island of Ireland and fully protects our Single Market. I hope that we can now bring this over the line and provide the certainty our citizens and businesses so deserve.” Michel Barnier, the European Commissions chief negotiator, said: “We had dficult discussions over the past days. We have managed to find solutions that fully respect the integrity of the Single Market. We created a new and legally operative solution to avoid a hard border, and protect peace and stability on the island of Ireland. It is a solution that works for the EU, for the UK and for people and businesses in Northern Ireland.” The DUP has said it could not support the deal brokered by Mr Johnson. So, what deal was agreed  A statement from the European Commission says: “In terms of regulations, Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of rules related to the EUs Single Market in order to avoid a hard border: legislation on goods, sanitary rules for veterinary controls , rules on agricultural production marketing, VAT and excise in respect of goods, and state aid rules. “In terms of customs, the EU-UK Single Customs Territory, as agreed in November , has been removed from the Protocol on Ireland   Northern Ireland, at the request of the current UK government. EU and UK negotiators have now found a new way to achieve the goal of avoiding a customs border on the island of Ireland, while at the same time ensuring Northern Ireland remains part of the UKs customs territory. This agreement fully protects the integrity of the EUs Single Market and Customs Union, and avoids any regulatory and customs checks at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. “Finally, the EU and the UK have agreed to create a new mechanism on ‘consent, which will give the Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly a decisive voice on the long-term application of relevant EU law in Northern Ireland. The Commission has been in close contact with the Irish government on this point.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
