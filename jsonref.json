Did Prince Harry tell him about his concerns in 2015?\u0027Just one of the many questions the Metropolitan Police could ask father and son if they choose to investigate.\u0027Harry first met Mr Mahfouz in 2013 at a pub in Chelsea, west London, owned by Mark Dyer, a former royal equerry, The Sunday Times revealed.They discussed the duke\u0027s charity Sentebale, set up in 2006 to help people in Lesotho and Botswana affected by Aids, following his gap year in Africa.The newspaper reported the pair met again at Clarence House the following year after Charles had also met Mr Mahfouz, where Harry allegedly joked: \u0027Has father beaten me to it and got the money?\u0027In February 2013, Mr Mahfouz donated £50,000 to Sentebale. Later that year he gave £10,000 to Walking With The Wounded, another charity of which Harry was patron.A spokesman for the duke said: \u0027The duke had one planned meeting with this donor eight years ago, did not introduce him to any members of the Royal Family, and expressed his concerns about the donor.\u0027The Prince\u0027s Foundation is being investigated by the Scottish charities regulator over claims it accepted a six-figure sum from a wealthy Russian donor which was later rejected by its ethics committee. An independent investigation into the \u0027cash for access\u0027 allegations commissioned by the foundation last week found \u0027evidence of communication and co-ordination\u0027 between Mr Fawcett and \u0027fixers regarding honorary nominations for a donor between 2014-18\u0027.Sentebale said: \u0027It is entirely normal and legitimate for patrons to meet potential donors, on whose support we depend. This includes the two donations received in 2013-14 from the Mahfouz Foundation – donations that we would not have accepted if we believed there was anything improper behind them.\u0027  Harry throws his own father under the bus  By Rebecca English To say that the Prince of Wales\u0027 relationship with his sons is complex is an understatement.Both William and Harry have historically accused Charles of being a \u0027laissez-faire\u0027 father – one more preoccupied with weighty affairs of state and his considerable philanthropic legacy than bathtime, wrestling matches and bedtime stories.It\u0027s not entirely fair, of course. The reality when it comes to the Royal Family – as with any family – is always more complicated.Like other royals, Charles was \u0027deeply, deeply\u0027 hurt at the manner of Harry and Meghan\u0027s bitter exit from the family in 2020.Still, as Harry and William\u0027s relationship descended into acrimony, their father tried to remain a non-partisan figure – partly because Charles has always shied away from personal confrontation with his sons, but also because he genuinely wanted to retain a Swiss-like neutrality between them.But, while disappointing, the statement from the prince\u0027s Los Angeles-based spokesman effectively throwing his father \u0027under a bus\u0027 over the \u0027cash for honours\u0027 investigation did not come as much of a surprise. The comment, which was belatedly issued after a newspaper highlighted Harry\u0027s own links with Saudi billionaire Mahfouz Marei Mubarak bin Mahfouz, was at pains to try to emphasise the younger prince\u0027s own foresight. It glossed over Harry\u0027s private meeting with Mahfouz in a close friend\u0027s pub in Chelsea – and a subsequent encounter at Clarence House where he was said to have joked: \u0027Has father beaten me to it and got the money?\u0027Much as there is the notion of collective responsibility at Cabinet level, so is it within the folds of the Royal Family: defend your position directly and to the point by all means, but not at the expense of your nearest and dearest.Harry\u0027s statement, however, was liberally sprinkled with digs at his father – the reference to \u0027the CBE scandal\u0027, for example. Then there was the suggestion that the younger prince and his advisers saw sense at the earliest possible opportunity, when Charles\u0027 former senior aide Michael Fawcett – and presumably the Prince of Wales himself – did not.As for the claim that Harry \u0027expressed his concerns\u0027 about the donor... well, to whom? Certainly no one within his father\u0027s household has any recollection about this at all.Indeed, I understand that Charles wasn\u0027t even aware until this weekend that his son had met Mahfouz in a west London pub, let alone encouraged his charity to accept any money from him.If Harry was that concerned about the Saudi billionaire, surely he could have warned his father, possibly when he saw him at his London residence the same day.It was also no secret, subsequently, that Mahfouz had become a major donor to Charles\u0027 charitable endeavours – he had a wood named after him at Dumfries House, the Scottish seat of his charitable empire, after all.Contrary to claims in the BBC\u0027s recent controversial documentary on royals and the media that the three royal households are all too quick \u0027brief\u0027 against each other, Clarence House was again maintaining a dignified silence last night.But one loyal friend of the Prince of Wales felt obliged to ask: \u0027If Harry indeed had such deep concern about this man and his \u0027motives\u0027, then why on earth did he not tell his charity, Sentebale, to just hand the £50,000 he had given them back?\u0027Prince Charles \u0027deeply shocked \u0026amp hurt\u0027 by Harry and pair have barely spoken in 8 monthsPrince Harry and Charles: has their fragile relationship been damaged beyond repair?"},{"url":null,"title":"Overweight detective told stop drinking gallons coke wins 10 000","story":"Share this article Mr Ley-Morgan said the force was not uncaring and had made a lot of adjustments for the officer who was \u0027a very useful member of the organisation\u0027. In July 2018 over lunch at Barnstaple police station DC Moth told DS Marvelly that she was \u0027fed up\u0027 with people assuming her weight contributed to her condition. The tribunal previously heard that in February 2019 Professor John Harrison from the force\u0027s Occupational Health department delivered a report on how the illness affected DC Moth\u0027s ability to do her job.He explained that Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition that requires people to learn to live with the condition and modify their lifestyle.In the unlikely event of a situation becoming violent, in Professor Harrison\u0027s view, DC Moth would be able to protect herself and come to the aid of a fellow officer.However, he added that she was not fit to undergo a fitness test and therefore could not undergo officer safety training. DC Moth said her weight was not a result of her diet but due to the medication she had to take for her chronic condition.DS Marvelly said he did not dispute that but claimed he saw her regularly drink \u0027gallons of Coca Cola\u0027. However, DC Moth said she only downed zero calorie and decaffeinated coke.The employment tribunal judge, Alastair Smail, said DS Marvelly was not acting in bad faith but the conversations \u0027did have the effect of humiliating her\u0027.He said the reference to her drinking gallons of Coca Cola indicated an unprofessional tone and concluded DC Moth was \u0027harassed\u0027 by his comments.Yesterday DC Moth, who still works for the force, broke down in tears as she said: \u0027I just want to do my job.\u0027The policewoman said she was not able to do fitness tests but one day aspired to be promoted to a sergeant.Judge Alastair Smail said DS Marvelly\u0027s comments became personal and were not appropriate for the professional relationship between them.He added that DS Marvelly acted in good faith but his comments had an upsetting effect which was unfortunate.The judge said £10,000 in compensation was for injury to feelings.He also made a series of recommendations so the officer can continue to excel in her duties.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Matt Hancock 43 reveals kept dyslexia secret 20 years","story":"Share this article He wrote: \u0027Even though after the diagnosis and training, I understood more and was able to read and write more confidently, I still held onto what I felt was the embarrassment of having dyslexia. \u0027I made some bad mistakes.

However, she apologised for the incident.In a letter giving her a written warning, the university \u0027accepted that Dr Plaut\u0027s loudness was largely unintentional, but expressed concern at her apparent inability to moderate it\u0027.At a return to work meeting in April of that year, the panel heard her relationship with the university\u0027s senior management soured further when she suggested one of her bosses was not open to criticism in his role as head of equality.Bosses \u0027seized\u0027 upon that comment to launch further disciplinary action against her, the tribunal was told, even though the academic concerned did not want it pursued.When, soon after, another of Dr Plaut\u0027s students told the university he wished to change lecturers, bosses falsely told him he could only do so if he complained about her.It resulted in Dr Plaut facing a fresh allegation of \u0027frequently shouting during meetings with a PhD student causing them stress and anxiety\u0027.The tribunal found senior management including Provost Janice Kay wanted to get rid of Dr Plaut.\u0027It is plain that (they) all wanted Dr Plaut dismissed and set that in train\u0027, the report said.The physicist was suspended again and sacked following a disciplinary hearing in December 2019.Finding the university guilty of harassment, victimisation and unfair dismissal, Employment Judge Paul Housego criticised the way an academic of such long standing could have been treated.\u0027This is a very large organisation, of very high reputation, and high professional standards in dealing with the careers of its academics are to be expected,\u0027 he said.\u0027This obligation is the greater when dealing with someone who has spent 30 years working for them. Senior management had decided that Dr Plaut would not be tolerated further.\u0027The good things she had done over the years were given no weight.\u0027The Tribunal does not doubt but for some people Dr Plaut\u0027s approach to life was highly uncomfortable, but that fails to appreciate that this is a façade behind which the evidence is of a long serving dedicated and caring academic.\u0027Judge Housego suggested one way of dealing with Dr Plaut\u0027s perceived shouting was to be given help and an opportunity to change her approach.Dr Plaut - whose additional claims of racial and sex discrimination were dismissed by the panel - will now be awarded compensation at a later date."},{"url":null,"title":"Bullish Dominic Raab says Plan B Covid restrictions NOT required","story":"Share this article There were 6,381 Covid cases in the last 24 hours, up 180 per cent in a week. This was down on yesterday\u0027s figure of 11,000, but tens of thousands of fewer tests were carried out.  Professor Spector, who runs the Covid ZOE symptom study, said that in around 10 days\u0027 time the UK could have more cases of Omicron than some countries it had put on the travel red list.He added: \u0027The official estimates are about 350-odd Omicron cases, and because the current testing is missing a lot of those, it\u0027s probably at least 1,000 to 2,000 I would guess at the moment.\u0027And we are expecting this to be doubling about every two days at the moment, so if you do your maths – say assumed it\u0027s 1,000 at the moment, and you think it\u0027s going to be doubling every two days, you can see that those numbers are going to be pretty (high) certainly in about 10 days time.\u0027But the Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab ruled out any further Christmas curbs this morning as he hailed the vaccination programme as Britain\u0027s way out of the Omicron crisis.He told the Today programme: \u0027We\u0027re doing everything that can be done to tackle the risk that we face, and we\u0027re doing it in the proportionate way that doesn\u0027t create other risks and other challenges.\u0027Pressed on why the Government is not implementing Plan B, he said: \u0027We don\u0027t think Plan B is required. Why? Because of the success of the vaccine programme. We\u0027ve got 118 million doses dispensed.\u0027Dr Barrett, director of the Covid-19 genomics initiative at the Wellcome Institute, said that there were still many unknowns about Omicron that could determine whether more curbs are needed.He told the Today programme: \u0027The really critical question, of course, is how many of those cases of which there will likely be a large number will lead to severe disease?\u0027And a number of people including Dr Fauci (chief medical adviser to US president), as you mentioned, have hypothesised that this variant may be more mild or less likely to cause severe disease than previous variants of the virus.\u0027I think what we have seen so far in South Africa, for example, is possibly consistent with that, but it\u0027s really much too soon to say, and the reason for that is that this variant seems to be able to infect iniduals who either have been vaccinated or previously have been infected.\u0027And we know that second infections or breakthrough infections of vaccinated iniduals tend to be more mild. So the fact that so far we have seen not very many severe cases of Omicron, maybe because it is infecting these iniduals with some amount of immunity and that\u0027s good news that they aren\u0027t having tonnes of severe disease, but I think it is too soon to assume that fundamentally Omicron is more mild than say Delta.\u0027Doctors in South Africa have insisted that most patients suffer only mild illness, with the US\u0027 top Covid expert Dr Anthony Fauci claiming yesterday it \u0027doesn\u0027t look like there\u0027s a great degree of severity to it\u0027. But British scientists, including the Government\u0027s own, have warned against the narrative that it is a weaker strain, warning that it could put significant pressure on the NHS by virtue of the fact it can infect more people. One mathematical modeller predicted there could be up to 3,000 hospital admissions per day in the UK in January if Omicron takes off domestically — compared to the 4,000 per day at the peak last year. Dr Jeffrey Barrett reiterated that even if the strain is milder, if it is extremely infectious it could put significant pressure on the NHS.\u0027The potential problem is that even if that\u0027s a very small fraction, a small fraction of a really big number can still cause problems. \u0027It kind of has a set of mutations in its genome, some of which we\u0027ve seen before, and others of which we\u0027ve only predicted, to make it bind very tightly to human cells to latch on and infect them.\u0027So that probably helps it transmit and it also has mutations in many of the positions which are known to be the places where antibodies that we make from vaccines for example, latch on to the virus.\u0027And so because those have been changed, it\u0027s highly likely that this virus will be less well neutralised by vaccines.\u0027Again, we\u0027ll see that with sort of laboratory data in a few weeks, but the speed at which it is moving through both vaccinated countries and countries with a lot of previous infection like South Africa, are strongly implicating that it can indeed evade some amount of immunity. "},{"url":null,"title":"Lib Dem election candidate issues grovelling apology Goebbels tweet","story":"Share this articleLib Dem candidate forced into grovelling apology after \u0027comparing Priti Patel to Nazi chief Goebbels\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb71847f04c97550693b5ad6a8d0a05b909ee16a/0_874_7240_4344/master/7240.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=459930b46c7acd8ed7021cc80d7206b8","title":"dominic raab foreign office kabul politics covid coronavirus live latest updates","story":"Sir Laurie Bristow,the former British ambassador to Afghanistan, says he didn’t.

The world No 5 is attempting to become only the third player in the 135-year history of world championship matches to win after trailing by two or more points. The others were Max Euwe, who trailed 5-2 against Alexander Alekhine before winning 15½-14½ in 1935, and Bobby Fischer, who trailed 2-0 against Boris Spassky before winning 12½-8½ in 1972.The time control for each game is 120 minutes for the first 40 moves, 60 minutes for the next 20 moves and then 15 minutes for the rest of the game plus an additional 30 seconds per move starting from move 61. If the match is tied after 14 games, tie-breaks will be played on the final day (16 December) in the following order: • Best of four rapid games with 25 minutes for each player with an increment of 10 seconds after each move. • If still tied, they will play up to five mini-matches of two blitz games (five minutes for each player with a three-second increment). • If all five mini-matches are drawn, one sudden-death ‘Armageddon’ match will be played where White receives five minutes and Black receives four minutes. Both players will receive a three-second increment after the 60th move. In the case of a draw, Black will be declared the winner. Notably, Carlsen’s second and third title defenses both came down to tiebreakers. But many believe the increased length of this year’s match (from 12 to 14 games) and the stylistic matchup at hand promises a decisive result in regulation.On Sunday, a fatal blunder by Nepomniachtchi donated a pawn to Carlsen in the middlegame, gifting the 31-year-old world champion an advantage he leveraged until the Russian challenger resigned after 4hr 6min. For anyone just coming aboard, Carlsen, who turned 31 last week, has been at No 1 in the Fide rankings for 10 straight years and was considered the world’s best player even before he dethroned Vishy Anand for the title in 2013. Nepomniachtchi, also 31, is ranked No 5, having earned his place at the table by winning the eight-man candidates tournament in April. We’re a little under a half-hour from today’s first move. Will we see Nepomniachtchi play yet another closed Ruy Lopez? Or will the challenger go for broke as the situation demands?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dae7f7795e4aafc71b4d84366193aef374368a07/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=e6e2c2567a23c23b0072ae2a095d2c77","title":"covid news live omicron likely to become dominant variant harvard researcher says france to close nightclubs","story":"“We now have society-wide infection with the Omicron variant,” director of the Danish Patient Safety Authority, Anette Lykke Petri, told reporters.

No new restrictions have been introduced in Wales in response to the new variant, but the first minister, Mark Drakeford, is due to announce the Labour-controlled government’s latest coronavirus review on Friday. The Welsh Conservatives are worried that the government could extend its vaccine passport scheme (which currently affects settings such as nightclubs) to other hospitality businesses. That includes 17 Omicron cases reported in Oslo, many of them linked to a super-spreader event at a nightclub where 130 Covid cases were reported. Amid concern over rising hospitalisations, combined with the impending flu season, the Norwegian government is expected to announce new restrictions on Tuesday evening. In the last 24 hours, Norway reported 4,117 new infections, an increase of 1,240 on the same day last week. Most striking, however, has been the outbreak linked to a Christmas dinner at Oslo’s Louise nightclub. There were 130 Covid cases recorded from the event, with Norwegian media quoting Tine Ravlo, an infection control doctor, suggesting that perhaps half could be Omicron. The club had been booked by Scatec, a renewable-energy company, for its Christmas party, despite the fact that only vaccinated employees were invited and had been required to take a rapid Covid test the day before.  It appears that some guests had recently returned from South Africa and may have been infected there.Here is the long read from Jacqueline Rose: Life after death: how the pandemic has transformed our psychic landscape While the number of daily coronavirus cases in the European Union’s largest eastern member has stabilised, it remains at a high level and authorities fear that the new Omicron variant could trigger a rise in infections. “There are no signals of a clear downward trend, and … there is a risk that the Omicron mutation will appear,” Adam Niedzielski told a news conference. “These two factors require us to take decisive action.” Poland has not reported any cases of the Omicron variant yet. Businesses will also be required to check customers’ Covid certificates. Nightclubs will be closed from 15 December and on New Year’s Eve. On New Year’s Day, only 100 people will be allowed to enter, not counting those who have been vaccinated. Additionally, travellers from outside the European Union’s Schengen passport-free zone will need to show a negative test result from 15 December and schools will return to distance learning for periods just before and after the Christmas holiday. Niedzielski said that the government was also working on a draft law that would allow employers to check workers’ Covid test results. The country of around 38 million has so far reported 3,704,040 cases of the coronavirus and 86,205 deaths.Switzerland and tiny neighbour Liechtenstein have reported more than 1 million confirmed cases of Covid and nearly 11,300 deaths since the pandemic began. Cases have been on the rise again, straining some hospitals as the Swiss government tries to keep the economy open amid what it calls a “critical” situation. Last week, it tightened rules on wearing masks and producing a certificate to prove a person is vaccinated or has recovered from the virus. Switzerland, which used the military twice last year to help out, will let cantons request help to care for or transport patients and to support vaccinations if their civil defence, fire department and private-sector resources are inadequate. The government said it would will ask parliament to approve the measure, that will run until 31 March. With a must-win Europa Conference League game against Rennes on Thursday then Premier League games at Brighton and Leicester, Spurs’ preparations look set to be severely impacted. Get the full story here: Tottenham games under threat following Covid outbreak at club Heunicke had stayed in his hotel room and not been in contact with other ministers, Denmark’s permanent representation in the EU told Reuters.Boris Johnson made the comment as he updated his team of ministers on the latest Covid situation at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday morning. Giving an account of the meeting, the prime minister’s official spokesman said:  But the spokesman said there was no debate around the cabinet table on whether to introduce ‘Plan B’ of the government’s plans to control the virus this winter. As of Monday, 336 cases of Omicron have been identified in the UK - 261 in England, 71 in Scotland and four in Wales. The health secretary, Sajid Javid, told MPs on Monday that cases of Omicron in people without any travel history have been confirmed in the UK, meaning it is now being transmitted within the community.Evidence suggests that the combination of viral vector vaccines and mRNA vaccines produces good levels of antibodies against the coronavirus, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said in a joint statement on Tuesday. Such an approach “may offer flexibility in terms of vaccination options, particularly to reduce the impact on the vaccine rollout should a vaccine not be available for any reason”, the EMA and ECDC said, while urging people to get fully vaccinated. Their endorsement comes after a major study on Monday said a first dose of AstraZeneca or PfizerBioNTech shots followed by a Moderna vaccine nine weeks later induced a better immune response. However, the EMA and ECDC said more research was needed to support the use of mixing and matching in people with weak immune systems, such as older people and those with chronic conditions like cancer, and for two-dose mRNA vaccine regimens. Longevity of protection offered by vaccines has been under scrutiny and the world is scrambling to trace the Omicron variant as governments impose fresh restrictions, and speed up rollouts of vaccines to children and booster doses. Official rollout of vaccines for five- to 11-year-olds will start next week in Europe. The EMA and ECDC recommendations are also meant to help EU member states with their own vaccination campaigns before any formal EU-wide approval as the health agencies continue studying data on mixing vaccines. The US has given the green light to mix and match, while the World Health Organization is assessing the approach. The EMA and ECDC’s review did not consider vaccines that are not approved in the European Union. Covid shots from AstraZeneca, PfizerBioNTech, Moderna and Johnson \u0026amp Johnson have been authorised for use in the bloc. Many countries have deployed a mix and match well before robust data was available as nations faced soaring infection numbers, low supplies and slow immunisation over some safety concerns."},{"url":null,"title":"gaiety to cancel panto tickets and put on extra shows due to regulations","story":"The Gaiety says  that  many tickets  for  performances of the Little Mermaid between December 7th and January 9th will be cancelled so as to meet the 50 per cent capacity requirements. Photograph: Tom Honan for The .The Gaiety has confirmed it is cancelling half the tickets already sold for its Christmas pantomime saying it has been forced to “let down” customers because of the Government’s decision to limit capacity to 50 per cent.It expressed frustration at the move and pointed out there had been “no case numbers linked to the theatre” since the start of the pandemic in March 2020. It said the tickets would be cancelled on a first come first served basis for every performance of the Little Mermaid between December 7th and January 9th.It also said it was adding “a very limited number of additional shows” with those who have had tickets cancelled to get a pre-sale link and priority access before they are available to the general public.“In the Gaiety’s 150 year history, we have never before been forced to make such difficult decisions as this,” said the Gaiety owner and pantomime producer Caroline Downey. “For the last 20 months, families and children have done everything that has been asked of them. We in the arts have done the same - opened safely, putting every protective measure in place to make the theatre a safe and controlled environment.”She said that despite having “no case numbers linked to the theatre since we re-opened, we have been forced by the Government to turn away people who had very kindly chosen to support us. We now have no choice but to let them down.”‘First-come, first-served’She stressed that the Gaiety had “explored every avenue to figure a way to avoid disappointing families and loyal customers, we have decided that it is the lesser of two evils to allow 50 per cent of the audience to see the show and keep cast and crew in employment, rather than cancel the show completely.” She said tickets would be honoured on a “first-come, first-served basis, based on the date the tickets were purchased. We are so very sorry to those families who bought their tickets in good faith and I’m sure they will feel disappointed and angry at this decision. I can assure you, we empathise with them and share their frustration at this entire situation. Monies will be refunded in full.”Karl Broderick is the producer of Aladdin which is being staged in the National Stadium in Dublin from later this week and he said that it was “purely by fluke” that the show was in a large venue that could accommodate full houses even with the 50 per cent capacity rule introduced. This is the first year his production will be using the National Stadium which has a capacity for 2,000. He had already decided to limit the numbers on the basis that demand for pantos in the run-up to Christmas was uncertain but would now be able to use the full venue to spread people out further. “We can accommodate everyone and that is purely by fluke,” he said. He expressed frustration at the “mixed message” from Government about the staging of the festive favourites. “We had the best opening day that we had in 20 years and then about 10 days when it was suggested children couldn’t go to pantomimes, we flatlined completely,” he said. “We still have people messaging us daily asking can children come to the shows. The message has to get out there that we are open.”He said his production had been hit with cancellations, with one school of close to 700 pulling out of a group booking as uncertainly swirled around live performances last week.‘Heart-breaking’“It is heart-breaking for us and for the children and there is no reason for the cancellations. We will be able to accommodate everyone. The show is set to go on in Cork to with the Opera House there adding an additional 26 shows added to the run to allow for the public health requirement of reducing the capacity of indoor events to 50 per cent. In order to facilitate the additional shows, the cast will perform multiple shows on several dates, up to 3 shows on some days. Half of the audiences will be able to hold on to the tickets they have already bought and they will remain valid on the date originally booked. The other 50 per cent will have to move to new dates and will be selected at random using a lottery system. The venue will contact the ticket holders who have been selected for new dates and will be working through moving these patrons show-by-show over the coming weeks. “The great news is that we are going ahead,” says Cork Opera House CEO, Eibhlín Gleeson. “It was touch and go for a few days while we established if it was actually possible for us to do it. “However, the thought of cancelling the show was devastating to us all having put so much love and energy into it to this point. With the support of our committed cast and dedicated staff, we are delighted to have found a way to move forward.”She accepted that the lottery system was “not ideal” but said it was “the only way that all of our Panto bookers will get to see the show. Our patrons have been so supportive so far, I’m confident that they will work with us in accommodating these changes.”Many tickets for live events in Ireland are sold by Ticketmaster and the company said it was waiting for clarification from inidual venues before deciding how to proceed. “We are still awaiting instruction from event organisers who are working through these new restrictions,” a spokesman said. “We will reach out to fans as soon as we know more. In the meantime, fans can rest assured that if their event is rescheduled their tickets will remain valid for the new date, and if cancelled they will be refunded automatically.”"},{"url":null,"title":"is teacher creativity the key to transforming irish education","story":"Teachers have led the charge in ensuring children have settled back into school in a positive manner, prioritising wellbeing and inidual learning needs. Photograph: iStockAs we face into a winter of uncertainty in our schools, Covid-19 continues to plague optimum functioning of our education system. While school leaders continue to battle to keep the physical doors open, increasing cases among children and school communities are a cause of grave concern.The challenge now is to keep school communities as safe as possible, while striving to keep the physical building open in the absence of a continuous and sustainable supply of substitute teachers. It is a case of all hands on deck, qualified or unqualified. For the first time in 20 years teacher recruitment websites are awash with teaching positions with little, if any, response to the call for help.The pandemic has highlighted the criticality of schools and communities working together in partnership to keep schools open and functioning. Since March 2019 we have witnessed schools navigating physical closures and the historic shift to remote learning.Schools and communities are working tirelessly to implement practices in an attempt to prevent the spread of the disease among our children. But our children continue to be affected, with many having to remain at home due to illness. The recent cessation of contact tracing in our primary schools has been of particular concern given the potentially deadly repercussions for extended family members who may be especially vulnerable to the virus.School leaders are powerless, working in the dark, uninformed about positive cases while unable to share information with the potential to protect children and their families. Their hands are well and truly tied. And yet schools continue to welcome children into the heart of what they do – teaching, learning and caring.Teachers have led the charge in ensuring children have settled back into school in a positive manner, prioritising wellbeing and inidual learning needs. They continue to support children and their families within our communities. Important rites of passage previously put on hold due to virus restrictions are now being celebrated including graduations, Holy Communions and Confirmations.Teachers and school communities have had to demonstrate agility, creativity and responsiveness within this ever-changing and dynamic context. Teaching is a dynamic undertaking in creativity and innovation embedded within the complex reality of the relational and realised through safe spaces where risk taking, vulnerability and wellbeing are nurtured in a supportive way.The power of teaching as creative endeavour lies in the transformative possibilities for children, teachers, schools, communities and our broader society. The pandemic has demonstrated the possibilities for teachers and school communities to create and innovate, profoundly transforming the education system from the traditional face-to-face classroom to the virtual learning environment.Although much evidence has highlighted the profound inequities which emerged during school closures, it would be detrimental to ignore the creative endeavour undertaken by teachers during the pandemic.While evidence highlights how unprepared teachers felt to engage with virtual learning environments when schools first closed in March 2020, teachers came together to engage in professional development and to share resources through social media in order to innovate and create a new virtual learning environment.The pandemic has offered a window into the power of teacher agency and freedom to create, innovate and transform the Irish education system as never before witnessed.It is crucial we pause to reflect on the level of innovation and creativity undertaken by the teaching profession during the pandemic. It is also extremely important we recognise the critical role teachers, children, special needs assistants (SNAs), school leaders and the wider school community have played in transforming the education system, not only during the period of physical school closures, but also for the future of the Irish education system.Out of necessity, teachers were afforded optimal conditions for creativity and innovation, where they created spaces and opportunities to take risks and be vulnerable navigating the challenges posed by physical school closures and the constrictions to teaching and learning approaches deemed necessary to keep school communities safe.Empowering teachers in this way transformed our education system evidenced by innovative ways to share learning content, to partner and connect with parentss and to re-engage children with learning from home. The legacy of such practices remains to be seen, but early evidence would indicate that learning platforms continue to be used for homework and apps have become the mode of communication between home and school.Morale of teachersHowever, wellbeing and creativity are inextricably linked. Prof Andy Hargreaves argues that “the quality and morale of teachers is absolutely central to the wellbeing of students and their learning”. There is no doubt that teacher wellbeing has been negatively impacted during the pandemic.The pace, intensity and demands of unprecedented changes within the education system continues to undermine the wellbeing of teachers, SNAs and school leaders within our system. We are at a critical juncture with systemic burnout a real possibility. If we fail to nurture teacher wellbeing we fail in ensuring we have a healthy and effective teaching profession. The creative endeavour undertaken by teachers will be stifled to the detriment of continued and meaningful transformation within the system.As we navigate the pandemic and rebuild our society, it is an opportune time to reflect on the purpose and value of education. It is clear that there is a gap between what schools do and how society understands what schools do, particularly in relation to the complex, dynamic and creative work undertaken in our classrooms. As a society, it is imperative to come to a shared understanding in redefining the purpose of the Irish education system. It is also an opportune moment to recognise the power of creativity and innovation within our schools.In order to nurture creativity and innovation we need to ensure teachers are trusted to be agents of change, prioritising their wellbeing to ensure they can meaningfully engage in creative and innovative practices, as witnessed throughout the pandemic. If realised, the transformational possibilities for our system are limitless. If education is the “practice of freedom” (Paulo Freire), schools, teachers and children must be entrusted with the transformational and creative agency required to continue building a dynamic, responsive and inclusive system post-pandemic."},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 cases up 21 in a week among children aged 14 and under cso says","story":"Confirmed cases of Covid-19 increased significantly among those aged 14 and under in the week to November 26th, according to a report from the Central Statistic Office (CSO).

The bulletin provides information about those contracting or dying from the disease using data sourced from the HSE’s Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC).In the latest week 32 per cent of cases were recorded among people aged between 25 and 44. Just 6 per cent of infections were detected among people aged 65 and over while cases in the 80 and over age group decreased by 11 per cent.Twenty nine people died from Covid-19 during the week to November 26th. Of those, 20 (69 per cent) were aged 65 and over. Cork was the only county to record more than five deaths in the week.In total, there were 30,243 cases, an increase of 10 per cent on the previous week. Since October, the weekly data shows the proportion of unvaccinated people catching the virus has declined in percentage terms, reaching 17 per cent by November 19th. The State’s most highly populated counties, Dublin (10,170) and Cork (3,358), had the highest number of new cases although the highest percentage increase in infections was recorded in Co Laois, where there was a 28 per cent rise. The largest decrease (27 per cent) was seen in Co Leitrim. There were 249 hospitalisations in the week ending November 19th and 190 the following week, with a total of 25 people being admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) over the two weeks. Since March of last year exactly half of those treated in ICUs were aged 65 and older. Since the beginning of the pandemic, men have accounted for 52 per cent of hospitalisations and 63 per cent of ICU admissions. The data shows that 16 per cent of reported cases in the week ending November 26th were among those working in wholesale and retail and vehicle repairs sectors. A further 11 per cent were in the industry sector. Although cases are generally increasing across all sectors, cases during the week decreased by 13 per cent amongst those employed in health and social work areas.

Photograph: Stephen CollinsCollins Photos Tánaiste Leo Varadkar has confirmed that the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) met on Monday to discuss approving vaccinations for children aged 5-11.Speaking on Claire Byrne Live on RTÉ 1, he said there would be a “significant decision” on vaccinations soon. He added that Niac met on Monday to discuss the priority order of vaccinations, “particularly in relation to children aged 5-11, which we are keen to get started in the new year”.When asked about comments made recently by Dr Cillian De Gascun, a member of Nphet, that he was “hopeful” the schools would reopen in January, Mr Varadkar claimed that school closures have not been discussed by Government. “The Minister for Education is responsible for schools, and what she has said, and certainly what I would support, is the schools are going to open in the new year... there has been no decision, nor discussion, about closing schools in January.”Mr Varadkar said the country was in a “peculiar” situation, clarifying comments that he made at the weekend. “This is the first time since the pandemic began that we are actually tightening restrictions at a time when things are objectively improving.”He said that despite the number of deaths and numbers of people in hospital and ICU declining, the public health advice was that some restrictions are necessary ahead of increased socialisation at Christmas. He said the possibility of a flu season and the emergence of the Omicron variant were also contributing factors to the decision to increase restrictions, as well as the fact that cases are stabilising at a high level, at about 5,000 cases being reported a day. He did not believe the new restrictions would be lifted before January 9th, unless there was a dramatic fall in hospitalisations and ICU admissions.

Video: Enda O\u0027DowdAngeline Ruddy, deputy principal of Moville Community College: ‘It’s on our children’s lips, it’s on our staff’s lips... There’s no getting away from mica’. Photograph: Enda O’DowdAt Moville Community College, everybody is talking about mica.“There’s not an English essay that’s passed to a teacher that doesn’t have a mention of mica in it somewhere... and every time you mention humanitarian issues it’s the first thing to the forefront,” says deputy principal Angeline Ruddy.“It’s on our children’s lips, it’s on our staff’s lips,” she says. “There’s no escaping it. There’s no getting away from mica.”The presence of the mineral in construction blocks – which makes them crack and eventually crumble – has caused structural damage to an estimated 7,500 homes in counties Donegal and Mayo, as well as smaller numbers in other counties.Mica has impacted the entire community, says principal Anthony Doogan, and the school community is no different.At Moville Community College approximately 20 per cent of staff and 25 per cent of pupils – about 20 staff and 100 families – are living in “mica homes” even more have siblings and parents who are affected.“I have five siblings, and four of them are affected by mica,” says Ruddy. The one who isn’t lives in the US.“Where I live, in a half mile radius, 20 houses are affected. It’s everywhere we go.”Her children “know nothing else but a mica household” as they go about their daily routine, mica is “like an app running in the background for every one of us.“‘Is the house safe tonight?’ is a regular question my children will ask,” she says. “I have cracks that are now the width of a two-euro coin, which means my gable is starting to move away from the wall of my house. I don’t know, really, if we are safe any longer.”Others tell a similar story. Special needs assistant Barry Moore’s home is crumbling his daughter was riding her bike around the house when “a lump of plaster fell off... it was near enough to scare her, and me.”“You’re lying at home at night and you hear the walls moving. It’s scary, to think you’re living in a place that is meant to be your safe place and you’re hearing the walls cracking.”Five of the special needs assistants – nearly half of the special needs staff – have mica homes, and so do some of the students they support. A hoist used by one child is attached to a crumbling mica wall, while foster parents have bought two mobile homes to house their children with complex needs.“They need routine, they need to know what happening... they’re going to be moved into two mobile homes behind their house and watch their house getting knocked down,” says Moore.In school, he says, you can “see the children who have mica, or whose houses have mica. They are, like their parents probably are, nearly obsessed with the fact they have mica.“As staff you’re trying to accommodate and support children... but they’re going home to houses that aren’t safe and that are causing them grief and stress.”Guidance counsellor Sineád McCarron’s home also has mica she warns of “what’s coming down the line... this is just going to explode, really, in terms of the amount of support the students need.”As principal, Doogan has significant concerns about the physical and mental health of students and staff – not least through heightened levels of anxiety – and about the impact on students’ attendance and life chances the effects, he estimates, will persist for the next five to 10 years.The anxiety of students and parents “is having an impact on their work rate and their effectiveness at their studies at school,” he says.“Every secondary school in the country”, he emphasises, has seen the effects of Covid “We’re at the beginning of this cycle for mica and in two years’ time, when there’s a large number of houses in this community which need to be demolished and rebuilt, there will be severe anxiety and perhaps worse felt by a lot of our students.”There is also “clear evidence” of an increase in absenteeism due to illness – “they’re living in draughty rooms, the rooms are colder, the rooms are causing them health issues that they wouldn’t ordinarily have” as well as students from mica homes who have left school altogether.Brother and sister Shaun and Aoife Noone describe how their home is “falling down”: “If I put my hand in the wall I could just pull away some of the side of the house,” says 17-year-old Shaun.They have moved out so that their home can be demolished and rebuilt. “I don’t really have a study room so that’s affecting my study, because I’m doing my Leaving Cert now, and it’s harder to focus and settle down and get work done,” he says.“I feel disadvantaged, it’s unfair that most people would stress or be anxious about exams but I’ve got the pressure of my house on top of that, so it’s a bit hard on the mind as well.”Aaron Price (13) and his family have also moved out. “It was a lot to handle trying to go to school and do homework and trying to empty the house.”The Government this week announced a €2.2 billion scheme to rebuild mica homes in Donegal and Mayo, capped at €420,000 per home and with a sliding scale of rebuilding costs from €145 per sq ft for the first 1,000 sq ft to €110 for the next 1,000 and €100 thereafter.It has been criticised by the mica campaigners in Donegal as falling short. “Apparently a new scheme was decided but it’s stupid, apparently each square metre gets less money, that doesn’t make sense,” says Aaron.“We need 100 per cent, and I know we probably will never get that, but if it was in Dublin, this would already be fixed.“It’s not our fault, we spent a lot of money on building our house... why should we have to spend more and more money rebuilding our house?”The adults have done the figures each of those spoken to by The  is facing a shortfall of between €60,000 to €80,000. “If council houses are being built at the minute they are built on a rate of €150 a square metre,” says Moore. “What was being offered would work out essentially for our house at €127 a square metre, which would leave us paying €65,000 on top of what we would get.“My other half is a psychiatric nurse, we’re no millionaires, we’re working-class people and we live in an average size house in Donegal which is the average in the country for a one-off build, 2,500 sq ft.“If they had dropped the sliding scale part... 145 euro per square foot, that’s it, and then your rent and then your storage, I would say 90 per cent of people would have been happy and celebrating, but they put in a scale that doesn’t exist in any builder’s pricing.”“The cost to me right now is €79,000, and that’s just for the build,” says Ruddy. “My house is 2,600 sq ft... that gives a total of €315,000 of a grant. The builders have come back to me with €395,000.“I can’t borrow because I have a mica home... 100 per cent redress is so far from it, I don’t think I’m even getting 80 per cent redress.“My children are at the stage where I should be starting to save for their college. Am I going to build their house and deprive them of education? We’re facing these choices.”“People bought the material in good faith... yet they are being victimised to the extent of having to spend 40, 50, 60, €80,000, whereas other areas were given 100 per cent redress,” says Doogan.For him, it is about the value placed on people from this area, not least given that the school itself is still “nowhere near completion” 20 years after it opened. “We bailed out the banks for €64 billion, and they’re saying three or four billion is a huge amount of money, but it’s less than five per cent of what we gave to the banks.“The people up here paid their taxes to pay for the bank bailout, and people here, like me, paid their taxes to pay for the pyrite redress in Dublin and Leinster. People round here are saying, ‘is there a different law for us?’”McCarron, too, is clear: “How can we help people look after their wellbeing and instil value systems of fair justice when our own Government continues to let this happen?”“They’ve let us down,” says 15-year-old Aoife. “If this was happening in Dublin, I feel it would be a different story, because we’re that far away and we’re rural they say ‘ah, them Donegal ones, they live in big mansions, they can afford it’. We can’t.

In areas that are still under a red warning, stay in situ and remain in place and in orange and yellow just not to take any unnecessary trips.“This is a multi-hazard event, high winds, high tides plus exceptional rainfall as wall so there has been a risk of coastal, river and indeed surface flooding.”In relation to schools, Mr O’Brien said Minister for Education Norma Foley would be taking further advice from Met Éireann this afternoon in consultation with the National Emergency Co-ordination Group. He said a decision was expected around 6pm so that parents would have enough notice to make plans.Meanwhile, healthcare services, public transport and power supply will also be affected by the storm.Met Éireann has said the status red warning was in place for counties Kerry, Cork and Clare as the storm could pose a “threat to life”.Severe, damaging winds are expected, as well as heavy rain. The status red warning came into effect in counties Kerry and Cork at 6am on Tuesday and 4pm on Tuesday in Co Clare.An orange warning has been issued for counties Limerick, Waterford, Galway, Mayo, Wexford, Dublin, Louth, Wicklow and Meath.On Monday, Met Éireann advised there was a strong possibility that the alert status of the counties currently in an orange warning might escalate to red.On Tuesday, Gerry Murphy of Met Éireann told the Today with Claire Byrne show they had extended orange level warnings to include Sligo and Leitrim from 8pm this evening to 8am tomorrow and in Donegal from 2am tomorrow to 2pm.The Defence Forces are currently on standby to assist local authorities and emergency services.Mr Leonard called on the public to stay at home, to take protective measures for themselves and to keep their mobile phones charged.Power outagesA disruption to power supply has been reported across the country on Tuesday morning, in particular in Donegal and along the southwest coast.As of 12.45pm, there were 49,000 homes and businesses without access to power. A spokesman for the ESB said it was hoped that power would be restored to the majority of those by this evening, but it was “hard to say” how many would be without power overnight.More than 15,000 homes and businesses were without power in Co Donegal this morning. However, the majority of those have now been restored.The areas with power disruptions are scattered throughout the country, with Cork city, Killarney and Dunmanway the most impacted areas, along with Arklow, Enniscorthy and some parts of Waterford.An ESB spokesperson said many more outages are expected due to the storm and the difficulty will be getting crews safely into red alert areas to repair lines.FloodingEarlier this morning the river Lee in Cork city burst its banks onto the surrounding low lying quays causing flooding. The floodwaters spilled onto low-lying streets reaching the South Mall, however the floodwaters have now receded.Minister of State for Flood Relief Patrick O’Donovan said the southwest of the country was “getting a bad battering” at present, with his own area of west Limerick being “pretty rough” while the worst affected area was Bantry, he told RTÉ radio’s Today with Claire Byrne show.There is concern regarding the high tide on the east coast later today, which could lead to problems said the Minister.About 23 premises in Bantry, Co Cork, were partially flooded this morning as Storm Barra hit the country.Sandbags had been positioned along the quay wall and remedial flood relief works were in place in the town.Bantry Fire Brigade has reported that the flooding has been cleared and the crew are back in the station.Danny Collins, owner of the Boston Bar in Bantry, praised staff of Cork County Council and the area fire brigade for their efforts in the town this morning.Mr Collins said that the south of the square in the town and New Street were now clear following extensive work by the emergency services.Mr Collins said flooding had been an issue in the town for years and they were awaiting a flood relief scheme to help mitigate its severity, he told Cork’s 96FM.While in Galway, the local authority has expressed concern about the potential of flooding later today.Schools and healthcareThe Department of Education has advised that all schools covered by the red and orange alerts should not open on Tuesday. This includes all schools, universities and creches in those areas.All schools are advised to keep up-to-date with weather warnings in the event of any change in the status for their area.The HSE has said the National Ambulance Service will be prioritising emergency calls today, but road conditions may be poor and there may be more emergency calls than usual. Some HSE services will be closed and some appointments have been cancelled.Covid-19 vaccination and testing centres will be closed today in Cork, Kerry and Clare where a status red warning is in place, while affected testing and vaccination centres in counties with a status orange warning can be found on the HSE website.In Cork and Kerry, all elective inpatient and outpatient appointments and procedures have been cancelled in University Hospital Kerry, Cork University Hospital, Bantry General Hospital, Mallow General Hospital, Mercy University Hospital, and South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital, with the exception of time-critical cases.Day services for older people, in disability services and in mental health services have also been cancelled, as well as BreastCheck appointments.In Co Clare, outpatient appointments have been cancelled in Ennis Hospital but some elective procedures will go ahead patients are being contacted directly by the hospital to confirm if their procedure is going ahead or not. The Injury Unit at Ennis Hospital continues to operate as normal between 8am and 8pm.Damien McCallion, the HSE’s national lead for the vaccination programme has urged the public not to travel to any medical appointments without first checking ahead.Mr McCallion asked the public to “think carefully” before making an emergency call, he told RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland.Covid testing and vaccination centres will be closed in status red areas and cancelled appointments will be rescheduled as quickly as possible, he said. In orange and yellow zones, local assessments were being undertaken in some sites - including tented sites and those in high locations.Public servicesThere will be no post delivered or collected in Cork and Kerry today due to the closure of post offices.In Clare, postal deliveries services will operate as normal until 2pm, and post offices will remain open for business as usual until 2pm today.However, letter, parcel and post office services will operate as normal in all other counties today, Tuesday.An Post expects all postal services to resume on Wednesday provided conditions are safe for staff.Some public transport services have been suspended in the south of the country today due to the nature of Storm Barra.Irish Rail services are now operating on all routes, including its service between Waterford and Kilkenny, which was previously suspended due to flooding at Waterford station.Reduced speeds are in operation between Cork and Mallow, and between Cork and Tralee as a safety precaution, due to high winds. Delays of up to 30 minutes are expected on these routes as a result.In Dublin, delays of up to 20 minutes are expected on Dart and commuter services due to high winds affecting the operation of level crossings at Lansdowne Road.Bus Éireann have suspended all bus routes and commuter services in counties Clare, Cork and Kerry today. A number of changes have been made to Bus Éireann services across the country due to blocked roads and flooding, with some services suspended.In Galway, bus routes 401 and 424 serving the Salthill Promenade have reopened, while bus route 109B between Trim and Dublin has been erted due to a fallen tree. Bus route 163 between Drogheda and Donore have been suspended due to road conditions in the area.In Limerick, bus route 329 is now back in operation between Kilfinane, Bruff and Limerick following poor road conditions.Contact numbersEmergency services: 999 or 112Irish Water have advised that a loss of supply should be reported on 1850 278 278ESB Networks emergency line is 1800 372 999 or +353 21 2382410.

An example of colloform sphalerite from the Lisheen deposit, southern Ireland.Congratulations on winning the 2021 Science Foundation Ireland Image of the Year award. Tell us about the image. It’s a microscopic view of an ore taken from the Lisheen mine in Tipperary, which was mined for zinc and lead. This one is a colloform sphalerite, which is one of the major ore minerals for zinc. Ireland is rich in zinc, in fact we are one of biggest zinc producers in Europe.How do such ores form? Ireland has lots of limestone, which formed about 360 million years ago, and it has lots of fractures and faults in it. Broadly speaking, cool, very salty seawater-sourced water or brine flowed downwards through some of those fractures and faults and this often contained abundant sulphur.Then you had hotter, hydrothermal fluid coming up through the fractures and faults from below, and these often carried metals, like zinc. When the fluids met and mixed, the host limestone rock dissolved and minerals formed with different textures. This zinc-rich colloform sphalerite has a pattern like a Celtic knot, and we got the image by taking a thin slice and looking at it with a microscope.It looks beautiful – why are zinc and its minerals important? We rely on zinc for making lots of green technologies, such as wind turbines and solar panels, and the sphalerite in Ireland has relatively few impurities so there is potential for it to be more sustainable to mine. I have just finished my PhD at iCRAG in UCD on how lead and zinc are mineralised in Ireland, and now I am applying what I have learned to another important metal, copper.I recently spent a month in Zambia looking at ore deposits in a cobalt copper mine, examining 1.6 kilometre cores from the ground, looking at rocks that were formed around 550-900 million years ago to better understand the environmental conditions under which the minerals became so concentrated there.Why is it important to understand the geology of minerals? As we move towards a greener society, we will be relying more on minerals for technologies like electric vehicles, wind turbines and storing energy from renewable sources. When we need to mine for those raw materials, it’s important that geologists are part of those conversations and plans, so we understand what the global supply is, whether it can be met and how to mine it sustainably.How did you find doing the PhD? I’ve finished up recently and I have yet to graduate, so I am still in the recovery phase of it all. I had great supervisors, Associate Professor Julian Menuge and Dr Steve Hollis, and I found my colleagues in iCRAG really supportive.One of the aspects I found tough was the amount of time on the computer – when you think of geology you maybe think of travelling around and doing field trips, but my project was computer and lab based, and I worked a lot from home because of the pandemic. But now I have started working on the project in Zambia and it is great to be doing trips again.And how do you take a break from work now? During my PhD I unfortunately dropped a lot of my hobbies, so I am trying to get back into more balanced work habits now. I like to get out for a walk and I love reading. Realistically though I also watch a lot of TV, and I am particularly enjoying the nostalgia of box sets from the early 2000s."},{"url":null,"title":"omicron s less severe cases prompt cautious optimism in south africa","story":"People queue to be vaccinated against Covid-19 at the Lenasia South Hospital, near Johannesburg, South Africa, on December 1st. Photograph:  Shiraaz MohamedAPMedics and scientists in South Africa have welcomed early hospital data suggesting that the Omicron coronavirus variant could result in less severe illness than previous waves but warned that higher transmission rates could still overwhelm hospitals.Early data from the Steve Biko and Tshwane District Hospital Complex in South Africa’s capital Pretoria, which is at the centre of the outbreak, showed that on December 2nd only nine of the 42 patients on the Covid-19 ward, all of whom were unvaccinated, were being treated for the virus and were in need of oxygen.The remainder of the patients had tested positive but were asymptomatic and being treated for other conditions.“My colleagues and I have all noticed this high number of patients on room air,” said Dr Fareed Abdullah, a director of the South African Medical Research Council and an infectious disease doctor at the Steve Biko hospital.“You walked into a Covid ward any time in the past 18 months ... you could hear the oxygen whooshing out of the wall sockets, you could hear the ventilators beeping ... but now the vast majority of patients are like any other ward.”The data will reassure global health officials who have been alarmed by South Africa’s rapid rise in infections. But experts have warned that the sharp increase in cases, linked to the new variant’s apparent ability to evade immune protection from previous infection or vaccination, could still strain hospitals to a similar extent as the summer Delta wave.Meanwhile, concern is growing in neighbouring Zimbabwe where surging infection rates are beginning to test the creaking healthcare system in the first sign of the Omicron wave spilling across the region.The pattern of milder disease in Pretoria is corroborated by data for the whole of Gauteng province. Eight per cent of Covid-positive hospital patients are being treated in intensive care units, down from 23 per cent throughout the Delta wave. And just 2 per cent are on ventilators, down from 11 per cent.Intensive careAlthough the total number of Covid-positive patients in Gauteng’s hospitals is approaching the level it reached at the same stage of the Delta wave, researchers said a large proportion received treatment for other conditions. And the number of Covid patients in intensive care is one quarter of what it was three weeks into the Delta outbreak.“I’m extremely optimistic,” said Shabir Madhi, professor of vaccinology at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, who forecast that while there would be a “large number” of breakthrough infections and reinfections, a smaller proportion of cases would end up requiring hospital treatment.Top US health official Anthony Fauci said on Sunday that early signals about the severity of the variant were “encouraging”.However, the potential for Omicron to result in less severe symptoms may be more a consequence of immunity than the virus evolving to become less virulent, according to Prof Richard Lessells, an infectious disease physician at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban. Scientists stress that even if the country is spared a more lethal variant, Omicron’s contagiousness alone could cause large problems. Weekly hospital admissions of Covid-positive patients across Gauteng province are increasing at five times the rate of the fastest growth period during the Delta wave.“If it spreads and transmits more efficiently, and you get more people infected in a short space of time, that is really bad news for your hospitals and health system,” said Lessells.Jantjie Taljaard, an infectious diseases physician at Tygerberg Academic Hospital in Cape Town, said hospitals in the city were readying themselves for their own wave of Omicron admissions that could match the Delta wave after case rates increased six-fold over the past week.Dr Taljaard added that he suspected the hospital data from Gauteng “may be a bit skewed” because of infections in the early stages of the wave being more prevalent among younger people, who are less likely to get severely ill.Sharp uptickAcross the border in Zimbabwe, health officials are increasingly nervous about how a similar surge could play havoc with the country’s healthcare system, which is less well resourced than that of its more affluent neighbour.There has been a sharp uptick in the number of seriously ill Covid-positive patients in Zimbabwe’s hospitals, with numbers climbing from six to 26 in the seven days to Friday last week, ahead of where they stood at the same stage of the Delta wave in June.Prof Rashida Ferrand, director of a research partnership between a Zimbabwean health facility and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, noted that infections in Zimbabwe were increasing at the fastest rate of “any point during the pandemic”, mirroring the spike in Gauteng.“That threatens to overwhelm the healthcare system, much more than it would in South Africa,” she said. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2021Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"History of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo role"},{"url":null,"title":"astrazeneca vaccines unlucky","story":"“I would just like them to hold their hand up and say, ‘we’re very much aware that this has happened and we’re going to do something about it’. And I’d like them to do that without taking it away in the next breath.“In no other circumstances where so many people have lost their lives would that happen. They wouldn’t say 72 people sadly died in the Grenfell tower fire, but hundreds of people didn’t. We don’t forget those who were wounded in conflict or those who did not come home.”These are the words of Gareth Eve, husband of Lisa Shaw, the 44 year-old BBC Radio Newcastle presenter who died in May of a rare brain hemorrhage, confirmed by a coroner in August to have been caused by rare complications from the Oxford AstraZeneca jab which scientists believe they discovered the trigger for last week.His is a tough story to hear, but it is made worse by being so hard for him to tell publicly.Gareth and hundreds of others in the UK who have lost loved ones, or seen their lives irrevocably changed by blood clots and other vaccine-related injuries, find themselves in a terrible position as the real stories behind the statistics.Not only are they being forced to battle for the lives, memories or continued care of their partners or children but – although it could not be further from the truth – they know that doing so risks them being branded as anti-vaxxers or even unpatriotic.“Lisa rolled her sleeve up for the country and said, ‘Right, well, I’m going to get my jab, because that’s what we are being told is the right thing to do’,” says Gareth, who had his second vaccination after his wife’s death, and is now bringing up the couple’s six-year-old son Zach alone. “She did it, like all the others, because it would mean that our little bit of the world, our family and community was better protected. And yet nobody even recognises them”.The number of people who have life-changing adverse reactions to vaccines for Covid-19 is a tiny proportion of the many millions of vaccines given, but is mounting in absolute numbers. (the exact percentage is not known)Up to November 17, the MHRA had received Yellow Card reports of 426 cases of major thromboembolic events (blood clots) with concurrent thrombocytopenia (low platelet counts) in the UK following vaccination with AstraZeneca. The overall case fatality rate was 17 per cent with 73 deaths. There have been, in addition, a small number of other rare adverse reactions which have led to death or disablement – as there are with nearly all pharmaceuticals.Sarah Moore, a partner with the London law firm Hausfeld, represents the families of 95 people impacted by such injuries, including Gareth Eve. Nine have suffered bereavement, while most of the others are caring for close relatives with life-changing injuries. “All have experienced, at first hand, a range of severe adverse health events following Covid-19 vaccination,” she says.When Covid vaccines were first authorised for use in the UK, the Government indemnified the manufacturers and took on liability for any adverse reactions. It then added all of the jabs used – including the Oxford-Astrazeneca vaccine – to the Vaccine Damage Payments Scheme (VDPS).“The UK has one of the most comprehensive immunisation programmes in the world, and sensible routine precautions such as these form a huge part of our global-leading standards in safety,” boasted the Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England, Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, when announcing the move just ahead of the launch of the Covid vaccination campaign in December 2020.“The VDPS is a safety net to help ease the burden on iniduals who have, in extremely rare circumstances, experienced harm due to receiving a government-recommended vaccine,” added the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) at the time.Moore and her clients are not anti-vaccination or suing the government, but campaigning for change: they say the VDPS is not a “safety net” worthy of the name.Launched more than 40 years ago to build confidence in national vaccination programmes, it is now hopelessly out of date – and in danger of doing the exact opposite.Paper-based and under-staffed, it has proven slow, bureaucratic and unresponsive. Claimants must show they are more than “60 per cent” disabled to make a successful claim as well as proving “causation”, which is notoriously difficult to prove. Worse, even for cases that are successful, the maximum total payout is just £120,000.“While £120,000 is a substantial sum of money, it will provide limited security where an inidual has been severely disabled and, particularly, where they may have dependents,” says Moore. “It is significantly lower than the awards that are achieved in personal injury claims involving similarly severe injuries.” Such awards can run to the millions.Historically, the VDPS has received about 100 claims a year, but Covid vaccinations mean that number has dramatically increased.“There are currently c.500 cases (as at November 2021) that require assessment, with this volume currently increasing per week by c.20 cases,” notes a recent government tender document for the running of the service. “It is estimated that in year one of the contract there will be c1500-1800 claims that will require assessment within the first year of the contract,” it adds.Kate Scott, a 32-year-old mum of two boys, age four and one, is one of those claimants. She is struggling to keep the roof over the family’s head after her husband Jamie, 44, suffered a brain injury after receiving the Oxford Astrazeneca jab this spring.Jamie spent 124 days in hospital and was lucky to survive his doctors thought he would need to live in a care home for the rest of his life. But, although he is now home with Kate and their boys, the brain injury he still lives with has changed his life.“We feel like the luckiest unlucky people because, despite all of this, Jamie has made more of a recovery than any of the medical teams thought possible,” she says. “But our life is still dramatically impacted. He’s able to communicate with us and to outsiders, he looks like he’s very much almost back to normal. But for our family that’s not the case.”Jamie can no longer work as a software engineer or even care for his children without supervision, for example.“I solely have to be responsible for the boys as he can’t independently look after them at the moment, which is very difficult for him as well,” says Scott. “He’s amazing. His motivation is truly inspiring, and the doctors have used the term miracle. I feel sometimes when I get upset that I’m being ungrateful. I know that others have lost loved ones.”Kate has had to stop working as a customer service coordinator for a children\u0027s charity to look after Jamie and the children full time. They are struggling financially and Kate worries they may have to sell the family home. She points out the £120,000 maximum payment from the VDPS scheme was worth £500,000 or more when the scheme was launched in 1979.“That’s a lot more money and enough to pay off most people’s mortgages. It would mean Jay could just focus on getting better or one day, he could do a vocational job, perhaps, where there was less pressure on him. It would mean that what has already been traumatic for our children doesn’t get worse. That we don’t have to move house because of it.”In the summer, Kate wrote to Boris Johnson to draw his attention to the holes in the Government’s vaccine safety net. Like others, she pointed out that other developed countries have more generous schemes.“You have suffered a heartbreaking and frightening change but I would like to pay tribute to your strength in proposing changes which you think could improve the situation. You’re not a statistic, and must not be ignored. I am deeply touched by your story.”Johnson went on to say he had asked the DHSC to consider the proposed reforms but, to date, there has been no announcement of change and not a single case has yet been settled via the government scheme. Indeed the DHSC has been directing victims like Gareth and Kate into the benefits system. Not surprisingly, real anger is building.“They promised a safety net if things went wrong but you are made to feel like you’re saying something controversial or, you know, wrong by raising it”, says Gareth. “Lisa’s death has been confirmed at an inquest as being caused by a vaccine. It says here on her death certificate she died due to ‘complications of an AstraZeneca Covid Vaccination’. It doesn\u0027t get more black and white than that. That is what happened to her. Fact. For Lisa and all the others I’ve heard about, there is no grey area about it.”A government spokesperson added: “More than 115 million COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in the UK, saving countless lives and serious side effects are extremely rare.“The Vaccine Damage Payments Scheme helps to ease the burden on iniduals who have, in extremely rare circumstances, been severely disabled due to receiving a government-recommended vaccine.“All vaccines being used in the UK have undergone robust clinical trials and have met strict standards of safety, effectiveness and quality set by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency’s (MHRA).”More from NewsCoronavirus latest news: Archbishop of Canterbury condemns red list as \u0026#39travel apartheid\u0026#39 and calls for it to be scrappedPolitics latest news: Omicron Covid variant \u0026#39more transmissible\u0026#39 than delta, Boris Johnson tells ministers - watch liveGhislaine Maxwell trial latest news: Photographs of relationship between socialite and Jeffrey Epstein to be shownWhy prosecutors are targeting the mystery of Ghislaine Maxwell’s extraordinary wealthStorm Barra hits: Forty flood alerts as UK battered by 70mph windsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"generation coke britain got hooked","story":"If, as it has been memorably asserted, the pandemic and its assorted lockdowns has largely seen middle-class people hiding and working-class people bringing them things, then it should hardly be a surprise that the delivery menu has also included illegal drugs. After all, there’s Ocado for groceries, a host of scooter warriors for meals and Amazon for everything else. Why should cocaine be any different?Covid, official figures reveal, hasn’t put a dent in the drugs trade hasn’t stopped those lethal entrepreneurs in the Andes from finding a way to supply the US and Europe, their most profitable markets. Above all, it hasn’t stemmed our prodigious demand for Charlie, the Big C, White Lady, Nose Candy, Flake, or the (misnamed, since the vast majority comes from Colombia and Peru) Bolivian marching powder.In the last eight years, a near 20-year decline in drug use has been abruptly reversed. The ONS, which tracks consumption through surveys, is clear what’s behind it: “changes in powder cocaine use”.Today, 2.6 per cent of British adults admit to using cocaine, an increase of more than 30 per cent since 2013. And while the Government, in revealing its 10-year drugs strategy yesterday, said it would target 300,000 perennial abusers with treatment, it offered much tougher words for casual snorters.“We’re not going to sit idly by while we have lifestyle users using Class A drugs,” said Boris Johnson, proposing tough new measures. Plans include removing passports and driving licences to inconvenience middle-class dope dabblers and, the Government hopes, make them reflect on their part in a chain of misery that may end at a Notting Hill shindig, but can begin with brutality in South and Central America, and continue with vicious county lines turf wars back here. “These people think it’s a victimless crime,” said the PM. “It isn’t. The country is ­littered with victims.”That drugs kill, though, is hardly news. And guilt has not limited consumption among the smart set so far. The very same people who rave about Netflix’s brilliant but ultra-violent series Narcos, which documents the rise of Pablo Escobar, are quite happy to keep hoovering up the Toot, even as coke-war eviscerations play out on screen before them.“When I think about the layers of the cocaine trade and the misery it inflicts on people involved, I do feel ashamed, but clearly not enough,” recounts one newish mother, who gathers with five friends “all pushing 40, for monthly ‘cocaine brunches’.”“I compartmentalise,” she says. “That is the raw truth. It’s a holiday from my life – and for now at least, I have no intention of changing that.”Not least as exchanging booze for powder makes toddler-wrangling easier: “Next morning, there’s no hangover, I’m not exhausted from a late night, but I still feel like I’ve had a blowout.” And she’s not alone. “A large number in my social circle – all middle-class, smart, professional women with children – are at it.”  And that cannot be uncoupled from the end of the civil war in Colombia. From the mid-1960s the country’s government was engaged in what amounted, at times, to civil war with Farc communnist guerillas. But by 2013 hostilities had abated, and by 2016, the two sides signed a historic peace deal, under the terms of which many revolutionaries were meant to be found education and jobs. When those didn’t materialise, many turned to farming coca. “Global cocaine manufacture, which had fallen by 37 per cent over the period 2006–2014, more than doubled over the period 2014–2019, to an estimated 1,784 tonnes,” notes the UN in its most recent report on the global drugs market. “The marked increase,” it adds, “has primarily been the result of changes in Colombia.” No one wants to blame a global glut of drugs on a peace deal. But the truth is, Colombia now accounts for almost two-thirds of the world’s estimated manufacture of cocaine.Expanding supply lines have met that increased production. Once, the Calabrian mafia known as the ‘Ndrangheta, which fostered direct contacts with Latin American suppliers, held a European monopoly. But the post-truce collapse of Farc’s own stranglehold in Colombian production areas led to a “proliferation of smaller criminal and armed non-State groups” seeking partners to traffic their product. Albanian gangs, Bosnian Serbs, Croats, Serbs and Montenegrins in particular, stepped in. Cocaine became a hugely competitive market.As so often with competition, the consumer benefited: prices dropped, quality increased. In fact, purity shot up by almost 40 per cent from 2011 to 2018. Britain, long considered the poor cousin of the US, was flooded with coke every bit as refined as that on the other side of the Atlantic. Then the pandemic arrived and dealers ensured that the regulars were kept supplied. Smug snorters had never had it so good.Indeed, it’s not just the pandemic driving drug-dealing ersification. The so-called “dark web” – an underground internet accessed using special browsers – is home to thriving marketplaces which are capturing ever-larger parts of the trade at least £237 million in annual sales in 2017, a four-fold increase in six years. Such direct-to-consumer supplies avoid the hassles of illicit dealers – they are simply posted in the mail.But that still doesn’t answer the question of demand, of why 6 per cent of our increasingly puritanical, drink-less, vegan, 16-24-year-olds have tried it, for example, even as they shun other stimulants, notably alcohol.“I’ve got a 22-year-old and an 18-year-old, and I see it all the time among their friends,” says one mother. “It’s definitely normalised. For them it’s like going to the pub, but cheaper. When we were younger, coke was a yuppie drug, or a hard drug. They view coke very differently. They don’t see it as a Class A drug at all.“They really don’t connect the dots,” between consumption and wider drugs violence, she adds. “But then, most middle class people don’t. I know lots of people who still take it at 50. Sure, they feel bad in the morning, but not as bad as you do with alcohol.” As is backed up by the experience of the “cocaine brunch” set.Across all ages, it seems, cocaine is no longer demonised. Universities will be targeted by the new strategy. Offices may be encouraged to follow. But with coke so widespread, it’s hard to preach without being accused of hypocrisy. One workplace already in the firing line is the Palace of Westminster, whose loos are reportedly plastered with traces of cocaine use, prompting Speaker Lindsay Hoyle to warn that he would be contacting the police “as a priority”. Both the PM and Michael Gove have admitted taking cocaine in their youth.Loewenstein says it is time to admit that half a century of war-on-drugs announcements like yesterday’s are not working, and simply provide political cover for policy failure. “Demand has never been higher, the cost has never been cheaper, access has never been easier. The stats are clear. Drugs are a normal part of many people’s lives.”After he rings off, I try to find more details of the Government’s new plan. As if to prove his point, I am halfway through reading its policy document, setting out its priorities to intervene with young people, treat the most addicted, and stifle gangs supplying drugs. Then I realise I am reading the wrong 10-year plan. This one, near identical in many ways, dates from 1998.  More from NewsCoronavirus latest news: Archbishop of Canterbury condemns red list as \u0026#39travel apartheid\u0026#39 and calls for it to be scrappedPolitics latest news: Omicron Covid variant \u0026#39more transmissible\u0026#39 than delta, Boris Johnson tells ministers - watch liveGhislaine Maxwell trial latest news: Photographs of relationship between socialite and Jeffrey Epstein to be shownWhy prosecutors are targeting the mystery of Ghislaine Maxwell’s extraordinary wealthStorm Barra hits: Forty flood alerts as UK battered by 70mph windsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"inedible food tears 20 minute daily walks around car park","story":"It resembled a scene from Alcatraz inmates circumambulating a tarmac yard, behind a high concrete wall spaced apart to prevent any fraternisation.These were no hardened criminals, however. Their misdeeds consisted of travelling back to the UK from “red list” countries. Rather than prisoners in a high-security prison, they were involuntary guests in a London quarantine hotel, paying thousands of pounds each for the dubious privilege of an 11-night stay.Among those forced to endure the experience were Kate and Alex Freed, a recently married couple who had travelled to South Africa for their honeymoon.But the honeymoon period is well and truly over, and they are now stuck in an awful hotel overlooking Heathrow serving inedible food.Perhaps the most grim condition is that they have to request to be allowed go for a walk outside. A security guard accompanies them downstairs, and they are allowed 20 minutes in the hotel car park before being told they have to go back inside, the pair say.Speaking on the third day of their 10-day quarantine period, Mrs Freed, 29, said: We’d been planning the South Africa trip for ages … we didn’t book it until the green list changed and the foreign travel advice was that it was safe to go to.Her 30-year-old husband added: To be charged for coming back to your country when the Government’s told you it’s safe to go, I think is just wrong.The couple flew back from South Africa on Dec 2, after having their original flight home cancelled due to the travel ban.It was the trip they\u0027d dreamed of, having been forced to rearrange their wedding day four times due to Covid.They said it took almost six hours to get from the plane at Heathrow to their hotel - the Holiday Inn Express at the airport\u0027s Terminal 4 - including waiting in a bus to be taken to their rooms.They put us on to a bus for the 30-second journey, but we were on the bus for three hours, Mr Freed explained.We were on a bus full of people, (with) no ventilation. It was the most unorganised mess ever. People were crying. It just seemed like something from a film, it was a bit mad, he added.After arriving at the hotel itself, the pair said they had food and other supplies delivered by their family, because the hotel food was inedible.You’re paying serious money and … it’s not substantial meals. Half the time it’s cold, half the time it’s just inedible, Mr Freed said.Travellers returning from red list countries originally faced a cost of £1,750 to quarantine in a hotel when the scheme was first announced in February. The price has now risen to £2,285 for the 11-night stay.I’d rather pay for security outside my flat and they can watch me not leave,” Mrs Freed said.I don’t disagree with quarantine if that’s what the Government want to do… It’s just the cost that’s come with it, she added.The way it is run is awful. I just feel something needs to be done about it, Mr Freed said.The Holiday Inn Express declined to comment, but the Department of Health and Social Care spokesman told The : The quarantine measures we have in place are minimising the risk of variants coming into the UK and safeguarding the hard-won progress of our vaccination programme.The majority of passengers who have used the Managed Quarantine Service have been satisfied with the service. All complaints are treated seriously and are investigated fully.Francesca Desquesnes was on holiday in South Africa, preparing for a safari, when the news came through from her sister that she needed to get home now. After trying and failing to book several flights home, she finally arrived at her accommodation for the next 10 days on Dec 2. It\u0027s inhumane. I would I would actually ask any MP to come and spend 10 days in the hotel like this and do what we do and then tell us it\u0027s humane.Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab, Grant Shapps - all three of you.Ms Desquesnes\u0027s will be allowed to leave at one minute past midnight on Dec 15, but has to endure another nine days yet. She told The : I think if you\u0027re not a person that is a strong person, and you weren\u0027t mentally strong, this would destroy you. I honestly believe that this would destroy most people\u0027s sanity.This is not humane or a nice way to treat British citizens. It makes me not want to be British.She - and others in the hotel - have taken their daily exercise into their own hands and started to defy the security protocols. You have to request permission to exercise. You contact security or reception but they don\u0027t answer. Sunday I went out for an hour and it\u0027s like One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u0027s Nest. And then today, I tried doing it, and they didn\u0027t answer. So I just looked out of my room and said I\u0027m going for a walk. And that\u0027s what a lot of people are having to do. We\u0027re just defying them.I think people are wearing masks and we\u0027re following the rules. But if we want to go out for exercise, then people walk.Ms Desquesnes said the food she\u0027s been served is worse than she ate at a HIV project in Africa where she lived with 30 people in a four-bed house. It feels like a prison, she said. It really does. It feels like I\u0027m in Guantanamo Bay. I will never go to prison if this is what it\u0027s like.Michelle Bovey-Wood is trapped at the Holiday Inn Gatwick - the same hotel lambasted by Richard E Grant - with her wife Sharon and their six-year-old daughter Leah. They landed on Dec 2 to find a room that sleeps two people, having paid more than £7,000 for one that sleeps three. Mrs Bovey-Wood was told that the sofa doubled as a bed, even though there was no sheet, pillows or duvet. They had to construct their own bed out of the cushions for their daughter. She told The : Quite honestly, as far as hotel experience goes, I\u0027ve had better in a non-graded hotel in the third world. It\u0027s total abuse. It has abused basically every single human right that we have - freedom of movement - in every sense. People are rude, it\u0027s isolating, there is no support should you need it. It\u0027s horrific.Mrs Bovey-Wood was told that because they had a child, the hotel would accommodate more exercise time - three half-hour slots a day. But they are being allowed out once a day - on Sunday for seven minutes and Monday for 10 minutes. Their exercise space is the hotel\u0027s courtyard - a strip of walkway around a patch of grass. The view is the rooms they are confined to for the other 23 hours and 50 minutes a day. And the hotel tries to send them out alone to avoid mixing with other quarantining families.Mrs Bovey-Wood explained: We were told initially that we could have two to three times a day, as is necessary with a child, and it would be up to half an hour at a time.If you request it, then you wait for about half an hour. If you\u0027re lucky. Somebody will come get you. They usher you down the passage. It was seven minutes. And then there\u0027s a hurry upstairs again. And they said, \u0027No, no, no, it\u0027s going to get better\u0027, the next day we were informed - 10 minutes.And that\u0027s it once a day.  The food served is hot if you\u0027re lucky, and Monday morning\u0027s breakfast consisted of a dry crumpet with a bit of bacon, bread with margarine, three blueberries and a black banana. Lunch is a sandwich, a packet of crisps and a stale chocolate bar. Mrs Bovey-Wood said: You get better care in prisons. I think when we got the bread and margarine this morning, and they inform you of 10 minutes of exercise - which I believe your basic human rights in a prison is at least half an hour\u0027s exercise a day - then you know that there\u0027s a huge problem here.They are given one cold drink a day, but Sharon is a diabetic. Sunday\u0027s drink given to them in the evening was Coke, which Mrs Bovey-Wood explained wasn\u0027t the ideal choice for a six-year-old at night. The mood in the hotel is tense, and the family can hear complaints through the walls. I can hear from our rooms - we can hear everything - there\u0027s a lot of complaining. Of course we have no Wi-Fi either, so we can\u0027t work right now. And smokers aren\u0027t actually allowed to go and use their time for smoking - they have to keep moving.What are they doing to keep sane within the confines of their room? The little one is doing drawing and she\u0027s getting some screen time.The Bovey-Woods are emigrating to the UK from South Africa, and they have not yet been told when they will be free to leave.It has not been the dream start ot their life in the UK. Incredibly rude staff, she said. We got shoved in a room that wasn\u0027t prepared for three people. So you asked for duvets and incredibly rude staff say you have to make up your own beds, that kind of stuff. It\u0027s just grown progressively worse because it\u0027s very clear that they don\u0027t have enough staff to deal with everything.Lauren Hopkins, a recruitment agency boss, says she faces another 11 days stranded in South Africa because there is no quarantine hotel room available until Dec 13 in the UK. She arrived in South Africa on Nov 21 for a 10 day holiday but fears she will not be back in her home until just before Christmas Day.I run a small independent recruitment agency and having worked tirelessly throughout the pandemic to keep it going, I was in desperate need of a break. In reality, this experience has been anything but relaxing and stress free. In all honesty I am ashamed to be British. I, and hundreds of other British citizens have been completely abandoned by our own Government. To say I feel let down is a gross understatement. It\u0027s an utter disgrace.Flights aren\u0027t an issue, it\u0027s getting a hotel quarantine booking that\u0027s keeping us all here. They haven\u0027t put nearly enough on for the amount of us. We\u0027ve been trying since Sunday November 28th to get a booking with no luck. At the moment the 13th December is the earliest availability, meaning we come out Christmas Day and have to fund an extra 11 nights in South Africa. From the communication of the quarantine decision to the lack of any help or cooperation from the Embassy officials to the cancellation of flights homeward, to the severe shortage of quarantine hotels, the acts of our Government have been shocking in their ineptitude.I will never again place faith in politicians or in Departments of State.Richard E Grant has said he was left “confounded” after being stuck in a quarantine hotel charging more than twice as much as a similar alternative nearby.The Withnail and I actor said he had been visiting his 90-year-old mother in southern Africa when he was caught out by the change in travel restrictions.Speaking in a video on Twitter, Grant said: “I went to southern Africa to visit my 90-year-old mother and got caught by the red region Covid restrictions.“It took over a week and many cancelled flights to finally get home, for which I am incredibly grateful.“I understand that there are security costs in the hotel and you’ve got to pay for two Covid tests, but £228 a day to receive 3 meals a day of this very poor standard, in a supposed 4* Holiday Inn hotel, beggars belief.”Grant said his meals, which included a pre-packaged tuna and cucumber sandwich, a sausage casserole and fish and chips, would cost less than £20 to buy elsewhere.A nearby Holiday Inn not being used as a quarantine hotel costs just £89 per night, including breakfast – more than half the cost incurred by red list travellers.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Omicron Covid variant \u0026#39more transmissible\u0026#39 than delta, Boris Johnson tells ministers - watch liveGhislaine Maxwell trial latest news: Photographs of relationship between socialite and Jeffrey Epstein to be shownCoronavirus latest news: Archbishop of Canterbury condemns red list as \u0026#39travel apartheid\u0026#39 and calls for it to be scrappedWhy prosecutors are targeting the mystery of Ghislaine Maxwell’s extraordinary wealthStorm Barra hits: Forty flood alerts as UK battered by 70mph windsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"watch kamala harris became incredible disappearing vice president","story":"Kamala Harris made history as the first woman, first Black American and first Asian-American to become vice president. But after less than a year in the post, she is a historically unpopular vice president, according to The \u0027s Washington Editor Rozina Sabur. As seen in the video above, where Ms Harris was once always in the frame during Joe Biden\u0027s major addresses, she\u0027s been notably absent from the president\u0027s side of late. “For now at least, it seems she is no longer Joe Biden\u0027s heir apparent,” says Rozina Sabur.“A number of Democrats seem prepared to challenge her for the nomination should Biden not seek re-election in 2024.”More from NewsCoronavirus latest news: Archbishop of Canterbury condemns red list as \u0026#39travel apartheid\u0026#39 and calls for it to be scrappedPolitics latest news: Omicron Covid variant \u0026#39more transmissible\u0026#39 than delta, Boris Johnson tells ministers - watch liveGhislaine Maxwell trial latest news: Photographs of relationship between socialite and Jeffrey Epstein to be shownWhy prosecutors are targeting the mystery of Ghislaine Maxwell’s extraordinary wealthStorm Barra hits: Forty flood alerts as UK battered by 70mph windsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"arthur labinjo hughes must pin ghost children have vanished","story":"We must pin down where ghost children who have disappeared from schools are, says Ofsted chief in the wake of Arthur Labinjo-Hughes\u0027s murder. Ofsted chief inspector Amanda Spielman said it is really important that there is an understanding of where children are in terms of their schooling and education as the country emerges from the pandemic.Asked about so-called ghost children who have never returned to school, she told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: It\u0027s a very hard number to pin down. I\u0027ve been talking about the problems of children disappearing from school rolls for some time now.We\u0027ve known about the problems of off-rolling for a couple of years, we\u0027ve been working on that. We know how hard it became during the pandemic to work out who was still in the country, who was still taking part in school at all.There\u0027s a real need now to pin down where children are. I\u0027ve been pushing for a register of home-educated children for a long time. The plans for that were put on hold due to the pandemic.It\u0027s really, really important that we understand who the children in this country are, where they\u0027re being educated, who\u0027s taking responsibility for that. We need a real effort coming out of the pandemic to make sure that we\u0027ve got that buttoned down.Ms Spielman said they will be starting work on their investigation into services involved with child protection in Solihull, where Arthur died, next week.She told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: What\u0027s important is getting the right focus on how people are working.Alongside the investigation into the particular circumstances of poor Arthur\u0027s death, we\u0027ve been asked to lead a joint targeted area inspection, looking at all of the services that are involved with child protection in Solihull.So that\u0027s not just care and education, but also health, police, probation. It\u0027s not an investigation of the case itself, which is a separate piece of work, but we\u0027ll be looking at how those services jointly are dealing with child protection at the moment and what improvements can be made.Warnings about Arthur Labinjo-Hughes were ignored, his grandfather has said.Arthur\u0027s stepmother Emma Tustin, 32, was jailed for life at Coventry Crown Court on Friday, with a minimum term of 29 years, after being found guilty of the six-year-old\u0027s murder.His father, Thomas Hughes, 29, was sentenced to 21 years for manslaughter.Peter Halcrow, Arthur\u0027s maternal grandfather, said warnings were issued by the little boy\u0027s other grandparents.He told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: They\u0027re decent people and they were very concerned. And they issued warnings that were ignored, shall we say.As for the couple responsible for his death, Mr Halcrow said they had committed a heinous crime by killing a defenceless, innocent boy.Mr Halcrow told the broadcaster: I wouldn\u0027t give them the time of day and I wouldn\u0027t want them to see the light of day ever again.Arthur was left with an unsurvivable brain injury while in the sole care of evil Tustin.She was convicted of murder by assaulting defenceless Arthur in the hallway of her Cranmore Road home in Solihull, on June 16 2020.Arthur, whose body was covered in 130 bruises, died in hospital the next day.Mr Halcrow said he can\u0027t understand why warnings about the six-year-old\u0027s care were not heeded.He said the little boy had been well loved and well looked after by his paternal grandparents.He told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: They\u0027re decent people, and they were very concerned, and they issued warnings which were ignored, shall we say.He added: I can\u0027t understand why something wasn\u0027t done about it.I don\u0027t know who runs Solihull social services or who went round to the house, because they were called and they must have had a snapshot of the house, and they must have felt everything was fine.There\u0027s been phone calls made to West Midlands Police as well, which were not acted on. It\u0027s a tough one, when you hear the kind of abuse the boy was going through.Mr Halcrow said someone should have stepped in when alarm bells were ringing in the case of his grandson Arthur Labinjo-Hughes.Asked what he would like reviews into the six-year-old\u0027s death to consider, Mr Halcrow told Today: It\u0027s not as if it was a kind of \u0027passing by\u0027 thing. I mean, people were flagging up there were problems and social services got involved and said there was nothing to worry about, and then \u0027hey ho\u0027, three or four months later, the boy is dead.How can you ask me what I would like them to consider? I mean, they must have a tick-list to do, \u0027house is clean, everything\u0027s tidy, blah, blah, blah, so we\u0027ll not worry about it\u0027.If alarm bells are ringing all around, even neighbour statements, then surely, there must be someone or some kind of body that can step in and say \u0027right, we\u0027re taking that child out of that situation\u0027, you know?If the father is not man enough to do that himself then someone has to say \u0027this child is suffering and needs help\u0027 and take them out of the situation.

Inevitably, that will cause some impact on motor transport.“It’s about available road space, as well as effective use of that road space, and good information for users so they can plan about when they travel.”Mr Lees added that the trend was mostly driven by the UK’s strong post-pandemic recovery, adding: “If you’re sat in that congestion, then it’s probably not a good thing.“But actually, for the country, it’s not really reflecting a bad thing, because what this is showing is that the UK, and particularly London, has rebounded most quickly from the effects of the pandemic.”Duncan Dollimore, head of campaigns at the charity Cycling UK, said: “It’s incredibly simplistic for Inrix to suggest that the use of road is all about supply and demand, without considering how efficiently that road space is used.“On Blackfriars Bridge, cycle lanes take up 20 per cent of the road space but move 70 per cent of the people across it at peak times, with cycle lanes across London moving more people more efficiently in less space.“Inrix are focussed on the tarmac available for cars, when the question should be how we use and allocate that space better, changing travel behaviours and reducing congestion in the process.”Last year the traffic information supplier ranked London as only the 16th most congested city. New cycle lanes were installed in the capital in 2020 following the coronavirus outbreak, in a bid to encourage active travel.Several councils reversed the schemes following vocal opposition by motorists who claimed they caused delays, but some of the lanes remain in place.Paris was in second place in the global ranking for most congestion, followed by Brussels, Moscow and New York.Across the UK as a whole, drivers will waste an average of 73 hours in traffic this year, up 36 hours from 2020, but down 42 hours compared with pre-Covid 2019.Inrix estimated that the economic hit from drivers being stuck in traffic this year will cost an average of £595 per person, and the UK £8 billion.Trips to larger city centres still lag behind normal levels, but smaller cities are experiencing “minimal decreases in travel” which is maintaining congestion levels, according to the company.This has led to Cambridge becoming the UK’s second most congested city, followed by Bristol, Exeter and Cheltenham.More from NewsUS warns of \u0026#39nuclear\u0026#39 sanctions on Russia ahead of Joe Biden-Vladimir Putin talksPolitics latest news: Omicron Covid variant \u0026#39more transmissible\u0026#39 than delta, Boris Johnson tells ministers - watch liveCoronavirus latest news: Archbishop of Canterbury condemns red list as \u0026#39travel apartheid\u0026#39 and calls for it to be scrappedGhislaine Maxwell trial latest news: Photographs of relationship between socialite and Jeffrey Epstein to be shownWhy prosecutors are targeting the mystery of Ghislaine Maxwell’s extraordinary wealthMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"david tennant around world 80 days shows alarming side british","story":"A new BBC One adaptation of Around the World in 80 Days will highlight the “alarming” nature of the British Empire, according to its star.David Tennant said the eight-part drama, which begins on Boxing Day and is aimed at a family audience, will explore “the racial and sexual politics” of Victorian England.He plays Phileas Fogg in the updated version of Jules Vernes’ novel. Ibrahim Koma, a French actor of Malian heritage, plays Passepartout, while the original character of Detective Fix has been replaced by Abigail Fix, an intrepid journalist.Speaking to Radio Times, Tennant said his Fogg was a “damaged” character.“In many ways, Phileas Fogg represents everything that’s alarming and peculiar about that old sense of British Empire. Potentially, it’s a story about an England that should elicit very little sympathy,” he said.“Verne chose to make Phileas Fogg a particularly stuffy Englishman. We’re showing a different type of stuffy Englishman. He’s very damaged, everything is a trauma for him.”The BBC has described the drama as “an ambitious interpretation of this classic novel for a new generation”. Other actors to have played Fogg include David Niven in 1956 and Pierce Brosnan in 1989.In a separate interview at this year\u0027s Cannes Film Festival, Tennant said the 1873 novel was “of its time” and the television series would approach things from a 21st-century perspective.“It seems almost an obvious thing to do to make one of our main characters female it seems rather regressive not to,” he said.“The sexual politics of the time are investigated, and it is also brilliant that Ibrahim, who plays Passepartout, is a black man. That’s also something that I think is right and proper about having a erse cast.“This is an unusual cast of characters travelling the world, but we use it to look at the racial and sexual politics of the time.“I think that is the right way to tell that story in the 21st century - not to pretend that the world was some sort of wonderful melting pot back in the 1870s.”In his Radio Times interview, Tennant questioned the Government’s desire to have “distinctively British” television shows, asking if what they actually desire was “programmes that have a certain political viewpoint”.“Is it just a government pleading for the artist to be more sympathetic towards it? Why would the government feel they need more sympathy directed towards them? Perhaps that’s a question they should ask themselves, rather than trying to blame it on the television industry,” he said.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Omicron Covid variant \u0026#39more transmissible\u0026#39 than delta, Boris Johnson tells ministers - watch liveGhislaine Maxwell trial latest news: Photographs of relationship between socialite and Jeffrey Epstein to be shownCoronavirus latest news: Archbishop of Canterbury condemns red list as \u0026#39travel apartheid\u0026#39 and calls for it to be scrappedWhy prosecutors are targeting the mystery of Ghislaine Maxwell’s extraordinary wealthStorm Barra hits: Forty flood alerts as UK battered by 70mph windsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"progressive alliance would prolong lefts delusions","story":"It’s an old joke so forgive me if you’ve heard it before: a Labour activist is walking along a clifftop path when he sees two people – a Conservative and a Liberal Democrat – clinging to the edge for dear life. So which one does he kick off first? The Tory, of course. Business before pleasure.Those of a less political nature will scratch their heads in bewilderment at the age-old rivalry – or perhaps hatred is a more appropriate word – between the two Left-of-centre opposition parties. After all, they want many of the same things: fairer taxes, fairer industrial policy, fairer foreign policy, fairer housing, a fairer economy, a fairer voting system…Ok, you can scratch that last one, which has long been a bone of contention between Labour and the Lib Dems. But the one thing they do have in common is a desire to rid the country of this Conservative government. The problem then arises: and replace it with what?A week on Thursday voters in North Shropshire will go to the polls to elect a replacement for disgraced former cabinet minister Owen Paterson. It’s one of those classic battlegrounds at which the Lib Dems have historically gained advantage by being the less hated of the three main options. Following the traditional post-election period in which Left-leaning columnists call for a “progressive alliance” to remove the Conservatives from office, the Lib Dems have intensified their demands that Labour voters in North Shropshire switch their support to them. This is a bold strategy for a party that last finished as runner-up in the seat in 2010 and who have been soundly beaten by Labour in every general election there since. But perception is everything and Ed Davey’s party will have been bolstered in its efforts to seize the progressive standard by a peculiar editorial in this morning’s  suggesting the Lib Dems are indeed more likely to win than Labour. In by-elections, parties’ internal polling is every bit as valuable as Monopoly £500 notes, but it’s worth noting that both Labour and the Lib Dems have produced “surveys” of voters – presumably in radically different parts of the constituency – showing them to be within reach of victory. Both opposition parties desperately need the morale boost victory would bestow. But why is such a progressive alliance so difficult to attain?The elephant in the room is, of course, the 2010-2015 coalition government. Davey himself, it will never be forgotten, served as a cabinet minister in David Cameron’s administration the same one that implemented austerity, cut services and trebled university tuition fees – a reform the Lib Dems strenuously opposed during the general election campaign, then enthusiastically voted for after it had ended. In time the Lib Dems may well shake off their reputation as the Conservatives’ little helpers, but that task is all the greater when the coalition’s former climate change secretary is leading it.The fact is that Lib Dems provide the main opposition to Labour in hundreds of local areas across the country. Labour MPs in particular are familiar with the party’s cynical (but effective) campaign tactics that have so frequently left Labour in its wake. And although the Parliamentary Labour Party is now greatly depleted, there are enough older MPs still around who recall the vehemence with which the Lib Dems opposed many parts of the last Labour government’s agenda, right up until the point where they went into partnership with the Conservatives.Talk of an alliance, therefore, is fanciful. And proponents are demanding it at exactly the wrong time, when Labour has started to make serious, though modest, progress in the polls. The time to make the case for an anti-Conservative alliance is when the government is popular and is looking unbeatable. Now, when Keir Starmer looks like he might actually make the next election competitive, is not that time.From Labour’s point of view, stepping aside for the sake of the Lib Dems, even if such an arrangement falls short of a formal electoral pact, holds very few benefits. If North Shropshire were to fall to either of the opposition parties, it would not be a huge surprise, given the circumstances in which it was called. When Government ministers and backbench MPs appear on the following morning’s radio and TV bulletins to explain why the party lost, no one is going to accuse them of spin. Indeed, a Tory victory – still an outside possibility – could accurately be depicted as an astonishing victory, so poor were the party’s prospects at the start of the campaign.So what would Labour gain from a Lib Dem win? Nothing whatever, except a short-lived blip in the polls for a rival party.The challenge facing Labour is the same as it has always been, whatever optimistic scenarios of “progressive alliances” dominate the fantasies of anti-Conservative commentators: how to win an election in its own right. Yearning after a shortcut to victory, either through an electoral alliance or via electoral reform, is simply a deflection strategy that allows the Left to focus on tactics rather than to make the hard choices about how to change enough so that they attract the support of previously reluctant voters.Labour needs to go all out for victory in North Shropshire and everywhere else, treating every other party – whether the Lib Dems, the Greens or the Scottish nationalists – as as much of an opponent as the Conservatives themselves. Because if they ever get back into government, they will find – as they did between 1997 and 2010 – that so-called parties of the Left will be as supportive of a Labour government as the Conservatives will be.More from NewsCoronavirus latest news: Archbishop of Canterbury condemns red list as \u0026#39travel apartheid\u0026#39 and calls for it to be scrappedPolitics latest news: Omicron Covid variant \u0026#39more transmissible\u0026#39 than delta, Boris Johnson tells ministers - watch liveGhislaine Maxwell trial latest news: Photographs of relationship between socialite and Jeffrey Epstein to be shownWhy prosecutors are targeting the mystery of Ghislaine Maxwell’s extraordinary wealthStorm Barra hits: Forty flood alerts as UK battered by 70mph windsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"david cameron refuses say hed","story":"Exclusive: David Cameron refuses to sayhed attend Grenfell inquiry after ridiculing rulesEXCLUSIVE: Returning red-faced from a morning spot of tennis at a local club, Mr Cameron repeatedly said “morning” to the Mirror but would not answer our questions on the inquiryFormer PM David Cameron leaves his Notting Hill home Image: TIM ANDERSONByMatthew Young:,  Dec Updated:,  Dec | commentsDavid Cameron this morning refused to say whether he would attend the Grenfell Tower inquirycalled upon. It came after Michael Mansfield QC, a lawyer for the bereaved and survivors of the tragedy, yesterday said the former Tory PM should be called to answer questions at the probe into the June  fire, which killed  people. Mr Cameron said in  how he wanted to “scrap health and safety rules that put people off”, the inquiry heard on Monday. The following year he disparaged the “shadow” of health and safety, saying: “Britannia didn’t rule the waves with armbands on.” Mr Mansfield said Cameron ridiculed health and safety rules “relegating citizens…to effectively a bonfire”. Mr Cameron was being referred to by lawyers as they described more than  years of cover ups of the extent of the cladding crisis that led to the blaze. But the former PM, , refused to say this morning whether he would attend the inquirycalled upon. Returning red-faced from a morning spot of tennis at a local club, Mr Cameron repeatedly said “morning” to the Mirror but would not answer our questions on the inquiry or whether he would attend. He entered his plush Notting Hill home - which lies just one mile from Grenfell Tower - and slammed the door shut. In response to the claims made in the inquiry Mr Cameron’s spokesman said he was for “a sensible approach to health and safety [rules] to ensure they protected people and were applied where needed rather than unnecessarily overwhelm businesses with red tape”.Do you think David Cameron should face the inquiry  Join the debate in the comments below The previously inquiry heard how the government acknowledged that a rule against introducing new regulations for the building industry in the s put it in breach of its duty to protect the right to le. The hearing heard the government suppressed information about the combustibility of cladding used on Lakanal House after a fire killed six people in  in Camberwell, south east London. It noted the need to “avoid giving the impression that we believe all buildings of this constructioninherently unsafe”. The investigation into this fire was shut down by officials in a “grotesque abdication of responsibility” which “raises the spectre of a deliberate cover up”, the inqury was told.  After Lakanal, despite the government outwardly promising to implement the coroner’s recommendation to encourage the use of sprinklers, civil servants wrote that it was simply acting “to be able to say that DCLG is taking action”. A senior civil servant warned in May  – just a month before the Grenfell Tower fire – that “we or ministers are increasingly vulnerable to some or all of these risks becoming material andbeing held to account for being inactive”. The inquiry continues today.

A veteran feminist campaigner, she held the post of Secretary of State for Social Security and became the first Minister for Women. She also served as a Justice Minister, Leader of the House of Commons and Solicitor General. Ms Harman said: I entered the Commons as one of only  Labour women MPs in a parliament that was % men. Now there are  Labour women and across all parties women MPs are a “critical mass.” But there remains much more to be done till women genuinely share political power with men on equal terms and until women in this country are equal. I will leave the House of Commons with my feminism, my belief in Labour and my enthusiasm for politics undimmed. She added: When I was elected in  I promised the voters I would serve as their MP with dedication and energy till the next election and I will do that, remaining active and diligent both locally and in the Commons.

And they added: “The Prime Minister said the UK would continue to use all the economic and diplomatic tools at its disposal to prevent any Russian aggression against Ukraine.  “The leaders agreed to speak again following President Biden’s conversation with President Putin tomorrow.” The US and Russian leaders are due to speak in a video call on Tuesday amid rising tensions over a Russian troop build-up on the Ukrainian border – seen as a sign of a potential invasion. US intelligence officials have said Russia could be planning for a possible invasion as soon as early next year, while Ukrainian officials have said it could be next month. A senior Biden administration official said on Monday that Mr Biden will directly address the concerns with Mr Putin. He added the president had agreed with European counterparts that there was the option to impose “substantial economic countermeasures by both the Europeans and the United States that would impose signicant and severe economic harm on the Russian economy, should they choose to proceed” with an invasion.  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed plans on Saturday for the much-anticipated call and said it will take place in the evening. Russia is adamant the US should guarantee that Ukraine will not be admitted to the Nato military alliance. Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said the number of Russian troops near Ukraine and in Russia-annexed Crimea is estimated at ,, and warned that a “large-scale escalation” is possible in January. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, recently charged that a group of Russians and Ukrainians planned to attempt a coup in his country and the plotters tried to enlist the help of Ukraine’s richest man, Rinat Akhmetov. Russia has denied that any plot is under way, but the Russians have become more explicit recently in their warnings to Ukraine and the United States. The Kremlin said on Friday that Mr Putin, during his call with Mr Biden, would seek binding guarantees precluding Nato’s expansion to Ukraine. Mr Biden tried to head off the demand in comments to reporters on Friday before leaving for a weekend stay at Camp David.

Arthuraposs stepmother Emma Tustin, , was jailed for le at Coventry Crown Court on Friday, with a minimum term of  years, after being found guilty of the six-year-oldaposs murder. His father, Thomas Hughes, , was sentenced to  years for manslaughter. Peter Halcrow, Arthuraposs maternal grandfather, said warnings were issued by the little boyaposs other grandparents as well as social services. He said the little boy had been well loved and well looked after by his paternal grandparents.Mr Halcrow told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: Theyaposre decent people and they were very concerned. And they issued warnings that were ignored, shall we say. He added: Theymust have a tick list to do, aposhouse is clean, things are tidy, so weaposll not worry about itapos. If alarm bells are ringing all around, even neighbouraposs statements, surely there must be someone or some kind of body that can step in and stay right weaposre taking that child out of that situation. If the father is not man enough himself to do that himself, then someone has to say this child is suffering and needs help and takes them out of the situation. He added: I canapost understand why something wasnapost done about it. I donapost know who runs Solihull social services or who went round to the house, because they were called and they must have had a snapshot of the house, and they must have felt everything was fine.  Thereaposs been phone calls made to West Midlands Police as well, which were not acted on. Itaposs a tough one, when you hear the kind of abuse the boy was going through. When asked about Arthuraposs relationship with his mum Olivia Labinjo-Halcrow, who was jailed for killing her boyfriend Gary Cunningham, Mr Halcrow said they were bonded. The pair of them, Arthur and her, were so happy, he said. She was a great mother. She spoiled them rotten as motheraposs do. The grandad added: There was a whole le ahead of him. As for the couple responsible for his death, Mr Halcrow said they had committed a heinous crime by killing a defenceless, innocent boy. He told the broadcaster: I wouldnapost give them the time of day and I wouldnapost want them to see the light of day ever again.  Arthur was left with an un-survivable brain injury while in the sole care of evil Tustin. She was convicted of murder by assaulting defenceless Arthur in the hallway of her Cranmore Road home in Solihull, on June  . Arthur, whose body was covered in  bruises, died in hospital the next day. This weekend Mr Halcrow said he was “shocked and mystied” as to how social workers had missed signs that Arthur was being abused.He told The Sun: “They must never see the light of day again. No punishment could ever be enough for this pair.I have never favoured the death penalty because I know mistakes can be made by courts, but in my view they have forfeited their right to live.  “They should certainly never leave prison as long as they live for such cruelty and inhumanity.” Mr Halcrow, from Dunkeld, Perthshire, said that he felt physically sick while following the court case online, and added that he hadnapost realise how much his grandson had suffered until the case. I don’t think I’ll ever get over this.” On Sunday, the community gathered in Arthuraposs home town of Solihull, West Midlands, for a balloon release in his memory. Arthur’s gran Madeleine Halcrow wept as hundreds of balloons were released into the air. Meanwhile, Ofsted will hold a separate inspection focusing on the safeguarding agencies in Solihull. Arthuraposs body currently remains in a mortuary because both families are allegedly not agreeing on who is organising the funeral.

Harry Brinkworth, who is  today, received hundreds of birthday cards from well-wishers after children in his class turned down his birthday invitations.The youngster was left sobbing after classmates said apostheir parents did not like himapos and would not go to his party.Harryaposs mum Hannah Brinkworth, , decide to take to Instagram to try and cheer up her son after the cruel incident.She asked members of the public to send him a birthday card to make his birthday special. This morning Harry woke up to almost  cards from kind strangers across the world wishing him a great birthday, with possibly even more in the post.  Mum Hannah is also organising him a bowling birthday party after she was approach by other parents saying their children wanted to celebrate his th birthday with him. When asked what he thought of the hundreds of cards and messages that he had received, Harry said: It was the best birthday I have ever had. Hannah was initially upset by the way he was treated but has since been blown away by the response of complete strangers. She wanted to raise awareness of autism and to give her son something to make his birthday. Weaposre not doing it for any kind of pity party, and we donapost want people to buy or send expensive things, she added. Itaposs just a case of making people aware of it and making a little boyaposs day.Harry has been receiving the cards since December  when Hannah posted on Instagram with some coming from people as far away as New Zealand. He was so excited to read all the nice messages.Hannah said: It was special for him, and he enjoyed it - he just wanted to read every single one of them like a book.Everybody was referring to him as a superhero and saying that heaposd done such a positive thing.He had a card from Dubai and a card from Texas, and also one from somebody in Canada and New Zealand.All of the excitement made Harry very happy, but he also has understood the importance to be inclusive and kind towards others.Hannah said: He understands the bigger picture of it, and he knows why itaposs important and itaposs not just him.After today, the conversation will continue and so it should - thataposs the important part.With autism, people are almost scared to have the conversation and scared to bring it up, but we shouldnapost be - we should celebrate our kids regardless.Thereaposs been so many people reaching out and sharing similar experiences.Every birthday, Hannah tries to organise a birthday for Harry but none of the children every come.  She said that it is usually the parents and not the children who do not want to go, and that there needs to be a change in attitude in how parents talk about children who may have additional or special education needs.Hannah continued: Harry is autistic, and weaposve known for a long time, and heaposs not a bad kid in any way.He always wants birthday parties, but historically, every year we try to sort one and nobody comes.I mentioned to him that I needed to know what friends he wanted to come to his party so I could send invites.He said two names, but when I asked again he said they werenapost allowed to come.I said I didnapost understand, and he turned around and, at -years-old, said one had told him their mum doesnapost like him and they canapost play with him.She said: I found it absolutely baffling - itaposs not the kidsapos issue, itaposs the parentsapos lack of understanding about Harryaposs issues.Itaposs not discussed enough how parents talk about kids with additional needs or SEN issues, and they donapost understand the impact of what they say in front of their kids, which is then repeated - itaposs unacceptable.She added: The amount of people who have kids with autism or ADHD who have said similar things, it shows that itaposs not kids who are the issues, itaposs the grown-ups.

James Stokoe, , was murdered in front of his four-year-old son, Harry, when he was stabbed to death by a complete stranger. Alexander Layton, , was jailed for le with a minimum -year term as Jamesapos family spoke of their aposunimaginableapos loss. The two men had a row when Mr Stokoe had to brake suddenly as Layton crossed Trenchard Avenue in Thornaby, Teesside on May  last year. Layton was captured on CCTV and Dashcam by passing motorists when he plunged the in kitchen kne six times into Mr Stokoe as Harry sat in a car seat in the back of the BMW.  Peter Makepeace QC, prosecuting, told Teesside crown court there were several aggravating factors in the case, including the impact of the crime on Harry at such a young age. The offence was committed in the presence of the victimaposs four-year-old son, he said. In the victim impact statement of his mother Alex Stokoe, she told of her sonaposs inability to stay in the car as it drives down Trenchard Avenue because he had so many memories of the traumatic events.  Harry is also fearfulanyone approaches an open window of a car, the court heard. Heartbroken mum Alex, a university lab technician, watched proceedings via a video link as she felt unable to attend in person, Mr Makepeace said. Instead, he read out her moving victim impact statement. She wrote: James will be remembered and loved as long as I breathe. Our son will always know what a wonderful father James was and how much he loved him.  She told how she was a single mother at , not because she chose to be, but because her husband had been apostorn away from usapos. She said: I will never be able to accept referring to James in the past tense. He should be here. Explaining to her son that his dad aposwould not be coming home againapos was the most painful moment of her le, she added. She said: A child should not be frightened when the car window is open in case someone comes to hurt them.  I now face le as a -year-old widow. I have lost not just my husband but my best friend and soulmate, he was everything to me. To tell your four-year-old that his daddy is dead and wonapost be coming home is truly the most horrendous, painful moment of my le. To know your child has seen things that no child should ever have to see or hear. To explain the process of death and how James died. Funeral, cremation the finality of it all, so our son could understand what was happening around him. Harry accepts as much as a child of that age can, that his daddy is dead, that he isnapost coming back. She told Layton: Harry has needed therapy because of the trauma that you have caused. In a heart-rending testimony, Jamesapos mother Doreen told how she had lost her only child. Her world had been changed forever on the day she lost her aposamazingapos son, who loved his family with all his heart, aposhis hopes and dreams for the future never to be realisedapos. Sentencing Layton to le imprisonment, His Honour Judge Howard Crowson said he had inflicted eight serious injuries to his victim as he sat in the front seat of his car, unable to defend himself. James Stokoe was a happy, successful husband, father and son, he added. His four-year-old son was in the rear of the car...and is still in fear of another attack. Layton had a history of violence, including attacks on his own mother.Temporary Det Supt Helen Barker of Cleveland Police said after the case: This was a shocking incident which occurred in the presence of Jamesapos young son, which will undoubtedly have had a huge effect on him.The death of James has had a traumatic impact on his whole family. James was a much loved dad to his little boy and was married in the Dominican Republic. The popular graduate of Teesside University was a keen footballer, a motorbike enthusiast and worked in the motor industry. At the time of his death, friends paid tribute to a gentle giant who was affectionately known as Big Red.

Urenna Okonkwo is set to marry her fiancé Emmanuel in Nigeria on December  but their plans could be left in tatters, MyLondon reports.But the country has now been placed on the UKaposs red list - meaning whoever leaves England to celebrate with them faces a £,-per person hotel quarantine bill. The couple from Blackheath, south east London, were hoping to be joined by friends and family and say they now canapost sleep due to the worry. They made plans earlier this year and have already shelled out on their big day after inviting around  people.  After picking December for the traditional wedding because their family would already be flying back home to spend Christmas with their loved ones, they thought it was the ideal time. But Urenna said: We booked hotel rooms for guests, money we canapost get backthis doesnapost go ahead, itaposs a nightmare. The past few days have been very stressful, finding out alternative solutions, Iaposve barely slept since Saturday evening, I donapost want to dwell too much on the problems, right now we are thinking of solutions. I have a very big family so quarantine would be an extra £,! Itaposs now a waiting game with the red list reviewed every three weeks, meaning they wonapost know more until December .  Alongside this, the couple will also be spending £, on their English wedding next summer. They say they have been left with no choice but to look for alternative plans. We donapost know how rules will change so we are looking at going somewhere  after Nigeria, rather than coming directly back to UK, the bride-to-be added. We are exploring dferent options, because no one can pay that £, unless youaposre a millionaire, then you add up Covid tests - my whole family wont be able to do that. Also some of my immediate family work in healthcare so they cannot take time off work to quarantine or go somewhere , they have uni and January exams, they cant even have the extra ten days - they wouldnapost be able to go there at allit stays on red list. The night before the wedding is a smaller ceremony called Marriage Rites, people from the home town meet with the family of the groom and they do bride pricing and dowry. With so much changing so quickly, keep on top of what is happening with the Mirroraposs news updates by email. Delivered straight to your inbox, our daily coronavirus briefing will keep you informed of what is happening with Covid, lockdown, the vaccination rollout and the impact on how we live.here. The next day we have the proper ceremony in Igbo tradition, the bride comes out with bridesmaids and they dance into the venue, or location of wedding, she then goes to her parents and they give her wine and she dances around and finds her groom. She then gives the cup to the groom ad he drinks out of it, both of them are then blessed by the brideaposs parents. Itaposs a terrible thing the Government has done, especially as its Christmas and loads of Nigerians are travelling, one of my friends lives in Nigeria, he was meant to come to get his wedding outfit in the UK, but doesnapost know what he will do now.

The father-of-two has now said he feels like a rug has been “pulled out” from under him after his PCR kit was lost. He is now hoping for compensation from the retailer, as well as for things to line up for him to get into Thailand before Christmas.The father-of-two has shared his disappointment withBristol Liveand said he will never use Bootsapos services ever again.The retailer has since apologised for the mishap and offered to pay for a “full refund for the price of his test”, but Nick believes he is entitled to more. On November , the -year-old visited the health retailer and pharmacyaposs Broadmead branch to take a PCR test, requiring a negative result to enable him to fly, and was told to wait up to  hours for a result.  Even when the deadline had passed two days after his test, he was convinced he would receive an email from the laboratory as Boots is a huge household name. But on the morning of his planned flight at :am on December , he still hadnapost heard back about his test, despite having attempted to find out multiple times. Unsure what to do, Nick went to the airport regardless, but his efforts were in vain. I had no choice as I had to go to the airport either way and my flight was leaving at that point,” he said. There was no way I could have got my PCR test but I thought the only way was to ring them up and seethey had my results ready. Nick added that only when there was  minutes left before check-in closed was he informed by a staff member at Boots that his test was lost in transit. Despite pleading with Boots that he hadn’t seen his children for almost two years and wanted to be with his family over the Christmas holidays, the company told him the best they could do was offer a full refund of £, the cost of the test kit. Nick said: I was absolutely fuming - I tried to ring up to look for a complaints department to speak to someone who could help and give me a bit of empathy about the situation When I had spoken to a member of staff, they said to me that they would pass on my message and get someone to call back. “Usually they said it takes them  hours for a response but also that it might take longerthey’re busy. That’s when I decided to not ring them anymore because it was a waste of time. Nick is now hoping to rebook his flight to reunite with his family, who he hasn’t seen since January last year, but fears it could be dficult. Before you travel to Thailand, you need to have a Thai pass so you can enter the country and you must have a lot of things put in place before you can get the pass such as booking for a hotel,” he said. So the knock-on effect of what Boots did is huge and I definitely feel after all the losses my family and I had suffered from, there is definitely compensation that I’m entitled to. This trip was about spending time with my family but I had to tell them over the phone that I’m not going to be there. They were so upset and so angry at Boots. They made me make my kids cry. Nick is now hoping compensation from the retailer. “I thought Boots was meant to be this big name who would never do anything like this and that’s why I went to them, but they were awful, he said. That’s why I’m doubling my efforts to fix things because they don’t seem to care every time I’ve spoken to them. Boots has since apologised for causing such distress. A spokesperson for the retailer said: At Boots we offer a range of Fit to Fly COVID- tests and the vast majority of them are processed normally within our recommended time frames. Unfortunately, in the case of Nicholas Baggs, his test went missing in transit to the laboratory – a very rare occurrence. We offer our wholehearted apology to Mr Baggs for the disruption this has caused to his travel plans and have offered a full refund for the price of his test.

Reports today have suggested that f ather and son have barely spoken over the last eight months and that relations between them are at an all-time low. It is alleged the pair have had only a few fraught conversations on the phone since Harry and we Meghan Markle quit their roles as senior royals and moved to Calornia in .And since stepping down as a working royal, Harry has spoken out several times criticising his father and the wider Royal Family. However, their bond hasnapost always been so strained - and Charles even stepped in to walk daughter-in-law Meghan down the aisle on her wedding day.  Here we look at Harry and Charlesapos fragile relationship and what their future might bring... Childhood daysHarry is the second son of Charles and his late ex-we Princess Diana. They also have an older son, Harry.Speaking in , Charles told a documentary, he tried to spend as much time as he could with his young sons. However, royal biographer Penny Junor once claimed that Charles had been a remote figure. Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up.She told the Daily Beast : It is a slightly tricky relationship because Charles has always been quite a remote figure, he has always been consumed by work.That’s not a product of a lack of love. It’s a product of the fact he is so focused on his work, and the need to make a dference in the world that, like many people who are seeking to make a dference in the world, he has sometimes overlooked friends and loved ones beside him.” Dianaaposs death  As a young boy, Harry saw the breakdown of his parentaposs marriage, which played out in the full media spotlight. In  - a year after Charles and Dianaaposs orce was finalised - Diana died following a horric car crash in Paris, leaving her two sons grief-stricken. Both William and Harry were staying at Balmoral with Charles at the time, and it was down to their dad to break the terrible news to them. In , Harry praised Charles for the way he looked after both him and William in the wake of their tragic motheraposs death.In a BBC documentary, Harry said: One of the hardest things for a parent to have to do is to tell your children that your other parent has died. How you deal with that, I donapost know. But, you know, he was there for us.He was the one out of two left and he tried to do his best to make sure that we were protected and looked after. But you know, he was going through the same grieving process as well. Closer than William Also in , Harry guest-edited The Today programme on BBC Radio , where he interviewed Charles - affectionately calling him aposPaapos. In the interview, Harry revealed how he values his fatheraposs opinion saying: I do end up picking your brains more now than I ever have done.Speaking earlier this year, royal expert and author Robert Jobson even remarked how Harry had been closer to his father than William. Wedding woes  In , Harry started dating his now-we Meghan with the pair tying the knot at St Georgeaposs Chapel in Windsor in May . In the lead-up to the wedding, it was revealed that Meghanaposs father Thomas would not be attending - prompting Charles to step in and walk Meghan part-way down the aisle. Speaking about the moment, Harry told a  BBC documentary: I asked him to and I think he knew it was coming, and he immediately said aposyes, of course, Iaposll do whatever Meghan needs and Iaposm here to support you.apos For him, thataposs a fantastic opportunity to step up and be that support, and you know heaposs our father so of course heaposs going to be there for us. The wedding also took place just weeks before a special Buckingham Palace garden party was held to mark Charlesapos th birthday. There, Harry made a touching speech and said: His enthusiasm and energy are truly infectious it has certainly inspired William and I to get involved in issues we care passionately about and to do whatever we can to make a dference. In fact, many of the issues William and I now work on are subjects we were introduced to by our father growing up. Sandringham summit After just over a year as working royals, Harry and Meghan decided they want to quit the Firm and step down from their roles.A summit was held at Sandringham between the Queen, Harry, Charles and William to thrash out a deal - and Harry and Meghan eventually settled in Calornia with young son Archie. Earlier this year, the Mirror revealed that Charles had been working hard to keep in touch with his son and his family.Oprah fallout In March , both Harry and Meghan sat down for a tell-all chat with Oprah Winfrey, which proved explosive.During the bombshell interview, Harry accused his dad of cutting him off financially and claimed he had stopped taking his calls. My family literally cut me off financially, Harry said in March.Iaposve got what my mum left me, and without that, we would not have been able to do this. I think she saw it coming, Harry said, adding that it was the inspiration behind Harry and Meghan seeking to land a Netflix deal.Harry also said he felt really let down by his father, saying: He knows what pain feels like. Of course I will always love him but thereaposs a lot of hurt thataposs happened and I will continue to make it one of my priorities to try and heal that. In addition, Harry has also appeared on the Apple TV series The Me You Canapost See, where he spoke about the royalsapos total neglect and the Armchair Expert podcast, where he lashed out at Charlesaposs parenting.  He told the podcast : When it comes to parenting,Iaposve experienced some form of pain or suffering because of the pain or suffering that perhaps my father or my parents had suffered, Iaposm going to make sure I break that cycle so that I donapost pass it on.Itaposs a lot of genetic pain and suffering that gets passed on anyway, so we as parents should be doing the most we can to try and say aposyou know what, that happened to me, Iaposm going to make sure that doesnapost happen to youapos. UK visits Shortly after the Oprah interview, the royals went into mourning after the death of Prince Philip at the age of .It saw Harryto the UK for the first time since quitting the Firm to attend his grandfatheraposs funeral. Many pinned their hopes on the reunion of father and son being the catalyst for them to clear the air. But following the service, Harry quickly ed to the US, where Meghan had remained as she was heavily pregnant with their daughter Lilibet. A source told the Mirror at the time: Harry didn’t expect everything to be completely back to normal but his feeling after seeing his family was there is a lot of ground to make up.Whether that is harder or easier to do on the other side of the world remains to be seen There is a lot of distrust in the camp and everything is still very, very raw. Harry also travelled to the UK several month later in July to unveil a statue of his late mother Princess Diana - but on this trip, didnapost see Charles. aposWhackingapos Charles It has recently been reported that Harry met with Mahfouz Marei Mubarak bin Mahfouz in  after the Saudi tycoon gave £, to the princeaposs charity and hinted he would give millions more. Mahfouz later donated £.million to Charles’ Prince’s Foundation and received an honorary CBE months later. The Charity Commission has launched an investigation. Mr Mahfouz denies any wrongdoing and Clarence House has previously said Charles had no knowledge of the alleged cash for honours scandal. In a statement at the weekend, Harry said he severed ties with Mahfouz a year before he was presented the CBE and said he had concerns over the businessman’s ‘motives’.And Angela Levin, Harry ’s biographe r, said: He doesn’t mention Charles by name in his statement but it’s a clear case of one-upmanship.Harry looks for any occasion to whack his father and criticise him. It’s sad. Future relationship   Now in the wake of that statement, it is reported that Harry and Charles have barely spoken in eight months. In fact, Charles is still yet to meet his six-month-old granddaughter Lilibet. Next year, Harry is set to release a tell-all memoir, which he promises will be a wholly-truthful and accurate account of his le so far.And author Andrew Morton, who famously wrote a biography on Princess Diana, says that Charles could be in the firing line again when Harryaposs book is published.He told the Royally Us podcast: If I was Prince Charles, I’d be looking for a pile of coats to hide under. Because I think that the book that’s going to come out next year is written by someone who spends a lot of time investigating father-son relationships because he ghost-wrote a book on Andre Agassi, who had a dficult relationship with his father. So I think we’re going to see Charles once more in the firing line. SoI was Prince Charles, I’d be looking for a hard hat and a flak jacket.But according to The Sun, Charles, , is keeping a dignied silence about his relationship with his son. And one former aide to The: The prince absolutely adores Harry. He will feel absolutely devastated by this distraught.He’ll be beside himselfthis means he also becomes more ostracised from his grandchildren. It’s such a sad state of affairs.

Families dubbed the Christmas meet-and-greet embarrassing and a shambles after kids queued for ages to sit down with Mr Claus at Northallerton Town Hall on Friday.The volunteer Santa turned up in the back of a x with the rest of the traffic and without prior warning, meaning the kids were busy when he arrived, one annoyed mum said.And some children didnapost get to meet St Nick because organisers, Northallerton Council, ran out of presents, Yorkshire Live reports. Parents claimed their kids were distraught after the Christmas do, with some coming away and askingthey could meet the real Santa.Another ticked off mum said she wondered how many kids went home not believing.  The free event was held on Friday at Northallerton Town Hall and was organised by the town council, who have responded to the complaints saying that it will have a review and publish an online survey to establish where improvements can be made for the future. One parent who visited with her five-year-old son told YorkshireLive that overall it was a complete shambles. She said: The main issues were that Santa arrived at .pm with the rest of the traffic with no warning before. Most people hadn’t even arrived at this point. My little boy was on a ride at this point and missed him.  The High Street was kept open during the event, despite the ongoing Town Square regeneration works which meant there was less space for families to manoeuvre. The woman added: There was people trying to dodge traffic with their little ones in the dark. Santa then appeared at the town hall doors and a huge group of people were pushing and shoving to get to the front - there was absolutely no organisation at all. The Santa was absolutely terrible. His outfit was falling to bits and his beard was hung down below his chin. One man said to the security stood next to Santa how rubbish the he was and they just laughed at him. My little boy was really upset. We didn’t get the chance to meet Santa as they ran out of presents and he knew he was a fake as he kept asking ‘where is the real Santa ’ Other comments on a community page include one person who said the event should have been cancelled. She wrote: A very big disappointment  embarrassment to Northallerton. I feel sorry for the children, tonight was something for them to look forward to after last year. It would be interesting to know how many children have stopped believing. Another wrote: Embarrassing for our town! The whole thing was a shambles. Why did they not close the road for a start  Cars and buses trying to get through crowdaposs of people, theyaposre lucky no one got hurt. Were they expecting just a few people to turn up. Such a shame for the kids . A spokeswoman at the council said: Northallerton Town Council would like to thank everyone who attended the Festive Friday event. There was a lively atmosphere on the High Street, due to the very high attendance, with more than  children receiving presents from Santa and High Street businesses benefiting from additional custom during late opening. We had detailed discussions with representatives of Hambletons Multi-Agency Safety Advisory Group beforehand and were advised that closure of the High Street was not necessary. However, space restrictions around the Town Hall, caused by the Town Square reconstruction works, meant it was more crowded on the night than had been anticipated. All those who wanted to meet Santa were able to do so. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that some negative comments have been posted on social media and, as always after events, we will undertake a thorough review to establish where improvements can be made for the future including an online survey of the public about the evening.

Grace Westwood had a party in the playroom in the only home she has ever known months after surviving a stroke. The youngster from Birmingham made history when she was fitted with the Berlin Heart machine in May. Her parents Becci and Darren told the Mirror how they cannot give her the one gt she desperately needs – the gt of le in the form of a donated heart.Without that operation she will never be able to leave Newcastle’s Freeman Hospital to enjoy her childhood at home with big brother Josh. Mum Becci said: “We are so glad we can make these memories, because we didn’t knowGrace would reach her birthday. “But milestones like these are a painful reminder how long we have been here.” Being reliant on a mechanical heart carries signicant risks and last month Grace suffered a stroke that left her temporarily paralysed down the right side of her body. She appears to have made a full recovery the paralysis but now her parents are desperate for a transplant to take place in case it happens again.  Before receiving her heart machine, Grace had spent  months in hospital after developing cardiomyopathy in March . Darren said: “It has made a huge dference. We can go outside, as long as we stay on the hospital grounds. So Grace can experience some of the simple things she missed out on, like touching the grass and listening to the birds sing.” Becci said: “We have no idea how long it will take to find a suitable heart for Grace. We don’t know how much longer she can wait.” Organ donation is now an opt out system in the UK after The Mirror’s Change The Law For Le campaign led to the introduction of Max and Keira’s Law in May last year.

A large number of children were admitted with coronavirus last month in Tshwane, the metropolitan area that includes the capital Pretoria, raising concerns that the newly identied Omicron could pose greater risks for young children than other iants.  This could, in part, be because children have not been offered the Covid vaccine as much as adults,at all.Children  years and under were not yet eligible for a jab in South Africa. But mathematician and professor of operational research Prof Christina Pagel, who works at University College London, did not think the trend was a result of the vaccine programme. Vaccination rates were low across all age bands in South Africa, she said. But it is worrying. Something has changed about the virus that is now affecting children under five, and we donapost know what it is,” she added.Downing Street has said there is “no hard evidence” to suggest children are worse affected by the Omicron iant, according toSun Online reports.It was not clear how the iant would behave and spread from country to country. Up until now, children have been largely unaffected by the virus, only suffering mildly from the virus in the majority of cases. It was not clear at this stage how the emergence of Omicron could change this. Scientists are yet to determine what severity of illness is caused by the Omicron iant, first detected in southern Africa last month and since seen in more than  countries, and whether it may be more resistant to existing vaccines. But an article by the South African Medical Research Council based on early observations at the Steve Biko Tshwane District Hospital Complex in Pretoria over the last two weeks contained reassuring signs. The common symptoms of Covid have altered slightly through the pandemic in response to new emerging iants as well as the vaccines. Dr Angelique Coetzee, chair of the South African Medical Association who first sounded the alarm about the Omicron iant, has claimed it causes dferent symptoms. The main Omicron symptoms she had seen in young men, she said, were:Fatigue Body aches HeadacheAccording to Dr Coetzee, who is also on the Ministerial Advisory Committee on Vaccines, patients so far had not reported loss of smell or taste. Meanwhile, public health specialist Ntsakisi Maluleke, who works in the Gauteng province, told Reuters that many patients were reporting “non-specic” flu-like symptoms such as a scratchy throat. Ms Maluleke urged adults not to take flu-like symptoms lightly and to get tested with haste. While she reassured children were more likely to suffer only “mild disease”, there has been mixed reporting around whether the new iant was causing mild or serious illness in children in South Africa. Dr Rudo Mathivha, of Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital in Soweto, said children were becoming more ill as a result of the virus than before. We are now seeing them [children] coming in with moderate to severe symptoms needing supplemental oxygen, needing supportive therapy, needing to stay in hospital for quite a number of days,” she said. The NHS lists the three main symptoms of Covid in children and adults as:a high temperature a new, continuous cough – this means coughing a lot, for more than an hour, or  or more coughing episodes in  hours a loss or change to sense of smell or taste Experts on the ZOE Covid Symptom Study app have urged parents tolook for other common signsin children including: fatigue headache fever sore throat loss of appetiteRead MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON NHSReuters AGUniversity College LondonSteve BikoAppsHospitalsTherapyFluCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Image: Getty Images iStockphotoByMya BollanTrainee Trends WriterDiana Buntajova:,  Dec Those who regularly reach for the box of paracetamol to keep an ache or pain at bay should be aware of what the warning signs of the possible side effects look like. From reducing a fever to keeping that hangover at bay, the painkiller can be taken in the form on tablets, capsules, syrup or as a dissolvable tab. It is also an ingredient of many other types of medication. However, much like any other medicine, paracetamol has a list of possible side effects. These warning signs can be a range of things, including something you might notice when using the loo. The NHS reports that paracetamol “rarely” causes side effectsyou stick to the right dosage.The usual recommended dose is one or two  milligram tablets taken up to four times in a -hour period, according to the health body.However, like any drug, paracetamol also has possible side effects some people can experience, reports The Express.One side effect, which warrants medical help and ceasing its use, is dark pee, as reported by Drugs.Dark pee is associated with another side effect of the drug - jaundice. Jaundice describes your skin and the whites of your eyes turning yellow.  The health portal Patient.Info explains that jaundice can occur because of paracetamol poisoning. This can cause acute liver failure, which may turn your skin and eyes yellow. Jaundice is triggered by high blood levels of the bile pigment called bilirubin in your body. This bile can turn your pee dark. Apart from dark urine, jaundice can also be spotted when you have a poo as it can colour your stool clay.If you experience any symptoms linked to jaundice you need to get “urgent medical help”, the NHS warns.Drugs also advises stopping taking paracetamolyou’re doing so. However, jaundice and toilet signs are not common paracetamol side effects. To see a full list of possible side effects, refer to the patient information leaflet that came with your medicine. To avoid any unwanted problems caused by the drug, the NHS stresses the importance of sticking to the right dose. Another “serious” side effect that can happen in some cases is an allergic reaction to the medicine. The warning signs to spot include: Skin rash that may include itchy, red, swollen, blistered, or peeling skin Wheezing Tightness in the chest or throat Trouble breathing or talking Swelling of mouth, face, lips, tongue, or throat. It’s important to go to AE or call you experience symptoms like these.

A month after the -year-old dog passed away, Andrea McNally has now created a beautul festive tribute for her beloved Staffordshire bull terrier, Boycie. The -year-old saved the stick from Boycie’s final walk before he fell ill, and has adorned it with fairy lights, baubles and decorations, now proudly hanging in her home in Maidstone, Kent. She said: “Boycie was a good boy and a really lovely dog. Whenever we went out we would bring him a stick back, and when we found out he wasn’t very well, we started saving a couple because I’d seen an idea on Pinterest that I wanted to do - and I knew just the right dog to find me one.”  Boycie was known to keep the family’s garden fire-pit well stocked with wood, but there was one stick he brought home on his final walk that Andrea knew would be perfect for her tribute. The mum-of-three added: “I got some lights and decorations that I liked and decided to get crafty with it, because I like to do stuff like that. “It’s not been a great year, so I wanted to get the Christmas decorations up to feel a bit festive, and this is definitely one I’ll be getting out every year now.” The TeamDogs Christmas Gt Guide, sponsored by Keep Wales Tidy, is packed with more than  treats, toys, gadgets and garments to make every dog’s tail wag with holly jolly joy on December .

Boycie had to be put to sleep four weeks ago after vets discovered a tumour on his heart that would be dficult to operate on. Andrea said: “Over the last year he started having infections, sore paws and then his breathing was getting a bit laboured. We took him to the vets and they said he had a tumour on his heart, but because of his age it wasn’t worth putting him through the surgery, so we had to say goodbye to him about four weeks ago. But now Andrea, who is married with three children, has five-year-old Staffy, Boe, and new French bulldog puppy, Bobby, to keep her busy over the festive season. The -year-old shared her Christmas decoration on a Facebook group dedicated to Staffordshire bull terriers, and wrote: “Lost my best boy recently and he loved to collect big sticks out on walks. He would often bring them home.He picked up a stick on his last walk and I decided to make a Xmas decoration from it. Thought I would share it because they turned out well. Great way to remember a great friend.” Other dog owners fell in love with the idea, with one writing: “Oh my this made me cry losing your dog is so heartbreaking this is a really lovely reminder.” Another added: “What a great tribute to a great friend.

She and her aunt are now fighting in court over a £, homeAnabel Mattingley outside High Court during hearing in battle over her mums will Image: Champion NewsByLeonie Chao-Fong:,  Dec A university student who says her dying mum’s sister betrayed a “promise to look after her” is embroiled in a bitter family row over a £, house. Anabel Mattingley, , says before her mother Kim died in  she trusted her sister Karen Bugeja would care for her daughter emotionally and financially after she was gone. Anabel told Londonaposs High Court that Kim Mattingley, a former JP Morgan banker, did not leave her £, house directly to her daughter in her will because she was worried that her ex-husband would lay claim to it. Instead, she left the property to her sister but set up a secret trust verbally, ensuring that Karen knew a share of the property was to be owned by Anabel. Anabel and her aunt are now fighting in court.  Karen has insisted that her promise to her sister created only a moral obligation and not a legal route for Anabel to claim ownersapos rights over the property. The court heard that Kim Mattingley died after having been diagnosed with skin cancer which later spread. She had enjoyed a successful career in banking, before becoming an alternative therapist and moving from her £, house in Kings Hill, Kent, to Switzerland, where she died in . Kim and Karen’s mother, Joan White, moved into Kimaposs house, having paid off the mortgage for her. The home remained under Kim’s name but she signed over a -year lease allowing her mum to live there, as well as giving her sister a % share of the value to reflect the cash their mum had poured in. Anabel is now demanding that her aunt sign over a .% share of the house to her, claiming she has betrayed a promise she made to her dying sister by hanging onto the ownership Kim handed her in her will. Speaking in the witness box, the student told Judge Malcolm Davis-White QC that her mum had expected her sister to care for her daughter after her death and had even looked into making her Anabelaposs legal . She added that Karen had understood that she was meant to pass a .% share of the house legally to Anabel. She told the judge: ”My mother told me it would be enough for me to put down for a house. She told me Karen would look after it and provide to me what was necessary. She tried very hard to make me understand and listen. I didnapost want to have the conversation because I didnapost want to contemplate the fact that she was going to die.”  Explaining why her share of the property was not just left to her in the will, she added: She didnapost want my father to get any of it. She thought she was doing the right thing in getting my aunt to look after it and that she would provide for me.” Representing Karen, barrister Adrian Carr told Anabel: The only instructions were that the property would go to your aunt and be held for the benefit of your grandmother. Thataposs what your mother said in her will. Thereaposs nothing to suggest that there was a secret trust. There is no specic mention of a binding obligation on your aunt. This is a straightforward simple will, where your mother directed that your aunt should have the house to look after your grandmother. Anabel denied the lawyer’s claim, saying that her mum had told Karen during a crucial conversation that she wanted the share of the house to pass legally to her daughter and Karen had “agreed. I think the instructions have created a trust, she told the judge, adding that after her mumaposs death her aunt had told her she didnapost deserve to have any of it and that it was our grandmotheraposs house”. Karen told the judge she wants to protect Joan, her and Kim’s mother, who still lives in the house, and has a lease which is coming towards its end. In the will she left me the house, she said. Both my sister and I considered it to be our motheraposs house. Anabel was telling me it was her house. Iaposm fighting this because I didnapost believe my sister would have told me that I was obliged legally to give Anabel a share of a property my mother lives in. Mum paid the mortgage off. She was entitled to have the house. It was her home for  years. In my opinion she is morally entitled to it. She told the barrister that once her mum has moved out of the home and has her care costs covered, she would consider passing some of the value on to Anabel, but that this would be a discretionary choice on her part, rather than Anabelaposs legal right. Anabel has been left the remainder of her mumaposs estate under the will including assets in Switzerland and Spain. The judge has now reserved his decision in the case to be delivered at a later date.

Yanice Wood, , was verbally abused by a stranger who swore at her and said aposgo back to your own countryapos. The horried teen was shocked during the incident in a housing estate in Edinburgh, and the altercation was caught on camera. A woman wearing a green jacket and carrying two Farmfoods bags walks passed her before stopping to turn and spit at her. As she spits, a disgusting pray of saliva is seen coming out of the vile womanaposs mouth and flying towards the -year-old nursery teacher.  The camera then moves to Yaniceaposs pink jacket, where a patch of spit is seen, as the middle-aged woman walks off shouting. She can be heard hurling abuse at Yanice, saying: Away you go you f*****g specky c**t. “Because I’ve got cancer in the mouth you silly cow. “Away you go back to your own country. “You have AIDS now.”  Yanice, from Edinburgh, says: “Ew get your f*****g black teeth out my f*****g face. “What the f**k  “F*****g b***h. I got that on video you f*****g ugly c**t. “She f*****g spat on me.” Yanice’s friend can then be heard saying: “You f*****g racist b***h. Racist b***h. “Shut up you fat b***h, go to the gym. “She’s got AIDS and she’s just spat on you. “She just said ‘you’ve got AIDS now you f*****g b***h’. “She literally just said that.”Speaking to Edinburgh Live, Yanice said: “The lady stated before getting on a bus she would pull my hair outI looked at her again.“I ignored her then we got off at the same stop as each other where she began to scream in my face. “I told her to get away from me which resulted in her spitting on me. “Then when she was walking away she was screaming ‘go back to your own country’. “I was shocked and disgusted. “I felt very uneasy as this lady stood and screamed in my face and felt absolutely disgusted once she spat on me.” Yanice said she reported the incident to Police Scotland. A Police Scotland spokesperson said: Officers were called around .pm on Monday  November, to a report of racial abuse in Muirhouse Gardens, Edinburgh. Enquiries into the incident are ongoing.

The victim suffered a blade wound to her cheek in the terrying ordeal, during which the men grabbed cash and jewellery. CCTV captured the moment the gang - one of which she believes was wielding a gun - burst into her home after throwing a brick through the back door.The mum-of-two said she was in the bathroom when she heard a loud noise at around .pm on Saturday, Liverpool Echo reports.She said: I heard a bang while I was in the shower. Iaposve got two dogs and they were barking but with the wind I thought something had fallen in the garden.  I heard another bang and with that I jumped out of the shower and saw three masked men with knives and a gun demanding cash and jewellery. The -year-old said she told them she did not have anything of value, but added: One of the lads pinned me down on the bed. He put the kne against my face. They cut my face. I said there was money in the drawer - there was only a small amount. I gave them my watches and jewellery and they were screaming aposis that all you have got, is that all apos  The student paramedic, who did not want to be to be named for fear of reprisals, said she had called the police during the incident and the men left her Bebington home after becoming spooked. Unsure why she was targeted, she said she wondered whether the men had seen her expensive dogs and mistakenly believed she bred them. She was home alone at the time and was grateful her children were not with her, she continued: They put a brick through my back kitchen door - itaposs full glass. My little girl could have been at home, eating her dinner at the table. Iaposm just grateful the children were not here.

The pair thought the deep-sea monster was a turtle or even an old rucksack, before dad-of-one Paul flipped it over, cutting his hands on hundreds of razor-sharp teeth. The couple spotted the adapted dorsal fin which emits a luminescent light to catch other fish.  Paul, , and Katrina, , left the beast, which was dead, to be reclaimed by the tide and continued their weekend break with Paul’s son Lucas Ashurst, , in Salcombe. The family, from Doncaster, Yorkshire, said they felt lucky to have seen the amazing creature. Katrina said: It was the most amazing experience.  “I just kept watching it, wondering what it was. “We didn’t realise it was upside down, then we flipped it and saw all these teeth and the dangly thing like a fishing rod. “It was so big - easily twice the size of a football. “A woman told us what kind of fish it was, and then I saw one had washed up in Calornia, and it’s the exact same fish.”  Electrical-engineer Paul said: “The teeth were like razor blades, I hardly touched it and I got these deep cuts all over my hands. “I kept washing them in the sea but they wouldn’t stop bleeding. “Not many people can say they’ve been bitten by one of those: I feel very privileged.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Staycation\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

All travellers will be required to take a Covid- pre-departure test, amid warnings that the time between infection and infectiousness could be shorter with the new strain.It comes as Professor Tim Spector, from the Covid Zoe app, said that in around  daysapos time the UK could have more cases of Omicron than some countries it had put on the travel red list.The professor of genetic epidemiology at Kingaposs College London told BBC Breakfast: The official estimates are about -odd Omicron cases, and because the current testing is missing a lot of those, itaposs probably at least , to , I would guess at the moment.And we are expecting this to be doubling about every two days at the moment, soyou do your maths - say assumed itaposs , at the moment, and you think itaposs going to be doubling every two days, you can see that those numbers are going to be prettycertainly in about  days time. By that time, weaposll probably have more cases than they will in some of those African countries.  So I think these travel restrictions do perhaps have their place initially, when cases are really low here and really high in the other country, but when we reach that equilibrium, thereaposs very little point in having them in my opinion. He said that data from the Zoe symptom study app suggests that about half of all cases at the moment of Delta are being missed because they are not presenting with classic Covid symptoms of fever, new and persistent cough and a loss or change of smell or taste. Omicron is probably more, much more similar to the mild iants weaposre seeing in people who have been vaccinated with Delta than anything , he said. And so it is going to be producing cold-like symptoms that people wonapost recognise as Covidthey just believe the official Government advice.Health Secretary Sajid Javid cautioned the iant was spreading within communities, rather than just being linked to international travel. And the decision on pre-departure tests followed calls from Labour to implement the process. It will mean anyone travelling to the UK from countries not on the red list will be required to take a pre-departure test a maximum of  hours before leaving, regardless of their vaccination status. Andthey test positive, they will not be allowed to travel. Scotland and Wales have said they will implement similar measures. However, the requirement was greeted with anger and dismay across the travel sector. On Monday, Mr Javid said: “The Omicron iant is continuing to spread here and around the world. “According to the latest data there are now  confirmed cases in England,  in Scotland and four in Wales, bringing the total number of confirmed cases across the UK to .  “This includes cases with no links to international travel. So, we can conclude that there is now community transmission across multiple regions of England.” He said the Government cannot “say for certain” whether Omicron will escape Covid vaccines, or how severe a disease it will cause. He told MPs: “We are learning more about this new iant all the time. “Recent analysis from the UK Health Security Agency suggests that the window between infection and infectiousness may be shorter for the Omicron iant than for the Delta iant, but we don’t yet have a complete picture of whether Omicron causes more severe disease or indeed how it interacts with the vaccines. “We can’t say for certain at this point whether Omicron has the potential to knock us off our road to recovery.” He added: “We are leaving nothing to chance. Our strategy is to buy ourselves times and to strengthen our defences while our world-leading scientists assess this new iant and what it means for our fight against Covid-.”  But he said of the cases identied so far, none had resulted in hospital admission. Mr Javid said the measures were temporary, and acknowledged they would cause disruption. He said: “We’re taking this early action now so we don’t have to take tougher action later on, and so that we can take every opportunity to prevent more cases from arriving in our country.”Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the Government must now do “whatever it can” to lower the price of Covid- pre-departure tests. ,],totalVotes:,votesToShow:,mentometerId:,publicationId:,callbackUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  status,voteActionUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  vote,closed:,closedMessage:This poll has been closed!,hideResults:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,blackFridayWidget.linkUrl:https:www.mirror all-about black-friday,blackFridayWidget:,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,blackFridayWidget.Link:https:get-latest.dev.convrse.media black-fridayblack-friday-widget-v.,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,openxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,nobidDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,publicationName:Mirror,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youaposve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Just over a year later, her son Arthur was also killed and last week his father Thomas Hughes and his step mother Emma Tustin were jailed for their part in his tragic death. During a court hearing at the coupleaposs trial, a statement written from prison was read out in court by Oliviaaposs mum and Arthuraposs maternal grandmother, Madeleine Halcrow.  In it Arthuraposs mum said: Never did I imagine he would be taken from this world so early in his le. The details of Arthuraposs case are harrowing and incomparable - but I want people to know who Arthur was. From his huge smile and his personality to his gentle caring nature. All mothers are biased and believe their children are the best and Iaposm no dferent. Talking about Arthuraposs loves would not be complete without mentioning superheroes, Marvel or DC. Arthur loved them all, from Batman to Black Panther, Aqua Man to the Flash. He had every costume and action figure and would spend hours dressing up and pretending he had all of their superpowers.  Why was Arthur not with his mum  For most of his le Arthur had lived with his mum Olivia, though she and Arthuraposs dad Thomas Hughes shared custody after they split up before their sonaposs second birthday. However, in February , Labinjo-Halcrow was arrested on suspicion of murdering her new partner, Gary Cunningham. When that happened, Hughes, , assumed full custody of Arthur. She was later convicted of manslaughter in court.In March  — just as UK went into lockdown - Hughes moved in with his new girlfriend Emma Tustin,  where reports found that Arthur was regularly beaten, starved, deprived of water and poisoned with salt.  Why is Arthuraposs mum in prison  Labinjo-Halcrow was originally sentenced to  years in jail for killing Mr Cunningham. This conviction was quashed but she was convicted of manslaughter again during retrial earlier this year and sentenced to  years in prison in July. Arthur’s death took place on June  last year when Labinjo-Halcrow was in jail and this was taken into consideration when she was sentenced.  What happened to Arthur Labinjo-Hughes  Arthur suffered an unsurvivable brain injury which experts have said was having been shaken and his head being slammed either into the wall or the floor. The eight-week trial at Coventry Crown Court into Arthuraposs death found that he was alone at home with Tustin on June   when she assaulted him.On Friday, December , a jury unanimously convicted Tustin of murder and Hughes for manslaughter.Although Tustin was initially sentenced to  years and Hughes to  years in prison, the the Attorney Generalaposs Officeconfirmed on Saturday that the sentences are to be reviewed. Recalling the last time she spoke with her son, Olivia Labinjo-Halcrow said: ‘It was the most excited I had ever heard him. He knew he was going to see me soon. “A child, my child, my little love defenceless, trusting and nothing but loving was killed. His short le was stolen - he will never see another Christmas, another birthday.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Arthur Labinjo-HughesDonald NeilsonGary CunninghamThomas HughesBlack PantherLovePrisonsCourt caseCrown courtMurder trialCrime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Mandy Seager, from Blackley, Manchester, said she has had “constant problems” with her boiler for more than a month and was left without any central heating at all, for more than a week. The -year-old said her flat became like an “iceberg” when a cold snap hit the UK at the end of November. She said she had no option but to cocoon herself in blankets, but was still “absolutely freezing as the coldest night of the year gripped the UK on November . Mandy rents her council home from Northwards Housing, who manage properties on behalf of Manchester City Council. She told theManchester Evening Newsshe had experienced problems with her heating since the beginning of November.This was the longest time it has ever not been working for and it was unbearable,” she said. I had to just sit in my lounge wrapped up in blankets or just stay in bed under the covers. It was actually warmer in the corridor outside my flat. It was like an iceberg. Nobody should have to be that cold in their own home.” After a journalist contacted Manchester City Council, who manages Northwards Housing, Mandyaposs central heating was fixed for the third time on December . The council had also been called out on November  and November , but Mandy claimed she had tried to make contact with the housing provider for a week before. Although the heating has now been repaired, Northwards Housing acknowledged there is a recurring issue with the heating system in the apartment. Mandy claims she was previously told the system needed flushing before it then broke again and left her in the freezing cold for “almost two weeks”. She says she was given a small fan heater in the meantime, which she says was eating up her electric bill. She wrapped herself in bed sheets and throws on the coldest night of the year, where temperatures in Manchester plummeted as low as C. Storm Arwen battered most of the country, bringing freezing temperatures and strong winds. Mandy added: I had to sit in front of the fan heater and then run straight to bed and get under the duvet to keep warm. It had been eating away at my electric bill. It costs a fortune. It was absolutely horrendous. It has just been so cold, it is just like sitting outside.It is the worst thing to be sat in the cold, especially with how bad the weather has been recently.It is fixed again now but I will have problems with it again soon and I will be left in the same situation. She added that she became desperate to get out the house when she rises for work at  am. Manchester City Council has since responded to Mandyaposs claims, saying that on both occasions she complained, engineers attended the property to repair the heating. A spokesperson said: Northwards Housing received a repair request from Mandy on  November and  November. Both requests were regarding the heating system and contractor Equans attended the property on the same day on both occasions. Their heating was reported as working following each visit. Equans have now attended the property againand the system has been left fully operational. Unfortunately, the issue with the heating system seems to be recurring and requires air to be vented periodically. We understand that this is really frustrating - especially at this time of year - and investigations will continue until the cause of the problem is identied and resolved.

The revelation comes after weekend reports that investigators found evidence of Class A drug abuse in the corridors of power. The Prime Minister joined a drugs raid on Merseyside today, to highlight the Government’s week-long drive on crime. The Tory leader, who signalled middle-class drug users could be stripped of their passports, has previously bragged about snorting cocaine at university. He told GQ magazine in : “I tried it at university and I remember it vividly, and it achieved no pharmacological, psychotropical or any other effect on me whatsoever.”  He had claimed he sneezed it out, but askedsome “did creep in to your big hooter”, he admitted: “It must have done, yes, but it didn’t do much for me, I can tell you.”Asked about weekend claims that newspaper investigators found evidence of cocaine use in Palace of Westminster toilets, a top Government minister today admitted he would be surprisedpeople were not taking narcotics in Parliament.Policing Minister Kit Malthouse told Sky News: “There are obviously several thousand people who work on the estate and I would be surprisedthere weren’t some lestyle users of drugs amongst them.” The Mirror spoke to Westminster insiders about drugs being taken on the parliamentary estate. One adviser said: “There’s a culture of work hard, play hard. “There’s also a culture of people who don’t really live by the rules that other people live by. “There’s lots of affairs, lots of MPs live a certain way during the week and a completely dferent way at the weekend - they live dferent lives.” The adviser recalled one booze-fuelled evening in Parliament’s Strangers’ Bar. She told how one Tory ed from the toilet where she had obviously been snorting cocaine. “She was clearly out of it, I looked at her face and I could see a globule of cocaine hanging out of her nostril,” said the insider. “I was like, ‘Is that what I think it is  Oh, yes it is’.” Another Westminster source told how they suspected some young researchers - many of them in their first paid job and straight out of university, where they may have been exposed to narcotics for the first time - often added something “harder” to their nights out. “You can see people getting p****d and that’s fair enough as we all work long hours,” said the source. “But sometimes people disappear to the loos for a while and they come back and you can tell from their eyes they’re off their face. “It’s either really brave or really stupid to do it in Parliament, given how many cops there are everywhere.” Another source told how they had on several occasions been to the lavatories and spotted white powder which they assumed to be cocaine. The Sunday Times reported this week that evidence of cocaine use was found in the toilets close to the Commons offices of PM Mr Johnson and Home Secretary Priti Patel. It was also discovered in the disabled lavatory on the Shadow Cabinet corridor. The PM’s spokesman said today: “Those reports are concerning and I know the Speaker has already talked about taking action on that.” He added: “We do know that drugs are prevalent in society and that’s why we are focused on tackling this issue.” Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has previously admitted Parliament has a “drug problem”. Speaking in autumn , when he was the senior deputy Speaker, he said: “It’s not just drink we’ve got to catch out, there is a drug problem.” Police snfer dogs could be deployed under plans for a crackdown. Tory MP Charles Walker, who chairs the Administration Committee and sits on the House of Commons Commission, said: “The House of Commons has a long history of using snfer dogs to detect explosives. “It may be that we now need to broaden the range of snfer dogs ... to include those which can detect drugs.” A Parliamentary spokeswoman said: “Parliament takes the issue of substance misuse very seriously, and should drug use be identied in Parliament, appropriate action would be taken. “Any allegation of criminal behaviour would be a matter for the politan Police. “It is important to stress that Parliament is a public place with facilities accessed by Members, staff, contractors, press, and members of the public.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Conservative Partypolitan PoliceHouse of CommonsPriti PatelKit MalthouseBoris JohnsonCharles WalkerLindsay HoyleDrugsPoliticsCocaine\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But one man on TikTok is being criticised for his “comedic” take on Christmas after he shared a video of the decorations outside his house.Rich Ferguson, @officialrichferguson, decided to play a prank on his neighbours with his display by only putting up half his lights – and then hanging a mannequin from his gutter with a ladder toppled over on the ground.The prank was supposed to make it look as though the ladder had fallen while Rich was putting up the lights, and he was now stuck dangling from the roof.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. In the clip, a kind stranger who was out walking their dog runs over to pick the ladder up to help the mannequin, before realising the scene isn’t real. Rich captioned the video: “It’s fun to watch cars stop and stare … But it’s pretty hilarious to watch a person walking their dog run to the rescue of this mannequin whose ladder fell over!” The man’s video went viral and has almost  million views – but his method has split opinion among commenters. Some found the video “hilarious”, with several comments praising Rich for his unique take on decorating for the festive season.  One person wrote: “This is a harmless joke, I think it’s hilarious.” While another said: “I watched this  times, it gets better every time! This is absolute gold!” But others thought the prank was in bad taste, as they criticised the man for making light of a situation that could result in serious injurysomeone were to actually fall from a roof. Someone said: “As a healthcare provider in a hospital, I’ve seen so many people with permanent paralysis from ladder falls. Let’s just … not do this.” And another agreed, posting: “At first glance it looks like an emergency, which is why you think it’s a funny prank. But lots of people are telling you that it’s tasteless and triggering for real trauma. “Just hear people out and open your mind when it’s brought to your attention. Would you consider taking it down ” As a third wrote: “I love jokes, but it’s kind of cruel to watch people be genuinely scared for them.”What do you think  Let us know in the comments below.Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON ViralChristmas lightsChristmasChristmas decorationsTikTok\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Join the Secret Elves for celebration inspiration - and brilliant gt ideas and reviewsSpread the cheer!Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Candice said: “In September  I had the fillers that were in my lips, cheeks and jawline all removed. “I realised that it wasn’t enhancing my beauty to continue to get this kind of work, it was making me look older having so much in my face. “A lot of young women get filler to look younger but we don’t realise when it’s gone too far. aposI spent years looking fake but now I want to be a natural beauty.  “Now that Iaposve got rid of it I feel so much better. “I had forgotten what my face looked like without filler!” Candiceaposs family and friends were used to her Barbie-like appearance but when she first started transforming into a doll, the modelaposs parents were a bit shocked. She said: “My mum is very happy I’m becoming more natural, she doesn’t like filler. “My dad is indferent, he is used to me being out there. “I think because it’s so dramatically dferent to my natural look they were quite surprised but they’re very supportive. “It’s my face and body.” In an emerging trend over the past few years, Candice has followed in the footsteps of other celebrities and influencers who are reversing their non-surgical beauty choices. One such person includes Love Islandaposs Molly-Mae Hague, , who recently dissolved her fillers.Thereaposs also Khloe Kardashian, who has had fillers multiple times in the past, having said that she looked crazy.Although she is easing back on the injectables, Candice still likes to put on a full face of makeup every day, which takes her roughly  minutes.

We’ve had the pandemic, the pingdemic and now - the partydemic. Yes, drape some tinsel, model a Christmas jumper and head out to your work’s Christmas bash. aposTis the season to be jolly, right  Wrong. The Omicron iant has meant numerous companies have canned their Christmas parties. Perhaps yours is one of them, and now youaposre stuck at home with a glassfor company.Don’t feel sad. I am here,not as aAngel, to argue…guess what  Nobody should mourn Christmas parties. If anything, despondency is pure Stockholm syndrome. Rather, apostis the season to be relieved at escaping utter chaos. Where to begin  Outfits are a good place to start. Unless you’re me. What I know about fashion fits on the back of a postage stamp. Dress codes are immensely ambiguous. Black tie  Christmas jumper  Or the worst code of all - smart casual. That I a recently wore double denim and b did not care only demonstrates the fashion nightmare any gathering brings.  That’s before the location. In the city is fine . Out in the countryside, disaster is guaranteed. Drivers getting lost, monumental pricing, traipsing to some country home: you are asking for trouble. Any gathering is all about the food. I want a three-course meal to die for, a sweet and savoury buffet with ine choice. In reality  Christmas bashes contain little more than last-minute supermarket nibbles. Worse still is bringing your own food to share - no thank you!  I’m a natural introvert, so any large-scale socialising is challenging. Despite my best efforts, endless procrastination means pre-planned conversation topics before said gathering never materialise, with discussion drying up quicker than the nearby seafood platter. I can only repeat my excitement at Christmas arriving so many times, with Christmas cracker conversation starters rarely saving me. There is music to deal with too at a Christmas bash. I love Christmas music at any time of year However, I’m hearing impaired so must shout as loud as possible, practically breaking Guinness World Records to be heard. Bellowing into someone’s ear is hardly an ideal situation, in or out of a pandemic.Do you love a Christmas bash or are you a party grinch  Have your say in the comments belowWhere music plays, a dance floor follows. Were I ever to appear on Strictly Come Dancing admit to rule breaking last Christmas , I would be booted off in the first week for crimes against art. At a Christmas party, it transpires dancing is mandatory. My moves, at best, are ‘drunk prancing’… and I’m teetotal.The morning after the night before is full of regrets. You may have made a tremendously inappropriate remark to your boss and lost any remaining dignity. Normally, you believe next year will be better. Though I love the naive optimism, be honest. It won’t. Sure, go for a Christmas meal, where the food is at least the focus. Butyou’re asked to dance, escape while you can.

To her disappointment, Elise was left unboxing several sets of stickers, a magnet, a wax stamp, a flipbook and many more unexpected trinkets, reports The Daily Star. However, there were some beauty items, including a lipstick, nail polish and mini perfume bottle.Chanel had described the pricey item on their website as a calendar unlike any other and a piece to treasure for years to come - statements many people may beg to dfer. Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here. Videos of the TikToker opening the calendar have gone viral on social media, being viewed over  million times in the last three days.In her first video - viewed . million times - Elise starts by addressing her fans very excitedly stating: Okay, am I crazy  Yes. But Iaposd never seen a Chanel advent calendar so letaposs seeitaposs worth the hype.She then opens up the humongous box which bears resemblance to Chanelaposs iconic Chanel No  perfume bottle, inside are  smaller boxes of all sizes.But as she randomly opens up one box, she is left bewildered as she uncovers just mere stickers in the box. Elise declares This has to be a joke before opening up another box filled with a tester body cream, enough to cream only her aposleft armapos. She continues to post more videos of her unboxing but is just left with more disappointment. But despite continuously being let down, Elsie kept her hopes up - but is once again let down when she uncovers an empty mini pouch with simple printing at the bottom. She jokingly says: Iaposm not sure how Iaposm supposed to live, laugh, love under this condition but we will prevail. Eliseaposs viewers shared their frustrations with her as they joked she was robbed by Chanel. One viewer asked: They straight up mixed samples with office supplies huh  While another stated: Girl Iaposm crying [because] the whole box is free samples and stickers. One other viewer demanded Elise claim a refund stating: That’s literally worth like  maybe. Since her videos, Elise has released other videos claiming her she may be the reason Chanel are aposcancelledapos entirely.

If he could travel at the speed of light, well, then his job would be a lot easier. But,we take a look at Einstein’s formula, EMC², this lets us know that anything with mass simply cannot travel faster than the speed of light. Of course, Santa has massand with the weight of all of those presents on top, well, it’s impossible. Once you add all of the nine reindeers, things start getting really heavy. Travelling faster than the speed of light is certainly out of reach now.  As pointed out by The Conversation, luckily there are still other options available to Santa that boost his chances at delivering all of the presents on time for the big day. They relate to what is known in maths as The Travelling Salesman Problem. As detailed by this problem, the example surrounds a salesman who needs to plan a route through dferent cities, having to commence and end his journey in the same city and visit every other city in between just once, all while minimising the distance that he travels. If we take this example and apply it to Santaaposs journey, this is just a festive iant of the Travelling Salesman Problem. The problem with this problem is that it is NP-Complete. Essentially, there is no known efficient algorithm that reliably s the optimal solution in reasonable time. So much so, that some mathematicians and computer scientists believe that no such algorithm exists . If someone proves that it does, or doesn’t exist, they stand a chance of winning  million for winning one of the famed Millennium Problemsthey discover that PNP or not.  With this unsolved problem not exactly helping Santa on his quest, it becomes clear that we don’t currently know of an algorithm that would provide Santa with the best route to take. In this absence, there are however algorithms that attempt to solve this issue in reasonable time. Route Santa from Edinburgh Napier University is one that is striving to solve this problem and crack the code. The interactive map is an example of the algorithm solving the problem. Users are encouraged to contribute to the map and the understanding of Santa’s route by simply adding their address to its list.The list in turn marks the home on the map and Route Santa updates to conceive the best route timing wise for Santa, updating the distance he needs to cover, as well as the speed he would need to be travelling in miles per hour. The more users that sign up, the more efficient Santa’s journey will work out to be and a better understanding weaposll have of the most efficient version of this journey.  That said, many maths whizzes have taken the basic numbers of houses Old St Nick visits, the land mass that needs to be covered, along with the  hour window he has to deliver them to get a rough idea. Science Focus came to the conclusion that Santa must need to travel at a speed of .million kilometres per hour to ensure every child woke up on Christmas morning with a present under the tree.While this is considerably slower than the speed of light it would still mean that he and all the presents would arrive a little worse for wear. Thankfully heaposs magical.So, while the speed at which Santa would have to travel is currently unknown, not to mentionit’d be physically possible, it poses a really important question because the Travelling Salesman Problem affects all of our daily lives. We’re talking about our access to food, everything that we buy and deliveries straight to our door. If the most efficient route for Santa can be solved, then we can apply this finding to ious other aspects of le, something which could revolutionise delivery services going forward.Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Father ChristmasMaths-Whizz\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Jessica Leidolph was left disfigured by the attack which almost cost the -year-old her le.She was mauled by the creature and after the animalaposs claw caught her carotid artery, it caused her to lose pints and pints of blood. She now has three metal plates on the right side of her face having attempted to bring out the product to raise funds to support unwanted animals. Now Jessica has decided to publish the calendar - despite the torment the shoot caused.  The page for August will always be etched in the modelaposs mind as within seconds of posing, the big cat called Troya pounced, biting her face and head. Jessica, who also worked as an animal rights activist and a physiotherapist, was critically injured after Troja attacked her out of nowhere during a photoshoot at a retirement home for show animals in the German city of Nebra. She underwent surgery after she was taken to the nearest hospital by helicopter on th August. But Jessica, who will reportedly have to carry the attack scars forever, begged the authorities not to put the big cat down, saying: I donapost want the animal to be killed, it just followed its instincts. It was unfortunate. I am glad there was no request to euthanise the animal. Jessica entered the leopardsapos enclosure at the aposSeniorenresidenz fur Showtiereapos - a retirement home for show animals - when the -year-old leopard suddenly attacked her.  Troja and another leopard living in the enclosure named Paris, , had once graced TV screens in an advert for multinational electronics giant Panasonic before they were moved to the retirement home in the German state of Saxony-Anhalt. She said: He attacked me, I couldnapost look that fast. I was sitting by the tree trunk and all of a sudden I was lying on the ground. He bit into my cheek, ear, head, and then again and again on my head. And then I screamed, put my hands in front of my face. At some point, he let go of me for a moment so that I could roll away and get out of the cage. A little while later, the ambulance and helicopter were there.  Jessica, who was brought to the hospital with severely bleeding wounds and was immediately operated on. She said she lost consciousness and the next thing she heard was the helicopter airlting her to hospital. However, instead of holding grudges, Jessica, who will reportedly have to carry the attack scars forever, has now shared images of the photoshoot as her new calendar is printed ahead of the new year. She said: I have been making yearly calendars with sexy photos of me and my proteges for many years. The sales will be used to maintain my private animal sanctuary.

Crews of the Western Military District’s bomber regiment have started to perform the first planned flights at the reconstructed Baltimore airfield in Voronezh,” said a military statement.“During the training flights, the bomber crews practiced takeoff and landing in ious weather conditions.”Russia said last week that the first  Su- fighter bombers had been deployed at the base - and now flights have started. New footage shows the Su-s in action from the revamped base with a two-and-a-half mile long runway giving it “the ability to accept aircraft of all classes and any size”.  In Chelyabinsk, the command staff of the aviation regiment of the Central Military Districtflew more than  sorties in Su-s and the Su-MR reconnaissance aircraft. In Dagestan, Black Beret marines of the Caspian Flotilla, supported by aircraft, foiled a mock enemy landing in separate drills. And Russian reservists were given firepower training during a three day camp, according to reports citing military sources. They were trained in firing small arms and using RPG- anti-tank grenade launchers at the Prudboy combined arms range in Volgograd region.  The drills came as Russia hit out at “emotional statements” in the West on Putin’s alleged invasion plans inn Ukraine. “These statements are so exalted, they lack a sensible approach,” said his spokesman Dmitry Peskov. Ahead of the video summit, he said: Such a number of  reports are published in the media.  “We see that tensions are increasing in rhetoric, but still we urge to keep coolheadedness. “Moreover, presidents never speak based on emotions, they always speak de facto based on their national interests, He stressed: Putin has repeatedly said that we are looking for a good, predictable relationship with the United States.  “Russia never intended to attack anyone, but we have our own concerns, we have our own red lines. “The president spoke about this clearly, to which Biden replied that he was not going to recognise any red lines.” The talks at pm Moscow time todayare “convenient” for Putin, he said. This was “in the middle” of the Putin workday.

which swung in either direction in horrendous conditions.The sides exchanged goals in the first half, with Stuart MacLean reacting quickest in the box after the Baljaffray keeper couldn’t hold a Fraser Talbot shot and the striker scored to net his eleventh goal in eight games.Baljaffray forced a succession of corners near the end of the half and were on level terms when Red Star were only able to partially clear a corner which fell to the away side’s full back and his shot via the aid of a deflection went past young Leon Murphy in the Star goal. -Into the second half and Star could have retaken the lead when Aaron Moore latched onto a drilled cross from strike partner Stuart MacLean, however, his effort was blocked by an excellent save from the Baljaffray number one.The visitors took the lead after  minutes when a cross caused confusion in the Star defence and the Baljaffray forward had the simple task of finishing into an empty net from close range.Star huffed and puffed for an equaliser, however, they were frustrated by excellent goalkeeping until the goal came in fortuitous circumstances after a long ball was nodded past his own keeper by the Baljaffray centre back meaning the sides were level with  minutes to go.Star took the lead with five minutes remaining when Aaron Moore was able to burst clear of the Baljaffray backline and finish well into the far corner to make it -.This should have been enough to see Star over the line but Baljaffray scrambled a late equaliser when Star again failed to clear a free kick and the ball was bundled over the line to see the match end -.Lochgilphead Red Star are on their travels on Saturday November  when they face their toughest test of the season so far as they take on league leaders and title favourites

Early religious writings tell the story that Thenew was a victim of her fatherrsquos cruel vengeance for what he believed to be her disobedience and wrongful behaviour.One early medieval account by Jocelinus, a monk from Furness, tells us: ldquoBy the kingrsquos command, she was led to the top of a very high hill called Dunpelder, that, cast down from thence, she might be broken limb by limb, or dashed to pieces.But that didnrsquot work, so she was instead taken to the shore of Aberlady and put into the small hide vessel, pulled from the shore and set adrt.Magsrsquo art captures the terror and desperation of Thenewrsquos situation, as her tiny boat is taken by the tide out to the open sea. It is rocked by waves and she clings on for le, the freezing water lapping over her.But thankfully, there is a happy ending to this story. Her small boat begins to drt inland, across the Firth of Forth, away from the kingdom of her abuser and towards the opposite shore, where she lands just in time. There, on the beach by Culross in Fe, she finds a fire with embers still giving warmth.Jocelinus tells us: ldquoThere were, in the neighbourhood, shepherds keeping watch over the flocks. And they beheld a fire lighted close at hand, and coming with haste found the young woman with her childbirth completed, and the child wrapped in rags, lying in the open air. They, moved by pity, took care of them by increasing the fire and supplying food, and procuring other necessarieshellipSt Serf took them in and cared for them, and Thenewrsquos child would become Saint Kentigern.This story is not provable history, of course, more likely itrsquos mostly legend making. Yet unknown truths often lie under the surface of legends and I for one have always seen the universal truths in this story.When I look into the faces of my children, I hope and pray they will never feel the fear and desperation that is on the face of Thenew of being cast at sea with the desperate hope of finding a safe place.And , God forbid, they ever do, I hope they will be met by people like those shepherds.Andever they, or I, were to meet someone in such a desperate situation, then I hope we would be like those shepherds and respond with kindness, understanding and compassion.That, for

railway line, in Dunbar in recent years.However, pedestrian links between the new homes and the older section of Dunbar are limited.East Lothian Council is keen to see a new pedestrian underpass to improve connections, which could be financed in part through another housing development in the area.It is expected that the cost of the underpass would be more than pound million, with part of the cost being covered by the Hallhill North development, which would consist of  houses and  flats.A decision is set to be made on the plans, which come from Taylor Wimpey East Scotland and Hallhill Developments Limited, at a meeting of East Lothian Councilrsquos planning committee on Tuesday.Councillor Norman Hampshire, who chairs the local authorityrsquos planning committee and represents Dunbar on East Lothian Council, noted that currently the only pedestrian access in the area was under the railway line beside Hallhill Sports Centre.He said: ldquoAs part of the application, the developer will be making a contribution to a new underpass at the railway.ldquoThere will not be enough funding coming from the developer to completely do this underpass.ldquoThat has to be done through grant funding from other agencies and the council themselves.ldquoAt the moment, all the houses from the Hallhill area to get to both the lower primary school and secondary school have to come underneath the tunnel, and children going to the Lochend Campus have to come back through that one.ldquoIt is really congested and we definitely need another way through there.An underpass was previously in place under the railway line but it was blocked up a number of years ago.Network Rail was approached about seeing it reopened but was not keen on the idea and East Lothian Council would have been liable for the structure.Mr Hampshire said: ldquoWe have to go with a completely new cut-through for pedestrians and cyclists, which will come through into Ash Grove swing park area but will be a safe route to get to the secondary school.Drawings and documents for the planning application were first submitted to East Lothian Councilrsquos planning department at the beginning of February last year.The scheme, to the west of the primary schoolrsquos Lochend Campus, originally featured  houses and  apartments."},{"url":null,"title":"musselburgh-grammar-school-host-first-outdoor-christmas-market","story":"The event, from am to pm, has been organised by S pupils studying National  retailing.The

If it works, it will be a game-changer.The firm has applied for planning permission to place a miniature version of the new windsurf turbine on the power station site for  months to monitor its effectiveness.Mr Dickinson said that theof time would give the company a full yearrsquos access to trialling the turbine in all seasons on the exposed coastal site.The turbine itself, which he describes as looking like an upside-down egg whisk, features five blades which are electronically operated and computer controlled.The smart technology allows the computer to move the blades with the wind to gain maximum energy from it, as well as monitoring for any kind of impact.Mr Dickinson compared it to having Olympic sailor Ben Ainslie at the helm of five sails, controlling them in the wind during a race to get the best performance.And he said: ldquoThe technology involved means thatthere was an impact from a bird, it would instantly shut down and we would know it had happened. The sameit was struck by a JCB.ldquoThis dfers from the rotaryturbines, which continue to rotate.It is understood that the company has agreed with East Lothian Council ahead of any planning consent that, should an incident occur onsite involving the death of a bird or breach of noise levels, the trial will shut down.The company has worked with RSPB experts in designing the turbine, which Mr Dickinson said had been years in the making.He said: ldquoThis is the first time we are putting our heads over the parapet, as such, with this prototype and publicly revealing our work.The application is for the siting of the lsquonovelrsquo wind turbine on the site for  months only to trial it. A mobile office and chemical toilet would also be onsite for that duration.It would require a -square-metre area in the north of the former power station site to be fenced off for the duration.Plans

around  times higher than those seen in people recovered from Covid - and the Phase Three stage also showed protection of around % against infections caused by the Gamma iant common in Brazil.No serious adverse events were reported and mild side effects were also rare, with fewer than % of participants experiencing fever after the second dose.Medicago, which previously developed a plant-based swine flu vaccine, is now seeking immediate approval from Canadian regulators and is also filing applications for use with UK and US regulators and the World Health Organisation.The vaccine does not have to be frozen and can be kept refrigerated at -degC, making a potential candidate for use in the developing world.Takashi Nagao, CEO and President of Medicago, said: ldquoThis is an incredible moment for Medicago and for novel vaccine s.

The Scottish Government via Transport Scotland have funded around half the £. million costs.The council’s head of marine services, transportation and harbour master, Jim Buck, is confident that the new m modern fibre glass vessel will have been worth the wait.“We are delighted to be able to announce the start date for the Nordic Sea. The Golden Mariana has served the communities well, but it’s time now for a younger, more comfortable vessel to take over. At m, with a m beam, the Nordic Sea will be able to carry  passengers and is capable of running at between - knots, which is a little faster than the Golden Mariana. She has stabilisers installed to help with the motion and is a much more luxurious vessel for passengers and, very importantly, is fully accessible for those who require this.”The ship has attracted plenty of speculation, after long periods of being tied up since being purchased in April . COVID delayed a £, refit programme, and further complicating matters has been the retirement of the previous skipper of the Golden Mariana and the longer-than-anticipated recruitment process for crew to serve on the Nordic Sea.Mr Buck went on to explain why the process has taken longer than some had expected.“It would appear to have taken a long time but actually in respect of the certication process when taking a vessel from one country to another it has actually been remarkably quick. She is the first vessel of her type to go through that process and with that comes inevitable hurdles that need to be overcome. The Nordic Sea had a series of modications made to bring her up to the full UK Classication and Certication standard.“She was built to a dferent specication so had to go through the required checks and balances to ensure we met the current specications for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency’s current passenger vessel system.”He is confident that she will be a favourable addition to the fleet.“She is a really good sea keeping vessel with good properties designed with the right centre of height for that comfortable ride.”Councillor David Dawson, chair of the board of Orkney Ferries, said: “I would like to recognise the efforts of the team here in Orkney for getting us to this stage, particularly given the challenges added in by the pandemic, but also for the patience of the people of Papay. We must not forget the faithful service of the Golden Mariana and crew who have served the communities well.“From the information I have received from seagoing staff who have taken the Nordic Sea out in what could be described as ‘challenging conditions’, I have every confidence that the Papay community will not be disappointed in what is a first-class vessel.“We are grateful for the support we’ve received from the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland to enable the purchase of the vessel and are looking forward to the inaugural journey.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The works are not entirely complete as the curved glass has been delayed by the supplier in Europe due to COVID, Brexit and other supply issues, but we are expecting it early . So for now the area will remain roped off from the public, but it is a delight to see the new vestibule settling in and the excited response by those who know the building so well.”Councillor Gwenda Shearer, chairwoman of OIC#s education, leisure and housing committee, said: “The cathedral really is the gt that keeps on giving to the people of Orkney and further afield.#What a beautul addition to what is a very special building. I look forward to seeing the complete, finished product which is sure to be absolutely stunning.”Elaine Grieve from the Society of the Friends of St Magnus Cathedral, who are making a substantial contribution to the costs of the work, said: “The Cathedral is so precious that it is hard to contemplate making any changes for fear they won’t do the building justice.#However, in this case, what an absolutely wonderful transformation the vestibule has made to the entrance of the building. The craftmanship is outstanding and we now have an addition which befits this treasured building loved by so many near and far.”The cathedral#s stonework also enjoyed a facelt recently.Conservation works included repointing stonework with lime mortar on the interior and exterior of the west door. Samples of original lime mortars were found deep in the constructions joints of the building and were analysed by the Scottish Lime Centre in Fe.

I will ask anyone visiting my home over Christmas to do likewise.Ms Sturgeon also urged MSPs to ldquolead by example on testing and she urged the public to stick with restrictions.ldquoBy doing that, we do give ourselves the best possible chance of enjoying a Christmas that is more normal, but also safe ndash and of avoiding a new year hangover of spiralling cases, she said.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

There were no help groups, no mental health care, back then.“We went to my grannys to live for a while and then we came back to the house, the three of us, and that was it. It was a case of paddle your own canoe, really.“My dads going out to work every day as a painter and decorator and we were two young boys going out to school.“Its really just about capturing that time and the values he taught us as kids without ever really knowing he was doing it - or us realising what he was doing. The behaviours, we just kinda copied him.“Thats what I realised as I started to right this thing, that this is what it was...”Ironically, it was his grand daughters prompting that convinced him to put pen to paper in the first place.“About a year ago, my eldest grand daughter said to me - grandad, remember all the old stories you used to tell us when we were kids, about our grandad, racing the pigeons. She told me one of them, almost word for word. I thought, I really must capture those for posterity, for the family. RETIREMENT “Obviously, when retirement and lockdown came into play I had a lot more time on my hands so I sat down at the laptop to fiddle about and to write these wee stories.“As I started, this thing just took on a le of its own and became something completely dferent which was kind of a surprise to me, but a very pleasant surprise, as I really enjoyed writing it.”And I really enjoyed reading it, this simple tale of a hard-working father and his two sons making their way in the world.But the real stars of the book are the pigeons to whom Frankie cleverly lends human traits, such as the ability to talk - characters like Proud Boy, Warhorse and Bootsy.And, of course, Princess Sofia, who we come to learn resembles Frankie’s own mother.The trials and tribulations of the loft in attempting to win the biggest prizes in the sport resemble the struggles faced by Frankie’s family in an era when times were tough.But this isn’t a depressing tale rather, it is an uplting story of how families and, by extension, close-knit communities bandied together to overcome adversity. With a healthy dose of pigeon racing nostalgia thrown in for good measure.“Whilst some of the pigeon names and details have been changed the book is based on true le events,” continues Frankie.“It was never my intention to get the book published, I only started writing it as something to give the grandkids. “I really dont care about the business side of things – its just nice that people can read about my father.“I suppose people are quite surprised about the book but there’s more interest there than anything which is great.“Depending on the feedback who knows, there might even be a second one.”‘The Penzance Smash,’ published by Austin McAuley is out now."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4289803.jpg--.jpg?1638799790000\n","title":"ballymena boy s artwork brings christmas card cheer","story":"THE festive artwork of  year old Adrian McVey from Castle Tower School in Ballymena has been chosen as Radius Housing’s  Christmas Card.

The low share of services in trade flows from Ireland to Northern Ireland is in contrast with the high overall services content of Ireland’s exports to other markets, ESRI report stated. Ireland is one of the main markets for services trade from Northern Ireland.   The reports, published on Tuesday, assess cross-border trade in services and “enhancing the attractiveness of the island of Ireland” to high-value foreign direct investment . The first of the set of economic reports examines the extent of cross-border trade in services on the island of Ireland and the characteristics of the firms participating in this trade. The main services traded include transportation and storage, business services and computer consultancy. Sales to Ireland account for % of services outflows from Northern Ireland and for % of services inflows to Northern Ireland, the report states. For trade from Ireland, Northern Ireland accounts for slightly less than % of total services exports from Ireland. This reflects the relatively small size of the Northern Ireland economy and the highly export-orientated and FDI-dominated structure of Ireland’s services sector. In terms of the balance of trade, the report found that more services are exported from Northern Ireland to Ireland relative to those from Ireland to Northern Ireland. Examining the characteristics of services firms active in cross-border trade, the report finds that exporting firms in services are systemically larger and more productive than non-exporters. The author of the report, professor Martina Lawless, said: “The patterns identied in this report suggest that there is considerable scope for expansion of cross-border trade in services. “The monitoring of the effectiveness of trade support policies would be greatly improved by expanding and coordinating the information collected on cross-border services flows.” This second research report provides novel evidence on factors and policies underlying the attractiveness of Ireland and Northern Ireland to FDI in high-value knowledge-intensive sectors.      This research also explores opportunities for policy coordination and cooperation on the island of Ireland that could enhance the attractiveness of both jurisdictions to high-value FDI. The research finds that FDI in high-value sectors in Ireland and Northern Ireland accounts for substantial shares of all new greenfield FDI projects. At over %, these shares are higher than the corresponding averages for Great Britain and the EU countries. Speaking ahead of the launch of the reports, Tanaiste Leo Varadkar, said: “We commissioned this research to provide a high-quality evidence base for looking, in real terms, at how we could do more, and do better together, across both parts of this island. “How we could align better, levelling up and taking the best of both jurisdictions. “The research shows that there is much more scope to ‘think all-island’ when it comes to the services economy and attracting foreign direct investment, accruing economic and societal benefits both North and South.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the opening of Lynchrsquos new Greysteel Eurospar were Alastair Conner,Joanne Kerlin, owner Conor Lynch, Stephanie McElwee, Virginia Moore and Paul Deans, from Henderson Group.

Butwe were all truly honest, isn’t it the side dishes we’re actually looking forward to most  googletag.cmd.push Pigs in blankets, bread sauce, cranberry sauce, roasted parsnips, stuffing… these tasty jewels beside the golden bird are arguably the best bit. We asked some celeb chefs and food writers to share their favourite festive sides, with tips for how to cook them too… . Ruby Tandoh adores a Yorkshire pudding       “My favourite side dish has to be the Yorkshire pudding,” says Tandoh, author of new cookbook, Cook As You Are. “Whether or not it’s strictly canon depends on who you’re speaking to, but I can’t imagine a better vessel for mopping up gravy. It’s the perfect counterpoint to the meaty savouriness of the Christmas dinner plate.” . Gordon Ramsay has very specic thoughts on stuffing      “Stuffing’s something that people think needs to be stuffed in the cavity of the turkey – that’s the worst place to cook a stuffing. It’s not good in there. There’s a reason why you don’t put much in that cavity,” says Ramsay, whose new recipe collection, Ramsay In , is out now.“To make a really good stuffing is something I do separately. And so, I get the ground sausage, the pork, the beef. And then from there we’ll put in some smoked pancetta, some beautully roasted pistachios, some chopped up apricot and bake it in the tray prior. And then as it comes out, we’ll add some resting juices from the turkey and let it sit and absorb.” . Donal Skehan appreciates the humble Brussels sprout…     “Brussels sprouts are my favourite. I love them every way,” say Irish chef Skehan, author of Everyday Cook. “I love them as a salad as well. Very much a winter salad – in a food processor, bag of sprouts, straight down the chute into the chopper, mix it together with some really good chunks of Pecorino cheese, and some dried cranberries or even pomegranate, would be lovely. And then just a light dressing and some nuts maybe as well, something to crunch, toasted walnuts would be nice. Youmix that together and it’s like a Brussel’s sprout slaw, but it is stunning.” . Same goes for River Cottage’s Lucy Brazier       “Sprouts with chestnuts, because I think that tastes like Christmas,” says food writer Lucy Brazier, whose new cookbook, Christmas at River Cottage, is all about the festive food season. “I could eat a bowl of that without anything .” . Gino D’Acampo gets excited about the roasted veg       “I’m a huge roasted vegetable fan at Christmas,” says the chef, celebrating his new series and cookbook, Gino’s Italian Family Adventure. “We do them with balsamic vinegar, extra virgin olive oil, parsley, a few capers, all these – amazing. Funnily enough I do like stuffing, because what is stuffing, sausage with herbs and a bit of bread  Very tasty, I like that. I hate Turkey. I don’t like turkey.” . James Martin has a buttery way with carrots       Chef James Martin loves carrots cooked in butter – Butter being the title of his new cookbook. He does them “in a style of Vichy – Vichy is a town in the south of France. They cook everything in mineral water, sugar, butter and salt to produce this amazing taste, butyou use the addition of star anise it makes carrots taste amazing.” . Mary Berry champions the good old celeriac       “I love celeriac,” says Mary Berry . “I just cook it until it’s soft. It’s knobbly. If you grow it, it doesn’t come to fruition until November. You can buy it earlier. And I cook it until it’s tender then add full-fat cregraveme fresh to it and puree it. It is delicious. It reheats well.” She also makes chestnut stuffing. “I do them the day before and I do it in small shapes and fry them, then all I’ve got to do is reheat them.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the opening of Lynchrsquos new Greysteel Eurospar were Alastair Conner,Joanne Kerlin, owner Conor Lynch, Stephanie McElwee, Virginia Moore and Paul Deans, from Henderson Group.

And they’re not alone – the research found a thirdof grandparents buy unsuitable gts for grandchildren at Christmas, closely followed by aunties , distant relativesand friends .  By asking yourself a few simple questions you can nail the art of gt-giving to both children and adults, promises Kim Brookes, who ran an online gt-registry for more than  years.   Have kids so that instead of real gts you can give friends and family novelty photo items with pictures of your children they saw on social media  months ago. — Some Boys MotherDecember ,    “Now’s the time to show your family just how much you love them by way of the perfect gt,” she says. “This is an opportunity not to be squandered, but one that causes a lot of stress at this time of year, as we really want to get it right.” Brookes, who now runs the natural scent jewellery brand, Perfino, suggests people choosing gts ask themselves these questions… . Do they really need it   Think about the person you’re buying for. You want to give them something that’s meaningful, not just for Christmas. Something that won’t be part of the re-gting cycle any time soon. So, it needs to be something they really want, rather than a short-term fad. “Subscriptions are a good option for this,” says Brookes. “Perhaps a comic or magazine – a gt that reminds them of you every month.” . Just because you love it, does that mean they will  Remember who you’re buying for and always keep their tastes and preferences at the forefront of your mind. “They may not want the chemistry set when their favourite subject is art, or the history book when they love nothing better than a murder mystery,” stresses Brookes.  . Have you really put proper thought into it  Don’t rush to buy something just because it’s there, without giving any thought to the person you’re buying for, says Brookes. “This is the worst offence,” she insists, “as it shows little consideration. Try to find some time to think long and hard about the child or person you’re buying for, and you’ll know what’ll make them happy, evenit’s not to your taste. Thankfully we’re all dferent.” . Have you gone too big    Brookes points out that while a gt recipient might love a trip to an adventure park for Christmas, and be a bit put out with a stick of deodorant, you’ll have a sense of what’s right. “And be very careful not to escalate,” she warns, “as you’ll be digging a hole for yourself on future gting occasions.” . Is it really eco-friendly  This question now has to be at the front of everyone’s minds, for your own satisfaction as well as the good of the planet, says Brookes. “I find the easiest way to do this is to trust who you’re buying from,” she says. “Most businesses will now put their eco credentials front and centre and,they don’t, look for one that does. Once you trust them, you can buy with an easy conscience.” . Have they already got it  If a potential gt is new and super-popular, it’s possible your gt recipient may already have it. If the gt’s for your own child, there’s a chance someone  may have bought it for them. “The best way forward could be to make some subtle enquiries,” advises Brookes, “andyou take the leap and buy, at least keep the receipt and be upfront about how happy you’d be to facilitate an exchange.”  . Are consumables a good choice   “We have so much at this time of year, so I’d avoid more chocolate, more sweets, more of anything unless it’s an extra-special treat – something they wouldn’t normally have, but which you know they’d enjoy,” suggests Brookes. . Are smellies always a winner  Smelly oils, creams etc may work for older children, teenagers and adults – but onlyyou know they like that sort of thing, warns Brookes, who says that, again, such items need to be really special to be a good gt. “Bath oil is my favourite thing,” she says, “but obviously it’s not for someone who only takes showers.” . Is it really appropriate  Consider whether something is age-appropriate for children and, of course, avoid anything made from plastic, stresses Brookes. .

Specsavers is encouraging avid readers to have regular eye tests so they can continue to indulge their hobby. Presbyopia is the gradual loss of our eyes’ ability to focus close up as the lens becomes less flexible. A natural part of ageing, it usually becomes noticeable around the age of . The condition is common and typically isn’t a cause for concern. But some struggle to adapt, and find they need to hold their book at arm’sto read the page or direct a light on it to see the words more clearly. For most people, the answer is a simple eye test which will identythey need reading glasses, multi-focal glasses or contact lenses to make words clearer – and le easier. Maeve Walsh, director at Specsavers Crescent Link in the Waterside and Ferryquay Street in the city centre, says: “It can sometimes be dficult for people to assess themselves whether they have presbyopia, which is why we always encourage regular eye tests, usually every two years. “As we age, it’s completely natural for our eyesight to worsen and it shouldn’t be something we worry about, providing our eyes are in good health. “My advice to those with presbyopia would be to carry your specs with you at all times and get into the habit of having them close by. This will help with activities like reading, and will also ensure you’re not straining your eyes, which can sometimes cause other problems.” To find out more about presbyopia, or to book an eye test visit:https:www.specsavers eye-health presbyopiaandwww.specsavers stores derryorwww.specsavers stores crescentlink Top five signs you have Presbyopia .

Reporter: Staff Reporter Dec   addthis, Lynch’s, the local family retailer which operates a number of Spar and Eurospar stores and supermarkets, have opened their third local supermarket bringing their total store number to eight across the North West and Mid Ulster. googletag.cmd.push Lynch’s Eurospar, Greysteel is the third outlet from the retailer to open under the popular Eurospar brand and has allowed management to more than double the number of jobs available, now employing  locally. Acquiring what was previously a Centra store on the site, company director Paul Lynch says the community needed a larger format supermarket brand that would not only bring a host of fresh and local produce and ranges, but would be convenient and complemented with services vital to the local area. Paul said: “We have invested around pound, to bring our supermarket experience to the Greysteel area and are so proud to open the doors. “We have more than doubled the size of the space which allows optimum navigation throughout the aisles, where shoppers will find an increased iety and range of fresh and local foods including our own meat offering and pre-packed ranges. “Importantly, we have continued the on-site partnership with Nicholl Fuels to offer locals a -hour fuel service with pre-pay pumps and we have  parking spaces to allow shoppers to conveniently load their cars safely.” The team has also retained important services including the Post Office, ATM, Lotto and PayPoint and added even more amenities and initiatives to bring value and choice to the area. The deli now serves an extended range of hot and cold food to go alongside Barista Bar coffee and Spar bakery, and shoppers can take advantage of the many deals available including the current  Deals of Christmas campaign which drops the price of big name items and festive essentials every week in the lead up to Christmas. Paul continued: “Eurospar also price matches over a thousand branded products to Tesco each week, so paired with our consistent schedule of value deals, we’re bringing a huge amount of savings for shoppers.” As is the Lynch and Eurospar ethos, the team in-store will implement outreach initiatives with the local community, sponsoring and supporting local clubs and organisations, while also fundraising for charity partner Cancer Fund for Children.

Reporter: Staff Reporter Dec   addthis, Lynch’s, the local family retailer which operates a number of Spar and Eurospar stores and supermarkets, have opened their third local supermarket bringing their total store number to eight across the North West and Mid Ulster. googletag.cmd.push Lynch’s Eurospar, Greysteel is the third outlet from the retailer to open under the popular Eurospar brand and has allowed management to more than double the number of jobs available, now employing  locally. Acquiring what was previously a Centra store on the site, company director Paul Lynch says the community needed a larger format supermarket brand that would not only bring a host of fresh and local produce and ranges, but would be convenient and complemented with services vital to the local area. Paul said: “We have invested around pound, to bring our supermarket experience to the Greysteel area and are so proud to open the doors. “We have more than doubled the size of the space which allows optimum navigation throughout the aisles, where shoppers will find an increased iety and range of fresh and local foods including our own meat offering and pre-packed ranges. “Importantly, we have continued the on-site partnership with Nicholl Fuels to offer locals a -hour fuel service with pre-pay pumps and we have  parking spaces to allow shoppers to conveniently load their cars safely.” The team has also retained important services including the Post Office, ATM, Lotto and PayPoint and added even more amenities and initiatives to bring value and choice to the area. The deli now serves an extended range of hot and cold food to go alongside Barista Bar coffee and Spar bakery, and shoppers can take advantage of the many deals available including the current  Deals of Christmas campaign which drops the price of big name items and festive essentials every week in the lead up to Christmas. Paul continued: “Eurospar also price matches over a thousand branded products to Tesco each week, so paired with our consistent schedule of value deals, we’re bringing a huge amount of savings for shoppers.” As is the Lynch and Eurospar ethos, the team in-store will implement outreach initiatives with the local community, sponsoring and supporting local clubs and organisations, while also fundraising for charity partner Cancer Fund for Children. Paddy Doody, sales and marketing director at Henderson Group, which owns the Eurospar brand in Northern Ireland added: “We now have  Eurospar supermarkets in Northern Ireland, each one bringing a wealth of convenience in a large format supermarket to their areas. “The Lynch’s are experienced independent retailers and know how to engage with their local communities, with an incredibly high bar set for customer service. “Its fantastic to see the Eurospar brand thriving under our independent retailers and we wish Lynch’s the best of luck with their new business.” The new supermarket in Greysteel joins Lynch’s portfolio of stores including Eurospars in the Skeoge area of Derry and Draperstown in Magherafelt, plus Spars in Dungiven, Claudy, Newbuildings and Trench Road in Co Derry, and Clonoe in Coalisland.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the opening of Lynchrsquos new Greysteel Eurospar were Alastair Conner,Joanne Kerlin, owner Conor Lynch, Stephanie McElwee, Virginia Moore and Paul Deans, from Henderson Group.

Owner of Ferry Clever, Christopher Ferry, said he believed it was more important than ever to shop local this Christmas. “Everything was in lockdown and a lot of small local businesses really got affected by that. I think this is probably the most important year ever regarding supporting local because a lot of businesses really struggled to get back on their feet after being closed for so long. “I think that people realise that, and they are really going all out this year to support local. A small business like myself doesn’t take it for granted, I really appreciate it and I would just really push to support local this year especially. Big operators like Amazon can be handy but your small spend makes a giant dference.” Ben Allen, owner of local record store ‘Abbazappa,’ spoke of the benefits of choosing to shop local. “I know my customers. I know them by name, they know me. The thing about a record shop is when a customer is with you evenit’s only for a few minutes, you’re that person’s best friend and you can talk about music, recommend things, and talk about all sorts. That doesn’t happen online. Online is completely soulless.  Ben Allen, proprietor of Abbazappa.  “The greatest thing on earth is being able to look through the products in the likes of a record shop or book shop physically. It’s a pleasure to do that. You can pick it up and seethe products okay before buying it. You can’t do that online, it’s a bit of a lucky dip.” Sinn Feacutein Foyle MLA, Paacutedraig Delargy, also urged the people of Derry to support local businesses this year. “On the back of the voucher scheme, we’re encouraging everybody to spend their pound in local businesses as it’s been such a tough couple of months for them. Anything that can be done to make sure these businesses get back on their feet, we need to do it and make sure we can support our local high street shops.” The new Ferry Clever store can be found at - Bishops Street, and Abbazappa Records can be found at the Yellow Yard on Palace Street.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the opening of Lynchrsquos new Greysteel Eurospar were Alastair Conner,Joanne Kerlin, owner Conor Lynch, Stephanie McElwee, Virginia Moore and Paul Deans, from Henderson Group.

Mr Durkan had long lobbied for the provision to be removed and worked alongside a number of charities to get Sinn Feacutein Communities Minister, Deirdre Hargey, to change the current provision. The Social SecurityBill was granted accelerated passage at its second stage in the Assembly on Tuesday. Foyle MLA Mr Durkan said: “I have long campaigned for this cruel and unnecessary measure to be changed. To ask people who have been given a terminal illness diagnosis to jump through hoops in order to access help and support is unconscionable. That we are not doing everything we can to make things easier for those suffering from illness in the final months of their lives is callous in the extreme. “Through my work with Marie Curie on this issue I was made aware of one family that received a letter declaring their brother was fit for work on the very day of his funeral. This should never have been allowed to happen and I hope this legislation will go some way to preventing that and get those suffering from terminal illness the quick and easy access to welfare they deserve – it’s the least we can do. “The extension of this provision to people with a year to live is welcome and will help many, but it doesn’t go far enough. I would urge Minister Hargey to take a leaf from the Scottish Government’s book and consider permitting clinicians to make the call on determining whether their patients are terminally ill without worrying about arbitrary time limits.  “People living with Motor Neurones Disease, Multiple Sclerosis and other le limiting illnesses won’t obtain a better prognosis. For them, a six-month extension wont make much of a dference and will just add to unnecessary stress at this awful time. We should be focused on support for people who have received this devastating diagnosis and their families, not judging peoples need to access help based on the time they have left.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the opening of Lynchrsquos new Greysteel Eurospar were Alastair Conner,Joanne Kerlin, owner Conor Lynch, Stephanie McElwee, Virginia Moore and Paul Deans, from Henderson Group.

Mr Durkan had long lobbied for the provision to be removed and worked alongside a number of charities to get Sinn Feacutein Communities Minister, Deirdre Hargey, to change the current provision. The Social SecurityBill was granted accelerated passage at its second stage in the Assembly on Tuesday. Foyle MLA Mr Durkan said: “I have long campaigned for this cruel and unnecessary measure to be changed. To ask people who have been given a terminal illness diagnosis to jump through hoops in order to access help and support is unconscionable. That we are not doing everything we can to make things easier for those suffering from illness in the final months of their lives is callous in the extreme. “Through my work with Marie Curie on this issue I was made aware of one family that received a letter declaring their brother was fit for work on the very day of his funeral. This should never have been allowed to happen and I hope this legislation will go some way to preventing that and get those suffering from terminal illness the quick and easy access to welfare they deserve – it’s the least we can do. “The extension of this provision to people with a year to live is welcome and will help many, but it doesn’t go far enough. I would urge Minister Hargey to take a leaf from the Scottish Government’s book and consider permitting clinicians to make the call on determining whether their patients are terminally ill without worrying about arbitrary time limits.  “People living with Motor Neurones Disease, Multiple Sclerosis and other le limiting illnesses won’t obtain a better prognosis. For them, a six-month extension wont make much of a dference and will just add to unnecessary stress at this awful time. We should be focused on support for people who have received this devastating diagnosis and their families, not judging peoples need to access help based on the time they have left.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the opening of Lynchrsquos new Greysteel Eurospar were Alastair Conner,Joanne Kerlin, owner Conor Lynch, Stephanie McElwee, Virginia Moore and Paul Deans, from Henderson Group.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the opening of Lynchrsquos new Greysteel Eurospar were Alastair Conner,Joanne Kerlin, owner Conor Lynch, Stephanie McElwee, Virginia Moore and Paul Deans, from Henderson Group.

A Christmas adventure set in Derry is available to buy at Little Acorns Bookstore on Foyle Street.Reporter: Matthew Leslie Dec Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, Once upon a time, what started as a bedtime story could become a Christmas best-seller. googletag.cmd.push Derry-based writer, Robert Campbell, has released a new childrens novel, “Sled Down!” where four animal schoolchildren from Culmore venture into the city to save Christmas. The characters, Ralph , Susan , Finbarand Bettyget wind of Santas elves crashing the sled on a test run over the River Foyle and the reindeer have escaped. Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is one and he makes his way inside Derrys Walls where he comes across an unscrupulous fake Santa Claus looking to use him to fleece the citys Christmas shoppers out of their cash. Robert,  and originally from Doagh in East Antrim, admitted the story started when he was making up a bedtime tale for his children and from there it grew into something more. He said: “Im not an author by profession although I have written other things. This is my first childrens story.  The author of a new childrens novel set in Derry, Sled Down!, Robert Campbell  “I have three young boys – Boyd , Henryand Adamand it was really a story that I told the children at bedtime and then I just sort of wrote it up properly and then published it. “The children seemed to enjoy my story. Generally they would give a pretty honest reaction on what they really think. Sothey enjoyed it, then maybe other children would too. “Without giving too much away about the plot, Santas elves have taken the sled out for a test run right before Christmas. “They have been messing about on the Foyle and have crashed the sled. “The animal children in the book get summoned by their headteacher, who has heard what has happened, to go and round up the loose reindeer and help get the sled back to their school in Culmore. “Meanwhile, around Derrys walls, there is a character who is a  Santa Claus and hes not very nice. “Hes managed to get a hold of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer himself and sets up a scheme to get people to have their picture taken with Rudolph for five pounds a go. “With Rudolph, the idea came about of where would he have gone to  following the sled crashing. “The bad Santa is not based on anyone in particular. Hes not really that bad except he is a bit of a chancer. Hes also up to a couple of other things that would not be classed as being environmentally friendly. “All the book is set in Derry. The walls get a mention as do the bridges where the elves are messing about with the sled. Culmore of course is mentioned as thats where the childrens school is. “Without giving too much away, like most Christmas tales, the day is saved by the children – although the real Santa makes an appearance as well.” Robert has been living in Derry for close to the last  years and admits that by setting the book in the city, he is paying homage to it. He added: “Im not actually from Derry myself. Im a blow-in from Doagh – near Ballyclare – in East Antrim. “My we is from Derry and Ive been living here for eleven or twelve years now. The book is probably a wee homage to Derry as well. “Its a lovely place up here. You could set a Christmas book anywhere but a festive story works perfectly well here. “Theres so many places in Derry that you could use for the book.” Robert Campbells book, “Sled Down!” is available to buy at Little Acorns Bookstore on Foyle Street, Derry or from Amazon at: https:www.amazon Sled-Down-friends-rescue-Christmas dp BKNZQN  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the opening of Lynchrsquos new Greysteel Eurospar were Alastair Conner,Joanne Kerlin, owner Conor Lynch, Stephanie McElwee, Virginia Moore and Paul Deans, from Henderson Group.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.  googletag.cmd.push   Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.    The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the opening of Lynchrsquos new Greysteel Eurospar were Alastair Conner,Joanne Kerlin, owner Conor Lynch, Stephanie McElwee, Virginia Moore and Paul Deans, from Henderson Group.

At a media briefing, he stated there were inherent internal contradictions in the bans and said, Weve seen these before where you ban flights except for your own citizens. Is it that some passport holders will have the virus and some wont  Does the virus read your passport  Does the virus know your nationality or where youre legally resident  Our concern here is that we apply public health principles, not political principles to selecting measures that are used to control the spread of disease. He made the comments in the wake of tightening border restrictions across dozens of countries in response to the Omicron iant. WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also called on countries to take rational and proportional risk-reduction measures. He said, Blanket travel bans will not prevent the international spread of Omicron and they place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods. Dr Ryan suggested other ways to manage risk: There are ways that you can de-risk travel in terms of having increased testing, more testing before departure, more testing on arrival, quarantine until negative testing. There is a whole series of things that can be done that will manage the risk of importation of disease or even exporting disease to another country which fall short of blanket bans. The idea that you can put a hermetic seal on most countries is just frankly not possible. We all know that, weve seen that happen before. And certainly there has to be consistency. If [the bans] are being applied, they have to be consistent.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the opening of Lynchrsquos new Greysteel Eurospar were Alastair Conner,Joanne Kerlin, owner Conor Lynch, Stephanie McElwee, Virginia Moore and Paul Deans, from Henderson Group.

The National Archiveswill present an exhibition thatmarks itsrole as the official repository of the recordsof the State, one hundred years since its formation. The Treaty, : Records fromthe Archivesopens up signicant historical records, official documents, and private papers for the first time, includingthe first public presentation of both the Irish and British copies of the Treaty document. The exhibition locatesthe Treaty negotiations in the political context of the Irish revolution beginning with the exploratorytalks betweenEacuteamon de Valera and David Lloyd George during the summer of , itdetailsthe work of the Irish plenipotentiaries and their secretariat, by presenting the documentary record that they left behind.  The exhibition also chronicles day-to-day le in London for the men and women who made up the Irish delegation, from parties attended,dinners hosted and appearances at theatre and gala performances, to the tense final days and hours leading to the signing of the Treaty just after am on  December . Finally, it documents the delegation’sto Dublin, and the Daacuteil Eacuteireann cabinetmeeting that pointed to the split in the independence movement that emerged over the terms of the Treaty, and the isions that wouldlead to Civil War. Speaking at the exhibition, Taoiseach Micheaacutel Martin said thisis a signicant exhibition bringing key records relating to the foundation of the State to the public for the first time in  years. These records highlight this complex period in our history culminating in the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty . They present the dficult political context in which the Treaty was negotiated but they also open a window for the first time into the world in which the Irish delegation operated during their time in London. It is an honour for me as Taoiseach to attend this exhibition. he added. Taacutenaiste Leo Varadkar said the Treaty was a decisive moment in history, an agreement negotiated in good faith between two opposing sides. This exhibition provides a vital connection to the foundation of our State, reminding us of the dramatic events of one hundred years ago, and the courageous decisions which enabled us to achieve a priceless stepping stone to freedom. he added. The National Archives wasestablished to collect, manage and preserve Ireland’s public record, ensuring their availability as a resource for all. These records relate to the social, cultural, economic and political history of the island of Ireland from the Middle Ages through to the establishment of the Irish Free State in  and into the modern era. Admission to the exhibition is free. Book online at here. This exhibition is presented as part of the Government of Ireland’s Decade of Centenaries - National Programme.

The National Archiveswill present an exhibition thatmarks itsrole as the official repository of the recordsof the State, one hundred years since its formation. The Treaty, : Records fromthe Archivesopens up signicant historical records, official documents, and private papers for the first time, includingthe first public presentation of both the Irish and British copies of the Treaty document. The exhibition locatesthe Treaty negotiations in the political context of the Irish revolution beginning with the exploratorytalks betweenEacuteamon de Valera and David Lloyd George during the summer of , itdetailsthe work of the Irish plenipotentiaries and their secretariat, by presenting the documentary record that they left behind.  The exhibition also chronicles day-to-day le in London for the men and women who made up the Irish delegation, from parties attended,dinners hosted and appearances at theatre and gala performances, to the tense final days and hours leading to the signing of the Treaty just after am on  December . Finally, it documents the delegation’sto Dublin, and the Daacuteil Eacuteireann cabinetmeeting that pointed to the split in the independence movement that emerged over the terms of the Treaty, and the isions that wouldlead to Civil War. Speaking at the exhibition, Taoiseach Micheaacutel Martin said thisis a signicant exhibition bringing key records relating to the foundation of the State to the public for the first time in  years. These records highlight this complex period in our history culminating in the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty . They present the dficult political context in which the Treaty was negotiated but they also open a window for the first time into the world in which the Irish delegation operated during their time in London. It is an honour for me as Taoiseach to attend this exhibition. he added. Taacutenaiste Leo Varadkar said the Treaty was a decisive moment in history, an agreement negotiated in good faith between two opposing sides. This exhibition provides a vital connection to the foundation of our State, reminding us of the dramatic events of one hundred years ago, and the courageous decisions which enabled us to achieve a priceless stepping stone to freedom. he added. The National Archives wasestablished to collect, manage and preserve Ireland’s public record, ensuring their availability as a resource for all. These records relate to the social, cultural, economic and political history of the island of Ireland from the Middle Ages through to the establishment of the Irish Free State in  and into the modern era. Admission to the exhibition is free. Book online at here. This exhibition is presented as part of the Government of Ireland’s Decade of Centenaries - National Programme. It runs from December ,  - March ,  from am-pm daily.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the opening of Lynchrsquos new Greysteel Eurospar were Alastair Conner,Joanne Kerlin, owner Conor Lynch, Stephanie McElwee, Virginia Moore and Paul Deans, from Henderson Group.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the opening of Lynchrsquos new Greysteel Eurospar were Alastair Conner,Joanne Kerlin, owner Conor Lynch, Stephanie McElwee, Virginia Moore and Paul Deans, from Henderson Group.

Pic by Mary K Burke.Reporter: Liam Tunney Dec Email: liam@derrypost  addthis, Derrys Competitions Control Committeehas vowed to clamp down on the number of clubs moving fixtures for the  season. googletag.cmd.push In their report to the Derry GAA AGM, the CCC said that of  games played during the  season,  games had been moved away from their original date. The figure excludes changes made before the beginning of the season to accommodate club requests, and the CCCs report said clubs need to stick to the deadline for making changes. “A weekly fixtures list is sent to clubs and any changes for the incoming week should be notied by the given deadline,” they said. “There is a tendency for club managers to agree last minute changes among themselves, sometimes not even informing their club secretary. “The original referee is not always available for the changed date time and this is a headache for our Referee Administrator. “In  as per CCC policy there will be NO game changes accepted after Sunday night for the week ahead unless in exceptional circumstances.” Dungiven picked up the U Jack Cassidy Cup in , but the CCC have raised concerns about the age grade. Pic by Mary K Burke. Elsewhere in the report, the Committee stressed the need to take another look at the bridging competition between underage and senior, saying the U grade did not work well. They also urged clubs to be honest in choosing their grade, and said there were reports of players prevented from attending to ensure lower-sided games. “We ask clubs to ensure that they work with managers and team personnel when choosing the grade they enter for  , and that they aim to play  a side including all eligible players,” the report said. “There were worrying reports that some players were being told they were not needed on a given night to ensure a  a side game. “This should NOT be happening and especially not in the current climate when sporting activity is more important than ever.” Discipline has continued to be an issue, with figures provided by the CCC revealing one club had had  incidents dealt with during . The report indicated the CCC would deal with issues in the strictest manner possible. Our games are contact sports and accidental injury will inevitably happen, but a deliberate attack on an opponent or official, causing serious injury is inexcusable, and the fear is that one of these days something will go badly wrong, with terrible consequences for all involved, said the report. We need to hammer home to our players the danger of the one punch attack and instil in them a healthy respect for their opponents and officials. The disregard for the authority of referees, and the abuse directed at them, especially from young players gives rise for concern. These remain UNACCEPTABE and we will continue to deal with them in the strictest manner possible. We will implement whatever measures we need to protect players and officials and work to ensure our games are safer and more enjoyable for all. In his secretarys report to the AGM, Peter Keane said Derry was in a good place both on and off the field of play. He said the county was close to appointing their full time Head of Operations. “The County Executive will announce the appointment of a fulltime Head of Operations in the coming days,” said the report. “When we look at what has happened over the past couple of years which can be put down to a dedicated and hardworking Committee of volunteers backed up by determined sub-committees then this appointment can only lead to further development both on and off the pitch. “The appointee will have leadership skills, financial expertise, strategic planning skills, marketing skills -all attributes that will help Derry to achieve their objectives in the next few years.” The report also said Derry were in a fairly good financial position, pointing to the recent acquisition of a new sponsor and a number of appointments yet to come.  More recognition for All-Ireland winning Derry minors  A civic honours reception has been held in their honour.   “We have reaped the rewards of an excellent championship campaign which generated increased revenue compared with last year,” said the report. “Over the past few days we are glad to welcome the Errigal Group as the counties main sponsor for football and hurling for the next five years. “The Counties Marketing consultants Teneo are presently seeking further sponsors for Development squads and Naming Rights sponsorship for both stadia - announcements will be made soon.” Sean Keanes report ended with a rallying call for the coming year. “I look forward to working together with you all again next year as we play a vital role in putting Derry back on the map again,” he added.

The resulting spot kick was coolly dispatched again by Robinson.At the beginning of the second half Omagh pulled level again and the sidelines were a hive of activity, with changes being rung by both sides.Left-back Jack Kelly delivered a deep cross into the Omagh box and the hardworking Tom Crudington recycled it out to Calam Mulqueen, who made no mistake when called upon to put Down High - ahead with the clock running low.But once again Down High became complacent as Omagh turned the screw and won countless corners. The pressure took its toll and a thoroughly deserved equaliser left the tie at - with the visitors left wondering what had gone wrong.At this stage, goalkeeper Alex Truesdale was busy keeping his side in the game and made one miraculous point blank save, resembling Jerzy Dudekrsquos heroics for Liverpool in the  Champions League final.Extra-time loomed large and with the floodlights now on both sides knew that one mistake or a well-placed pass could be decisive.After a cautious start to extra-time, Caolan Lennon stepped up to take a free-kick and scored a simply stunning goal into the top corner of the Omagh goal mdasha tremendous -yard thunder strike that encapsulated his class throughout the game.Omagh Academy pushed to get back into the game and were caught on the counter when that man Robinson pounced and rounded the rsquokeeper to score and put somne breathing space between the sides.Robinsonrsquos goalscoring exploits won him the man-of-the-match award, with Mulqueenrsquos midfield battling also worthy of high commendation.Lennon was a constant thorn in Omaghrsquos side while mazy runs from Josh Ward caught the eye, with Josh McMullan working hard too.

finalised and it is hoped that once the date of the K event and the venue have been formally confirmed that the parkrun will become an annual event for runners of all abilities.Hugely popular across the globe, the proposed Downpatrick parkrun also has the potential to provide the local economy with a boost.Downpatrick Town Committee is behind the ambitious plan for the new parkrun which it believes will bring the local community closer together and may encourage people who have never run before to get out and enjoy themselves in an event where there is no time limit and no one finishes last.Last month, the Town Committee issued an online appeal for ldquoenthusiastic and committed volunteers to come forward to help get the parkrun up and running and itrsquos hoped that the parkrun could become a weekly event and attract people from across the district to enhance their health and enjoy the great outdoors.Downpatrick area councillor Gareth Sharvin has welcomed the progress on establishing a parkrun event at Dunleath Park.He said parkruns have become popular with runners and walkers alike across the country and keen participants in the Downpatrick area have been planning the establishment of a similar event in the county town.Cllr Sharvin confirmed that he recently requested an update from Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Active and Healthy Communities department on the progress of establishing the parkrunand providing financial support to the group setting up the event.ldquoI am happy to report that the financial contribution and approach has been agreed between all stakeholders and officers are working with the parkrun organisers to finalise the details, he said.ldquoWith this great news, it should not be long until we have our first parkrun event in Downpatrick, utilising the new trail around Dunleath.Cllr Sharvin added: ldquoA parkrun will also bring people from outside the area into Downpatrick spending locally in our shops and cafes, adding to our great array of social and leisure activities on offer.News that Dunleath Park could host the parkrun comes after recent confirmation that major investment is planned for this part of the town.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is planning to create a series of new facilities, including a dedicated running track, while also in the pipeline are a cycling pump track, skateboarding track, improved planting and a new play park.In addition, soccer and GAA pitches are in line for an upgrade as part of the plan to transform Dunleath Park into a sporting and recreational hub.Itrsquos understood that the area earmarked for the proposed pump track, skateboard track and play park sit outside the parkrsquos floodplain and will enable the local authority to move faster in putting a

I am so grateful for their support, said a delighted Laura.ldquoPeople were very generous and while I initially asked my relatives for support, some people that I did not know also donated. Everyone was very generous and the donated items will help families in need. Thank you again to everyone who supported me.The foodbank says all generous donations are put to good use to help those in need in the community, with those who receive parcels very grateful to the generosity of others whose compassion is having a positive impact.Volunteers who run the service say people use foodbanks for a iety of reasons, including low incomes, redundancy, illness, benefit issues, homelessness, family break-up, domestic violence or simply an unexpected bill.In addition, crisis situations can occur for lots of dferent reasons, with the foodbank working closely with frontline professionals to identy iniduals in need of help by using a voucher referral system.The volunteers who run the foodbank say they continue to be overwhelmed by peoplersquos generosity and thoughtfulness to help those in need and who find themselves in dficulty through no fault of their own.ldquoWe would like to thank Laura and her family and friends for their recent donation which will be used to help those in need, said foodbank co-ordinator Shirley Lennon..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Liatroim get one over on neighbours St John’s  ","story":"A VERY competitive derby fixture played out at Fontenoy Park between two sides with winning momentum behind them.Missing key personnel, the Liatroim management team of Danny McKay, Aodhan Morgan and Sam Walsh were forced to make a number of positional changes prior to throw-in.The away side got off to a blistering start, with Caolan Burns coolly dispatching a third-minute penalty past Fontenoys net minder Eoin Cotter.Midfield pairing Oran Carew and Oisin Hastings were central in the lead-up to the penalty, with slick interplay.Burns was a thorn in the side of the home defence from start to finish, linking up cleverly with Christopher Cope and Owen Madine in particular.Deputising goalkeeper Damien McMullan performed strongly, his efficient kick-outs finding wing backs Conor McMullan and Adam McCourt, who were having good duels with Michael McAleenan and the dangerous Donnacha OrsquoToole.In the th minute, OrsquoToole finished a swt Fontenoy counter-attack to the net to swing the momentum in favour of the home side.The strong running of Eoin OrsquoHare, Cormac McElroy and team captain Mark Owens ensured the Fontenoys were able to transition at speed.However, Carew and Hastings were gaining a foothold in the middle sector and used precious primary possession intelligently, offloading to the always available Ryan Morgan and Chris Cope.Copersquos point from the tightest of angles in the st minute was sublime. From the resulting kick-out Carew won possession before sending over a mammoth effort to put the Johnnies back in the ascendancy.With both teams displaying huge work rate, the challenge for the Johnnies was to play through the Fontenoy press and find space.Ryan Morganrsquos pace, and incisive angled runs were a crucial factor in carving a way through a Fontenoy backline that was being well marshalled by Queens Universityrsquos Niall McElroy.Cope and Madine combined to create an exceptional team score in the th minute, but the Fontenoy response was swt and the energetic Eoin OrsquoHare burst through to raise the green flag in the next phase of play.Caolan Burns and Eoin McCrickard kept the scoreboard ticking over with well taken frees for their sides.A key battle within the game was that of Johnnies centre half Oran OrsquoConnor against Michael McMullan. OrsquoConnor was readily available each time the full back line of Aaron Murphy, Adam Walsh and team captain Rory McMullan gained possession.McMullanrsquos brave block from a Shea Moorehead effort in the th minute typied the spirit within this young Johnnies team, his cousin Conor McMullan claimed the resultant rebound and found Cope who won a late free on the far sideline.From fully  yards out, Ryan Morgan launched a majestic effort that found its way to the Fontenoy net to leave just one score between the teams. The next kick-out was pivotal. Kevin Middleton managed to fist the ball down to the onrushing OrsquoToole to claim a vital possession for the Fontenoys who held out for a narrow win.A great game played in a good spirit and well officiated by referee Colm Gribben..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Planners approve Down High order  ","story":"PLANNERS have given the green light to y a condition of the planning approval for Down High Schoolrsquos new multi-million pound campus in Downpatrick.The iation ensures that archaeological remains uncovered within the proposed development site are properly identied and protected or appropriately recorded.Local planners have approved the move under their delegated authority which means their decision does not have to be formally approved by the local authorityrsquos Planning Committee.The Education Authority confirmed recently that an application was made to allow construction of the eagerly-awaited new school to start, in tandem with the completion of the archaeological works which, due to the signicant findings uncovered, could take some time.A spokesman confirmed that site works are due to finish next January, with the archaeological report expected to take a further six months or more to complete.Education officials have also revealed that an addendum to the original business case was completed and approved in March this year.They say the new school project was issued for tender last month with a target of contract award by the second quarter of ldquoto complete a -month contract period for construction of the new school building and associated works.It also emerged recently that the contract to build Down High School on a site mdash which borders the Strangford and Quoile roads mdash could be awarded as early as next spring.Tenders were issued last month and education officials expect that it will take  months to build the eagerly-anticipated new building and complete all associated site works once construction work gets underway.The site was purchased some time ago by the Department of Education with the construction of the new school deemed a priority as far back as  due to what at the time was described as the existing schoolrsquos ldquosubstandard accommodation and over-reliance on temporary classrooms.The site of the proposed new campus is located in an area of outstanding natural beauty which also includes a graveyard linked to the townrsquos former workhouse.Extensive archaeological work was disrupted by the coronavirus but has resumed to identy and evaluate any remains at the site.It is understood that any which are discovered will be relocated to a nearby site during an ecumenical service led by local clergy.School officials say they are aware of the ldquohistoric signicance of the development site, with plans to commemorate important parts of local history..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Posthumous honour for ‘hero’ fundraiser Bonny after £230k Marie Curie support  ","story":"A DRUMANESS man who helped raise pound, to support families deal with terminal illness has been posthumously honoured by Marie Curie.The late BonnyBrown was one of a number of people given an honorary remembrance award at the charityrsquos annual Fundraising Excellence Awards.His family watched online last week as Marie Curie chief executive Matthew Reed paid tribute to the  year-old who started the Co Down Marie Curie fundraising group.He said: ldquoWe are here to celebrate people in their letime who gave so much time and of themselves and made such a considerable dference to the work of Marie Curie and to so many dferent families.Bonny sadly died on April  last year of a heart attack which shocked and saddened the Drumaness community.

Together we can put a stop to illegal puppy farming. Buying a puppy from illegal breeders can have devastating results, she continued.ldquoOften puppies die a short time after purchase or end up with infectious diseases such as parvovirus which is expensive to treat and, often fatal. They can also suffer behavioural issues relating to fear and anxiety due to poor or no socialisation.Chief Inspector Ford said it can be tempting to buy a puppy in these circumstances and often purchasers will recognise that things are not quite right, asking people to remember that by lsquorescuingrsquo a puppy in these circumstances, they are fuelling and supporting what is a particularly lucrative criminal industry.She added: ldquoWe would encourage anyone who is aware of illegal dog breeding establishments to contact their local council and we would like to take this opportunity to thank those that have done so to date already.Council chairwoman Cathy Mason said the local authority was committed to working with its partners to address this issue.ldquoWe investigate all reports made to us, she said. ldquoRecently, animal welfare officers seized seven dogs from a property following reports the animals were kept in poor living conditions and a further  dogs were seized at an illegal puppy farm with associated poor environmental conditions.Cllr Mason said the local authority is currently investigating a case of failing to ensure the welfare needs of dogs and causing unnecessary suffering.She continued: ldquoThis is a particularly timely message at this time of year when many will be thinking of purchasing a puppy for Christmas.ldquoCouncils are the lead agency when it comes to animal welfare issues and we routinely work with other agencies such as police and Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs to help us tackle this serious issue.Cllr Mason also asked people across the district for their help.She added: ldquoIf anyone sees or is are aware of anything untoward, please report it to your localcouncil dog warden immediately so we can take appropriate action and seek assistance from relevant partners..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13274193.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Clockwise from top left, David Lloyd George Austen Chamberlain, F.E.Smith, , Winston Churchill, Robert Barton, Michael Collins, Arthur GrfithLock it up carefully”, David Lloyd George said to his mistress and secretary, Frances Stevenson, in her room at  Downing Street, as he handed her the British copy of the historic Anglo-Irish Treaty just before  am on  December .Under its terms the Union of Great Britain and Ireland, as created by Pitt the Younger  years earlier, came to an end. Only the six counties of the newly formed Northern Ireland were to be permitted to remain within the United Kingdom. Their devolved Parliament, which had been opened by King George V the previous June , was given the power to vote them out of the all-Ireland settlement, based on dominion status, which the Treaty embodied.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.The document that was locked away in Downing Street bore the signatures of four members of the British delegation who had negotiated it. They formed a column headed by Lloyd George himself the others, drawn from his Liberal  Unionist coalition cabinet, were Austen Chamberlain, F.E.Smith, Lord Birkenhead , and Winston Churchill.Another column listed the signatures of three of their Irish counterparts, headed by Arthur Grfith, the founder of Sinn Fein in , and followed by the charismatic Michael Collins, the chief organiser of the IRA’s terrorist campaign against Britain, waged from  until July  when a truce was agreed between the two sides. The third Irish signatory, Robert Barton, a Unionist landowner turned Republican and an intimate friend of Collins, was the Sinn Fein delegation’s economic adviser. Never before had British and Irish representatives put their names to a formal agreement of this kind as complete equals. After the signing, which took place at . am, the two sides shook hands for the first time. Trust had replaced the deep suspicion with which they had first regarded each other. Irish leaders, who a few months earlier had been denounced as rebels and murderers, had come to enjoy the respect of the British delegation. Michael Collins had undergone an astonishing transformation from terrorist leader to statesman, gaining the admiration of two prominent members of the British team, Churchill and Birkenhead.Final agreement on the terms of the treaty had been reached in two intense negotiating sessions in the Cabinet Room at No , which ended two months of wrangling. The first session, which lasted over five hours, began at pm on December . Lloyd George employed all his formidable political skills to secure a breakthrough in all but one of the key areas that had hitherto defied resolution.The Irish gained the full fiscal and financial autonomy they craved. The British got what they wanted on defence: the use “in time of war or of strained relations with a foreign power [of] such harbour and other facilities as the British government may require”, combined with the permanent retention of what came to be known as the Treaty Ports , major strategic assets which Neville Chamberlainwas to abandon in a further Anglo-Irish Treaty in  to Churchill’s fury. Since the start of negotiations in October, the words of an oath of allegiance which Irish elected representatives would in future be required to swear had been through endless drafts. It was at last settled with a suitably convoluted rigmarole to spare the Irish republican conscience as much strain as possible: “I will be faithful to His Majesty King George V, his Heirs and Successors by law, in virtue of the common citizenship of Ireland and Great Britain, and her adherence to and membership of the group of nations forming the British Commonwealth of Nations.” This was the first time on which the customary reference to Empire was dropped from an official document.There remained just one make-or-break issue: Northern Ireland, with its devolved powers over local matters entrusted to it by Westminster earlier in . Sinn Fein were determined to get it into their independent state. Lloyd George was happy to give them all the help he could. In November, he had piled pressure on Sir James Craig, the Northern Ireland prime minister. In letters and conversations he tried, with all his accustomed craftiness, to get Craig to accept that he had a patriotic duty to remove the last barrier to peace in Ireland by joining a sovereign all-Ireland Parliament in place of Westminster, while retaining all the devolved powers that Westminster had provided.The Unionist members of the British delegation did not demur. Not for the last time, Ulster Unionists found that they could not rely on their English Unionist allies in high places . Austen Chamberlain said that separate arrangements for six of the nine Ulster counties were “illogical and indefensible”. He thought “the greatest moral pressure” should be put on Northern Ireland to bring it into a settlement that was “vital to the Empire”. His party chairman, Sir George Younger , believed “Ulster should take some risks and forget some of the past arguments against unity in Ireland”.These Unionist calls for compromisewere made against the background of a sustained press campaign, led by The Times, criticising Ulster Unionists for their intransigence. “Ulster blocks the way to peace” was the newspapers’ regular refrain. Craig described it as “ a press campaign against Ulster without parallel in the history of Great Britain.”But the Northern Ireland premier was unmoved. He told Lloyd George that a single parliament for Ireland was “precisely what Ulster has for many years resisted by all the means at her disposal”.Lloyd George tried another tack in November, concentrating his cunning this time on the leader of the Irish delegation, Arthur Grfith. Here he had much greater success than in his attempts to manoeuvre Craig into an all-Ireland parliament. At a private meeting with Grfith on November , he got the leader of the Irish delegation to give a personal written pledge that,Northern Ireland refused to accept an all-Ireland settlement, it would remain under the British Parliament, “but in this case, it would be necessary to revise the boundary of Northern Ireland. This might be done by a Boundary Commission ... to make the boundary conform as closely as possible to the wishes of the people.” What went unrecorded in the paper was the clear impression given by Lloyd George that Northern Ireland would lose so much territory that it could not survive as a separate entity and a united independent Ireland would as a result come into existence.During the course of the long afternoon session in Downing Street on December , Lloyd George reminded Grfith of what they had agreed.Proof was needed. A frantic search was made of the prime minister’s wardrobe, and “eventually an insignicant pocket cast up an envelope and a piece of paper.” On the strength of this written undertaking to establish a Boundary Commission whichwould undermine Northern Ireland, the leader of the Irish delegation agreed to sign the Treaty himself, but said that he could not commit his colleagues.At this, Lloyd George assumed a magnicently melodramatic air. He had told Craig in Belfast to expect news of the outcome of the discussions in Downing Street the following day. That could of course have been done by telephone, but Lloyd George now conjured up an elaborate plan to send the news in writing to Belfast in an attempt to force a decision out of the other two Irish delegates.“Here are the alternative letters which I have prepared, one enclosing Articles of Agreement reached by His Majesty’s Government and yourselves, and the other saying that the Sinn Fein representatives refuse to come within the Empire. If I send this letter it is war, and war within three days. Which letter am I to send  Whichever letter you choose travels by special train to Holyhead, and by destroyer to Belfast. The train is waiting with steam up at Euston ... to reach Sir James in time we must know your answer by ten p.m tonight. You can have until then, but no longer, to decide whether you will give peace or war to your country.”With these impassioned words ringing in their ears, the Irish delegates ed to their Knightsbridge hotel for anguished discussions amongst themselves, but promised to be back in Downing Street by the pm deadline. In fact, it was nearly .pm when they ed.Nothing more was heard about the special train waiting at Euston. Grfith announced calmly, “Prime Minister, the Delegation is willing to sign the agreements, but there are a few points of drafting which perhaps it would be convenientI mentioned at once.” The most important concerned the Boundary Commission redrafting increasedthe likelihood that Northern Ireland would collapse. At Iam on December , an agreed text was handed to the Downing Street typists.In England, reaction to the treaty was ecstatic. The Times led the way: “These are fitting peace terms to mark the close of an age of discontent and distrust, and the beginning of a new era of happiness and mutual understanding.” In Ireland, discontent intensied and took a new form: the long quarrel with Britain was replaced by distrust and ision within Sinn Fein, which led to a bitter civil war the following year. In Northern Ireland, IRA terrorism increased, generating sectarian stre in  parts of Belfast came to resemble the battlefields of the First World War. The Boundary Commission recommended only minor changes, and its report was shelved. Englishmen looked away. “The country”, said Austen Chamberlain, “wants peace and is tired of Ireland and Ulster.” English politicians hoped they would never have to think seriously about Irish affairs again. For nearly  years they had their wish — which meant that that they were fatally handicapped by ignorance when the Ulster crisis of  erupted.l BIBLIOGRAPHY—D.G.Boyce, Englishmen and Irish Troubles: British Public Opinion and the Making of Irish Policy -and “ How to Settle the Irish Question: Lloyd George and Ireland -” in A.J.P.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe complaint to the Public Services Ombudsman for Wales against the Cardf and Vale University Health Board was lodged by the patient -referred to in the complaint as lsquoMr Drsquo -who was unhappy with the care and treatment he received at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardf during and after a scheduled admission for surgery to remove the right side of his colon.Mr D, who has Aspergerrsquos Syndrome, complained that hiscondition - at the time believed to be Crohns Disease -was not clearly diagnosed and that clinicians were slow to identy he suffered a post-operative bleed and needed further emergency surgery.He complained that information about his treatment and care was not provided clearly to him despite those caring for him knowing about his Aspergerrsquos Syndrome. He was also unhappy with aspects of his care after his discharge.Mr Drsquos surgery was carried out on the presumption that he had Crohnrsquos Disease according to the Ombudsman, but surgical findings suggested complex chronic appendicitis.The Ombudsman found that neither of these conditions needed the extensive surgery that Mr D was given. The Ombudsman also found there was no complete record of how his condition was monitored following his surgery and that his post-operative bleed might have been detected sooner.The Ombudsman also concluded that the clinicians were aware of the patientrsquos Aspergerrsquos Syndrome but did not clearly communicate the information about his diagnosis and treatment to him. The Ombudsman also found that the patient was not seen by a mental health clinician as requested by Mr D because it was not arranged.MORE NEWS:The Ombudsman did not uphold the complaint regarding Mr Drsquos care post-discharge.Nick Bennett of Public Services Ombudsman for Wales said: ldquoThis regrettable case highlights yet again the importance of one of the key principles of prudent healthcare formulated by the Welsh Government ndash lsquodo only what is needed and do no harm.rsquoldquoPhysicians responsible for Mr Drsquos care should have employed a lsquowatch and waitrsquo approach in which his condition would probably have settled without surgical treatment.ldquoInstead, Mr D, a vulnerable inidual, faced completely avoidable trauma of unnecessary surgery and post-treatment complications ndash a trauma which saw him seek mental health support. I anticipate that my findings will be extremely distressing for him. This is reflected in my recommendations in this case.The Ombudsman recommended that Cardf and Vale University Health Board provides Mr D with a detailed apology and a redress payment of pound,. Mr Bennett also recommended that the physicians and nurses involved in Mr Drsquos care have relevant training in the management of Crohnrsquos Disease and chronic appendicitis as well as the care and management of patients with Aspergerrsquos Syndrome.It was also recommended that the nursing team consider the importance of conducting and documenting post-operative observations and of preparing accurate and relevant care plans.The Ombudsmans report says Cardf and Vale University Health Board has accepted the findings and conclusions of the Ombudsmanrsquos report and has agreed to implement the recommendations.A spokesperson for Cardf and Vale University Health Board said: \"As a health board we would like to reiterate our sincere apologies to Mr D for the concerns identied in the report.\"We are implementing the recommendations from the Ombudsman and an improvement plan has been developed to monitor the delivery of all recommendations within the agreed timescales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"Comments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Why not name it after yourself, your business, or a loved one \"Oryou really want, you can call our stadium The my mate Dave is a k**b Arena - knock yourself out!\"The lucky competition winner was named as Katie Louise Williams - the girlfriend of the clubs star striker Thomas Walters.Beautician Katie decided to rename Frampton Lane after her pet dog Moomin and chose the title Prince Moomins Palace.Ms Williams, , is planning to take four-year-old Moomin down to the next match to show him around his own stadium.She said: \"Im sure he will be very excited. We cant wait to take him.\"Ive been following the team for years and it was great to win the prize. Moomins name will be known to everyone around her now.\"The club confirmed Ms Williams - who is also the long-term partner of star striker Thomas Walters - won the prize.The club said: \"The stadium was named after her dog Moomin, who we are reliably informed is treated like a Prince.\"The competition raised vital funds in the quest for the club achieving a FAW Tier  License, with proceeds raised going towards much needed ground improvements such as floodlights.\"Reaction from fans has been positive, although much confusion on the stands last Saturday as to whether were still the Windmill Army or now the Moomin Army.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.
