First he filed chapter 11 bankruptcy, claiming he \u0027couldn\u0027t afford\u0027 the $5million demo cost. That was dismissed.Then he filed an appeal against Judge Karlan\u0027s order to tear down the giant house. That too was denied.He went to California\u0027s Supreme Court to try to save his project. But the state\u0027s highest court torpedoed his efforts, refusing even to hear the case.Still undeterred, Hadid\u0027s lawyers filed a second appeal - this time against Judge Karlan\u0027s decision to appoint a receiver to oversee destruction of the house. He lost that appeal as well.Last month, Hadid\u0027s legal team filed a third appeal, this one against the $2.9 million judgment awarded to the neighbors by the civil trial jury."},{"url":null,"title":"Lets Joe Hunt generous six year old sent football teams star player 26p","story":"Share this articleCrowdfunding to fund Joe \u0026amp his family attend a Swindon Town game on JustGiving"},{"url":null,"title":"Paramount Plus offered British TV views streaming service launches Summer","story":"Share this articleThe company also announced that the third instalment of John Krasinski\u0027s A Quiet Place is scheduled for 2025, following the huge success of the sequel in 2021, which was instrumental in encouraging people back to cinemas after long Covid closures.The film is likely to see Krasinski\u0027s wife Emily Blunt reprise her role as a mother desperate to protect her family as blind creatures with extremely sensitive hearing run rampage.The US version of the service is already home to Yellowstone spin-off 1883, starring Tim McGraw and Faith Hill, and upcoming series The Offer, about the making of The Godfather, starring Miles Teller, Juno Temple, Matthew Goode and Giovanni Ribisi.Among a raft of announcements of new series is new Star Trek show Strange New Worlds, starring Anson Mount as Captain Pike Rabbit Hole, a psychological thriller starring Kiefer Sutherland and an update to Fatal Attraction starring Lizzy Caplan and Joshua Jackson.The company also announced Grease: Rise Of The Pink Ladies, a musical prequel to the classic film, updated with new music and choreography.It will also premiere a new Beavis and Butt-Head movie, followed by new episodes of the animated series, while South Park will premiere two events on Paramount+ each year for the next six years and all episodes will be exclusive to the service internationally this year and in the US in 2025.The service says it already has more than 50 new international original shows planned as it expands into global markets.The news comes as part of a range of announcements by ViacomCBS following an investor day meeting on Tuesday.ViacomCBS will be rebranded to become Paramount, the company said.Other American streaming platforms like Hulu are not available in the UK, while HBO Max has given its rights to Sky Atlantic. "},{"url":null,"title":"Bristol bar branded Britains right pub refusing serve unethical major brands","story":"Share this article Lemmy added: \u0027A lot of the reasons we\u0027ve taken s*** before in what we choose to stock and what not to is because of land use, water use, worker\u0027s rights - to name just a few.\u0027We don\u0027t serve Coca-Cola because they have a history of seriously bad use of water in third world countries, that not a lot of people know about.

heavily linked to long Covid. Official estimates show around 1.3million Britons, 2.1 per cent of the population, have long Covid-like symptoms that last at least four weeks after infection. But because the condition is hard to define and figures are based on self-reported symptoms, it is hard to know exactly how many people are affected by the condition.Fatigue, shortness of breath and loss of smell or taste are the most common ongoing symptoms.To examine the role of the vagus nerve — roughly 3mm in diameter — in long Covid, medics at University Hospital Germans in Badalona recruited 348 sufferers.Two-thirds of the group had symptoms similar to those who had damaged the nerve — which usually occurs through surgery, physical injury or a tumour. These included diarrhoea, an elevated heart rate, dizziness, difficulty swallowing, voice problems and low blood pressure.Further tests of 22 patients also showed that slightly more than a quarter had a thickened or inflamed vagus nerve. Almost all of them, however, suffered symptoms relating to vagus nerve dysfunction, including diarrhoea, an elevated heart rate and dizziness. Dr Gemma Lladós and Dr Lourdes Mateu, medics at hospital and authors of the study, said the results show most long Covid patients with symptoms of vagus nerve damage had changes in the structure or function of their nerve. \u0027Our findings so far thus point at vagus nerve dysfunction as a central pathophysiological feature of long Covid,\u0027 they added.The findings were presented at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases. Dr David Strain, a senior clinical lecturer at the University of Exeter Medical School who was not involved in the study, said it adds to growing evidence that at least some long Covid symptoms are \u0027mediated through a direct impact on the nervous system\u0027.He said: \u0027It is entirely possible that people susceptible to nerve damage are at the greatest risk of developing long Covid. \u0027In this case this observation tells us little more than nerve damage is a result of Covid, this is greater in those with long Covid and the damage is easy to detect in a long, complex nerve.\u0027 But Dr Strain noted that not all persistent symptoms post-infection will be linked with this nerve, so more investigation is needed into the triggers of brain fog and muscle aches. He said drugs used to treat vagus nerve damage could be considered for long Covid."},{"url":null,"title":"England offer Covid jabs 5s Vaccines rolled non urgent basis","story":"Share this article Healthy children face a vanishingly low risk of severe illness from the virus, with only six children dying of the virus in England\u0027s first year of the pandemic. And two doses of a jab offers as little as 10 per cent protection against catching the antibody-resistant Omicron variant, UK data suggests.Many scientists have questioned the need to vaccinate children when so many have already had Covid.The Office of National Statistics estimates nearly three-quarters of youngsters aged 8 to 11 had Covid antibodies as of January 10. Normally the JCVI\u0027s recommendations are accepted by the Department of Health and implemented within a matter of days.But there are reports that No10 stepped in and blocked its publication last week so it could \u0027review\u0027 the advice.It is unclear what exactly caused the hold up, but in the past ministers have expressed frustration at the JCVI\u0027s caution over jabbing children.The group initially dragged its heels on recommending jabs to 12 to 15-year-olds in September, citing a lack of safety data and concerns about side-effects. In the end ministers had to circumvent the JCVI, and relied on Professor Chris Whitty and the chief medical officers in the devolved nations to approve the jabs on the basis they would prevent further disruption to schooling. There is a suggestion the Government wanted to announce the roll out to five to 11-year-olds as part of Boris Johnson\u0027s plan for England to live with Covid like flu.That strategy is set to be unveiled in Parliament after the recess on February 21 and include radical plans to ditch even the most fundamental Covid rules.Vaccination rates for children are similarly low in the US, where just three in 10 five to 11-year-olds have received one Covid jab and two in 10 are double-jabbed, according to data from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Children are given two Pfizer injections — which are a third of the dose given to adults — three weeks apart.Vaccine uptake is highest among white and mixed-race youngsters and lowest among black children. And children from the richest families are nearly three times more likely to be vaccinated (28.2 per cent) compared to those from the poorest areas (10.7 per cent).CDC data shows 17 per cent of children aged five to 11 rushed forward for their first jab in the month after the US approved the vaccine for the age group on November 2.But since then, uptake has slumped, with only eight per cent of opting to get the jab in the following month.The CDC\u0027s website states children as young as six months could be eligible for a Covid vaccination \u0027soon\u0027, with the country\u0027s Food and Drug Administration due to make a decision by February 21.But the FDA last week warned its announcement on the rollout to babies and toddlers is at least two months away. It is waiting for an update on the efficacy of three doses in the age group from Pfizer before it makes a decision. "},{"url":null,"title":"Facebook owner Meta promotes Nick Clegg equal founder Mark Zuckerberg","story":"Share this article Chief technology officer, Andrew Bosworth, said on Twitter that the Meta, Metamates, me slogan was in reference to a \u0027naval phrase which Instagram has used for a while\u0027 - \u0027Ship, Shipmates, self\u0027.The word Metamates was an original idea suggested by Douglas Hofstadter, scholar of cognitive science, physics, and comparative literature, after an employee of MEta asked him for ideas, according to Bosworth.These changes, which also include a call from Zuckerberg for staff not to \u0027nice ourselves to death,\u0027 are part of a bid to build a new corporate identity. Zuckerberg explained that the \u0027naval-inspired\u0027 new slogan, that has spread from Instagram to the whole firm, was about being good stewards of the company.\u0027It\u0027s about the sense of responsibility we have for our collective success and to each other as teammates. It\u0027s about taking care of our company and each other,\u0027 he said.\u0027At the end of the day, values aren\u0027t what you write on a website but what we hold each other accountable for every day. I encourage you to reflect on these values and what they mean to you as we start working on this next chapter for our company.\u0027 The announcement was made at a town hall meeting, but also streamed through the virtual reality-based Horizon Venues.As well as new slogans, and a new name for employees, this is a shift away from a particularly open culture for the social media firm.Insiders predict this is a move to avoid leaks and repetitional damage, asking everyone employed by Meta to consider the welfare of the firm as a whole.Meta employs more than 71,000 people, all connected to an internal \u0027Facebook-like\u0027 chat system called Workplace that hosts deep debates on everything from Black Lives Matter to elections, as well as internal research on the company\u0027s impact. This is part of the open culture, once prized by the firm. But in recent years this information has made it out beyond the corporate firewall.In 20221 Frances Haugen, a whisleblower, released thousands of documents that had been posted to Workplace that revealed research into social harms caused by the likes of Instagram and Facebook.This prompted the firm to shut down groups within Workplace that were open to a lot of people, and having communications teams tell staff posting critical comments about Facebook and its business, that they were being disrespectful.Facebook has been faced with years of controversy, mainly linked to the sharing of data and impact on the mental health of its users, and politics of countries. Part of the name change to Meta was to shift away from being a social media brand, into a new \u0027metaverse\u0027 company, that also sold hardware such as the Oculus Rift.The rebranding came soon after a series of whistleblower reports that revealed how much damage to society Facebook, and its subsidiaries, was doing to society.This came in the form of affecting the body image of young women, through to allowing the spread of disinformation - on everything from vaccines to politics.    The firm is still facing legal battles, including a law suit from the state of Texas over the use of facial recognition by Facebook.Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who filed the lawsuit in state District Court in Marshall, said the company\u0027s capture of facial geometry in photographs that users uploaded between 2010 and 2021 resulted in \u0027tens of millions of violations\u0027 of Texas law, according to the Wall Street Journal. Early in February Facebook was ordered to remove content defaming a politician and post a banner on its Austrian homepage announcing the ruling after losing a legal battle, which also saw the internet giant pay €4,000 in damages. Yesterday it was announced that Meta had settled a decade-old class action lawsuit over the use of cookies in 2010 and 2011 that tracked people even when logged out. As part of the proposed settlement, which must still be approved by a judge, Meta has agreed to delete all the data it \u0027wrongfully collected\u0027 during that period. The company, which posted profits of $39.37 billion in 2021, will also pay $90 million to users who filed a claim, after lawyer fees are deducted.\u0027Reaching a settlement in this case, which is more than a decade old, is in the best interest of our community and our shareholders and we\u0027re glad to move past this issue,\u0027 said Meta spokesperson Drew Pusateri in a statement on Tuesday.  adverts.addToArray({pos:mpu_factbox})AdvertisementShare this article"},{"url":null,"title":"Photo diary six months French Riviera Rolling Stones 1971 feature new exhibition","story":"Share this articleUp Close and Personal With The Rolling Stones by Dominique Tarlé — Blind Magazine"},{"url":null,"title":"Biden taps non binary drag queen look nuclear waste","story":"Share this article Brinton, who has a Master\u0027s degree from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) writes in their LinkedIn bio that they are working towards \u0027Solving the World\u0027s #NuclearWaste Challenges and Protecting LGBTQ Youth from #ConversionTherapy.\u0027 They currently work as a director of global political strategy at Deep Isolation, a nuclear waste disposal company.

But the swarming Canadian defense forms a red wall, and the danger is cleared.Finally, the USA goes back on the attack. Alex Carpenter gets a shot on a quick push forward. Nurse has tied the great Hayley Wickenheiser for points in one Olympic tournament with 17 -- five goals, 12 assists.Canada has outshot the USA 5-1. Canada whips the puck around against a somnambulant US defense, and Natalie Spooner takes it in the middle of the US zone and drills it past goalie Alex Cavallini, who is getting the start here instead of Maddie Rooney, who played the first game. But the US challenges the play, saying Canada was offside. Replay says ... yes. Offside. No goal. But if that isn’t a wakeup call for the US, I’m not sure what would be. Organ plays the Star Wars music from the scene of Luke watching the twin sunset.Before I forget, I’d like to single out the organist at the hockey venue, who has been outstanding. They’ve been alternating the organ with recorded music, most recently Tame Impala’s song Elephant.CHANCE! Hannah Brandt pounces on a rebound on the doorstep with half the net open behind Canadian goalie Ann-Renee Desbiens. Call it nerves, call it a rolling puck -- Brandt’s shot hit the outside of the goal, and they may regret that. In the group stage, the USA outshot Canada 53-27 and lost 4-2. Just like the USA-Canada men’s soccer game recently. Possession means nothing if you don’t put something in the net.Just know this -- no other country has ever won squat in this sport. A Canadian columnist actually wrote recently that the sport didn’t belong in the Olympics because no one else can compete. It was not a popular opinion. Faceoff ... here we go ..But the women lost their last three to finish 4-5, taking care of business against the less-accomplished opponents but failing to break through against the sport’s titans -- world champion Silvana Tirinzoni’s Swiss team, second-ranked Anna Hasselborg and Sweden, and two-time Olympic semifinalist Eve Muirhead and Britain. A loss to fearsome Canadian Jennifer Jones, the 2014 Olympic champion and 2018 world champion, deflated the USA, and they lost their final game to Japan. Shuster’s team underwhelmed in several games, including a horrid 10-4 loss to Italy in their penultimate game. But other results broke their way, and as in 2018, a 5-4 record would get them into the semifinals. They clinched that a few minutes ago with a workmanlike win over a misfiring Danish team.  Later today, the US will face Team GB, which clinched the top seed with an 8-1 record. Shuster, though, accounted for that loss. This team often plays to the level of the competition for better or for worse.  No one else in the top seven has any World Cup points in slalom this year. Italy’s Federica Brignone, who’s eighth, has a handful but would not be expected to make up 0.13 seconds on Shiffrin. The biggest threats to Shiffrin are Switzerland’s Wendy Holdener, who’s 0.43 seconds behind the American and stands third in the World Cup slalom standings, and defending champion Michelle Gisin, who’s another 0.01 back and is seventh in World Cup slalom this season. The slalom starts at 1 a.m. Eastern time, right when the USA-Canada gold medal women’s hockey game will be in full swing. Other games are just for seeding, and Team GB has a firm grasp of the top seed with a 5-2 lead over Canada. Their only loss? USA.  Sweden, also with just one loss, is up 8-7 in a barnburner with an already-eliminated Swiss team.And they have not yet crossed it here, either, as Mikkel den Krause makes another mistake that would agitate a typical above-average club curler, taking out a US rock but rolling far enough from the center to give the US another steal. It’s 7-3 USA after eight ends, and John Shuster has the semifinals in sight. Team GB will be represented by Zoe Atkin with an impressive fourth-place run. The last spot goes to Germany’s Sabrina Cakmakli. Aside from Sildaru, Atkin and Cakmakli, the final 12 comes from three countries. Kexin Zhang busted out a 1080 to move up from 10th to fifth in her second run, joining Chinese teammates Gu and Li Fanghui in the final. Canada has Karker, Cassie Sharpe and Amy Fraser. For the USA, it’s Brita Sigourney, Hanna Faulhaber and Carly Margulies, clumped together from eighth to 10th. Now it’s up to Devin Logan, who goes big on the first trick but barely lands it. Her tail hits before the rest of her, and it’s a nice bit of athleticism to hang on. But that’s not going to impress the judges. She’s out. Margulies is in, and NBC informs us that she has not competed in two years due to injuries. Not a bad comeback.Not much has changed on the bubble, which has a lot of Americans. Hanna Faulhaber is ninth and has almost clinched a spot. Carly Margulies is 10th. Devin Logan is one spot outside the top 12 and will have a pressure-packed final run. Faulhaber has already done both runs. Margulies is up now.Ledecka competes almost exclusively in downhill and super-G when she does Alpine skiing rather than snowboarding. She shouldn’t be a factor in the slalom unless favorites like Shiffrin miss gates.But her downhill run is a little ragged. She’s 0.99 seconds behind Ledecka and just fourth out of the eight pre-Shiffrin skiers. Second place -- the USA’s Keely Cashman.Mikaela Shiffrin starts ninth. Another five minutes or so. On her second hit, she flies 12 12 feet out of the pipe. She does the same tricks as in her first run except for some slight changes near the bottom. That’s an 84.50. Should be fine. A bit earlier, Kelly Sildaru opted out of her second run, thinking her 87.50 will be enough to qualify. Safe bet.95.50. Off the charts. Before that, the USA’s Hanna Faulhaber didn’t improve her score, once again getting tremendous amplitude but having some sketchy landings. After that, Britain’s Zoe Atkin improved slightly to 86.75. She’ll be in the final.This is where Mikaela Shiffrin should shine. She’s the slalom GOAT and is good enough in downhill. She took silver in this event in 2018 and won the 2021 world championship.Eileen Gu has the top score with a 93.75, and there’s no way 12 people will top that. It’s unlikely more than two people have a shot at it. Canada’s Rachael Karker and Estonia’s Kelly Sildaru are similarly safe. Likely safe: Canada’s Cassie Sharpe and Team GB’s Zoe Atkin. Three Americans -- Hanna Faulhaber, Brita Sigourney and Carly Margulies -- are clustered at seventh through ninth and might need better runs to feel safe. Devin Logan is 13th, so she definitely needs better.Denmark’s Mikkel den Krause needs to draw close to the button to get a single point. If he misses by a couple of feet, he gives up a steal of one. He missed by a lot. In archery terms, his shot missed the target entirely and went somewhere into a neighboring realm. Anyway, the US men just need to beat last-place Denmark to reach the semifinals. They gave up a steal in the second end to trail 2-0. They did get two back in the third, though.Next -- Britain’s Zoe Atkin, one of many US-based Winter Olympians who competes for another country, has a nice array of spins for an 85.25. The parade of high scores comes to a screeching halt with China’s Wu Meng. She crashed, so her score was obviously kind of low. This isn’t figure skating.There are six judges for this event, and the highest and lowest scores are dropped. Ironically, the US judge was responsible for the “lowest” score for Gu, though it was a 93. Remarkable consensus here. Canada’s Rachael Karker goes for more spins than height, landing back-to-back 900s. Speaking of USA-Canada, stay up late with me (East Coasters, that is) to keep up with one of the most anticipated events of these Games -- USA-Canada women’s hockey, for the gold this time.

Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireIreland is set for further battering from high winds, flooding, stormy seas and snow, according to the Government’s crisis management team.The team, which has been monitoring recent storms and issuing weather warnings, said members of the public should not take any risks during Storm Eunice which arrives on Friday morning.While a brief respite is expected on Thursday, the national weather forecaster said conditions on Friday would be “challenging” , with heavy snow expected in the north and northwest of the country, and high winds across western and southern counties.ESB Networks said “a few thousand homes” lost power during heavy rain and high winds on Wednesday. The homes that lost electricity were mostly in the midlands and northwest, with the ESB saying Tullamore, Co Offaly, was particularly affected by loss of power to about 1,600 people.But with the status yellow wind warning associated with Storm Dudley due to expire at 11.30pm on Wednesday, Met Éireann said it expected conditions on Thursday to be more mild, with even a chance of sunny spells.A yellow wind warning for Northern Ireland was due to expire at 6am on Thursday, according to the UK Met Office.However, Thursday’s respite is expected to be short-lived. Heavy showers, cloud, rain and strengthening winds are expected on Thursday night ahead of the arrival of Storm Eunice.Met Éireann said a status orange wind warning remains in place for counties Galway, Clare, Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Waterford and Wexford as Storm Eunice tracks across the country from 5am to 11am on Friday .Storm Eunice also brings a status yellow wind, rain and snow warning for the entire country for Friday, coming into effect at 1am and lasting until 3pm. The worst of the snow and sleet is expected in the northern half of the country, while the high winds are expected in the south.In addition a status orange gale and storm force warning for all Irish coastal waters and the Irish Sea will come into effect from midnight on Friday, until 9pm Friday evening.Met Éireann hydrometeorologist Jennifer Canavan said Ireland was “in a period of high tides at the moment and this in combination with strong winds and stormy conditions means there is a high risk of large coastal waves and coastal flooding on Friday, especially along southern and eastern coasts.“As such we’re urging people to take extreme care near coastal areas and paths.”A status yellow marine gale warning is in place for all coasts of Ireland and on the Irish Sea until noon on Thursday, with winds expected to reach gale force 8 or strong gale force 9.Met Éireann meteorologist Matthew Martin said Storm Eunice was expected to bring further challenging conditions, “as strong winds, heavy rain and snow moves across the country”.“At the moment it looks like northern and western areas are most likely to see the heaviest snow falls, with southern areas expected to see the strongest winds, however we’re still a few days ahead and the details of when and where are likely to change,” he said. “With this in mind, we’re urging people to keep a very close eye on the forecast and warnings for their area as these may change in the coming days.”The Government’s crisis management team is monitoring the situation, and further weather updates will be issued on Thursday morning.In a statement on Wednesday evening the crisis team said that only necessary travel should be undertaken during periods of orange weather warnings.Around the country precautionary measures were being taken in case of flooding. Waterford City and County Council has said flood barriers for the City and Passage may be deployed on Thursday afternoon and the situation is being actively monitored.The Road Safety Authority has appealed to road users to exercise caution over the coming days.Meanwhile, Gas Networks Ireland said it does not anticipate any disruption to gas supplies during this week’s forecasted storms.Five-day nationwide forecasts, weather warnings and rainfall maps "},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 government expects nphet to recommend mask wearing be voluntary","story":"Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan is expected to write to Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly  following the first meeting of Nphet since January. Photograph: Colin KeeganCollinsThe Government expects that most mask-wearing, including in schools, will become voluntary after the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) meets on Thursday to review the Irish Covid-19 situation. Taoiseach Micheál Martin last night signalled the move as he told the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party about a meeting with chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan. Mr Martin is said to have delivered an optimistic assessment of the current Covid-19 situation. He said there would need to be a continued focus on vaccination as almost 800,000 people who had the disease recently are set to become eligible for booster shots next month.Dr Holohan is expected to write to Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly with his assessment following Nphet’s first meeting since January.Nphet is expected to say the progress of Covid-19 since then has been in line with projections and that the harm caused by the disease has further reduced. While the number of daily infections remains high compared to previous waves, officials are likely to note the declining numbers needing hospital and intensive care treatment.A further 108 deaths related to Covid-19 were reported in the last week, bringing the total to 6,399 since the start of the pandemic. An additional 5,268 PCR-test confirmed cases were reported yesterday, with 4,613 positive antigen tests registered on the HSE’s online portal. Some 631 patients were being treated in hospital for Covid-19 on Wednesday, down four in 24 hours, including 62 people in intensive care units, a decrease of one. Public transportWhile the remaining restrictions are not due to expire until the end of this month, there is optimism in Government that Nphet may recommend the end of mandatory mask wearing in most environments, though they may still be required in healthcare settings and on public transport.Senior Government sources said they expected the requirement to wear masks in schools could be ended from next week, but that they would await Nphet’s advice. The Government is likely to recommend that people continue to wear masks in situations where they perceive a risk of Covid-19 infection. Mr Martin has said that he would favour moving to a voluntary regime as the pandemic recedes. However, there is some concern at the relatively low rate of take-up of the vaccine among five to 11 year-olds, which is at 28 per cent.Teaching unions and school managers say they would prefer a gradual relaxation of the Covid-19 rules. Minister for Education Norma Foley yesterday said public health advice had served schools well during the pandemic and that whatever changes are recommended would be implemented in the education system. She said she anticipated that advice around hand hygiene, the need for symptomatic staff or pupils to stay at home and enhanced cleaning would likely remain.AbsencesStaff representatives say the volume of Covid-19 in schools remains a challenge and is resulting in high levels of pupil and teacher absences.The Irish National Teachers’ Organisation (INTO) called for a “pragmatic and cautious” approach to any changes to school mitigation measures.The Teachers’ Union of Ireland (TUI) said a sudden relaxation could disrupt preparations for the Junior Cycle and Leaving Cert exams. “If we stop everything all of a sudden, there is a risk that we’ll have lots of students and teachers missing,” said TUI general secretary Michael Gillespie.The two main school principals’ representative groups said they would be guided by whatever public health measures are announced. Some inidual principals said they looked forward to a full resumption of school activities such as concerts, plays, choirs and in-person parent-teacher meetings. Meanwhile, all children aged five to 11 in Northern Ireland are to be offered Covid-19 vaccines following advice from the UK’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. They will be offered two paediatric doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, with an interval of at least 12 weeks between them. Five further deaths of people who previously tested positive for Covid-19 were reported in the North on Wednesday, along with another 2,889 cases. There were 474 Covid-19 patients in hospitals including 12 in intensive care.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"church keen to secure value of its lands for future sale","story":"The intervention by the archdiocese can be seen an effort to preserve the potential value of church lands that might later be sold for housing.  Photograph: Alan BetsonA move by Dublin City Council to change land zoning rules in its mammoth new development plan prompted a planning submission from the Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin.At a basic level, the argument turns on a narrow technical question: what exactly can be built on church land? But the issues are bigger than that.The move casts light on profound change in society that has left the Catholic Church with a diminished role and raises questions about its property holdings.In a booming property market, the intervention by the archdiocese can also be seen an effort to preserve the potential value of church lands that might later be sold for housing as congregations decline.It comes with housing pressures ever-present on the political agenda and a deepening sense of crisis in the city’s property market, which has left many young people wondering whether they will ever be able to buy their own home.The council’s 2022-2028 draft development plan will set the legal parameters for building in the city for the rest of the decade. It will have big implications for all property owners of scale in the city, including the church, which has major holdings throughout Dublin and, indeed, the rest of the State.Dozens of archdiocese church sites have the zoning category Z15, which has the basic objective of protecting and providing for community uses and social infrastructure. Noting in the draft plan that Z15 lands have “come under increased pressure for residential development”, the council has proposed fresh curbs on any developments on such properties.‘Key objective’“Protecting and facilitating the ongoing use of these lands for community and social infrastructure is a key objective of the council. The council are committed to strengthening the role of Z15 lands and will actively discourage the piecemeal erosion and fragmentation of such lands,” the draft plan says.“Limited residentialoffice development on Z15 lands will only be allowed in highly exceptional circumstances where it can be demonstrated by the institutional landowner that the proposed development is required in order to maintain or enhance the functionoperational viability of the primary institution on the lands.”The draft goes on to say that the cessation of an existing social or community use on a site or a “change in land ownership” does not extinguish or negate the function of such lands for community and social infrastructure use.No matter what the long-term plan is for particular church lands, it is clear that such measures would erode the potential sale value of such property if the church ever wanted to sell.The archdiocese insists it has no proposals for any change of use on any church site apart from previously disclosed plans for property at Finglas West. But the central thrust of its submission to the council marks a robust claim to alter the zoning on dozens of properties and, thereby, to enhance their value.Legal opinionCompiled by Brock McClure planning consultants, and backed up with a forceful legal opinion from solicitors Mason Hayes \u0026amp Curran, the church’s 130-page submission is one of almost 1,350 published on the council’s website.The archdiocese identifies each of 33 church sites with Z15 zoning and seeks to change the zoning to Z12, whose objective is to “ensure existing environmental amenities are protected in the predominantly residential future use of these lands”.The reason it cites for seeking the change is the interests of the proper planning and sustainable development of the area “and the provision of residential accommodation” on appropriately located sites.Brock McClure wrote: “Our client is confident that a Z12 zoning, as set out in the Draft Plan, will allow them to protect their current pastoral, community, educational and religious requirements and obligations, whilst, in some instances, allowing them to achieve their objective regarding the delivery of social and affordable housing.”The submission says the church concurs that the Z12 “narrative” applies, in that “these are lands, the majority of which are or which have been institutional use, which may be developed for other uses in the future”.This may well be a long-term play by the archdiocese. But the submission strives for freedom of manoeuvre when it comes to the future of its lands.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"dublin archdiocese urges rezoning church sites to allow homebuilding","story":"The properties listed in the submission from the archdiocese include Our Lady of Good Council Church in Drimnagh. Photograph: Courtesy Mourne Road Parish The Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin has urged Dublin City Council to assign dozens of church sites in the city a zoning that would allow homes be built on them. The archdiocese insists there are no current proposals to change the use of any churches other than previously published plans for lands at Finglas West. But a legal planning submission makes it clear that the church wants to retain freedom of manoeuvre to develop housing on some sites in the future. The properties listed in a 130-page submission from the archdiocese include 33 churches in areas such as Artane, Ballymun, Beaumont, Cabra, Griffith Avenue, Drimnagh, Navan Road, Raheny, Walkinstown, Terenure, Harrington Street, Church Street and James’ Street. The council has said it wants to tighten the zoning rules governing such sites to preclude any housing or office developments in all but “highly exceptional” circumstances. A paper produced for the church by planning consultants Brock McClure says the zoning should be altered because the council’s move “unfairly inhibits any development options our clients wish to pursue, should the timing be right to rationalise some of the uses at certain locations”.“Many of the subject sites are located in disadvantaged areas where the delivery of housing is taking priority over additional institutional land uses,” they said, adding that it was “difficult” to provide details on short, medium, and long-term intentions of the Dublin diocese with respect to its sites.“However, it is clear that certain uses will, in the short and medium term, be no longer required, and certain buildings will no longer be fit for purpose. When this is juxtaposed against an express objective and desire by the Dublin diocese to assist in the provision of social and affordable housing across the city, a barrier to achieving this is potentially formulated in the context of the city development plan.”Íde Finnegan, the archdiocese’s head of operations, said the request to change the zoning did not mean that the church was working on plans to build housing on the sites. “There are no plans for any change of use, other than Finglas West,” she said in response to questions. Referring to the sites listed in the submission, Ms Finnegan said all were included because they had the zoning that was subject to the restrictions proposed by the council. “There are no particular plans in respect of any of those sites.” Church-owned schoolsThe archdiocese also listed numerous church-owned schools in Dublin, saying the submission was “applicable to these also” and asked the council to consider an “alternative zoning” across the sites. “These sites don’t have any long-term capacity issues, and don’t envisage a need for expansion of same in the long term. They are also not on any Department of Education Schools programme lists.”Asked about the inclusion of schools, Ms Finnegan said the statement that there were no particular plans “applies to the schools as well”.The archdiocese submitted a legal opinion by solicitors Mason Hayes \u0026amp Curran saying a proposed zoning change was an unlawful interference in religious and property rights because it would prevent housing being developed.“Overall, the changes will make it significantly more difficult to obtain planning permission for residential development,” said the lawyers. “There are many reasons why our client may need to obtain planning permission for residential uses on its land, and these proposed changes will make it very difficult to achieve. As such they are particularly discriminatory against our client, and will only serve to hinder the religious institutions they intended to protect. “For the reasons set out in this letter, the proposed changes are unlawful insofar as they affect religious institutions such as our client.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord the seanad where bilateral relationships begin","story":"Seanad Cathaoirleach Mark Daly is set to ‘begin hauling in the ambassadors at a terrific rate so they can witness him in the flesh conveying his best wishes to their respective countries on their national day’. Photograph: Tom Honan The Lithuanian ambassador was in the Seanad on Wednesday morning, much to the delight of the Cathaoirleach, who had been reduced to sending virtual greetings from the Upper House to their excellencies because of the Covid restrictions. Now that business has returned to normal, senators expect Mark Daly will begin hauling in the ambassadors at a terrific rate so they can witness him in the flesh conveying his best wishes to their respective countries on their national day. Cathaoirleach Daly has made it a feature of his tenure in the chair to mark these days, particularly when there might be an interparliamentary friendship group and possible bilateral visits in the mix. Ambassador Marijus Gudynas rose magnificently to the occasion by wearing a dickie bow in the colours of the Lithuanian flag during his brief visit to the distinguished visitors’ gallery, from where he was able to view the Seanad in all its underpopulated glory while Mark waxed lyrical above in the chair.The two countries have a close and friendly relationship, noted the Cathaoirleach, and last year 27 members of the newly-elected Lithuanian parliament (about 20 per cent of the total membership) formed the Group for Inter-Parliamentary Relations with Ireland. “We look forward to deepening the interparliamentary relationship with Lithuania and I wish the ambassador, all our friends in Lithuania and all Lithuanians, including those living in Ireland, and the Irish people living in Lithuania a very happy and safe Independence Day.”Senator Daly, of course, was building up to his trademark party piece in which he salutes the country in question in its native tongue. “Su laisvës diena, Lietuva!” he beamed, thrilled with himself. There were words of warm welcome from many senators as they spoke on the order of business, but none to top the contribution from Fianna Fáil’s Denis O’Donovan from west Cork, himself a former cathaoirleach. “I join in the welcome to the Lithuanian ambassador. I had the pleasure in my previous life as cathaoirleach to visit your country and I had, eh, an exceptionally good time there,” said Denis, placing particular emphasis on the “exceptionally” bit. “I won’t go into details, ambassador.” “The Cathaoirleach mentioned the Lithuanian community in Ireland,” he began. “And interestingly, I eat a lot of fish.” His excellency must have been wondering where this was going. We all were.“And the man who looks after my fish is a Lithuanian man – lovely man. And if I have a problem I ring him and he makes sure he has fresh cod, hake, or whatever is on the menu. The only thing I would say is that even though he is a Lithuanian fishmonger, the fish are Irish.”Independent senator Rónán Mullen welcomed the ambassador and commended his country for establishing an embassy in Taiwan. “Many of us support Lithuania in its dealings with China. It has set an example for other small countries,” he told his excellency. “As we say around here, ‘keep her lit’.”No doubt ambassador Gudynas enjoyed his short trip to Leinster House. Now everyone is wondering what country Cathaoirleach Daly will chose to honour next. New ambassadorsAs he was doing his thing in Kildare Street, fresh diplomatic meat was wandering into his orbit across the city in the Phoenix Park, where three new ambassadors presented their credentials to President Michael D Higgins at a ceremony in Áras an Uachtaráin. His excellency Sturla Sigurjónsson (Iceland), his excellency Gen Geraldo Sachipengo Nunda (Angola) and her excellency Saroja Sirisena (Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka) were received with the usual pomp and ceremony.Unfortunately, Mark has just missed Sri Lanka’s national day, which was at the start of this month, and he’ll have to wait until November if he wants to welcome Gen Geraldo. But Iceland has its day in June, albeit on a Friday.However, he might get a few pointers from Michael D’s event to liven up future little ceremonies in the Seanad. The three ambassadors were given a motorcycle escort to and from the Áras by a cavalry squadron detachment from Cathal Brugha barracks. There was a flag ceremony and an infantry battalion from Galway’s Renmore barracks provided a guard of honour. The Army No. I Band tootled away. Obviously, the Cathaoirleach would do away with the sizeable contingent of officials which attended from the Department of Foreign Affairs, including new secretary general Joe Hackett. Although an exception could probably be made in Gen Sec Joe’s case should there be a few bottles of prosecco left over in Iveagh House following Champagne-gate. Nor would there be any need for a Government Minister to adorn the Seanad’s souped-up national-day greetings gig (Minister of State Hildegard Naughton was on duty at the Áras). But maybe Daly could turn his episodic national-day gigs into a major pillar of the Seanad’s centenary programme, which kicked off on Tuesday. Michelin-star restaurantPerhaps ambassadors invited in for their national day could then be taken for lunch in a Michelin-star restaurant. Barry Ward, Fine Gael senator for South Dublin on Sea, was so pleased to see Liath in Blackrock bagging a second star that he had to convey his congratulations. Lawyer Barry knows his onions. “Obviously there’s a very small number of restaurants in this country that are operating at that level – only four, in fact, three of which are in Dublin but Liath is in the suburbs of Dublin, in Blackrock. It is, on the face of it, a modest restaurant, certainly a small one with, I think, about 20 covers but it operates at a level of excellence that is remarkable.”It’s all go in South Dublin sur Mer: “And as we see, Michael’s of Dublin moving to Blackrock. I hope it will be at the core of a foodie destination in Blackrock, the likes of which we have in Monkstown and other places in the Dún Laoghaire area.” Barry was using the royal “we” there. “Minority Voices, Major Change” is the title of the centenary programme launched on Tuesday to commemorate 100 years of the Seanad. Those senators who didn’t get the chance the previous day took the opportunity on Wednesday to declare how wonderful the launch of the Seanad 100 celebration had been. Joining in the congratulations was Fine Gael’s Seanad leader, Seán Kyne. “It was wonderfully choreographed and introduced,” he said, praising the Oireachtas team who worked so hard to put it together. “It was a wonderful start to a year of engagement and recognition of the role of the Seanad in this State,” said the former minister of state and TD for Galway West who lost his Dáil seat at the last election but found a berth in the Upper House.Fair enough.

The great French mathematician Henri Poincaré, a brilliant expositor of the scientific method, described how he grappled for months with an arcane problem in function theory. Exasperated by lack of progress, he went on holidays and forgot about the problem. But, as he was boarding a bus, the answer came to him in a flash. He was later able to return to his office and complete a proof of the result.This is characteristic of the sudden spurts of progress that often occur. New mathematical ideas do not arise according to some pre-determined plan they seem to pop up in random fashion, but this invariably happens following sustained efforts and deep thought, which lay the groundwork for discovery.Some mathematicians keep regular and limited working hours. The renowned English mathematician GH Hardy began his research after breakfast each day, working until 1pm. Then he would have lunch and head for the cricket ground. But, of course, progress was not confined to the four morning hours. The intense conscious mental effort triggered unconscious activity, with sudden insights breaking through at any time, day or night.Where do the ideas come from?Ideas come from a multitude of sources, but the researcher needs time to think about them, follow up hunches and explore various options. No holds are barred at this stage and intuition is given free rein. A mathematician may have a feeling that a certain result is valid but cannot prove it. Intuition is a valuable guide, but it can also mislead us to believe what appears obvious but is false. For this reason, mathematicians insist on a cast-iron proof, understandable to their colleagues and removing all doubt. A result does not become a theorem until the conditions for its validity are established and it is shown to follow logically from these conditions. In the past, most research was done by mathematicians working alone. They might maintain contact with colleagues and attend meetings and conferences, but published papers usually had a single author. This is no longer the case: today, most papers have two or more authors and collaborative work is the norm. Where does it all happen?The conventional notion is that research is carried out at an office desk or in a library. A mathematical idea may arise at a meeting, a seminar, or a conference. There are also research centres dedicated to mathematics: INI in Cambridge, IHP in Paris, MFO in Oberwolfach, IMA in Minnesota and many more, where mathematicians gather for a week or two to work together.Walking provides a great opportunity for thinking and many researchers have written about how their best ideas came to them during a ramble. René Descartes did his mathematical thinking while still in bed in the morning. The Indian genius Srinivasa Ramanujan was inspired by Mahalakshmi of Namakkal, a family Goddess when, as he slept, complex mathematical results unfolded before his eyes. American topologist Stephen Smale used to do his research on the beach in Rio de Janeiro, and André Weil proved one of his most famous results, the Riemann hypothesis for curves over finite fields, while in prison. Other likely places for inspiration are on a train or plane, in a café or church, at a concert or in dreamland.

A sailor with no facial features. A courtier with one red leg and one white.Nightmarish as these tableaux might sound, they derive not from a horror film but from the Bayeux Tapestry. Long regarded as one of the most important records of English history, the tapestry turns out to be riddled with errors.And these errors go beyond the famously ambiguous death of King Harold, who might be the soldier struck in the eye by an arrow, but who might also be the inidual slashed by a cavalryman’s sword and trampled underfoot.Mia Hansson, an amateur embroiderer from Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, is six years into her project of making a full-size replica of the tapestry. The original, of course, is 230ft in length and tells the story of the Norman conquest of England, culminating in the Battle of Hastings and – spoiler alert – the victory of William the Conqueror.Thought to date to the 11th century, the tapestry has previously been hailed as “one of the supreme achievements of the Norman Romanesque” by Sylvette Lemagnen, author of the 2005 book La Tapisserie de Bayeux. Its status assured, Lemagnen says, by its “exceptional length, the harmony and freshness of its colours, its exquisite workmanship, and the genius of its guiding spirit.”Perhaps it is time to dock a few marks from this mainstay of British history teaching. Over the six years in which she has been painstakingly copying the tapestry, Ms Hansson has identified at least 15 mistakes in the original.They begin with the sailor, who has a rope running across the void where his face should be. They continue with a mounted soldier whose chainmail is rounded in the portion above his waist and square beneath it – a discrepancy that Ms Hansson ascribes to the tapestry being embroidered by two people at once. The errors continue with the men carrying the coffin of Edward the Confessor – look closely and you will see that there aren’t enough legs to go round.Given that Ms Hansson still has roughly another six years’ worth of work to go, we can safely forecast that more errors will emerge.But she is not amending them, despite her professional instinct – Ms Hansson, 47, is a trained primary school teacher – to correct. She is reproducing the tapestry, she says, “as faithfully as I can, because they did an enormous job. This is a masterpiece, this embroidery, and who am I to come and correct what they’ve done? I’m trying to honour it, warts and all.”That said, the errors can be frustrating. “This is going to turn my hair grey,” she said. “I’m working on a piece now where the back leg of a horse is just simply wrong.“There’s everything wrong about it and I have to copy that and it’s doing my head in.”Ms Hansson has also turned the tapestry into a colouring book. She will display the unfinished replica tapestry at St Peter’s Church Hall in Wisbech on April 12.More from NewsStorm Eunice: Power cuts and travel chaos as strong winds batter BritainCovid vaccine for children: Who is eligible and what are the side effects?Storm Eunice: ‘Stay indoors’ alert as 100mph gusts set to cause chaosEden Project creator Sir Tim Smit criticises Cornish people in expletive-laden rantInside the Oak Room at Windsor Castle, as the Queen returns to action after Covid scareMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"eden project creator sir tim smit criticises cornish people","story":"As the creator of the Eden Project, Sir Tim Smit has had a transformative effect on Cornwall, bringing worldwide attention, jobs and a much-needed economic boost.But no good turn goes unpunished, it seems, particularly in a county where outsiders like Dutch-born Sir Tim are insultingly labelled “grockles” by some natives.For 20 years, Sir Tim has bitten his tongue as critics have railed against change, but he has finally let rip with an extraordinary takedown of locals who obsess about their “mums’ pasties” and romanticise “good old days” that never existed.In an expletive-laden rant, Sir Tim, who grew up in Sussex, accused Cornish people of defining their lives “in terms of what you don’t like” and of attacking entrepreneurs like Rick Stein who had helped rejuvenate their county.He told The Reason Why podcast: “One of the problems in Cornwall is, if you say anything – if you’re not Cornish – and you say anything about it, they say you’re an arrogant so-and-so speaking for the Cornish.“You feel, and I don’t, but you feel like saying ‘well if you were a bit more f- - -ing articulate you could speak up for yourself but you haven’t’.“You’ve all got mums who made the best pasties in the world and it’s fantastic and it’s fabulous, and you talk about the good old days, and the good old days never were the good old days.“They’ve been bad for about 70 years – and they’ve been bad because of t- - - - - s like you.”Sir Tim, 67, opened the Eden Project in 2000 after transforming an old clay pit near St Austell into a unique world of interlinking domes housing exotic plants from around the world. It attracts more than a million visitors each year and is reported to have contributed more than £1billion to the Cornish economy.Not everyone has welcomed the influx of visitors and cash, but Sir Tim said it was time they came up with their own ideas for taking the county forward rather than simply directing anger at those who are doing it for them.“His foundation was the fishermen of Padstow and him being a chef of fish.“He is personally quite anxious about being seen as a spokesman for Cornwall because he knows you get bricks thrown at you for saying you speak for anybody here.”Malcolm Bell, chief executive of the tourism body Visit Cornwall, said: “I suppose my reaction is I am a bit offended. The Cornish people are wonderfully warm and welcoming. It is regrettable because we are a community, we are a proud community. We know there are some strong views that most of us maybe don’t agree with and it does polarise people.“My view very simply is if you can’t say anything nice, don’t say anything at all.”On Wednesday, Sir Tim apologised for the comments. In a statement, he said: “I’m sorry that some of the comments I made in the podcast have caused offence. “I hope that when people listen to the whole piece they will realise that I was speaking in the context of defending my friend Rick Stein and my strongest words were directed at people who seek to damn him for making Cornwall attractive to outsiders.“I wasn’t intending to comment on Cornish people as a whole, rather some of those who would tell you that the past was better than now when the truth is different it was not.“Cornwall has been my home for more than 30 years and I don’t want  a few harsh words on my part to damage the many friendships I’ve made in a place I love.  “My comments in the round are extremely pro-Cornwall and the rightness of anger at the neglect of this special place  - and an encouragement not to attack the wrong targets.”The podcast was hosted by Cornish actor and musician Seamus Carer, who said: “I’ve tried to make a balanced, nuanced piece of journalism about Cornwall, from the point of view of someone who grew up and still lives here. With that in mind, I’m extremely grateful to Tim for giving me his time and opinions.“I’m a big fan of empathy, so can see where Tim’s coming from whilst also understanding the anger that some listeners have voiced. It’s good to remember that Tim’s made big things happen in Cornwall, which many people have benefited from. He’s a canny businessman, with a confident style. He’s always been very supportive of my work and is a family friend.“However, I’m aware that some people feel distrust and animosity towards him, hence why he was such an important figure to interview. The overall aim of the podcast was to look at issues in contemporary Cornwall and to try to understand both sides of the argument. There’s no simple answer to any of it, but having dialogue and listening is certainly a good start. That’s all I tried to do.”More from NewsStorm Eunice: Power cuts and travel chaos as strong winds batter BritainCovid vaccine for children: Who is eligible and what are the side effects?Storm Eunice: ‘Stay indoors’ alert as 100mph gusts set to cause chaosInside the Oak Room at Windsor Castle, as the Queen returns to action after Covid scareRussia must pull back, or there will be trouble in the pipelineMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"hms queen elizabeth inside aircraft carrier royal navy flagship","story":"The yellow-helmeted flight deck officer leans into a 40-knot wind and raises a small green flag in his right hand. I crouch behind him, clutching my robust but battered high-def camera. A few feet away, a snarling F-35B Lightning Stealth Fighter, sleek as a shark and every bit as lethal, prepares to launch into the steel-grey skies of the eastern Mediterranean.On the bridge, the navigators steer directly into the wind. ‘Steady on designated flying course, one-one-zero,’ says the officer of the watch.  ‘Steady on one-one-zero, sir,’ confirms the helmsman.The F-35B needs plenty of headwind to get airborne. The aircraft has a run-up of only 350 feet to the curved ‘ski-jump’, from which it will make its final leap skywards. Inside the glass-encased flight control tower behind us, the vessel’s Commander Air, Ed Phillips, aka ‘Wings’, looks up and down the massive flight deck and, when satisfied all is clear, gives a short sharp order:All eyes turn to the green flag held aloft and rippling in the wind. Probably worth no more than a couple of quid, it is brought down to the ground with a dramatic flourish the signal for the F-35B, worth well over £100 million, to get airborne.I brace myself for the immense power about to be unleashed. I’ve witnessed this many times and know what to expect. It’ll be exhilarating, for sure, but also terrifying and probably painful. I’m determined to capture on film a spectacular close-up of a launch as near to the aircraft as possible, but the timing is critical and so far I’ve manifestly failed to pull it off.The searing blast from the rear jet nozzle has always blown me off my feet and sent me sprawling. I have the bruises and cuts to show for it and God knows how much skin I’ve now invested in the roughened, diamond-hard surface of the flight deck. But I still don’t have the footage I want. This time, two hefty sailors are ready to hold me down, or at least try to. My fear is that no amount of muscle power will be a match for the explosive thrust of what is essentially a horizontal rocket.The pilot releases the brakes and opens the throttle. The Pratt \u0026amp Whitney afterburning, turbofan engine raises its pitch to a terrifying scream as the aircraft surges forward. I clench my teeth, tense my muscles and, with my heart pounding in my ears, bear hug the camera in a semi-stable position. But how long can I hold on? Four vice-like hands press down on my hunched shoulders.It’s June 2021 and I’ve joined the ship’s company of HMS Queen Elizabeth for her first operational deployment. We are some weeks into a seven-month voyage to the South China Sea, not on exercise but, locked, loaded and ready for action, should it become necessary.The new carrier and fleet flagship, together with eight escorts (destroyers, frigates, supply ships and a submarine) comprise Carrier Strike Group 21 (CSG21) – the most powerful naval force to leave the UK in a generation. Prior to our transit through the Suez Canal and the Red Sea, on our way to the Pacific and the disputed waters of the South China Sea, the ship has been launching waves of jets on Operation Shader – in support of land forces in the fight against Islamic State in Syria. But this has prompted a reaction from the Russians. They consider this part of the Med their own backyard and are intent on letting the QE and her escorts know they’re not welcome here. But the QE is the new dog on the block and she’s here to mark her own territory, not with a wag of the tail but a snarl.Today’s launch of the F-35s, therefore, is not to attack IS but to ward off Russian warplanes attempting to overfly us. Pilots, drawn from the Fleet Air Arm, RAF and US Marine Corps, have been scrambling all day, sometimes in rapid two-minute intervals, to intercept ‘red bandits’ and escort them away at a safe range.The Russians, apart from wanting to goad the Royal Navy, are desperate to get a closer look at the QE, the most advanced aircraft carrier in the world, and also test the Task Group’s reaction procedures – not only in the air but also on the surface, with their warships, and underwater with their submarines. The QE’s Anti-Submarine Warfare Merlin Mk2 helicopters from 820 Naval Air Squadron are on constant patrol in order to monitor subsurface incursions and react accordingly. Nobody has actually opened fire, but there’s a lot of posturing and tactical lip-curling. If this is the start of a new Cold War, nobody is in doubt that things could heat up very quickly. The QE’s magazines are bursting with bombs, bullets and missiles of all descriptions and capabilities, as you’d expect on a warship that is now Britain’s main conventional strategic deterrent.Commodore Steve Moorhouse, leading CSG21, knows that Britain’s potential adversaries, the Russians and Chinese, will prod and poke his Task Group at every opportunity. ‘They want to see what we’re made of,’ he freely admits. ‘And I’m happy to show them, but professionally, in a spirit of confidence, not confrontation.’ Moorhouse is a steely commander but also a diplomat by default. After all, HMS Queen Elizabeth, a chunk of British sovereign territory, is part warship, part floating embassy. As the embodiment of ‘Global Britain’, her charge is to deliver ‘power projection’ on behalf of the nation: on the one hand that means hard-edged, lethal warfare on the other it’s about soft, political persuasion through deterrence, as well as overt support for allies around the world.Friends and foes alike will be watching this deployment with keen interest and I’m here to capture it on film for a forthcoming BBC TV series. But this isn’t the first time I’ve filmed HMS Queen Elizabeth. That was back in 2009, when I witnessed Princess Anne cutting the ship’s first steel at Govan shipyard in Glasgow. This was not so much the birth of Britain’s biggest-ever warship – more like her conception – and I was struck by the enormity of the occasion.  Sir Jonathon Band, the First Sea Lord at the time, spoke with passion to the audience and assembled media. The Queen Elizabeth Class of aircraft carrier, comprising HMS Queen Elizabeth, with HMS Prince of Wales to follow, would, he explained, ‘provide Britain with the means to deliver air power from the sea, wherever and whenever required, and in a stronger and more decisive form than ever before’. They will also, he added, ‘be the centrepiece of Britain’s military capability for many years to come’.The construction of HMS Queen Elizabeth and her sister ship meant a complete reinvention of the Royal Navy but, despite Sir Jonathon’s upbeat messaging, it was to prove a painful and long-drawn-out process. Our active carriers at the time, Ark Royal, Illustrious and Invincible, were about to be axed in the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review and with them the Navy’s Harrier squadron – its entire naval fixed-wing capability. Already, naysayers and vocal critics were provoking a heated debate over the pros and cons of a carrier-centric Navy, and whether there’d be enough escort ships to protect the carriers while at sea or sufficient sailors to man them – each would be three times the size of the Invincible Class carriers.General Sir Peter Wall, former head of the British Army, described the decision to build the new carriers as no more than a ‘vanity project’ that ‘lacked credibility’ and which could be seen to have ‘skewed the UK’s conventional defence effort to a damaging degree’. Max Hastings, ever the provocateur, suggested the new warships represented delusions of grandeur for a Navy in decline. Other denigrators were quick to point out that a large carrier is a big target – especially for the new generation of hypersonic missiles that the Chinese call ‘carrier killers’.Russia inevitably chimed in with some of its own political trash talk: ‘Just make sure you keep your new carrier away from Moscow’s warships or they’ll send it to the bottom of the sea.’Military hardware is an emotive subject, especially in the context of huge capital expenditure that might otherwise be spent on housing, welfare or the NHS, but £6 billion for two vessels (albeit a near doubling of the original budget) is modest compared to the eye-watering price tag of USS Gerald R. Ford, an American super-carrier of similar proportions which cost more than $13 billion (and which, according to the Pentagon, ‘has yet to demonstrate it can effectively defend itself from anti-ship missiles and other threats’).The glossy brochure issued by a conglomerate of shipbuilders known as the Aircraft Carrier Alliance certainly suggested that Britain was getting its money’s worth. At 65,000 tonnes, HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales would not only be the biggest warships ever built for the Royal Navy, but also the most powerful and advanced in terms of military technology and stealth capabilities – especially when married eventually to the state-of-the-art F-35B Lightning jet fighter.The sales pitch for the super-carriers came with a staggering array of facts and figures. The ships, it claimed, would be so highly automated they’d require only ‘lean-manned’ crews – less than 1,000 per ship, without aircrew. That’s broadly one fifth the size of an American crew on a similar-sized ship. They’d each have a four-acre flight deck, the size of three and a half football fields, nine decks and a hangar big enough to fit two Type 23 frigates side by side. Each carrier would have two propellers weighing 33 tonnes – exerting the same thrust as 50 high-speed trains and producing a maximum speed in excess of 27 knots (31mph). The six engines (two mighty gas turbines and four diesels) would produce enough energy to power a city the size of Swindon the electrical cabling and wiring would stretch six times round the world the ship, weighing the same as 35,000 family cars, would carry enough fuel to take those cars to the moon and back a dozen times… and on it went.The statistics were mind-boggling, but one thing was for sure: the challenge of building the first of these ships – the nine-decked HMS Queen Elizabeth – manning her, taking her to sea and getting her battle-ready was going to be a compelling story, as I learnt while following her construction in seven shipyards around the UK, culminating in her final assembly at Rosyth in Fife, like some gargantuan Lego toy. But, engineering aside, I knew that her real story would reside in the sailors yet to arrive the men and women who would breathe life into the country’s first super-carrier.  Foremost among them was Jerry Kyd, the ship’s first seagoing captain. I encountered him on the day he arrived in Rosyth in May 2016, as he addressed a fledgling ship’s company of just 456 sailors standing in front of their ship, still an inert hulk without propellers and dead in the water.‘The world’s a frisky place at the moment,’ he said. ‘And we have to be ready to respond to threats which I think are coming sooner rather than later.’ Kyd glanced towards their future home, encased in scaffolding. ‘HMS Queen Elizabeth, as big and sophisticated as she might be, is really just a huge metal box, full of pipes, wires, gadgetry and computer terminals. She’s missing one vital ingredient…’ He paused dramatically. ‘Without the flesh, blood, muscle and hearts of you, my sailors, that ship is just a robot. You, not the ship, are the most important resource at my disposal.’It was nearly a year before the QE was ready for her first sea trials. As a ‘new build’, there were bound to be problems. On the eve of our departure for the North Sea, Captain Kyd warned that there would be emergencies: ‘We’ll have floods, we’ll have fires. And casualties too. That’s the nature of this business.’For the best part of two months the ship was put through her paces off the coast of Scotland, where I joined them. The first aircraft, a Merlin helicopter, was landed on the flight deck within four days as the ship’s company got used to their largely subterranean existence deep in the belly of the beast. I watched with amazement as the sailors, many of them straight out of training, transformed the massive grey hulk not only into a working warship but a home from home. The QE was fast becoming a vibrant floating city and, with 23 nations represented from across the Commonwealth, all human life was here. My first challenge, however, was to learn my way round a ship longer than the Houses of Parliament and taller than Nelson’s Column and so gigantic that it boasted five kilometres of passageways and 3,200 compartments.Apart from a serious issue with a cracked thrust block that held one of the drive shafts in place, all went as well as could be expected. As Jerry Kyd foretold, there were plenty of fires and floods as the ship was pushed to breaking point so that her technical and seagoing limits could be identified. There were ‘casualties’ too, but thankfully only minor ones – the worst being cracked teeth and broken fingers. Sea trials completed, we finally entered Portsmouth dockyard, the ship’s designated home port, and within months the QE was officially commissioned by the Queen.After a period of maintenance, the ship set off for the next vital stage of her trials off the eastern seaboard of the US. Within hours of leaving Portsmouth we became aware of an ominous presence – a Russian Federation frigate called Admiral Makarov had closed to within two miles of our position. A highly capable warship armed with Kalibr long-range cruise missiles, the Makarov was in transit from the Baltic to Sevastopol on the Black Sea. While officially permitted to route through the English Channel she had clearly erted her course to have a closer look at our ship.  A few days later, just before starting our transatlantic crossing, we were suddenly erted into the Irish Sea to help chase off a Russian submarine spotted in British territorial waters. There was an increasing concern, as there still is, that Russians could be sussing out British underwater power and communication cabling – an obvious target for a potential enemy.  The Russian sub made a run for it as soon as we got close. Even before the QE had become operational the writing was on the wall and it was written very clearly in Cyrillic script. A sign of things to come (and indeed I write this as the world tries to second-guess Russian designs on Ukraine).Following this brief ersion we progressed across the Atlantic and the next dramatic event I witnessed was the ship’s first-ever run ashore in a foreign port, which didn’t go entirely to plan. In Mayport, Florida, after a night of heavy drinking, four sailors from the QE and two from our escort frigate, HMS Monmouth, were arrested for a range of alcohol-related offences including jaywalking, fighting and resisting arrest. Despite making headlines on both sides of the Atlantic, the episode was soon forgotten and at least part of the blame was attached to overzealous policing.  Captain Kyd, a pragmatist, reckoned that a night in jail was punishment enough for sailors letting off steam. ‘The question we have to ask ourselves,’ Kyd told his commanders, ‘is what sort of sailor would we want to go to war with? The automaton who obeys every rule, plays it safe and never takes chances? Or the free spirit who pushes his luck and breaks the odd rule?’    Kyd quickly refocused on the job in hand – namely to see an F-35B Lightning jet land on the ship’s flight deck for the first time. Helicopters were one thing, but a fighter jet that lands vertically using immense downward thrust from its enormous engine was quite another. Commander Nathan Gray, the Navy’s top test pilot, was the first to attempt a landing. It went without a hitch, although many questions remained about safety margins before the flight deck and aircraft could be handed over to front-line combat pilots. Two months of continuous, painstaking testing in all weathers, including a full-blown hurricane, gradually provided the answers. Gray, despite a few near misses, was satisfied that he and his colleagues had done all they could to ready the ship and aircraft for action.  And so to the present. Here I am aboard the QE once again – no longer on sea trials, but busy arm-wrestling the Russians, and before long she’ll be playing cat-and-mouse with the Chinese in the South China Sea. This is the acid test, with much at stake. The Prime Minister has declared he wants the Royal Navy to be the most powerful and influential in Europe by the end of the decade. CSG21 is the first step to achieving that ambition and proving that the new aircraft carrier is no white elephant but an effective instrument of government as well as an iconic symbol of nation.  Great adventure beckons and, once again, all life is here – a much expanded ship’s company of 1,650 men and women. Yes, there are the aviators yes, there are the seafarers yes, there are the marine engineers. But there are so many others: stewards, chefs, medics, gunners, aircraft handlers, writers, warfare specialists, physical trainers and intelligence officers. There is even a specialist chocolatier and, maybe because of him, a dedicated dentist and dental hygienist.‘Bleeding frozen chips!’ shouts Ronnie Lambert, an Essex boy, born and bred. ‘They want 10 more boxes in the main galley and they’re all at the back of the frickin’ fridge.’‘Well, get in there and pull ’em out,’ laughs fellow storeman Aaron Mackin. ‘It’s yer bleedin’ job.’‘Well, I’m transferring to aviation! Them boys have it easy up there. All sunshine and sea.’    The F-35B, accelerating from a standing start, rattles my bones. The heavyset sailors push down hard on my prone body as I attempt to point the camera in the right direction. The sailors are now lying on top of me – the jet stream strikes and skittles us. I roll across the deck, trying to protect my camera. Did I capture the moment of take off? I will check as soon as I can. Lying on my back I look up to see five British F-35s close in on three Russian MiGs.There will be more Russian warplanes soon. They’ll keep coming, but at least we know one thing: we have chips to go with our fish tonight. Must be a Friday.More from NewsStorm Eunice: Power cuts and travel chaos as strong winds batter BritainCovid vaccine for children: Who is eligible and what are the side effects?Storm Eunice: ‘Stay indoors’ alert as 100mph gusts set to cause chaosEden Project creator Sir Tim Smit criticises Cornish people in expletive-laden rantInside the Oak Room at Windsor Castle, as the Queen returns to action after Covid scareMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"met launches cash for honours investigation prince charless","story":"Prince Charles has said he is willing to speak to detectives after Scotland Yard announced it had launched a criminal investigation into an alleged cash for honours scandal involving one of his closest confidants.The politan Police is examining claims that Michael Fawcett, his former right-hand man, had worked with fixers to secure a CBE for the Saudi billionaire Mahfouz Marei Mubarak bin Mahfouz, who had given more than £1.5 million to the Prince’s Foundation charity.The Prince of Wales, who presented Mr Mahfouz with the honorary title at a private ceremony at Buckingham Palace in 2016, has denied any knowledge of the alleged deal.Royal sources have said Prince Charles is willing to speak to police in order to help with the investigation.“There has been no request for help from the police so far, but if he is asked to help he will of course do so,” the source said. A Clarence House spokesman said: “The Prince of Wales had no knowledge of the alleged offer of honours or British citizenship on the basis of donation to his charities.”Scotland Yard confirmed it had launched a criminal investigation into the allegations, which first appeared in the media last year.The Prince\u0027s Foundation is an educational charity established in 1986 which brings together a number of projects and causes that Prince Charles is passionate about.The allegations centered around claims that Mr Mahfouz, who denies any wrongdoing, donated large sums to restoration projects of particular interest to Prince Charles.Mr Fawcett - who has been a close aide to the Prince for more than 40-years - resigned as the chief executive of the Prince’s Foundation charity in the wake of the allegations.Detectives liaised with the officials from the Prince’s Foundation after Norman Baker, the former Liberal Democrat MP, made a formal complaint to Scotland Yard.In December, the Prince’s Foundation published the findings of its own investigation into the allegations, which stated there was some evidence of communication between the CEO and fixers regarding honorary nominations for a donor between 2014-18.But the report stated it had found no evidence that the charity’s trustees were aware of this.The police investigation is being led by the Met\u0027s Special Enquiry Team, the same unit that is in charge of the Partygate investigation.A Scotland Yard spokesman said: The politan Police Service has launched an investigation into allegations of offences under the Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925.The decision follows an assessment of a September 2021 letter. This related to media reporting alleging offers of help were made to secure honours and citizenship for a Saudi national.The Special Enquiry Team has conducted the assessment process which has included contacting those believed to hold relevant information.Officers liaised with The Prince’s Foundation about the findings of an independent investigation into fundraising practices. The Foundation provided a number of relevant documents.These documents were reviewed alongside existing information. The assessment determined an investigation will commence. There have been no arrests or interviews under caution.A spokesperson for The Prince\u0027s Foundation said: It would be inappropriate to comment on an ongoing investigation.More from NewsStorm Eunice: Power cuts and travel chaos as strong winds batter BritainCovid vaccine for children: Who is eligible and what are the side effects?Storm Eunice: ‘Stay indoors’ alert as 100mph gusts set to cause chaosEden Project creator Sir Tim Smit criticises Cornish people in expletive-laden rantInside the Oak Room at Windsor Castle, as the Queen returns to action after Covid scareMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"moments see immense value nuclear deterrent","story":"Shortly after becoming prime minister, Theresa May was challenged (by the SNP, of course) on Trident and whether there were any circumstances in which she would press the nuclear button. She answered: “Yes.” And all hell broke loose. It was one thing for the independent nuclear deterrent to form the backbone of British and Nato defence policy, but quite another thing to actually state publicly that you would use it.May was right. What would be the point in possessing Trident at all if our political leaders stated publicly that it was only there for show, that in the case an enemy launched a first strike at us, we would defend ourselves with a few sturdy brollies and a whole dictionary of harsh language?Deterrence is about persuading the other side that in the event they chose to launch a nuclear attack at us or our allies, they should know that that would be the equivalent of signing their own, and their people’s, death warrant. That sounds harsh now that I’ve typed it, but there we are. Life is tough. And in a world in which nuclear weapons can’t be uninvented, it’s the best and only way of maintaining international peace.All of this sprang to mind when contemplating the current impasse on the border of Ukraine, where Russia may or may not perform an homage to Germany foreign policy in 1938. It’s arguably the most serious military dispute for the West since the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, and certainly the worst since the end of the Cold War. However it’s resolved, we should at least be thankful that so far, no one is considering turning this territorial dispute nuclear. But the only reason that is unlikely is because Nato countries ignored the siren voices of the Left over decades and steadfastly held onto, and upgraded, their nuclear arsenals.Can anyone be in any doubt that, had CND and their fellow travellers successfully persuaded Britain’s leaders to ditch Polaris, Cruise and Trident, the world would be there for the taking by the likes of Putin? I used to ask former constituents who imagined the world would be a safer place without nuclear weapons how such a utopia could emerge. After all, the only countries where peace movements are allowed to press their case are modern liberal democracies how safe would the planet be if America and her allies rid themselves of nuclear weapons, leaving Russia, China and North Korea still in possession of theirs?Yet this is a scenario that is, if not actually embraced by modern day “peace” campaigners, then ignored altogether. Buy the world a Coke and we won’t have to think about all this uncomfortable business about facts and reality.The reason Jeremy Corbyn never made a serious attempt to change Labour’s pro-Trident defence policy while he was party leader was because he didn’t need to. Once prime minister, he could virtue signal his intention never to use them in any circumstance, making them obsolete in a single, publicly broadcast sentence.There were many who, as communism crumbled, subscribed to Francis Fukuyama’s optimistic view of the End of History and his predictions that the global triumph of economic liberalism would ultimately make nuclear weapons redundant. Alas, we remain a long way from that destination. Those who blithely claim that “the world has never been more dangerous” are, I think, wrong. There were points during the Cold War when the world really was on the brink of nuclear Armageddon, and no realistic scenario today can compete with those blood-curdling moments in the 60s, 70s and 80s when the world held its breath.But Putin’s nationalistic designs on neighbouring countries, China’s similar claims on Taiwan and North Korea’s unhinged and borderline psychopathic leadership show that we are a very long way from the point at which the ploughshare industry can expect a boost.The same old naivety that once drove thousands of CND supporters through the streets of London is well replicated in the Twitter accounts of corporate organisations hoping to increase their profit margins by signalling their woke credentials to their younger audiences. “You cannot simultaneously prevent and prepare for war,” was the considered geopolitical and philosophical conclusion reached recently by the makers of Chocolate Fudge Brownie ice cream. Not only can you do both, but in this nuclear age there is no alternative to doing both. The absence of war – or at least the absence of nuclear war – since Hiroshima and Nagasaki is an inescapable and inconvenient fact. Peace has been established through a fear of retaliation, a fear of obliteration.This being earth, there are no comfortable assurances to reach about the military and political strategy of Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD): it may work indefinitely or it may not. But how can anyone doubt that the best way to bring about the apocalypse none of us wants to see is to give up our weapons and leave it to the dictatorships of the world to use them as and when they see fit?More from NewsStorm Eunice: Power cuts and travel chaos as strong winds batter BritainCovid vaccine for children: Who is eligible and what are the side effects?Storm Eunice: ‘Stay indoors’ alert as 100mph gusts set to cause chaosEden Project creator Sir Tim Smit criticises Cornish people in expletive-laden rantInside the Oak Room at Windsor Castle, as the Queen returns to action after Covid scareMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"relocate england scots vote independence says head major defence","story":"The head of a major defence firm has warned his company could relocate to England if Scots were to vote for independence.David Lockwood, the chief executive of Babcock, said its huge fabrication yard at Rosyth could move south within three years if the firm was made to feel unwelcome after a referendum.Unionists said the intervention showed that major employers would desert the country if Nicola Sturgeon delivers on her plan of winning a referendum next year.Mr Lockwood, speaking to The Courier after Boris Johnson visited Rosyth in Fife this week, said Babcock could “manage” the break up of the UK but suggested this could involve relocation.Almost 800 skilled engineers are employed at the site, one of the largest waterside manufacturing and repair facilities in the UK.“I think in reality there will be plenty of warning if the vote were in favour of independence,” Mr Lockwood said.“There would then be a negotiation period and at the end of the negotiation period there would be an implementation period. So I don’t think there is anything that we can’t manage as a company.”He added: “If we had to replicate this in England because we were told we weren’t welcome here – which I think would be a bad mistake for Scotland – but if that were the decision, we can replicate this in three years, and the time window of negotiations is longer than that. It’s not ideal but it is manageable.”SNP figures responded by insisting that Babcock would be welcome in an independent Scotland. However elements within the independence movement, including the Scottish Greens who are in a coalition government with the SNP, have condemned Scottish-based defence firms as “arms dealers who profit from delivering death, destruction and misery”.Ms Sturgeon has insisted she intends to hold a new vote on independence by next year, although there are major doubts over whether she will be able to deliver.However, Mr Lockwood also warned that the ongoing constitutional debate alone was putting firms off investing in Scotland.“I think if you are already here it is manageable,” he said. “But I think it is a slightly different question if you weren’t here, does it affect your decision?“I am aware of people who are … it is a question they ask when they are making a decision where to base themselves.”Douglas Chapman, the SNP MP for Dunfermline and West Fife, said he was “disappointed” with Mr Lockwood’s remarks. “As the local MP I have consistently supported Babcock and the Rosyth workforce,” he said. “They make a very valuable and significant contribution to our economy. “They operate and are welcomed in many independent countries globally. An independent Scotland will be no different.”Stewart McDonald, the SNP defence spokesman, said the firm was “not just welcome, but vital”.He added: “Babcock is not just an important employer, but would play a crucial role in an independent Scotland’s defence capability.”More from NewsStorm Eunice: Power cuts and travel chaos as strong winds batter BritainCovid vaccine for children: Who is eligible and what are the side effects?Storm Eunice: ‘Stay indoors’ alert as 100mph gusts set to cause chaosEden Project creator Sir Tim Smit criticises Cornish people in expletive-laden rantInside the Oak Room at Windsor Castle, as the Queen returns to action after Covid scareMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"secrets number 10 front door","story":"As with so much to do with 10 Downing Street right now, establishing the facts about its famous front door isn’t always as straightforward. A  reader wrote a Letter to the Editor this week, to correct no less an eminence than Sandi Toksvig on the question of why the zero on the threshold to the Prime Minister’s residence is skew-whiff.On the BBC’s brainbox television show, QI, Toksvig had explained that the 37-degree tilt to the left on the numeral ‘0’ in question “had always been” that way since what had hitherto been 5 Downing Street was redesignated 10 Downing Street in 1779.  But the letter’s author, Malvern Harper, who had trained as a sign writer in the 1960s, recalled that his tutor had told him the slant was because the number ‘0’ was actually a capitalised letter ‘O’ in the same unusual typography used on Emperor Trajan’s Column in Rome in AD113.Both explanations can be found in the many histories of Downing Street written since Sir Robert Walpole took up residence there in 1732 at the invitation of George II. And there is even a variation that suggests the official Department of Works, as a result of another round of austerity which coincided with the renovation of Numbers 10, 11 and 12 in the early 1960s, had simply run out of ‘0’s. In the spirit of make do and mend, they substituted a spare Trajan ‘O’ as the next best thing.Which account is right? Even as one who has experienced that frisson – as if a very small footnote in history – of stepping over the threshold, I’ve no idea. But I can report some other secrets that the Downing Street door hides in plain sight. The original six-panel Georgian door, made of black oak, was installed in 1772 when Lord North was Prime Minister, as part of extensive renovations that saw three Downing Street properties knocked into one of suitable grandeur. Its 1991 replacement is made of black gloss-finish steel, installed for added security after an IRA attack, when John Major was PM, saw a mortar land in Number 10’s back garden. (When it needs maintenance, it has an equally robust twin that holds the fort.)If you can see past the press pack regularly gathered outside, the eagle-eyed will notice that there is no lock in which to put a key, and no handle. This is a door than can only be opened from the inside, where – because the brass door bell to its right is for decorative purposes only – a security guard is on duty 247, watching security cameras so it can swing open as if by magic on cue to allow in prime ministers, ministers, monarchs and assorted visiting dignitaries.  Or, on occasion, fail to open: as once when the Blair family were briefly left stranded on the doorstep, or worse in 2016 when US Secretary of State, John Kerry, came for his first meeting with Theresa May and walked straight into the door.  For those wanting to find a more discreet way into 10 Downing Street – and I will leave it to your imagination why that might be necessary – there is a back door, which does boast its own keyhole. If only they could train Larry the resident Downing Street cat to make use of it.There is something solid, serious and stately about today\u0027s glossy black door. Back in 1908, however, Herbert Asquith decreed – at the instigation, it is said, of his wife, the celebrated wit and socialite, Margot – that black was passé. Instead it was given a lick of what historical paint consultants have suggested was either Brunswick Green or Bronze Green, as popular then with those in the know as gold wallpaper is today.  The experiment didn’t last. Asquith\u0027s successor, David Lloyd George, known for his colourful turn of phrase and private life, proved to be more sober and traditional when it came to picking paint.If you have ever wondered why those delivering petitions to the Prime Minister can’t just slip their bundle of papers through the shiny brass letter box, there is an easy answer. Despite appearances, it is not a letter-box at all, but a shiny brass plate simply made to look like one (for security purposes) inscribed with the words First Lord of the Treasury. When Sir Robert Walpole took on the house in 1735, that was his official title, though he was de facto Prime Minister. All his successors since 1905 have held both offices simultaneously. The original lion’s head door-furniture was made of cast iron, the essential ingredient of the Industrial Revolution that began in Britain. At the outset of the First World War, soldiers about to depart for the trenches are reported to have walked up Downing Street to touch the knocker for good luck. During the 1960 renovations it was replaced by a brass lion\u0027s head painted black with Downing Street now out of bounds to the casual passer-by, it is in no immediate danger of being rubbed off.There are other alternatives at hand. Close by is the original door, on display in the Churchill War Rooms, or else wander down Whitehall, onto the Strand and turn into Adam Street, where a near identical front door, with similar frame and façade around it, is available free of charge at Number 10. But position yourself carefully for maximum authenticity. This door does have a lock.  More from NewsStorm Eunice: Power cuts and travel chaos as strong winds batter BritainCovid vaccine for children: Who is eligible and what are the side effects?Storm Eunice: ‘Stay indoors’ alert as 100mph gusts set to cause chaosEden Project creator Sir Tim Smit criticises Cornish people in expletive-laden rantInside the Oak Room at Windsor Castle, as the Queen returns to action after Covid scareMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"welby claims not pope acting like one","story":"Back here in England, there are times when it would benefit his church if Welby did act more like a pope – if that means  leading from the top, insisting that changes are made, and doing a bit of table-banging. Surely it is time for him to help the Church of England’s bedrock: the parishes. For years now, they have been bled dry by the parish share system, with increasing demands to send money to the dioceses. As church membership declines – less than a million attend Church of England services on a Sunday - fewer and fewer loyal Anglicans are being asked to carry an impossible financial burden of funding their own parish as well as handing over substantial sums to what could be called regional head office. And insistence on change at local level must be matched by Welby knocking heads together to put an end to ever-increasing bureaucracies of the myriad dioceses with their jobs boom. Climate change officers, sustainability experts, inequality advisers – you can find them across the country in the CofE dioceses. Then there are the number of dioceses and their bishops. In a document leaked in the past few days that was written by Welby, the current Archbishop of York, Stephen Cottrell, and Bishop of London, Dame Sarah Mullally, and full of phrases about “a new paradigm”, the problem was evident: there are 42 dioceses, each with a bishop, plus dozens of suffragan bishops as well. Buried within its pages is the admission that 27 of the 42 dioceses are operating on deficit budgets, although the document seems to suggest that there should not so much be a drop in episcopal numbers but non-diocesan ones who would “speak into particular issues”.

The Labour leader said he was on a mission to prevent Labour being linked to anti-Semitism for good - and did not rule out putting forward a candidate in Mr Corbynaposs seat at the next election.

Asked how he planned to ensure Labour upheld the values he hoped to roll out across the country, Mr Starmer said: “I said I would tear anti-Semitism out of the party by the roots in my acceptance speech. “We have been doing that and we have made progress on it.”Pressed on whether that would include standing a Labour candidate in Mr Corbyn’s seat, Mr Starmer said: “Well, Jeremy Corbyn doesn’t have a Labour whip at the moment.“That’s the position he finds himself in, and it’s down to the response he made to the report on anti-Semitism.” It follows claims Mr Corbyn could be deselected by the party in his safe seat of Islington North, which he has held since .It is understood he plans to stand at the next general election, whether it is for Labour or as an independent candidate. Mr Starmer also promised he is taking allegations of Islamophobia as seriously as anti-Semitism. “There is absolutely no hierarchy here, he said. “We have to root out Islamophobia in just the same way as weaposd have to root out anti-Semitism. “And we do it with the same determination and energy. And Iaposm absolutely as prepared to take tough decisions on Islamophobia as I am on anti-Semitism.” Askedhe had spoken to Labour MPs concerned by the issue, he said he “talked to all of our MPs pretty well all the time but admitted it was harder to keep in touch during Covid.

I wanted him to see me go to Parliament, she told the Mirror. Imagine a poor family from the inner cities and watch their daughter go to Parliament - you donapost know what that means. “He worked so hard for me and my family. I just wanted to stand up and say, ‘This is for you’.  Ms Hamilton, , grew up in a tight-knit family without much money. We had a party when we got our first washing machine,” she recalled. It was magical.” She said not going to private school or possessing family wealth had been a driving factor of her career, from nursing through to politics. Ms Hamilton said she knew she might face challenges in politics as a black woman. Iaposve faced racism and faced issues where people have thought perhaps I wasnapost good enough to do it because of the areas Iaposve grown up in, she said. I remember once a senior telling meyou are going to achieve anything in nursing, you donapost just have to be as good as your white counterpart, you have to be twice as good.

Ms Hamilton said: Iaposm not gonna tell you Iaposm prepared. But what Iaposve seen over the last month or so, from the MPs that have come to Birmingham, is that they seem very supportive. And so all I can do is learn from people that have gone there before me. Just try not to make the same mistakes. AndI get it wrong, just work with the powers that be to look at the issues. As well as her strong work ethic, Ms Hamilton has beaming smile on her face that lingers through the interview and when speaking to locals. Asked what her secret is to looking happy, Ms Hamilton replied: Iaposve got a good husband who loves me, and has for  years. Iaposve got five lovely children who absolutely root for me, a really good extended family and a great network of friends. Chuckling, she added: And also Iaposm a beautul girl walking about! Sharing her plans for Erdington, Ms Hamilton said: I want to see our high street as something we can be proud of, a town where people have high earnings.

Race equality thinktank the Runnymede Trust was granted the declaration by Lord Justice Singh and Mr Justice Swt after a High Court hearing in December. The Good Law Project joined the Runnymede Trust in the action. The judges ruled that the Runnymede Trust had sufficient standing to bring a public sector equality duty challenge but GLP did not.The ruling centred on Mr Hancockaposs decision to appoint Baroness Harding as interim executive chair of the National Institute for Health Protection in August  and ex-Sainsburyaposs boss Mr Coupe as director of testing for NHS Test and Trace in September . Lawyers representing the two organisations suggested that people outside the tight circle in which senior Conservative politicians and their friends moved were not being given opportunities. They said an unfair policy was being challenged. Ministers disputed the claims made against them. Jason Coppel QC, who led the two organisationsapos legal teams, told Lord Justice Singh and Mr Justice Swt that the challenge was based on equality legislation and public law. He said the Government had a policy or practice of making appointments to posts critical to the pandemic response without adopting any, or any sufficient, fair or open competitive processes. Mr Coppel said people less likely to be known or connected to decision-makers were put at a disadvantage. He also said the Government was failing to offer remuneration for high-level full-time roles and excluding all candidates who were not already wealthy or held other posts for which they would continue to be paid.  Lord Justice Singh and Mr Justice Swt said in a written ruling: It is the process leading up to the two decisions which has been found by this court to be in breach of the public sector equality duty. For those reasons we will grant a declaration to the Runnymede Trust that the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care did not comply with the public sector equality duty in relation to the decisions how to appoint Baroness Harding as interim executive chair of the NIHP in August  and Mr Coupe as director of testing for NHSTT in September . Dr Halima Begum, Chief Executive of the Runnymede Trust, welcomed the findings. She said: “The judgement handed down today by the High Court is incredibly signicant to the British people. It shows the importance of the Public Sector Equality Duty and its role in protecting the people of this nation from the closed shop of Government appointments, not least in a time of national crisis where people from our minority communities were dying from Covid in hugely disproportionate numbers. Mr Hancock’s spokesman said the judgement aposthe claim brought by Good Law Project fails in its entiretyapos, therefore highlighting the fact this group continues to waste the courtaposs time. He said the High Court ruling “states that aposthe evidence provides no support ... at allapos for the allegation that Dido Harding secured senior positions on the basis of apospersonal or political connectionsapos in the Government”. He said: They accept these aposwere urgent recruitment processes which needed to find highly specialised, experienced and available candidates within a short space of time. Letaposs not forget, we were dealing with an unprecedented global pandemic where time was of the essence in order to protect and save lives.

He is also likely to confirm the date free lateral flow and PCR tests will be axed - though it’s not thought this will actually happen next week. The £ self-isolation payment for low-income workers and legal powers for councils both face being scrapped. Scroll down for the full guide to the changes - or join the debate in the comments Unions also fear the ability to claim Statutory Sick Pay from Day One of Covid isolation will be axed when current laws expire. And charities worry immunocompromised Brits will be thrown to the wolves with little support.Meanwhile Boris Johnson’s plan could kick vaccines for all children over five into operation, though the announcement of this looks set to be brought forward after Wales and Scotland both unveiled their plans in the last  hours.For holidaymakers, Passenger Locator Forms could be simplied further, or even scrapped completelyTransport Secretary Grant Shapps gets his way.Travel testing, however, is likely to stay for unvaccinated people entering the UK for the foreseeable future. Here’s everything we know about what is likely to be announced.Self-isolation laws scrappedLegal Covid self-isolation is due to be scrapped - evenyou currently have the virus - from as soon as Thursday  February. The decision will end almost exactly two years of legally-enforced isolation for people who test positive. But it raises ethical dilemmas about whether to go to work and put others at risk, especiallyyou can no longer claim a £ isolation paymentor sick pay. Despite scrapping legal isolation, No said: “We’re not saying isolation is pointless. We’d expect anyone with an infectious disease to take steps not to spread that disease further - a colleague at work with flu, for example. Currently people who test positive must go into self-isolation for at least five full days in England, a period that has been repeatedly cut from  days and seven days. Fears Statutory Sick Pay will be stripped back Unions and Labour fear the right to claim Statutory Sick Payfrom Day One of Covid isolation will be axed.The £.-a-week payment is usually only available from the fourth day of illness, after three ‘waiting days’ are complete. This was cut to the first day for Covid cases.But the power is contained within the Coronavirus Act , which could lapse in its entirety by the end of March. It is thought ministers may need to pass new laws to continue the ‘Day One’ SSP power, and they have not yet said whether they plan to do that. Sources suggested the issue was still being worked out. TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady - who has long called for SSP to be increased and extended to more part-time workers - said: “It’s vital that sick pay remains a day one right and is made available to all. “Workers who are laid low by Covid must be able to make ends meet – not pushed into financial hardship.”A date for scrapping free lateral flow testsBoris Johnson’s plan is expected to set a timetable for the end of free lateral flow tests, with people having to pay instead.The government warned last summer it would eventually stop paying for these rapid tests due to the huge cost of the NHS.Sources told the Mirror that claims the tests themselves will end next week are wide of the mark. However, the Living with Covid plan could set a date in the future for when they are cut off. It’s not known how much lateral flow tests will cost, but estimates have put it at £ for a pack of seven. A date for scrapping free PCR tests and Test and TraceIt’s thought next week’s plan may contain a date for ending free ‘gold standard’ PCR tests as England’s Covid infrastructure is wound down. Whitehall sources told thethe Treasury is trying to cut the £bn-a-year cost, which will mean having to phase out free testing and all but ending the contact-tracing system. Scientists have raised the alarm about ending these free tests with reports suggesting they could cost £ each privately. According to reports, only health and social care workers and .million vulnerable people will continue to get free PCRs. Prof Lawrence Young of Warwick University said: “Living with Covid doesn’t mean letting our guard down”. Covid travel Passenger Locator Form could be simplied or axedFully-vaccinated people entering the UK do not need to take any Covid tests, under changes that happened on February . But they still need to fill in a Passenger Locator Form - albeit a ‘simplied’ one - and further changes to this are possible in next week’s Covid plan. It’s understood the Department for Transport is pressing to further simply the Passenger Locator Form - or get rid of it completely. However, it is thought there is only a slim chance of the form being axed altogether, with health officials still worried about needing to track new iants coming in to the UK. Meanwhile, unvaccinated people still need to take one pre-departure test and one post-arrival test before entering the UK. It’s understood this rule will stay for the foreseeable future and no changes to it are due next week. £ self-isolation payment could be scrappedThe £ self-isolation payment for poor workers with Covid could end as the legal requirement to quarantine is scrapped. The Test and Trace Support Payment was introduced in September  to help low-wage workers afford to self-isolate for up to  days. No final decisions have been announced yet over the future of the £ payment, and its status is being considered by the government this week. An announcement is due on Monday.  Legal powers for councils will goThe legal change will also end remaining powers which authorities had under the  Coronavirus Act in England to close some venues. However, these powers were barely ever used, because powers for lockdowns flow from a separate law passed in . And the vast majority of Coronavirus Act powers - including on detention, events, gatherings, shops and restaurants and schools - already expired in September . Only a few of the more draconian powers - including the power to suspend port operations - remained in the Act. Vaccines for all children over fiveAll children over five will be able to get vaccinated against Covid- from April. The “non-urgent offer” to the parents of nearly six million - year olds was confirmed by the Government moments after advice issued by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation . Two smaller doses of the Pfizer jab,  weeks apart, will be available to this age group to help control future Covid waves after Covid curbs have been lted. It is understood there are no plans for a major publicity drive to encourage this age group to be vaccinated and it will be left very much up to parents to decide. Itaposs understood a rollout for over-s will be less urgent than previous vaccine drives, due to the very low risk Covid poses to younger kids. The idea is that ordinary NHS care shouldn’t be interrupted to give kids the jab, like it was for adults. All children over  have been able to get the Pfizer Covid jab since September last year. Currently, only the most vulnerable kids aged  to  are eligible. They are offered two jabs but at a lower dose than for adults -  micrograms instead of .

New guidance published today says schools should avoid advocating for organisations with contested aims or views when teaching pupils about racism. Britainaposs imperial past must be taught in a balanced manner and teachers should avoid controversial theories about historical figures, it states. Children must be taught that racism has no place in society but campaigners such as Black Lives Matter could be considered partisan political views. The guidance tells schools to offer pupils a balanced account of opposing views and not to advocate for ideas such as withdrawing funding from the police.  It says: Partisan political views must not be promoted to pupils, including by encouraging pupils to support campaign groups advocating such views. Teachers discussing the decriminalisation of homosexuality are told not to present discriminatory beliefs held at the time in an uncritical way - and make it clear they are not acceptable today. Schools already have a legal duty to ensure political impartiality in the classroom and teachers are required to promote values like democracy and the rule of law. Teachers are banned from encouraging pupils to back a political party or candidate in an election. But schools are allowed to teach children about dferent political parties and views - as long as they donapost promote a particular ideas. The latest guidance comes after Mr Zahawi waded into a row over a primary school in Nottingham where pupils had written letters to their Labour MP Lilian Greenwood about the Partygate scandal.  Labour accused the Education Secretary of playing to his own party with the new guidance, while union bosses warned it could limit teachers efforts to discuss serious subjects. Shadow Schools Minister Stephen Morgan said: This hopelessly thin guidance shows Nadhim Zahawi is more focused on playing to Tory backbenchers than on the real challenges facing our schools. Dr Mary Bousted, Joint General Secretary of the National Education Union, said: There is absolutely no need for new guidance on how to appropriately handle political and social subjects in schools.Very good guidance already exists and this is followed up and down the country. It has always been the case that educators take their responsibilities for teaching in these areas seriously and carry it out with considerable thought. “We note Nadhim Zahawi’s intention that he ‘does not seek to limit the range of political issues that schools can and do teach about’. But in practice his guidance will have the opposite effect.Geoff Barton, General Secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said young people were exposed to a swirl of misinformation online and schools needed to provide a safe space for discussions.  He said: The vast majority of teachers are very good at managing these discussions in a way that is balanced and impartial. We welcome anything which helps them to navigate this dficult territory. However, we are keen that this should not be over-prescriptive as it could have the unintended consequence of deterring open discussions.” Launching the new guidance, Mr Zahawi said: I know one of the reasons many teachers feel so passionate about the profession is the remarkable role they play in young people’s lives, helping them understand more about themselves and their views of the world. I don’t want there to be any barriers – real or perceived – to teachers’ vital work in this space, which is why I am reinforcing that no subject is off-limits in the classroom, as long as it is treated in an age-appropriate way, with sensitivity and respect, and without promoting contested theories as fact.

Norman Baker says Andrew has, over the years, pulled in money from shady sourcesPrince Andrew attends the annual Founders Day Parade at the Royal Hospital Cha in  Image: Getty ImagesByNorman Baker:,  Feb So Prince Andrew has finally paid off Virginia Giuffre, at a cost rumoured to be £million. That’s a lot of money to give to someone he says he has no recollection of meeting. So where’s all the money coming from  Well it’s not from his handouts from the Queen, who gives him £, a year. Nor is it from his annual £, naval pension. Andrew has, over the years, pulled in money from shady sources. His marital home, Sunninghill Park, sat unloved on the market, empty for years before being sold to the dodgy billionaire son-in-law of the Kazakhstan dictator for £m. Why would he pay £m over the odds and then demolish the house without even living in it   Another dodgy deal gave him a % commission for sending a couple of emails relating to a £.m Kazakh infrastructure scheme, though that one fell through when Kazakh soldiers killed a group of striking oil workers. But now he is clearly short of cash. He has had to rely on the tycoon David Rowland to pay off a £.m loan from Banque Havilland. No doubt the fact Andrew had hosted his son Jonathan at Buckingham Palace when he was trying to land a lucrative deal involving the Royal Estate did no harm. It seems clear that the Queen is going to have to bail him out. Most of us stop cadging off our parents when we are in our s, but not, it appears, the -year-old Duke of York. The Queen, of course, is fabulously wealthy. But noises from the Palace suggest she could fund Andrew via the Duchy of Lancaster, a sort of royal slush fund. The Queen already pays out her annual support to the Royal Family from this source and offsets these payments against tax. If she bails out Andrew this way, that will in effect reduce her tax bill and mean the public purse is part-subsidising Andrew’s shenanigans. That is outrageous. We need a clear statement from the Palace that no public money will be used for a payoff. It is also high time the Public Accounts Committee looked into the whole murky business of royal finances.

If you sell goods to the EU, or buy goods from the EU and bring them into the UK, you need to be able to prove that they meet the new rules of origin requirements to access preferential tarfs. It’s vital you understand the new rules to keep your business moving. To benefit from the preferential tarfs, you must have proof that any goods you import from the EU originate there, or any goods you export to the EU originate in the UK. Proof of origin can either be a statement of origin completed by the exporter, or evidence of the importer’s knowledge of where products originate. If you cannot prove the origin, you or your EU customer may be liable to pay the full rate of customs duty and could face penalties. Andrew Macleod, founder of London-based restaurant brand Emilia’s Crafted Pasta, explains that imports from the EU are vital to his brand: “We import ingredients directly from Italy, including special cured meats, cheeses, drinks and alcohol. Each of our suppliers is hand-picked.”  Has he had to make any changes to his business now that there are new import rules in place  “Yes – of course we already knew the origin of all the goods we import as we source everything carefully. But we’ve trained two of our managers on the rules around importing, so we know that we have staff in house who are well versed in the process.”  And having successfully navigated the changes, what advice would Andrew offer other businesses that import  “We found using a customs agent really helps the process run smoothly, but it’s equally important that you understand the rules yourself,” he says. “It’s not too late, and the gov.uk site has lots of valuable information.”  You must be able to prove the origin of any product you import You can choose to work with a freight forwarder or courier To benefit from preferential tarfs, you must be able to prove that any goods you import originated in the EU Note:you’re moving goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, rules of origin work dferently.

Forever tainted Andrew’s banishment from public le must be permanent after paying his sex abuse accuser a substantial sum to settle sordid charges he denied. Because the court of public opinion will reach its own verdict on the U-turning prince now commending the bravery of a victim, Virginia Giuffre, his team disgracefully accused of lying in a stomach-churning smear campaign. And hoisting the white flag over Buckingham Palace to avoid a court inquisition means a man who until yesterday considered it honourable to be the guest of a convicted paedophile can never openly clear his name.  The donation to Giuffre’s charity combined with avow to campaign against sex trafficking and that apology indicate who won. She did. He still lost. The question remains unanswered about what to do with befouled Uncle Andrew despite relief in royal circles an Emily Maitlis mauling with knobs on is averted in a New York courtroom. Sneak him into platinum jubilee celebrations and the Queen will besmirch  years to rehabilitate a favourite son who’d be safer for the family locked in the Tower. Stripping him of a few courtesy titles and recognising the armed forces want nothing to do with Andrew isn’t enough.  The riot act must be read to him and a public declaration there is no way back nailed to the gates of Windsor Castle. Andrew remaining ninth in line to the throne and continuing to enjoy the perks of royalty is an insult to all women. It also goes to the heart of the rottenness of a hereditary monarchy, permanently elevating one family over millions of better others.

A councillor described the report as deeply shocking and upsetting, the Manchester Evening News reports. On one occasion, inspectors say a child was put in harmaposs way by staff aposcarrying out cardiac pulmonary resuscitation on them when this was not necessaryapos. And, in a separate incident, staff at the home did not enter a childaposs bedroom for four months aposdespite there being evidence of flies and a pungent smell coming from the room and spreading throughout the homeapos.  The home, which we are not naming in order to ensure the anonymity of the children, has had its registration with Ofsted revoked, according to the report. Staff are not effective in supporting children’s health and well-being, it read. A spokesperson for Achieve, the firm which operates the childrenaposs home, said staff would work with Bolton council to investigate the incidents in Oftedaposs report. In the inspection report, which covers visits on January  and  this year, Ofsted inspectors Chris Scully and Michelle Edge wrote: The registered manager and staff have failed to meet the basic care needs of children. One child has been signicantly neglected and he has not bathed, changed his clothes or been provided with a home-cooked meal since he moved into the home in September . Adding: Staff are not effective in supporting children’s health and well-being. The registered manager and staff fail to take action when children refuse to take their medication.Another issue listed in the report involved a child who refused to leave the home during fire drills for over three months.Despite knowing this, staff failed to put systems in place to help the child in an emergency. The report added: Currently, only two members of staff hold a childcare qualication one of these is the registered manager. The staff team is very inexperienced to care for two very complex children. Staff have not been supported by the manager to safely care for these children. In response to the damning findings, Bolton councillor Adele Warren said the childrenaposs home in question was an example of a wider problem. The report is deeply shocking and upsetting. Children who have been through so much already shouldn’t have to go through that as well in a location which is supposed to be safe and secure, she explained. I appealed it at the planning committee and it was declined but unfortunately they then applied for a certicate of lawful development, which there’s no recourse to object to. I did write to Ofsted and asked them not to grant registration but unfortunately they did.  It’s a dficult subject because these are extremely vulnerable children and you have to try and find a balance between trying to do the right thing for everybody but in Bolton we have so many private children’s homes and only  percent of the children placed there are local children. This puts a massive pressure on the availability of homes for our own children and I believe it’s a national scandal what’s happening in the private care home sector and I think a lot of people are just in it to make money. Some children’s placements are £, per week so some organisations are making a hell of a lot of money on the back of vulnerable children. These children deserve the best and to not even have adults that are adequately trained to look after them, it’s just not good enough. A spokesperson for Achieve said: We have voluntarily revoked our registration after the incident that occurred in our care home and we are working with the Local Authority to investigate it further. A Bolton council spokesperson said the home had undergone aposdue diligence and all the appropriate checksapos to be registered with Ofsted initially and that regular independent visits took place.  They added: “Bolton Council are working with Ofsted, health partners, and the provider to review the service that was provided at the home and consider what could have been done dferently to inform practice. “Children placed in the home were removed as soon as concerns were raised, and alternative placements were sourced within  hours. “This case demonstrates a broader national issue of sufficiency, quality and capacity within the care system, especially as children with complex needs are discharged from hospital settings at short notice due to a reduced number of hospital beds. “Like other local authorities, we are working with national partners, and the Independent Review of Children’s Social Care, to address this problem and ensure there is a more robust approach to registering providers. “There is also a need to enhance the monitoring of the quality of placements for children on a regular basis.” Read MoreRead More Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON HospitalsCare homesNursing homesChildcare\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

And sources say it was the Queen and Prince Charles who p ut substantial pressure on the Duke of York to come to an out of court deal - said to be worth £million.The Firm is said to have wanted a settlement agreed so the case did not overshadow the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee year. Well placed royal sources said Andrew was under “intense pressure from the very top” to ensure a deal was done after a US judge last month rejected the duke’s bid to have the case dismissed. And itaposs not the first time royals including the Queen, Charles and Andrewaposs other siblings have put their foot down amid his legal troubles... Stepping back from public le  Itaposs long been thought that Andrew is Her Majesty favourite son, and sheaposs said to have had a far more hands-on relationship with when he was a child than his older brother Prince Charles. Royal expert Penny Junor once said: I think the Queen has always had a bit of a blind spot when it comes to Prince Andrew.But after giving a car crash interview on BBC Newsnight about his association with Jeffy Epstein, Andrewaposs royal role diminished as his mother approved him stepping back from public le and reportedly cancelled a milestone birthday party. In the days after the Newsnight interview was broadcast in , Andrew sensationally quit public le for the foreseeable future in a statement - approved by the Queen.Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm.

He said at the time: It has become clear to me over the last few days that the circumstances relating to my former association with Jeffrey Epstein has become a major disruption to my family’s work and the valuable work going on in the many organisations and charities that I am proud to support. Therefore, I have asked Her MajestyI may step back from public duties for the foreseeable future, and she has given her permission. Birthday party axed Andrew celebrated his landmark th birthday on February , .But it was reported that the Queen cancelled a birthday bash she had planned for him and downgraded it to a small family dinner. The Queen hosted a lavish reception at Buckingham Palace to mark the Prince of Wales’ th birthday in November .But in the wake of allegations against him at the time, a similar party for Andrew didnapost happen. No way back In October, it was reported that Prince Charles, Princess Anne and Prince Edward ruled out ato public le for Andrew during a get-together.According to the Sunday Times, a meeting was held in January , where Andrewaposs siblings were in agreement that their brother should never be allowed toto public le, an insider claimed. A source said at the time: “Nine months ago Charles, Anne and Edward had a meeting, a summit, and agreed there was no way back for him.” Titles stripped Last month, Andrew suffered another blow when he learned he was being stripped of his honorary military titles and royal patronages. He was said to be utterly devastated by his mother’s bombshell decision, which came after the Sunday People exclusively revealed Her Majesty would reluctantly strip her son of his prized roleshe did not resign. A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said: With The Queen’s approval and agreement, The Duke of York’s military affiliations and Royal patronages have been ed to The Queen. The Duke of York will continue not to undertake any public duties and is defending this case as a private citizen. A royal source said: All of The Duke’s roles have been handed back to The Queen with immediate effect for redistribution to other Members of the Royal Family - will notto The Duke of York. The Duke of York will no longer use the style ‘His Royal Highness’ in any official capacity. Balcony appearance  However, itaposs not just since his legal battle that Andrew has seen other royals put their foot down when it came to him. In , the Queen was celebrating her Diamond Jubilee of  years on the throne - and an appearance by the royals on the Buckingham Palace balcony was planned.It was reported that Charles had a hand in the decision for only senior royals, such as the Duchess of Cornwall, Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge, to appear on the balcony - leaving Andrew dismayed.  Royal expert Richard Kay wrote in the Daily Mail in : For Andrew, according to one close figure, being excluded from the balcony scene was a sudden and totally unexpected demotion from front-rank to peripheral royal. It was ‘like a dagger to his heart and he hasn’t got over it’.But this was a dramatic statement of intent by Charles, who long ago decided that when he is king the Royal Family would be ‘slimmed down’. But as a friend of the Duke of York says: ‘The speed and suddenness with which Charles has acted has taken Andrew’s breath away. It’s dreadfully high-handed.’ Do you have a story to sell  Get in touch with us at yourmirror@trinitymirror.

The Met Police also opened an investigation into claims Prince Charles’s charity offered honours to wealthy donorsThe Queen is celebrating her Platinum Jubilee this year Image: Getty ImagesopinionByVoice of the Mirror:,  Feb This should have been a year of undimmed celebration for the Queen as the country marks her Platinum Jubilee. While the nation’s affection for Her Majesty remains undiminished, the reputation of the Royal Family has been tarnished by Prince Andrew’s unsavoury court case. To add to the Queen’s woes, the politan Police has opened an investigation into claims Prince Charles’s charity offered honours to wealthy donors. Clarence House insists Charles did not know what was happening at his foundation and is not involved in its day-to-day running. But the revelation is another blight on what should be a momentous year for the House of Windsor. For the Royal Family to be hit by one scandal is unfortunate but to be rocked by two in as many days is deeply embarrassing. The Queen described the year of  which saw the separation of Charles and Diana, the orce of Princess Anne and the fire at Windsor Castle as her annus horribilis. It would be deeply unfair on her Majestythe year in which she marks  years on the throne turns out to be equally grim.  Paying the price Soaring inflation is another blow to households hit by sky-high fuel bills. Prices are now outstripping wages and the recent increases in pensions and benefits. Rishi Sunak claims he understands the pressures on family finances. But he is still pressing ahead with a National Insurance rise this April. If the Chancellor genuinely cares about the cost of living crisis he would rethink this tax hike and help people more with heating bills. He should also send a clear signal to bosses that workers deserve a rise. Working people should not have to pay the price for this Government’s economic mismanagement.

The government hopes to announce that an end to all Covid restrictions, including the mandatory period required for self-isolating, will be in place by the end of February.Parliament is currently on recess, but the Prime Minister is due to announce his plan for living with Covid when MPsnext week on Monday, February . Another change, this time to testing, is also likely to be announced. Boris Johnson looks set to unveil the change that could impact Brits up to £ at a time, as the UK looks to learn to live with the virus.So what is the change and why will Brits be charged   Will PCR tests be scrapped  Free PCR tests now look set to be scrapped and could cost people £they want to get their hands on one. The Living Safely With Covid plan is due to be published on February  and may well include the plans to scrap free PCRs.  PCR tests have been vital to determinea person has Covid, as they are more accurate than lateral flow testsand have become a requirement for travel to and from certain countries around the world at ious points during the pandemic. The hope is that LFTs becoming more widely available will mean PCRs will not be so heavily relied upon. Why are free PCR tests set to be scrapped   The Treasury will be hoping to save billions by announcing the end to free tests. Covid figures have taken a downward trend recently. The seven-day average has been falling since January .  However, UK Health and Security Agencywants the government to keep providing free tests until at least the start of April and some experts are also concerned that the changes will be taken as a signal by people with Covid that they should continue to mix in public setting, despite having clear symptoms of the virus. ,],totalVotes:,votesToShow:,mentometerId:,publicationId:,callbackUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  status,voteActionUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  vote,closed:,closedMessage:This poll has been closed!,hideResults:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,blackFridayWidget.linkUrl:https:www.mirror all-about black-friday,prebidUseTestRuntime:true,blackFridayWidget:,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,nonIframeMantisRecommender:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,amp.trackonomics.enabled:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,mantisRecommender.useIntTracking:true,blackFridayWidget.Link:https:get-latest.dev.convrse.media black-fridayblack-friday-widget-v.,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,openxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,nobidDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,publicationName:Mirror,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,trackonomics.id:reachplc_cDEYX_mirror,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],video.ctpFloatAndPark:true,felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youaposve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He said it has put him off visiting the establishment again.The customer, who wished to remain anonymous, contacted the takeaway to complain about the crispy foot find but he said they brushed him off and hung up the phone, North Wales Live reports. He said: I honestly didnapost even process it at first, I pulled out the first piece of chicken and took a bite. Following this I looked into the meal and noticed the oddly shaped piece, which made me put out what I had in my mouth in disbelief. As anyone would imagine seeing what I was holding on my hand really put me off the rest of my meal. I literally had to google chicken body parts to make sure I wasn’t telling myself it was what it wasn’t. But, then I knew and couldn’t continue eating the meal, I physically felt sick. After around  minutes of getting my head around what I had actually being served, I called the takeaway back and explained to them what had happened. I took photos and offered to send them to them to prove myself but they were having none of it. After trying to explain to them what they had served me, they just went silent, laughed, and then seconds later the line went dead”  He added: “I would have given them the benefit of the doubtthey had listened to me and took in what I was saying, and would have happily ed as a customer. I fully understand, they haven’t picked the pieces themselves and have just placed them in the fryer from a bag. The customer service really didn’t help matters on their behalf and the whole situation has confirmed to me that I will never enter the takeaway again, let alone order from there. This has put me off chicken as a whole, knowing that I could have eaten thatI hadnapost have noticed it. Chicken is no longer top of my choices of food, I would rather go withoutI’m being honest and will always opt for something the choices are there for me. Reporters contacted East Eat several times for a response and they have declined to comment.  The takeaway is currently awaiting afood hygiene ratingwhich is believed to have been delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic.Although chicken feet are often discarded as a waste product in the UK, they’re common cuisine in ious places around the world, including Mexico, South Africa, Asia, Jamaica, and Trinidad, where you can find them as street food or a festive dish. Chicken feet are praised for their health benefits, which are mostly attributed to their high collagen content.

Curious Brits took to social media to share pictures of the distinctive pouch-like clouds, which one person likened to a painting.The phenomenon took place as mph winds lashed the country after the Met Office issued an amber weather warning for the north of the UK. Meteorologists have now answered Britsapos queries about the bizarre clouds that accompanied Storm Dudley. The organisation said the formations are called mammatus clouds. These clouds usually emerge after a storm has passed, particularly thunderstorms. They are named aposmammaapos, which means breast or udder in Latin, due to the apospouchesapos that appear underneath them. One awestruck Brit shared a snap of the clouds above the Scottish town of Clarkston, in East Renfrewshire. Another Twitter user, Claire Campbell, posted an image of the clouds above Glasgow. She said: I spotted these clouds during Storm Dudley today, at Silverburn ! Like a painting! Meanwhile Brian Morrison shared a video of the same aposweird cloudsapos above Glasgow. Another person wrote apos#StormDudley is doing weird things to the sky up in Edinburghapos and shared a picture of a red sky filled with mammatus clouds. Retweeting a video of the clouds, the Met Office said: Great Mammatus clouds from #StormDudley.The Met Office website states:are some of the most unusual and distinctive clouds formations with a series of bulges or pouches emerging from the base of a cloud. The shape of mammatus formations can y widely from the classic protruding shape, to a more elongated tube hanging from the cloud above.” The clouds are particularly eye-catching during sunsets, when they absorb the red light and take on a crimson colour. The formations came after Storm Dudley caused chaos across the UK, downing trees and knocking out power for thousands of households. Nearly , homes in Wigan, Greater Manchester, were left without electricity after strong winds caused an outage. Electricity North West previously warned the weather may damage overhead lines and the network operator has now dispatched engineers to fix the issue. The firm said power cuts have also taken place in towns and villages throughout Lancashire and Cumbria.  As of pm, Capel Curig in Wales had experienced gusts of up to mph, with Emley Moore in Yorkshire seeing mph winds, while Drumalbin in Scotland was hit by mph gales. Social media users shared images and videos of fallen trees, large waves smashing coastal areas, howling winds and rain sweeping through quiet roads and dark and gloomy skies, with some facing delays on public transport. Met Office forecaster Greg Dewhurst told the PA news agency: Weaposve seen Storm Dudley move in over the course of today with strong winds and heavy rain across northern parts of the country.

In terms of rainfall the highest weaposve seen in the past  hours is .mm in Low Laithes in west Yorkshire, which is a good amount for the time period.

In the footage Dean can be seen trying to act as peacemaker to defuse an altercation between his cousin Taylor Lock and another man outside the pub.The CCTV shows the moment that -year-old Silllence threw the “forceful, swinging punch” from behind, knocking Dean backwards without warning. He went on to assault Mr Lock.  Boxing enthusiast Sillence, from Bangor, was found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to  years in prison in December . He also admitted to assault causing actual bodily harm on Mr Lock. Deanaposs family took the incredibly dficult decision to share the moment Dean was killed as they step up their campaign for tougher sentences for single-punch killers. They have launched a petition, signed by more than ,, calling on the UK Government to change the sentencing for one-punch assaults so that it matches that for murder convictions.Deans’ mum, Becky explained why she shared the footage on Facebook : “I wanted to put it out there that when my son was killed there was no fight or words exchanged between Dean and Brandon.He was in fact trying to prevent a fight breaking out between his cousin and a friend of Sillence, she added.  “You can clearly see by the video that the police have released, that Brandon aposCowardapos Sillence punched my son from behind. “Dean couldn’t even see it coming, it killed him instantly because he hit him that hard and forcefully. “What sort of coward hits someone from behind and leaves him on the floor, then walks away knowing the damage he had done. She added: “How is this not an intentional act of violence to cause harm  To all that defended Brandon by saying it was a pub fight shame on all of you. “My son and nephew were attacked by this coward, Brandon.“As the judge said he was willing to punch his own shadow that night which resulted in my sonaposs death, and affected our family lives forever” Sillence was jailed a few days after the jury found him not guilty of murder but the court case and sentence was a huge disappointment to the family. While nothing will bring Dean back, his family hope to see change which would give others living with the consequences of a fatal punch a greater sense of justice.The petition set up by the family of Dean Skillin, and can be signedhere .Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON CCTV footageCourt caseMurder trial\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Vincenzo and Lisa Pranzo said their experience with United Utilities was a nightmare after they followed the advice of an employee which turned out to be wrong, they claim. They claim they were told aposyeah youaposve definitely got a leakapos. According to the family, a United Utilities inspector visited their Lancashire home on October , , and told Lisa that he was checking properties for leaks due to a recent spate of high water usage in the area. The inspector allegedly told Lisa she had a leak at the corner of her property near the house and said work needed to be carried out after checking the drive and surrounding areas of the property.She told Lancashire Live that when Vincenzo arrived home and had the situation explained to him, he said that in that specic part of the property there were no pipes, but the inspector reportedly assured them there was indeed a leak and he would investigate the matter. He said to us, aposyeah youaposve definitely got a leakapos, who am I to argue with someone who works for United Utilities and he is supposedly qualied, Lisa said. They came back and dug underneath the wall and thereaposs no water visible, but he listens and says aposyeah the leak is definitely under your houseapos so then obviously you go into panic mode. Heaposs explained to me, as the leakaposs under my property, United Utilities donapost fix it, Iaposm liable to fix that. United Utilities has said it is sorry Mrs Pranzo is disappointed with the service she has received and said it remains in contact with the couple. Their full response is at the bottom of this article.  The couple say they were given two options, they could dig a trench and get a stop tap with an insulated box fitted outside or pay £ for a company to use a mole - displacing the soil creating a bore instead of a trench. Days before Christmas, when the couple still hadnapost figured out how they would fix their leak, Vincenzo walked up to the top of the drive when his foot started sinking through the ground. As heaposs walking from the path onto the road, his foot almost sank into the stones- a sinkhole had kind of appeared at the front of the property, Lisa said.  Now we knew a pipe directly runs there because  years ago, the fitting that United Utilities used to branch it off from the supply blew and they had to dig it up and replace that. Weaposre thinking at the time, this is where the leak is, obviously thereaposs a large pool of water here. Looking to their eldest son who is a pipefitter, the family believed that the leak was due to a faulty pipe fitting. But, during a re-inspection, the couple were allegedly told that the leak was simply a random pool of water. Lisa said: He turned up laughing, heaposs not taking us on, heaposs telling me first, itaposs a random pool of water thataposs appeared- well Iaposve lived in this house for  years and Iaposve never seen, even in the most torrential rain, a random pool of water. My house is on an incline, the path is about cm higher than the front of the house. Heaposs then trying to tell me that the water thataposs pooled at the top of the path is due to the leak under the house. I said aposIaposm not being funny and Iaposm obviously not a plumber myself but water doesnapost run uphill.apos  Vincenzo and his son decided to dig up a hole in the path themselves to prove where the leak was coming from. Having removed all the water from the hole, they watched as the water soon filled the hole up once again showing that the water wasnapost coming from a source underneath the house but from the top of the driveway. Despite being able to show where the leak was coming from, Lisa says the inspector still refused to take on board what they had found, so the family decided to get Christmas out of the way and go back to the inspectoraposs original suggestion to dig up the trench in the new year. In doing so, Lisa says they would have been able to apply for the Lead Replacement Scheme which allows customers to receive a grant to pay for the replacement fixture. It states on the United Utilities website: Under the lead pipe replacement scheme, we may be able to offer a free like for like connection of a replacement water supply pipe , from your boundary to the water main in the road or footpath. Before going ahead, Vincenzo and Lisa asked the companythey were to dig, when would be the closest time they could come out and were told someone could come to replace the pipe in - days. My husband spent three weeks digging this trench that had to be cm deep and  metres long which is no mean feat in the freezing cold but he did it because there was going to be no other way we were going to be able to afford to do this, Lisa said. Then we got an email to say that it was now going to take - months to connect the water supply because there is a backlog at the council with applying for work permits. Explaining the severity of the leak and the now gaping hole across their drive, Lisa was able to arrange with the company for another inspection. The fella that came out, hats off to him - he was brilliant - I told him what the other fella had said and heaposs shaking his head, Lisa said. He said because lead pipes are such good conductors of sound, you could hear a leak right at the top and I could be hearing it from ,  metres down. He raised the job immediately and they were out the next morning- it took them an hour to dig down, find the leak which had nothing to do with my pipe, my pipe was fine. It was, as I said, the connection that United Utilities had put in - it was faulty, it was leaking - they fixed it. Although the leak was fixed, the trench was still there, which caused yet more problems for the family. During this time, Lisaaposs youngest, her -year-old son, badly hurt his foot on the rubble outside of their home and after an infection, he was put on antibiotics. He had to have adult antibiotics in tablet form and he couldnapost swallow them so we have to cut open the tablet to give him the power, Lisa said. The first two times he vomited in the kitchen floor because it was that bitter- he had to have that four times a day. While the cost of the job to repair the leak was covered by the company, Lisa said she rang up the customer service team hoping for some help with the trench they never needed to dig.  After  days of reportedly not getting a full response back, Lisa says she was told nothing could be done and she would have to fix the trench privately, with no option to speak to senior members of the team herself. Itaposs still not over because weaposre still arguing about it, Lisa said. Weaposve invested a lot of money in this house and itaposs one of the only things weaposve got of any worth and theyaposve made us do that to our home for no reason. The least they should have done is offer to help us put it straight - this is going to cost me money now for a skip, put the patios back and ordering sand and cement. My husband is working full-time and has to try and fit that in now around work- I just donapost think they understand what theyaposve done. He worked really hard and I feel for him, the words apos metre trenchapos donapost do any justice to the pictures and how hard he worked. Itaposs just been a nightmare from start to finish andUnited Utilities trained these people better who went round with these listening devices we wouldnapost be in this situation weaposre in now. Iaposve paid my water bill and I have been for the past  years to the water company, I am never late, Iaposve never once moaned or had a problem and I donapost get a phone call from the person who decided this.  United Utilities says their policy stands that private homeowners are responsible for the maintenance of water supply pipes that bring water into their homes from the mains on the street. Where customers have supply pipes made of lead, United Utilities advise them to replace them and there is a lead pipe replacement scheme the teams will point customers to where appropriate. A spokesperson for United Utilities said: We are sorry that Mrs Pranzo is disappointed with the service she has received. Whilst we will try to help customers when a leak has been identied on their property it is ultimately their responsibility to maintain the water supply pipe to their home. We are still in contact with the customer and we hope they will apply to our lead pipe replacement scheme that can help with grants for replacing lead supply pipes.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON United Utilities PLCCustomer service\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

When Olena Veitaite was five months pregnant she and partner Michael Gapski were told their daughter would need surgery to repair her heart after she was diagnosed with a cardiac condition - an atrioventricular septal defect. Pola was born in June  with Downaposs syndrome and a hole in her heart.The family were referred to leading charity Rainbow Trust before her surgery at Alder Hey, LiverpoolECHO reports. Pola underwent her operation in January when she was six months old to repair the hole in her heart.  The operation was meant to last six hours, but after eight hours the doctor wanted to speak to the parents. Olena, from Blackburn, said: The doctor explained the operation had been very complicated and Pola had had dficulty breathing because of pulmonary consolidation, meaning there was some blood in her lungs. She had to spend ten days in intensive care, initially with an open chest and on breathing machines. It was incredibly hard.  It took  days for Pola to open her eyes as the mum said she cried tears of joy when her daughter appeared to be out of the woods. She added: On  January she opened her eyes. It was amazing and we cried constantly with joy. Gradually she became stronger and the tubes were taken out of her belly and step by step she was getting better. Since September  the family has been supported by Rainbow Trust Family Support Worker, Brodie Stockwell. Olena added: Over time we became more and more comfortable with Brodie and now she feels like a part of the family.When we were in hospital Brodie would accompany me on the ward as only one parent was allowed because of Covid-. I was sleeping at the hospital and only swapping with Michael so that I could eat meals. It was exhausting and having Brodie was such a support.On February , little Pola was finally able to come home. Olena said: As we opened the front door carrying Pola, Michael and I looked at each other and started crying with happiness and relief. We were so thankful that we were coming home with our baby. We love Pola so much and throughout it all Michael and I have always tried to keep positive and Brodie has been such a help.” Rainbow Trust supports families who face the very real possibility that their child might die. To mark the Trustaposs th anniversary they are creating a permanent presence in Liverpool to help families like Polaaposs. Rainbow Trust Chief Executive Zillah Bingley added: For several years we have been aware that there are a number of families in desperate need for the type of support Rainbow Trust provides in and around Liverpool. Rainbow Trust has supported families attending Alder Hey for treatment, like Pola’s family, but until now we have not been able to fund a new team in the area. Thanks to the incredibly generous donation from The Kentown Wizard Foundation this is now a reality. We look forward to working alongside the existing palliative organisations in the region to ensure that our new team can complement the existing support and together make sure that families receive the full care they require.

With his lawyers’ help he came across as a debauched, entitled social reactionary from the world of th century princelings that America cast off in . Andrew seemed to believe his rank made him unaccountable. And the aggression of his defence team in the New York civil action brought by Virginia Giuffre made it much worse. There was also a feeling in America that Andrew had already been judged in another court: The one convened by his own family.  Their draconian steps to strip him of his titles and banish him from public duties may not be trial by jury but it rang out clearly as an unequivocal condemnation by those who know him best. That does not, however, pacy federal prosecutors. They still want Andrew’s help in shedding light on the world of sex-trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. By his own admission, Andrew had known and regularly met Epstein for two decades. In  the New York-based federal prosecutor, Geoffrey Berman, said Andrew “sought to ly portray himself to the public as eager and willing to cooperate” in his investigation but had repeatedly declined to be interviewed. That was bad enough. But when Andrew’s legal team painted Virginia Giuffre as someone compromised by “her own wrongful conduct” rather than as one of the many victims of the depraved Epstein Ghislaine Maxwell menage, it reinforced a certain view of Andrew: That he was incapable of feeling any remorse for believing that he could circulate in that world without being tarnished by it.The Last Queen by Clive Irving is published in paperback by Biteback on Thursday, £..Read MoreRead More Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Ghislaine MaxwellPrince Andrew, Duke of YorkRoyal FamilyCourt caseCrime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Prince of Wales and Prince Harry could be quizzed by policePrince Charles with Michael Fawcett Image: PAByTom PettorCrime EditorRussell MyersRoyal Editor:,  Feb Prince Charles and Prince Harry could be quizzed as witnesses in a cash for honours investigation launched by Scotland Yard.The Prince of Wales and his former right-hand man Michael Fawcett were reported to police over a Saudi billionaire who made donations to royal charities, allegedly after he was promised a knighthood and British citizenship.In a move which could heap further misery on the Queen and Royal Family, the politan Police today announced it had launched a probe.The Prince of Wales, who presented Mahfouz Marei Mubarak bin Mahfouz with an honorary title at a private ceremony at Buckingham Palace in , has denied knowledge of the alleged deal.  The investigation emerged amid calls for transparency about Prince Andrew’s £million civil sex case settlement. The Mirror can reveal the Queen helped Prince Andrew settle the claim by making a £million donation to his sex abuse accuser’s charity. But ­questions were still being asked about whether public money was used. Her Majesty was today seen for the first time since her Covid scare last week, at an engagement at Windsor Castle. Standing with a walking stick, she pointed to her left leg or foot, and said: “Well, as you can see, I can’t move.” Tonight a source close to Charles confirmed the future king is willing to speak to police to help the investigation. They said: “There has been no request for help from the police so far, buthe is asked to help he will of course do so.” The allegations centre around ­businessman Mr Mahfouz donating £.million to restoration projects of particular interest to Prince Charles.  Mr Fawcett, who has since quit as chief executive of Charles’s charity, is alleged to have negotiated with fixers to secure a CBE for the Saudi who was said to be seeking recognition and residency in the UK infor financial contributions to The Prince’s Foundation. Prince Harry met Mr Mahfouz in  and was pictured shaking hands with the billionaire who donated £, to his charity.In December, the Sunday Times revealed that the pair met at a pub in Cha, West London, owned by Mark “Marko” Dyer, a former royal equerry known as Harry’s “second father”, who is said to have brokered the introduction in . They reportedly discussed Sentebale, a charity Harry set up after a gap year in Lesotho, Southern Africa. In response to the report, the Duke of Sussex issued a rare statement saying he had severed his ties with Mr Mahfouz. A spokeswoman for Prince Harry said: “The Duke and his advisers, as well as his nonprofit Sentebale, severed ties with Mr Mahfouz and his associates in , no longer accepting further donations to Sentebale and discontinuing any plans for a fundraising event amid growing concerns over his motives. “The Duke had one planned meeting with this donor nearly eight years ago, did not introduce him to any members of the Royal Family, and expressed concerns about the donor.”  Harry did not say what he believed Mahfouz’s motives were, or specy whether he shared his “concerns” with Charles or Clarence House. Despite the denials, former Met detective sergeant Steve Morris said: “Both Prince Charles and Prince Harry should be questioned without a doubt. “It is all part of the investigation, how the donor got to where he is within the charity, that is vital evidence to show the picture of how he has allegedly infiltrated the charity. “They should both be spoken to at the very least as witnesses. It would involve officers going to their address, or them being invited to a police station to give what’s called a Section  statement, purely as a witness at this moment in time.” Charles is president of the foundation but thought not to be involved with its governance or with trustees overseeing its day-to-day activities. A Clarence House spokesman said: “The Prince of Wales had no knowledge of the alleged offer of honours or British citizenship on the basis of donation to his charities.” Prince Harry could not be reached for comment. The Met is understood to have arranged an investigating team after pressure group Republic contacted Scotland Yard last September and reported Charles and Mr Fawcett on suspicion of breaching the HonoursAct . At the time Clarence House said the Prince had “no knowledge” of the alleged cash-for-honours scandal.Former BBC royal correspondent Peter Hunt tweeted: “This has the potential to be very challenging for Prince Charles. For decades, Michael Fawcett was one of his most powerful confidants.“If their investigation is to be ­credible, the Met police will have to interview the future king in the same way they would any other citizen.”  Mr Mahfouz has previously denied the allegations. Scotland Yard confirmed a probe is under way, saying: “The decision follows an assessment of a September  letter. This related to media reporting alleging offers of help were made to secure honours and citizenship for a Saudi national. The Special Enquiry Team has conducted the assessment process which has included contacting those believed to hold relevant information. “Officers liaised with The Prince’s Foundation about the findings of an independent investigation into fundraising ­practices. The foundation provided a number of relevant documents. “These were reviewed alongside existing information. The assessment determined an investigation will commence. There have been no arrests or interviews under caution.” Read MoreRead More Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Prince HarryPrince Andrew, Duke of YorkPrince Charles, Prince of WalesBBCBuckingham PalaceScotland Yardpolitan PoliceCharitiesRoyal FamilyBillionairesDaily Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The mum from Durham didn’t let her stop that though and took things into her own hands.She documented her efforts on a Facebook group ‘DIY On a Budget UK’, it was reported on LatestDeals. She said: I painted my kitchen in the first lockdown with a dark grey paint as I had seen other people do this but I loved the shaker style kitchens. I just followed lots of home accounts and saw dferent people doing similar things.We had quotes a while back and it ied but it would have been something like £, to replace the kitchen and I couldn’t justy that kind of money when I knew I could update the plain doors to a shaker style myself.” After using MDF, a medium weight fibreboard, in her bedroom for ling as well as on her staircase and hallway, Jill was already self-taught. She continued: I was desperate to do my kitchen and after doing the hall I knew I could do my kitchen. So I contacted a local timber merchant and asked them to cut a sheet of MDF into mm strips, which meant it would cover all the old holes where the handles had been. I chose mm deep as I tried dferent depths of MDF and any thicker it would have caught on the door next to it.”  She cut eachwith a manual saw and asked her local timber merchant to cut a sheet of MDF into mm strips. Jill said: “ I did three light coats with a sponge roller. I used the Valspar v eggshell paint for wood and metal. “It was colour matched to Farrow and Ball Purbeck stone.” She then drilled holes for the doorknobs and replaced the door hinges with soft close hinges so they don’t bang when they close.Jill uploaded the upcycled kitche to her Instagram account which has received more than , views. She concluded: It cost me £ for the MDF, about £ for the primer and eggshell paint and about £ for the new handles and a couple of pounds each for the caulk and adhesive. I have friends who paid about £, at least to have their kitchens professionally painted and that didn’t include changing them with the MDF. People are frightened to try so my advice would be to try painting a little piece of furniture first to get used to painting oryou have a spare kitchen cupboard stuck in the loft then have a little practice on that. “Obviously saving the money is a huge benefit and that means I have that money to spend somewhere .” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Kitchen\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Karen Davison wrote: What a great idea! Do they have braille birthday cards  I have a friend who is blind and this would be amazing. I know you can buy from RNIB online, but just asking. While Steph Laban loved the inclusive range, as she said: Love this. My daughter is fully blind and although she is only  at the moment, I love that she can now enjoy cards the way we do.There was also heaps of praise from Twitter users, including Simon Doherty who said Tescoaposs display was the first time heaposd ever seen braille cards.He noted: Fair play to Tesco, Iaposve never seen braille cards before.  Others called the push to sell accessible braille cards an amazing initiative, and said itaposs something that should have hit shelves years ago. The RNIB confirmed the range of cards the weekend before Valentineaposs Day, where they said they had teamed up with Tesco and Hallmark to design the cards with ied sensory features.

The cards, created by @Hallmark, have ied sensory features on them, including dferent feel, texture and pattern work in addition to braille. The braille cards are part of Tescoaposs continued commitment to offering a more inclusive card selection across its stores.

Just when The Firm thought they had buried one of the most shameful and humiliating periods in its recent history, the Queen has been dealt another hammer blow. Scotland Yard launching a criminal probe into an alleged cash for honours scandal at the heart of one of Prince Charles’s charities is not just another extraordinary development in exceptional times. It may call into question the very fabric of those operating at the heart of the monarchy.  Once again, as she has done many times before in times of trouble, the Queen today summoned the strength to put on a brave face and put duty first. But one could not fail to be moved by her admission, walking stick in hand, that she was unable to move as she would wish while a dignitary was wheeled out for a photo-op at her Windsor home. Just as she should be preparing to revel in the glory of her remarkable  years on the throne, it seems as though events are imploding around her. The family had hoped the shame of Prince Andrew’s involvement with two convicted sex offenders would be finalised ahead of Her Majesty’s Platinum Jubilee celebrations this year. But questions will surely remain over the Queen’s judgment in helping her son make such a settlement to his sex abuse accuser, which largely remains shrouded in secrecy. All of this against a backdrop of another potential scandal, which may see her son Charles and grandson Prince Harry quizzed by police, albeit as witnesses in the first instance. If ever there was a time to unite and collectively take the strain, now is that time for the family. Whether they are too fractured to do so is a story to be continued.

One follower Tricia Davis said: There is no need for it, businesses are struggling enough,you canapost afford to go out until you get paid, donapost go out, its so wrong, I feel sorry for the staff, puts so much pressure on them, its down right cheeky. They should have gone to Tesco got a meal for £. Katie Platt added: Blimey ! That’s a lot of wine on a school night. No wonder they aposforgotapos to pay.  Alex confirmed the bill was settled but added that the pair was also barred from the establishment for good. Many people were impressed with the pubaposs handling of the situation.

The news comes after the UK has had to tolerate two years of Covid , with multiple iants like Omicron, Delta and Alpha taking it in turns to cause havoc, lock down the country and claim the lives of thousands of people. With signs emerging that Omicron is beginning to recede, the government has begun to dramatically scale back restrictions over the UK.In the biggest change yet, mandatory isolation for people who test positive for the virus is due to be lted on February . What is the new Covid iant   It has been labelled ‘Deltacron’ after seemingly exhibiting aspects of the Omicron and Delta iants that have, at dfering points, ripped through the UK. Its scientic name is BA. + B....Experts have reported it has developed in patients who caught both Omicron and Delta at the same time,WalesOnlinereports.The UK Health Security Agency, or UKHSA, is yet to deliver a verdict on how contagious this form of the virus is, or how dangerous it could be for people who catch it.According to theMail , the UKHSA is yet to announce how many cases of the hybrid have been found in the country.Professor Paul Hunter, an infectious diseases expert at the University of East Anglia, told MailOnline: If both Delta and Omicron are falling then, in theory, this [iant] should struggle to take off. Covid iants that are products of recombination are rare but have been known to form at points throughout the pandemic - three cases have arisen in the past with hundreds having been infected. Speaking to the MailOnline, a UKHSA source said: We monitor everything as a matter of course, but we are not particularly anxious about this iant. The developments have led to Deltacron being included in the UKHSA’s iant surveillance report.Indiareports that the iant was initially believed to be a laboratory error, however, its inclusion in the report has signalled that the iant is real.The same publication reports that the UKHSA is yet to report whether the iant was imported to the UK or whether it is native. The Mail report that sources at the UKHSA is “not concerned” by the iant with case numbers remaining low. The findings are contextualised by generally positive news about Covid, with the number of people who have tested positive up to February  having fallen by ,, or .%, in the last seven days.

It means that he has now avoided a potentially explosive trial with the settlement said to be £million.In the past two years since giving a car crash interview on BBC Newsnight about his association with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, Andrewaposs le has changed dramatically. Shortly after the sit-down interview, he sensationally quit public le - announcing it in a statement that was approved by the Queen.Meanwhile, just last month, the Duke of York was stripped of all his military affiliations and royal patronages by his mother the monarch. The statement from Buckingham Palace also said he would continue not to undertake any public duties. Now the civil claim against him has been settled, what could be next for Andrew  We take a look... Public roleThis year, Andrewaposs mother the Queen is celebrating her Platinum Jubilee after marking  years on the throne.In June, there will be a host of celebrations on a bumper four-day long bank holiday weekend. So will we see Andrew at these events or indeed carry out public duties in the future now a settlement has been agreed According to former BBC royal correspondent Jennie Bond, absolutely not. Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up .She told the Mirror: The Queen has already assured the smooth transition of the monarchy by expressing her wish for Camilla to be Queen alongside Prince Charles. And the new King will want a streamlined modern monarchy in which Andrew was already surplus to requirements. He is, of course, a much-loved son and is adored by his ex-we, Fergie, and their two daughters. He will remain part of the royal family into which he was born, and I am sure the Queen will include him in family le. But there can be no public role for him ever again.  The fact is that Prince Andrew will forever remain tarnished by more than a decade of speculation about his friendship with a convicted paedophile.However, a report last week suggested Andrew could make a public appearance at a remembrance service for his late father Prince Philip next month.Sources told the Sun Andrew is expected at the ceremony at Westminster Abbey on March .Duke of York title stripped   While Andrew may have been stripped of his military affiliations and his royal patronages - he still retains his Duke of York title.And even though the civil claim been settled, he is facing renewed calls to give up his ducal title. Labour MP Rachael Maskell, who represents York Central, says Andrew must remove his association with the city in light of the out-of-court settlement reached with Virginia Giuffre. She added that she welcomed the Duke of York’s pledge to donate money to his accuser’s charity, but said his relationship with disgraced Jeffrey Epstein had damaged the city’s reputation. She said: “Although it is a relief that Prince Andrew has finally acknowledged and expressed regret for his close association with a convicted sex offender and sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, his long delay in doing so and initial response to the charges and Ms Giuffre have been source of deep hurt and embarrassment to many people across the city. “Carrying a title does create an ambassadorial relationship with that place, and for somewhere with a global reputation, such as York, this is extremely important.  “It is to be welcomed that he has now pledged to support the fight against the evils of sex trafficking and its victims. “To demonstrate his seriousness in this endeavour, and his respect for those affected by abuse and the people of our city, I would ask that his first act of contrition is to confirm his support for the withdrawal of his ducal title.” Quoting a poll from York’s daily newspaper The Press, she highlighted how  per cent of people in the city who were asked wanted Andrew’s association with it to be removed. Helping sex trafficking victims   In court documents filed yesterday indicating a settlement had been agreed, a statement was included in a letter submitted to US judge Lewis A Kaplan, who has been overseeing the civil sex claim brought by Ms Giuffre.In it, Andrew admitted his regret at his association with Jeffrey Epstein and also vowed to support sex trafficking victims. Part of the statement said: It is known that Jeffrey Epstein trafficked countless young girls over many years. “Prince Andrew regrets his association with Epstein, and commends the bravery of Ms. Giuffre and other survivors in standing up for themselves and others. “He pledges to demonstrate his regret for his association with Epstein by supporting the fight against the evils of sex trafficking, and by supporting its victims.”  However, Nazir Afzal, a former chief prosecutor, has said that he has spoken with many sexual attack victims and claims they have told him they would not work with Andrew.Writing in the Mirror, he said: Victims have been so badly affected by the language his legal team has been using I cannot think any of them will want to be in the same room as him. I’m patron of nine charities working with victims of sex offending. However, he added: I’m happy to offer him the opportunity to meet victims, in confidence, to understand their suffering and how victim-blaming of the type he indulged in will have affected them.

Two smaller doses of the Pfizer jab,  weeks apart, will be available to this age group to help control future Covid waves after Covid curbs have been lted.Professor Wei Shen Lim, Covid chair of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation , said: The Committee has carefully considered the potential direct health impacts of vaccination and potential indirect educational impacts.The main purpose of offering vaccination to --year-olds is to increase their protection against severe illness in advance of a potential future wave of Covid-.Here is all you need to know...  What is the advice  The JCVI advice is for parents of --year-olds to get them vaccinated “ they feel comfortable” to protect against possible future Covid waves. They fear that should a new iant trigger a wave, at that point it will be too late to get all children in this age group protected by vaccination in time. The very small chance of severe complications in this age group is thought to be bigger than the even smaller chance of severe vaccine side effects. Some % of - year olds are thought to have already had Covid, however immunity wanes over time, particularly against mild infection.  What is dferent about this advice  While the independent experts advise that this age group should have the jab, the JCVI have issued a more nuanced message and stress it is not an emergency programme like previous vaccine drives. They say parents should not rush to get them vaccinated against Covid at the expense of school time or other childhood vaccinations such as the MMR jab. In the older  to  age group so far . million have received at least one dose.  What was considered when deciding to recommend jabs for this age group  While school absences were considered this was not a signicant factor. This was because pupils can require time off with mild side effects - such fever, headache or sore arm - as well as requiring time off due to Covid. The main factor was the risk of serious illness to the child. The JCVI weighed up the extremely low risk of severe Covid symtoms versus the extremely low risk of severe vaccine side effects.  What is my child’s risk  In a future Covid wave between  and  cases of a rare inflammatory condition called PIMS-TS triggered by Covid will be prevented for every million double vaccinated - year olds. The JCVI also estimates that between  and  Covid hospitalisations will be prevented per million double jabbed in this age group, as well as up to three ICU admissions. This was compared to the risk of the most worrying vaccine side effect of Covid- vaccines, known as myocarditis. This is inflammation of the heart muscle and it is still unclear how harmful it is in the long term. The JCVI estimates it occurs in less than two per million children given the Pfizer jab.  How will rollout work It is yet to be decided whether vaccines will be administered to - year olds in schools or NHS centres.From April this age group will be offered two  micrograms doses of the Pfizer vaccine This is much less than the  microgram doses given to adults. They will be administered at least  weeks apart but the second dose may be delayed so it can be administered during school holidays. This is to avoid school absences caused by minor side effects such as fever, headache and sore arm.

Victoria’s Secret has launched a string of initiatives over the past few years to try and regain credibility in the face of declining sales and past accusations of a culture of misogyny at the business.Recent moves by the company include its first mastectomy bra, racially erse models promoting underwear in dferent skin tones, and hiring transgender beauty Valentina Sampaio after being criticised for its lack of ersity.

As well as modelling, she works as an activist with her No Limits campaign, called Sin Límites, which aims to raise awareness about Down’s Syndrome.  Sofia also founded her own brand, Alavett, launching its online store in . She came to global attention when she made her catwalk debut at New York Fashion Week in February . She said she hoped her success would inspire other people with Down’s. Speaking at the time she said: “I am proud as one of the few models with Downaposs syndrome who have managed to participate in the important fashion event. “Modelling in the United States was the beginning of conquering the dream I have had since an early age - to model on the most important runways in the world.”  Victoria’s Secret launched their Love Cloud collection on Monday designed to be comfortable everyday underwear as part of their ongoing efforts to rebrand. The campaign sees  women modelling the range, some are professional models while others are inspiring women, to reinforce the message that the brand is for everyone. The inclusive campaign features Celilo Miles, a Nez Perce Tribe-Wildland firefighter and Sylvia Buckler, an accessory designer who models the bra while cradling her pregnant belly. Speaking to Vogue, Celilo said she still cannot believe she was selected for the campaign. aposI used to watch the Victoriaaposs Secret fashion show and wish that I could be up on that stage. aposEveryone wanted to be in that club, but you knew you didn’t belong there, she said. She added that when she started modelling she tried to lose weight in order to fit a size she could not sustain because she believed it was the done thing. The campaign also features plus-sized models like Paloma Elsesser, and Devyn Garcia.Voguehas noted the collection is the first under the tenure of Victoriaaposs Secretaposs new creative director Raúl Martinez, who has been working hard at rethinking how the brand markets itself to women.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON New York Fashion WeekLingerieDowns syndrome\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The family plan to keep a couple of the items as a memento of their totaposs adventure and have ed the rest to a nearby Walmart supermarket.  Thankfully, they have been told they will receive a refund. But Madhu told NBC New York she is taking measures to make sure no more online shopping can take place. He’s so little, he’s so cute, we were laughing that he ordered all this stuff, she said. It is really hard to believe that he has done this, but that’s what happened.  I need one or two items, why would we need four of the same thing  The mum has said that she will be placing much tighter controls on all her devices to prevent any more of Ayaanshaposs shopping sprees. She added: Moving forward, we will put tough passcodes or face recognition so when he picks up the phone he finds it in locked condition.

Another person asked her outright why she had to pay for the tightsthey are a mandatory part of the unorm, remarking in my opinion the boss should provide them for free..

At any wedding, the newlywed husband and we are the focal point and usually hold most of the attention - and itaposs up to the guests to follow dress codes and instructions laid out by the stars of the show. But one mum on Reddit has been left fuming after she was recently kicked out of her cousinaposs wedding for letting her four-year-old daughter wear a tiara to the event, and then refusing to take it off when she was asked to do so by the bride.Sharing her story anonymously, the woman said her daughter has a fascination with princesses and loves wearing tiaras, but was asked to take the hair accessory off at the wedding because the bride wanted to be the only one wearing one.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. The -year-old mum wrote: My daughter Chloe has a fascination with princesses. She loves the colour pink, wears only dresses, and has an array of tiaras that she wears everywhere - except to pre-school, where she canapost. My cousin Alex invited us to his wedding, which was this past Saturday. Chloe was excited because she got to dress up and stay dressed up the entire time. She also couldn’t wait to see the bride’s dress. She askedshe could wear her princess tiara and I said of course. We got to the wedding on time. However, the start time was delayed for unknown reasons.  minutes after it was supposed to start, one of the bridesmaids came out and told me that the bride, Jen, was refusing to come out because my daughter was wearing a tiara.  I thought she was joking but she wasn’t. Apparently, the bride was also wearing a tiara and wanted to be the only one wearing it. The mum put her foot down and refused to remove her daughteraposs tiara, but was confronted by her cousin Alex, who told her she would have to leave the weddingshe didnapost comply with the request. She added: I told the bridesmaid that Chloe loves tiaras and always wears them. The bridesmaid said aposnot today she isn’tapos and told me it needed to be removed. I said no. The bride is a grown woman and was being petty over a child’s tiara. The bridesmaid left for a couple of minutes and then Alex himself came out. He told me to leave. I asked why and he said it was because I won’t tell Chloe to take off her tiara.  I said this was ridiculous and Alex said it’s not my wedding and when I get married then Chloe can wear one to mine, but that I’m officially uninvited regardless. Others around me told me to just take it off and I wouldn’t. Alex’s mum came over and escorted us out. The mum was baffled by the turn of events but agreed to leave the wedding - with her daughter left upset and crying out of fear that sheaposd done something wrong. She said: Chloe was upset and crying because she feels she did something wrong, and I’m upset because I can’t believe someone would be jealous over a literal -year-old. I also feel bad because Chloe was really looking forward to seeing Jen’s dress because she loves wedding dresses. But no one is on my side. And while commenters on Reddit agreed that the request to remove the tiara was slightly over-the-top, they also believed the mum was petulant and entitled for putting her foot down on the issue. One person wrote: You seriously need to parent-up and teach your kid that thereaposs a time and place for indulging your inner princess, and a time and place for sitting back, following dress codes and letting other people shine. For example, at their own goddamn weddings. You were asked nicely but were petulant and entitled. You caused this, itaposs not over a child, itaposs over your lack of parenting. Thereaposs a reason nobody is on your side. While another added: I agree with this. The four-year-old should be taught the time and place for attire. She didnapost wear a tiara to preschool, as mentioned by the mum, so a wedding is also a specic occasion. I personally would find it cuteI were the bride, but everyone is dferent I guess.

Eight years after the flight vanished, a new report claims to have found the “exact location” of the Malaysian Airlines jet.It vanished in March , along with the  passengers and crew onboard, with no one able to confirm what happened to it. The plane departed Kuala Lumpur bound for Beijing on March , but lost contact with air traffic control after  minutes. However now, new technology could solve the nearly decade old mystery. Australian air safety investigators have renewed their search after a report from Richard Godfrey, a British aerospace engineer.  He has claimed that the plane went down km west of Perth and currently sits at the bottom of the ocean under ,m of water. Angus Mitchell of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau has renewed focus on what he calls “the largest unsolved mystery of our time”. Mr Mitchell stressed he did not want give the victims’ families  hope, but said that Mr Godfrey’s research was “credible” but stopped short of saying it would be enough to find the aircraft.In an upcoming Sky News Australia documentary, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau has confirmed it and Geoscience Australia have been looking over Godfreyaposs data. While the bureauaposs involvement in the search officially concluded five years ago, their new chief commissioner Mitchell has renewed focus on the missing plane. Godfrey, a Germany-based Brit, first became interested in doomed flights after the Air France Flight  vanished on its way from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, in May .  He had been due to fly on it, but was asked to remain in South America on business, which delayed his departure by two weeks, saving his le. The flight disappeared with  people on board and it was only found in the Atlantic two years later.

Amongst these is Beinn Odhar # its southern slopes lying firmly in the county of Stirling, whilst its summit stands proudly in Argyll.If approached from the west, north or south you could keep your toes in Argyll all day. Unless on a round of Corbetts # there are five here that make a fine challenge # it is easier to approach the Corbett via its gentler slopes from Tyndrum. This also gives the opportunity to explore the adit # access tunnel # and old lead mine on its higher slopes where the mineral vein continuation from Sron nan Colan is exposed. The Beinn Odhar lead mining venture appears to have been a short one but the views once the summit is reached are tremendous.Leaving the car park, cross the A and head left passing the Tyndrum Inn, the Green Welly Stop and cross the bridge.Turn right immediately after crossing the bridge to join the West Highland Waynorthwards, passing the KeyStore.You will need to stay on the WHW for the next .km as it slowly climbs out of Tyndrum with the A on your left and the Crom Allton your right until you reach the bridges over the burn and railway.Cross the bridges and go through the gate at the north end. You will be heading up on to the open hillside to your right.You now have a choice. Either head straight up in a north easterly direction picking your own route on the grassy slopes or veer slightly right back to the Crom Allt to pick up a faint path. If you use the latter, ensure you head upwards at around NN. Either way you will tend to end up on sections of the old mining path as it zigs zags upwards by default due to the natural line of the slope.Once you reach m # after approximately .km depending on how direct your route was # the ground becomes stonier. The adit and mine are higher to your left, northwest, on the crest of the ridgeline, whereas the faint path runs just under this soyou want to explore them it is worth scrabbling up the rocks to have a look. The bottom of the adit starts at around ms.Heading up from the adit and mine # or path # the route flattens out, passing a lochan and the county boundary to your left. Ahead, the final ascent is best tackled by heading northeast then northwest to follow the hill’s natural line. There are no particular dficulties.The summit views are fabulous and an excellent panorama of Beinn Dorain can be had from the steep northern slopes above Coire Luaidh.It is easiest todown the southwestern slopes you ascended, but other possibilities could include some of the neighbouring Corbetts, especially the longer days in summer.Safety in the outdoorsThe described routes and accompanying information are there to be used as a guide and do not replace the use of map and compass and the skills required to use them.Whilst every effort is made to ensure the route is accurate at the time of going to print,  please be aware track and path closures can happen at any time.

Their hard work puts food on our plates, produced to some of the highest standards in the world, and their stewardship knits together the environmental and social fabric of our iconic landscape.Their remarkable adaptability, resilience and hard work, though, comes at a price.In an industry that continues to have the poorest safety record of any UK occupation, making sure we look after our physical and mental wellbeing has never been more relevant.The Farm Safety Foundation charity # also known as Yellow Wellies # is this week running its fth annual Mind Your Head campaign to break down mental health barriers in farming.A recent study by the foundation revealed that mental health issues among farmers and agricultural workers are of growing concern and are having a direct impact on safety # with  per cent of farmers under the age of  suggesting poor mental health is the biggest hidden problem facing farmers today .In an industry where  farm workers lost their lives in farm incidents in  , an additional  farming-related suicides were registered in England and Wales by the Office of National Statistics.Farm Safety Foundation manager Stephanie Berkeley said: #I think it is time we dealt with the issue of poor mental health head-on.#My father always advised me to never judge anyone unless you walked in their shoes, which are words I live by.#It is important to know what is really going on behind the smiling or grumpy demeanour.#Many in rural communities are suffering and doing so in silence.#As an industry, it#s time to ease the pressure, stop expecting people to be perfect and start talking openly about feelings with people you trust.#The Mind Your Head campaign aims to dispel the myths and tackle stigma around mental health and highlight the support available to those living and working in farming.Actor Kelvin Fletcher, who last year bought a -acre farm in the Peak District, is supporting the campaign.He said: #I feel really privileged to have been welcomed so warmly by the farming community, who have supported me so much since I started my farm last year. Before joining farming, I had no idea the community was so heavily impacted by bad mental health.#If one person reads about Mind Your Head and decides to reach out or to check in on a loved one, that’s a step in the right direction.#Please, be that person and start the conversation. You never know how much it could mean to someone struggling silently.#For more information on the Mind Your Head campaign visit www.yellowwellies.org or follow @yellowwelliesUK on social media using the hashtag #MindYourHead."},{"url":null,"title":"council-provide-free-emergency-service-website-residents","story":"UPDATE FROM SBC -  The amber warning for windhas been amended and now runs from pm to midnight on Wednesday.

And the Bonnyrigg player was lucky to escape further punishment when he demonstrated his frustration by booting a stray ball over the fence into the adjacent field.Gala continued to dominate in the second-half and player manager Scott came on for his first appearance since taking over from Neil Hastings.And with his first-touch the former Hibs’ player  set up Murray who scored with a superb low angled drive..removeScott then tried his luck with a long-range effort from the half-way line but the keeper got back to save his shot.He then demonstrated his skills on the right wing before firing a low cross into the danger area but there were no takers.With time running out Rose were awarded a penalty, but Kit McRitchie produced a fine ing save to deny Curie and Rovers held on for a well-deserved - victory.Scott told us: “Before the game we told the players that we believe in them.“And we set our stamp on the game early-doors with a goal in the sixth minute and another in the th minute. Normally we have been conceding at these times of late. But to get the first goal then go on to have a dominant performance for the -minutes was very pleasing.“They had a - minute spell of pressure after the sending off but we got a foothold back in the game and it was comfortable in the end.“It’s been a learning curve and myself and Stevieare learning about the team and how they react in dferent situations and how we manage situations going forward.”Craig praised the contribution of Scott and told us. ”He’s hardly trained in three months due to a thigh and a calf problem. I’ve been trying to encourage him and told him that he was capable of playing and managing at Lowland League level. He’s got too much to offer on the pitch just now.

We welcome anything which helps them to navigate this dficult territory.”He added: “However, we are keen that this should not be over-prescriptive as it could have the unintended consequence of deterring open discussions.”Mr Zahawi said: “I know one of the reasons many teachers feel so passionate about the profession is the remarkable role they play in young people’s lives, helping them understand more about themselves and their views of the world.“I don’t want there to be any barriers – real or perceived – to teachers’ vital work in this space, which is why I am reinforcing that no subject is off-limits in the classroom, as long as it is treated in an age-appropriate way, with sensitivity and respect, and without promoting contested theories as fact.“Clearer guidance on political impartiality is just one part of my wider work to give children the best possible education as the Government continues to prioritise skills, schools and families, to enable young people to reach the full height of their potential.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Schools given  uimpartiality guidance u on teaching of racism and British Empire"},{"url":null,"title":"ross-brawn-believes-mercedes-red-bull-playing-catch-up-2022","story":"Formula One motorsport executive Ross Brawn believes Lewis Hamilton’s Mercedes team could be off the pace when the new season starts.Hamilton’s toxic championship battle with Red Bull rival Max Verstappen went down to the wire last year.And Brawn, who has spearheaded a massive overhaul of the sport’s technical regulations, says Mercedes – winners of the past eight constructors’ championships – and Red Bull might have taken their eyes off the ball.️⃣️⃣ is back. 💜🔥 pic YtSNvTFt— Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS F TeamFebruary , Jenson Button profited in  when Brawn GP took advantage of a regulation change, winning six of the opening seven races en route to the title.Hamilton was the defending champion at the time but his McLaren team endured a torrid campaign and he took just two victories.The budget cap for the forthcoming year also restricts teams to spending million US dollars .“Mercedes and Red Bull could be impacted,” said Brawn. “Last year, human resources were devoted to fighting a very intense world championship.“Some of the teams further back didn’t have that consideration.vw,vw,px, px\"Max Verstappen beat Lewis Hamilton to last year’s world championship “If I had been Ferrari or McLaren in the very early part of last year, I would have put everything into the  car.“That is what happened in .

firm to claim three precious league points.A healthy crowd of almost  turned out in dreadful conditions, with gusts topping  miles per hour and intermittent sheets of freezing rain greeting those spectators who arrived to support the team.Refreshingly, though, a group of youngsters were amongst the entourage travelling with the north Glasgow visitors, and they soon felt at home, happily mixing with the Pupils# own young supporters and joining in song.First, an attempted Pupils clearance found its way to Finnart#s number , who kept his composure to slot home a close-range finish and make it two goals in two games against the Pupils.Then, a header from a swirling cross from Finnart#s left-hand side couldn#t be kept out, despite the efforts of Alasdair Ferguson in goal.The Pupils# Rhys Casci did go close with a one-on-one effort in the first half after being freed by a low pass from midfield, but the Tarbert-based player opted to shoot early and the keeper got his body in front of the effort and gathered at the second attempt.After the interval, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils hoped to use the westerly tailwind to put pressure on the visitors# goal, but it was a quieter half than the hosts would have liked.Finnart battled to repel the Pupils, limiting them to two dangerous efforts from outside the box, first from Casci who forced a save from the away keeper to tip his low shot round the post for a corner, and then from Scott Souden whose deflected effort forced the keeper into a save.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils made some changes late on with youngster Andrew Renton and right-back Michael McKinlay making afrom injury, but it wasn’t enough to turn the tide of the game and the visitors took all three points, to leave themselves two points behind leaders Kilsyth Athletic with two games in hand.Conversely, the Pupils are three points adrt at the foot of the ision, but importantly have two games in hand themselves.In the aftermath of the game, the Pupils# management team stated they were satisfied with the effort and performance level of the squad, acknowledging that the dference between the sides on the day, despite the polar dference in league positions, was the conversion of chances.This is something which Finnart has made an art form of in winning games against sides around them who perhaps play more expansive football.Sure enough, this was the case against the Pupils, for the fourth time this season.Tomorrow , the Pupils are on their travels, playing Glenvale FC at Ferguslie Park, Paisley.

He was protected well by right back Conner Brown, left back Burns and central defensive pairing Ross Souden and captain Keith Mitchell.With less than  minutes remaining, McCallum – who had shted into central midfield with the introduction of second sub and debutant Cameron Wylie at right midfield – intercepted a ball from a Glenvale player, his tackle putting Lang one on one with the hosts# keeper.Lang showed excellent composure for his tender years to slot the ball low into the net with his right foot, just inside the box, his teammates joining him in celebration.After seeing out the final five minutes of regulation time, four nervy minutes of added time were played as Glenvale pushed for an equaliser.In the st minute, Ferguson was called upon to make the save of the day, stopping a powerful Glenvale drive from  yards out, before a Pupils defender cleared the danger.The final whistle sounded soon after and the Pupils# squad and management could cheer a hard-earned, much-needed win, especially impressive considering the inexperience of much of the squad, who are still learning at this level, but judging by this showing, are certainly contributing.Tomorrow , the Pupils host high-flying Harmony Row from Govan, at Kintyre Park.Kick-off pm.

Avoid plantingthe ground is frozen or extremely waterlogged.Your planting hole should be no deeper than the roots, but at least three times the diameter of the root ball.It#s a good idea to soak bare-rooted trees for about  minutes before planting.Place the tree in the planting hole so the first flare of roots on the stem are level with the soil surface. If you plant the tree too deep, it can result in rot and disease.You may need to insert a stake for top heavy or larger trees. Refill the planting hole, firm gently and water in.Drought stress is common in newly-planted trees so make sure you keep watering throughout the growing season. The quantity required will y with soil type, but  to  litres per square metre – four to six watering cans – each week in dry weather will do the trick.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to sow lettuce seeds – both under cover and outside.If you start now, it will give you a continuous supply that can be harvested throughout the year.Sow in modules or fibre pots under cover to have lettuces ready to plant outside in four to six weeks. You can also sow outdoors, but use cloches or small poly tunnels until next month when the soil has warmed up. They will also provide your lettuce seedlings with protection from birds and slugs.Good ieties to start now include cut-and-come again Salad Bowl – oak leaved, high yield with green and red ieties a

drivers who remain in charging spaces beyond a permitted duration – or after their session is complete – can also receive notications to vacate the space, allowing others to access the charger and avoiding fines.Councillor John McMillan, East Lothian Council transport spokesperson, said: “For those who don’t have a safe place to park and charge at home, seeing live, on-street status in their

Were the white-toothed, perennially cheerful brothers too nice and squeaky clean to have had a pop le worth writing about What of the music, Jay  How did the boys from Utah feel when Donny’s arrival onto the stage dragged them from the pop- rock world into the land of ‘bubblegum And what of the dynamic of The Osmonds  How do you keep seven egos in check, decide who holds the power  And there’s the religious factor. In the s and s, The Osmonds were rarely described without the adjective Mormon attached.We begin however with a chat about how the musical came about. “Five years ago I was thinking of writing a book about our story when a producer friend of mine said he thought the story should become a musical,” says the band’s drummer. “And he said it should be told from my perspective. Now, I’ve never written a musical before. And we’d been approached several times over the years with offers to create a musical based on The Osmonds. But the timing felt right and he encouraged me to go it alone.”Jay Osmond met with Andrew Lloyd Webber’s producers and five years later the story has been completed. He recognised immediately, however, it couldn’t be just a series of links to connect the  songs performed in the show.“I wanted to show people the dferent sides of The Osmonds. People knew we had a tight-knit group but no one knew the reason for this. I wanted to reveal what made us tough [dad George instilled this] and how we managed to get over the obstacles.”The story begins in  when the brothers were hired to appear on the Andy Williams Show and took America by storm.We flash forward to the s and then back to the s, which suggests the script is far from simplistic.Osmond also had to trace the group’s evolution, from iety act to pop rockers, to chart toppers. The shting tones gave the band longevity but must have created schisms  “I love that question because it sums up the reality of conflict exactly. It was hard, because we played as The Osmonds, and then Donny joined and we became his backing band.“It was hard for people to categorise us. You know, we’ve put out  albums over the years, we’ve sang and danced and done it all, but because of that you have identity issues.”In the same yearwhen Donny came out with Puppy Love, the brothers released the rocking Crazy Horses. And when you add to that little Jimmy Osmond’s Long Haired Lover From Liverpool, the team were covering all the bases, but radio station playlist schedulers found them hard to pigeon hole.Jay Osmond knew that the show, which features two sets of Osmonds,had to address that dilemma.But he also had to deal with their personal lives, holding relationships together, all the time remembering they were a family unit, as well as a band.“We had a voting system,” he reveals, with the hint that democracy wasn’t always smooth.And there was the Mormon tag. Did the association deny them the chance to be seen as rockers  “Well, it’s almost like you’ve seen the musical because that’s exactly what we deal with. At one point we were called ‘The Mormon Von Trapp family.’”What of the disparate voices in the band  Has he reflected those in his writing  “Yes, the Osmonds’ story may have been dferent had it been written by Merrill for example. Or Donny. So, I wrote it how I saw it. And you’re right I was concerned at first that this was my story.“But each one of the brothers has come up to me and said how much they support the project. And the other night Donny wrote me a note saying, ‘Not only do I support this, I believe in you.’”That’s nice. But then that’s what you’d expect from The Osmonds. Fundamentally nice people who look out for each other. “We’ve always had this ‘one for all and all for one,’ motto.” He grins: “But as you can imagine, it’s sometimes been dficult to push your own priorities aside.”What have been the toughest parts of the Osmond’s journey  The constant pressure to produce albums  Going out on the road constantly  Having to wear the Elvis rhinestone suits, or cope with Donny and Marie on the telly  “One of things I struggled with was bringing out my personal view within a family system.\"And how to progress musically. On top of that we had a lot of dferent people telling us what to do. And yet all the time we had to make the decisions that were best for the family.”It’s a dynamic most groups never even have to contemplate. “But I think we pulled it off. We’ve had people come up to me and say, ‘Wow, what a boy band!’ And they’re talking of a band that was in the charts  years ago.”Indeed. The Osmond’s story is tale of longevity. And fun. And some very good songs. But with some searching into how it was all possible.There’s little doubt that Wyoming-based Jay Osmond has loved the family band journey, even coping with all the competition that came their way, such as the Bay City Rollers. “The boys were great,” he says with real generosity of spirit. “The Jacksons were our buddies.”His voice becomes a little more serious. “You know, the hardest part of my career has been putting this musical together, so that it’s real and heartfelt.”The reviews suggest the drumming Osmond has pulled it off. And it’s a chance to showcase his own talent.He adds “I’ve always been a team player, never one to go up front but this has changed that. And I feel great about it.”The Osmonds - A New Musical, Kings Theatre, Glasgow, runs until this Saturday .

Let’s not throw away this huge opportunity that we have.With regard to the cost of fuel, as mentioned by Leonard Maguirethe increase in cost is not the fault of the renewable energy companies, it is profiteering by the major oil and gas companies. A windfall tax on these companies could help alleviate the dficulties that many people are having heating their homes. In the mid to long term these dficulties will be overcome by relatively cheap renewable energy. In addition, it will be no longer possible for foreign countries, and indeed the big oil companies, to literally and metaphorically hold us over a barrel and increase prices once renewables become our main source of energy.And,your correspondents cannot see the signicance of reduced carbon footprints and preventing climate change, let them note the serious storms that we have been having recently which may well be a portent of increasingly dficult weather problems coming our way.So, come on Scotland, let’s lead the world in renewables the way we did in offshore oil and gas.John Palfreyman, Coupar Angus.* IT is dficult to see how a reduction to Scotland’s minuscule . per cent of global emissions could make any dference to our climate, and I suppose Lorna Slater and her party would not be able keep the lights onoil production stopped as they intend. If Ms Slater actually believes what she is doing is worthwhile, then she is fighting on moral grounds.

Whose freedom are we talking about exactly Freedom in the purest sense is only possibleyou live in a bubble, alone, or on a desert island where your actions have no bearing or result on others.Now, people are entitled to their own opinion, as long as it is not coercion to their own world view. Presumably, since these freedom fighters think that most people dont die, they dont mind many more filling hospital beds unnecessarily. And,they are one of those needing hospitalisation, they dont mind sacricing their hospital bed for others and suffering or even dying horribly in their own home, without causing a fuss. Or,they find their hospital bed is filled, when they need an urgent operation for an unrelated matter, they dont mind waiting in pain.Tellingly, this protest is more about themselves, not others.Trevor Rigg, Edinburgh.TELL THE PENICILLIN BACK STORYI HEARTILY endorse the wish expressed by Alastair Clarkthat you and other publications will commemorate the centenary of the discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming.The story is well known: Fleming had ed from a holiday, and was tidying up his laboratory, disposing of old petri dishes and their contents. However, he was struck by seeing that one dish, in which had contained a culture of a very virulent micro-organism, had been contaminated by mould, and this mould had markedly disrupted the germs growth.Most peoplewould probably have thought How interesting\" and simply dunked the dish into the bucket of disinfectant. Fleming appreciated the signicance of this finding, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine.He thought that this discovery could be used to identy germs, but its development into a drug followed a rather convoluted path.It was not until  that the therapeutic aspects of penicillin began to be explored in Oxford by Howard Florey, from New Zealand, and Ernst Chain, a refugee Austrian Jew . Florey and Chain cultured the mould, and extracted penicillin from it, successfully treating patients for as long as they could maintain supplies, but they were working on a very \"cottage industry\" basis.In order for penicillin to become widely available, it was necessary to enlist the help of the US pharmaceutical industry, which could produce it on a large scale. Even so, they had much dficulty, because the penicillin molecule is fastidious.Thus, I hope that any journalistic production would, as well as praising the pioneers, spare some effort to celebrate the contributions made by many others which must have saved countless lives, and prevented much disability.Christopher W Ide, Waterfoot.ON NEUTRAL GROUNDPERHAPS it might be an idea to revert to some previous post-revolutionary gender-neutral terms for everyone: for example, Citizenor Comrade .

The advice to take regular lateral flow tests is also expected to be dropped.It isn’t clear who would be eligible for free tests but this is thought to be those who are more vulnerable to coronavirus including older people and those with underlying health conditions.Reports suggest people could still be given free lateral flow tests when they test positive – but this may also be limited to at-risk groups.: Scotland to follow Wales and offer Covid vaccines to  to -year-oldsSage, the independent group of advisers who have been counselling the Government throughout the pandemic, cautioned against removing free testing.The group said getting rid of free testing would make it harder for people to take precautions and “may also increase anxiety among those who have found testing reassuring after possible exposure, particularly those who are, or live with, someone who is clinically vulnerable”.Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said it was essential that all the devolved governments were involved in decisions about free testing.He said there could be situations in the future where free tests are recommended by public health in some parts of the UK but not others and said the Westminister government had a duty to honour its funding obligation.He said: “Free tests and being required to isolate when testing positive are effective in addressing the virus and should remain for as long as the expert public health advice recommends. We are clear that all devolved administrations must be involved in any decisions about any changes to testing.“If we reach a point that public health advice in any part of the UK is that testing should be maintained while others end it, the UK Government must honour its commitment to ensuring they remain funded.\"This is crucial to ensure all parts of the UK have the capability to address future iants that may emerge, which is why any decisions must be driven by public health advice.”: GP patients want telephone appointments to continue but say they are worse than face-to-faceChanges to free LFTs and PCR tests are expected to be announced under the Government’s “Living Safely with Covid” strategy, which is due to be revealed on February .All remaining domestic Covid legal restrictions in England are likely to be scrapped later this month.Asked on BBCs Good Morning Scotland to justy why Scotland will have the UKs most stringent measures, Mr Swinney said: \"I dont think that is the case.\"We have relaxed very signicantly the restrictions within Scotland. We have the existing arrangments of the wearing of face masks in public and to a certain extent within the school estate although that is going to be changing.Mr Swinney said it was important to have a legal framework in place to be able to act swlycases surge once again to protect public health.He said: \"Covid has not gone away, its not ended. Anyone who puts that argument around is just misleading people.\"Covid is still a signicant theat to public health. Weve got to proceed with care but also apply the proportionate test and thats what the Scottish Government looks at, at all times to make sure the measures are proportionate.\""},{"url":null,"title":"wordle-242-todays-wordle-february-16-hints","story":"The aim of the game is to find a  letter word in only six attempts.The game uses the same rules as Scrabble, where only real words are allowed both in guesses and the result.If you get a letter in the right spot and form the correct word, the square turns green.Butthe guessed letter is in the word but not in the right spot, the square turns yellow.Letters that are wrong turn grey to help the process of elimination for the six tries.If you’re still trying to save your streak, then don’t scroll down yet, maybe some hints will send you on your way. Today’s word starts with the letter C and ends with the letter K.There are  vowels in today’s word.It is a waterproof filler and sealant. If you have given up on today’s game, then we can save you the misery.

We lost four players in January. Four important players for Tottenham, and we brought in only two.“So even just in terms of numbers, rather than reinforce the squad, we on paper may have weakened it.”Conte has been backed with ready-made signings at Juventus, Cha and Inter but says he now knows that will not be the case at Spurs.“Bentancur and Kulusevski are ideal prospects for Tottenham, because Tottenham are seeking young players they can develop and grow, not players who are ready. That is the issue,” he added.“This is the vision and the philosophy of the club. It is inevitable thatyou want to grow quicker andyou want to be competitive more rapidly, you need players with a lot of experience, because they also raise the experience level of the overall team.“But I repeat, I have realised now that this is the vision of the club.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

We welcome anything which helps them to navigate this dficult territory.”He added: “However, we are keen that this should not be over-prescriptive as it could have the unintended consequence of deterring open discussions.”Mr Zahawi said: “I know one of the reasons many teachers feel so passionate about the profession is the remarkable role they play in young people’s lives, helping them understand more about themselves and their views of the world.“I don’t want there to be any barriers – real or perceived – to teachers’ vital work in this space, which is why I am reinforcing that no subject is off-limits in the classroom, as long as it is treated in an age-appropriate way, with sensitivity and respect, and without promoting contested theories as fact.“Clearer guidance on political impartiality is just one part of my wider work to give children the best possible education as the Government continues to prioritise skills, schools and families, to enable young people to reach the full height of their potential.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

The year before there was a big battle between Ferrari and McLaren and they fell flat on their faces. I don’t think it will be that severe but is a good point.“A team has to balance its financial resources each season, too, and you cannot simply throw money at it. That is what teams with deep pockets did in the past. It will provide us with a more competitive field for the future.”Hamilton’s gripping title tussle with Verstappen contributed to one of the sport’s greatest seasons and there is a possibility that F’s rulebook rewrite could thwart a second chapter.But Brawn added: “Last year was a great season between two drivers and two teams. But we really would like to see more teams in that battle. is feeling good so far. 🖤 Thanks for all the messages everyone. pic hACagIyIS— George RussellFebruary , “I don’t think the regulations will change the general order dramatically – the good teams will always do a good job – but it will bring the field closer.“We are blessed with a number of great drivers – McLaren’s Lando Norris, Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz at Ferrari and George Russell moving to Mercedes – sothere are three or four drivers in the mix for the title than that is even better.”Hamilton, , will speak in public for the first time since his title defeat in Abu Dhabi when he appears at Mercedes’ Silverstone car launch on Friday.The seven-time world champion is set to drive his new Silver Arrows at the opening test in Barcelona next week ahead of the first race in Bahrain on March .We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

You are even more nervous on qualiers day than on finals day. I just wanted to put down a clean run and after that I was like, ‘phew, all the pressure is off’.”Atkin revealed she feared her Olympic debut might not have happened: “I had a couple of mishaps,” she added. “I missed my flight on the way here and I forgot to set an alarm this morning.”Atkin’s sister Izzy was also named in the team for Beijing but despite travelling to the Chinese capital, she was forced to withdraw from both Big Air and slopestyle events due to injury.Chinese superstar Eileen Gu, who is looking to add to the gold and silver medals she has already claimed at this Games, topped the qualying standings on . points with Canada’s Rachael Karker one point behind.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

This falls in with ‘Candlemas’ on nd February as a Christian festival and a traditional end of the Christmas season. Candlemas commemorates the presentation of the infant Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem as described in St Luke’s Gospel and when some denominations bring candles to their church. Candlemas is also one of the so-called ‘Quarter-days’ marking the changing seasons of winter, spring, summer and autumn. It is followed by Whitsun, Lammas Day and Martinmas as the term-days with their administrative and legal implications for the payment of rents and flittings. Saint Bride or Saint Bridget has been one of the most popular of the saints of the celtic church. Of course, there were many ‘Bridgets’, but the one whose festival date is on st February was ‘Bridget of Kildare’ in Leinster whose death was dated to AD . Bridget was one of the patron saints of Ireland and is remembered in the tradition of plaiting rush crosses around st February to set over doors and windows to protect the home from fire and other danger.   or the endearing ‘Bride’s little fosterling’.’ . ‘Bride’s Day, the birthday of spring’. century, traditions of Saint Bride were collected by Alexander Carmichael among his prayers, hymns, blessings and charms from the Hebrides. He suggests that accounts of Saint Bride were not easily recovered and summarised the tradition: ‘The serpent is supposed to emerge from its hollow among the hills on St Bride’s Day, and a propitiatory hymn was sung to it. Only one verse of this hymn has been obtained, apparently the first. It dfers in dferent localities: [Early on Bride’s mornThe serpent shall come from the hole, I shall not molest the serpent, Nor will the serpent molest me.’ The snake is a powerful element in mythology and religion and a creature to be respected as the ‘hymn’ makes clear. Familiar in the snake coiled round the rod, it is a symbol of medicine and healing, and the appearance of the adder or snake on Saint Bride’s Day offers a feeling of hope and transformation, and of turning the corner with the ening of the days. . century. .!... !"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Donnie-Munro-picture-scaled.jpg","title":"special donnie munro concert to bring skye live back with a","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe island#s premier music festival is set toin style on Thursday th May # following a two-year break due to the pandemic # with an opening night extravaganza # ‘Coming Home: An Evening with Donnie Munro and friends’ and featuring special guests in the form of multi-award-winning Gaelic supergroup Mànran.The show will be Donnie’s first in his hometown since  and will see him perform with a full eight-piece band line-up on the spectacular Skye Live Festival site at Am Meall in Portree. The singer said: #This offers me a fantastic opportunity to bring this amazing line-up, featuring some of Scotland’s top musicians together, for an exclusive performance to open this year’s Skye Live Festival.He added: #It has been fantastic to watch the festival grow in strength, year on year, in what must be one of the most special and unique festival locations anywhere in the world, and to see it become internationally recognised as, ‘one of the best boutique festivals in the country’, is just fantastic for the island, and it is such a great honour for me to be invited to be a part of it all and to be bringing the music back home here to where it all began.#Joining Donnie Munro on the night will be Mànran, internationally recognised as one of the most iconic and respected Scottish bands on the road today.

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645020787354.jpg--covid_19___wed_16th_february_figures.jpg?1645020787000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220216newscovid 19 wed 16th february figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows five further coronavirus related deaths and , new positive test results.

Mitigations have included advice for post-primary pupils to wear face coverings at all times when inside school buildings and for schools to introduce one-way systems.“We will be writing out to schools in the coming days in relation to any impact this may have on the department’s current Covid guidance,” the department said.But the timing of the removal of restrictions, while schools are on half-term break, means head teachers have been left in the dark on what will be expected when they .“We just don’t knowcoronavirus mitigations will be in place,” said Graham Gault, interim director of the National Association of Head Teachers.“Principals have been left trying their best to address the concerns of pupils, parents and staff while we again wait for guidance from the Department of Education.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “While the lting of restrictions in wider society is celebrated, the truth for schools is that they will continue to mitigate against coronavirus in order to keep as many children and staff in school as possible. Schools will definitely not be back to normal next week.“This is yet another school break which is tinted by the fact that school leaders don’t have guidance and are having to make decisions in the dark. We have advised our members to always err on the side of safety.”One of the main concerns is that the removal of restrictions in society will lead to a sharp increase in Covid cases, which in turn will lead to further problems with staff absent from the classroom.“The great fear among school leaders is that the lting of restrictions will further increase the crisis of trying to find available staff and keep schools open,” said Mr Gault.“There are many across our schools feeling a bit of trepidation at what increased community transmission might mean for keeping schools open. What we need is clear guidance from the minister so we can prepare for what will be asked of us.”While the number of reported Covid cases among school pupils in the first week of February fell to just over ,, the figures over a -day period, since schools ed after Christmas, have shown a signicant rise in positive cases.Related topicsDepartment of EducationDepartment of HealthMore On Department of EducationTeachers ‘ready to strike’ after rejecting pay offer PremiumDebate on issue of integrated education has never been higher, says campaignerMLAs back Bill to defer school starting age for some children from four to five PremiumDUP confirms its opposition to Integrated Education Bill PremiumViewpointOpinionDelays in our court system must be fixedMost ReadCivil servants set for hybrid working policy in two months‘There’s loads of ways to be a family’: Derry dads make surrogacy historyCommunity heartbroken after Co Down man Kevin Gregory dies suddenly in UkraineStorms Dudley and Eunice: Amber and yellow warnings now in force as wind begins to batter Northern IrelandStorm Dudley: Weather warning brought forwardTop Videos \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Police ram car as #Divis Hoods# go on weekend rampage in BelfastPlay Lidl Ireland investigating incident involving security guards outside busy storePlayVideo: Mask or no mask  Belfast reacts as Covid restrictions are ltedLatest EducationTeachers ‘ready to strike’ after rejecting pay offerDebate on issue of integrated education has never been higher, says campaignerMLAs back Bill to defer school starting age for some children from four to fiveDUP confirms its opposition to Integrated Education BillViewpointOpinionProgress is possible in education systemLatestGovernment expected to scrap ‘golden visas’ provided to foreign investorsBob Saget’s family granted injunction to block release of death investigation recordsFacebook’s Mark Zuckerberg promotes Sir Nick Clegg to more senior role at MetaMother’s fears of another Port serial killer amid Met Police ‘shambles’Taika Waititi shares trailer for new HBO pirate comedy series,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Management Side will now take time to consider how the matter should be progressed before engaging again with NITC.”NASUWT confirmed the offer had been rejected by % of its members, not accepting that the deal for  to  proposed by employers was a .% pay increase.The highest rise would be for newly qualied teachers as under the proposals a new teacher’s starting salary would rise to £, from about £, with a newly qualied teacher seeing their gross salary increase by .% from September  with no increase in September .Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Unions claim that most teachers would receive much smaller increases over two years and that the figure of .% presented by the employers included the normal incremental pay progression teachers were due to get anyway.“The anger felt by the profession could not be more stark with the vast majority of members saying they were prepared to take industrial action over the offer, with % prepared to take action short of strike action and % prepared to take strike action,” the NASUWT said.“The vast majority of NASUWT members also expressed concerns about the failure of the Department of Education and the employers to deliver on the  Agreement, with % saying that their workload had increased signicantly in the last two years.“And in a sign of the retention challenges facing the profession, % said they were seriously considering leaving teaching.Dr Patrick Roach, NASUWT General Secretary added: “This pay offer has come after months and months of delay and represents a further damaging real-terms cut to teachers’ salaries at a time of surging inflation and a deepening cost of living crisis.“Members are clear that they are prepared to take actionthe Minister does not deliver a substantially better deal which addresses teachers’ concerns on pay and workload.”Justin McCamphill, NASUWT National Official Northern Ireland, said the “derisory” offer is “damaging the morale of the profession. It will only serve to make the recruitment and retention of teachers harder at a time when they are desperately needed.”The Northern Ireland Teachers’ Councilhad submitted a pay claim for % for  to  and has called on the Department to urgently make a new offer “which reflects the current inflationary environment.”School leaders’ union NAHT has called for further negotiations after % of NAHT members in Northern Ireland also voted to turn down the offer.Graham Gault, Interim Director for NAHT NI, said: “Having endured cumulative real-terms pay decreases worth % over the last decade, school leaders have made their opinions on the Department’s recent pay offer clear through our democratic processes. A basic cost-of-living increase for teachers and school leaders was requested through the NITC , but the offer has fallen well short.“We believe that genuine attempts to resolve this issue can result in an acceptable settlement and are determined to do all that we can to avoid any escalation to a formal pay dispute.”The chair of the Irish National Teachers’ OrganisationNorthern Committee, Ms Marie O’Shea added: “The latest offer made by the management side to the unions for a cost-of-living increase in the   year falls signicantly short of both our expectations and that of our members.“For any offer to be acceptable to our membership, it must reflect the ongoing efforts by our members who, during the Covid- pandemic, ensured that the vital routine of the education system, remained working effectively for the children and young people in their care. Any award offered to teachers needs to reflect this and offset the effects of the rising inflation we are currently experiencing.”“We remain available to discuss these matters with them constructively and hope they will approach this issue with a more positive and practical attitude than this offer would suggest they have brought to the issue of teachers’ pay to date.”Related topicsDepartment of EducationMichelle McIlveenMore On Department of Education PremiumSchool leaders ‘don’t have guidance and are having to make decisions in the dark’ after curb removals PremiumDebate on issue of integrated education has never been higher, says campaignerMLAs back Bill to defer school starting age for some children from four to five PremiumDUP confirms its opposition to Integrated Education Bill PremiumViewpointOpinionDelays in our court system must be fixedMost ReadCivil servants set for hybrid working policy in two months‘There’s loads of ways to be a family’: Derry dads make surrogacy historyCommunity heartbroken after Co Down man Kevin Gregory dies suddenly in UkraineStorms Dudley and Eunice: Amber and yellow warnings now in force as wind begins to batter Northern IrelandStorm Dudley: Weather warning brought forwardTop Videos \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Police ram car as #Divis Hoods# go on weekend rampage in BelfastPlay Lidl Ireland investigating incident involving security guards outside busy storePlayVideo: Mask or no mask  Belfast reacts as Covid restrictions are ltedLatest EducationSchool leaders ‘don’t have guidance and are having to make decisions in the dark’ after curb removalsDebate on issue of integrated education has never been higher, says campaignerMLAs back Bill to defer school starting age for some children from four to fiveDUP confirms its opposition to Integrated Education BillViewpointOpinionProgress is possible in education systemLatestGovernment expected to scrap ‘golden visas’ provided to foreign investorsBob Saget’s family granted injunction to block release of death investigation recordsFacebook’s Mark Zuckerberg promotes Sir Nick Clegg to more senior role at MetaMother’s fears of another Port serial killer amid Met Police ‘shambles’Taika Waititi shares trailer for new HBO pirate comedy series,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

PMFacebookTwitterEmailChildren in Northern Ireland who are aged between  to -years-of-age and not in a clinical risk group will be offered the chance to receive a Covid- jab.The announcement by Robin Swann follows the latest advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation .It also comes after Wales, Scotland and England also announced they would be following JCVI guidance.Those children eligible will be offered two  mcg doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech jab, with an interval of at least  weeks between doses.Read MoreCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Five deaths and , new casesThe dose offered to these children will be equivalent to a third of the strength given to a typical adult.In December, the JCVI had advised that children aged five to  years who were in a clinical risk group, or who were a household contact of someone who is immunosuppressed, should be offered vaccines.Mr Swann said: As has always been the case, our vaccination programme will continue to be guided by the expert advice.This announcement by the JCVI underlines the important role that the Covid- vaccines plays in protecting people of all ages and has only been taken after rigorous assessment of both safety and effectiveness.I have asked the PHAto work with thetrusts to put this latest advice into operation and further details will be released shortly.In a statement, the JCVI said: This advice on the offer of vaccination to  to -year-olds who are not in a clinical risk group is considered by JCVI as a one-off pandemic response programme.As the Covid- pandemic moves further towards endemicity in the UK, JCVI will review whether, in the longer term, an offer of vaccination to this, and other paediatric age groups, continues to be advised.Related topicsRobin SwannMore On Robin

Credit: Liam McBurney PA WireFebruary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailWhen the books are written and history students look back on the early s, they’ll be forgiven for thinking they’re studying science fiction instead.Had a man with a sandwich board been shouting “the end is nigh” outside Belfast City Hall in February , it would have looked like he had a point. It was the end of the world as we knew it.Read MoreNiamh Campbell:OpinionImportant day forto some kind of normalityNorthern Ireland’s Covid rules scrapped and replaced with guidance“The end is nigh” means something dferent today, and we can all breathe a little easier.There is no doubt that without the restrictions we would be looking back on a lot more lives lost to Covid than the official figure of over ,.For many, their last moments were spent alone. For those who mourned, they watched from afar. That was one of the hardest restrictions to bear.Pulling our bedroom curtains closed on Monday, March , , we did so wondering what sort of world would await when we opened them the next morning.The UK death toll stood at , three of them here.St Patrick’s Day had already been cancelled, giving the first hint of what was heading our direction. Then lockdown started.Farewells were said to those in nursing homes as the doors closed to visits. Businesses shut, save for those deemed essential.The queues outside supermarkets started. Our children spent their first day at home after the closure of schools.That was  days ago.We had all suspected it was coming, having watched images from around the world as the pandemic wave approached our shores.Shielding letters were sent to , of the most vulnerable, telling how they were to go into isolation.March ,  was furlough day as the Government committed to support % of wages for employees.Three days later gatherings of more than two people were banned. It was essential trips only.Thursday, March  saw the start of a weekly ritual as we clapped for carers. Communities made scrubs and masks for front line workers. On a bigger scale, companies were redeploying staff and taking on new workers to help the cause as fears over a lack of PPE rose.Then, at pm on Saturday, March  lockdown officially commenced.We said farewell to work colleagues, socially distanced ourselves from family and friends, and started to embrace a new style of community.Those of us with children became teachers overnight. Our children taught us a thing or two also, with crash courses on Zoom, Facetime and TikTok.The older generation had to embrace the technology the young had grown up with. Hands upyou logged in to a Zoom meeting hiding those pyjama bottoms under the kitchen table Maybe it was just as well for our egos the pubs and nightclubs were closed. Self-styled hair, out of necessity, was perhaps not the way to go.Strange as it may seem, being apart from other people actually brought us closer together.For the older among us, we instantly felt a need to hug our parents as soon as we were told we couldn’t. It would be a shame not to remember that. In a way, we all became heroes of a sort. “Stay at home, save lives,” was the message. We stayed at home, while others manned the front line.Driving around was an eerie experience in those early days — few cars on the road shops shut.And when we went out for a walk to get some exercise we actually heard the birdsong.Weddings were halted. Birthdays went uncelebrated. Holidays put on hold.And in the midst of all the sitting around doing not very much at all, a new vocabulary sprung up: furlough the R-rate PPE self-isolation shielding.Social distancing was no longer the domain of the school disco, where the boys sat on one side and the girls on the other.We all wanted to knowwe were a key worker. There was the unprecedented rolling out of guidelines, restrictions, support services and grants to keep businesses afloat.Confusion reigned: how many could meet in a garden  Where could airplanes take us to, and what did we need to get there  What was a ‘wet’ pub Little by little, the restrictions we were living with eased and chinks of light started to emerge.Cemeteries reopened on April  after a public outcry — the first easing of curbs.Monday, May  saw garden centres reopen, with the promise of more rules being ltedthe downward trend in cases of Covid continued.All eyes were on the R-rate, but the same day saw the first signs of a lockdown breakdown.By the end of the month, with temperatures soaring, thousands headed for the seaside.Still, on May , for the first time since March , no deaths were recorded. Positive signs were emerging, and further lockdown easements saw le edging back, evenit was baby steps.But there were relapses. We were teased with the freedom of the pre-pandemic world, only to have it pulled back from us as new iants, second waves of the virus, kept arriving.Restrictions came, then were eased. But they never went away.For many, particularly in the business world, there has been a heavy price to pay.Some pub doors were shut, never to open again. Even big names such as Debenhams could not survive the pandemic, having battled for years against the growth in online retailing.Then there was the impact on people’s wellbeing.That many died having contracted Covid has been well documented, but lockdown brought with it the extra baggage of isolation. The mental state of people was a constant concern.Sure, it’ll be over by Christmas, we said in . We said the same in .It wouldn’t be this placethe ending of restrictions didn’t bring with it some added confusion and doubt.With the Executive unable to meet due to the lack of a First and Deputy First Minister, the issue became a legal matter.In years to come there’ll be plenty of stories told starting with the words: “Do you remember the time ”Those history books  years from now will be filled with the facts and the figures, the bumps in the road, the scandals of those in public office.But we’ve lived with it all, lived through it all, and come out the other side.We can all see a little more clearly now.The dark clouds have been replaced by that hopeful rainbow we’ve been teased with several times over the past two years.There does come a time when we have to learn to live in the world as it is, as close as we can to the way we did.We might not be quite stepping into the brightest of bright days.Restrictions will change to guidelines and recommendations.There will still be many content to take the precautions they feel they need, and everyone should move forward at their own pace.Hopefully the last two years have taught the majority of us to appreciate the things in our lives that are most important to us — our family and friends.Le moves fast. Hopefully, before long, the darkest days of Covid will be a memory.Being honest, a lot of people had left those memories behind some time ago.But think, too, of those who bring the memory of loved ones lost into a world their parent, husband, we, sister or brother is not there to enjoy beside them.Related topicsBelfast City CouncilMore On Belfast City Council PremiumBigger rates bills on way for all NI householdsNI cinema owner calls on Belfast council to change The Batman’s rating so younger viewers can watch with parentsCall for Belfast City Council to remember Bloody Friday  years onCost sinks council plan to make Belfast public transport free for young people PremiumBBC NI presenters topping up pay packets with money-spinning external engagementsMost ReadCivil servants set for hybrid working policy in two months‘There’s loads of ways to be a family’: Derry dads make surrogacy historyCommunity heartbroken after Co Down man Kevin Gregory dies suddenly in UkraineStorm Dudley: Weather warning brought forwardStorms Dudley and Eunice: Amber and yellow warnings now in force as wind begins to batter Northern IrelandTop Videos \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Police ram car as #Divis Hoods# go on weekend rampage in BelfastPlay Lidl Ireland investigating incident involving security guards outside busy storePlayVideo: Mask or no mask  Belfast reacts as Covid restrictions are ltedLatest CoronavirusChildren aged  to  in Northern Ireland to be offered Covid- jabMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageNI Covid passport scheme was #proportionate and justiable#, judge rulesWatch: Belfast shoppers split over masks as rules replaced with guidanceCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Four deaths and , new casesLatestFacebook’s Mark Zuckerberg promotes Sir Nick Clegg to more senior role at MetaMother’s fears of another Port serial killer amid Met Police ‘shambles’Taika Waititi shares trailer for new HBO pirate comedy seriesQueen of burlesque Dita Von Teese says she is ‘obsessed’ with British royaltyRussia accused by US of adding , more troops to Ukraine border,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueBronagh Murray with her lawyer Brian ArcherAllan PrestonTwitterEmailFebruary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA Co Down woman who won a religious and sexual discrimination case against the Ministry of Defencehas told of how months of insults by an Army captain left her dreading the thought of going to work.Bronagh Murray , a Catholic civilian worker who was stationed in Thiepval Barracks in Lisburn, is set to receive over £, in compensation after the decision of a Fair Employment Tribunal in Belfast this week. It is believed to be one of the largest awards of its kind, with the MoD also accepting liability.Read MoreCatholic woman who left job over alleged harassment by her Army boss to receive more than £, compensationSpeaking to the Belfast , Ms Murray said she was relieved at the decision and was now focused on rebuilding her le.I absolutely dreaded going to work even though I had an immaculate record as a civil servant since I was , she said.“At times I just couldn’t think straight. I thought I had a handle on it by ignoring him but I obviously didn’t. I kept thinking, ‘he’s getting the message, it just needs to stop’. I didn’t approach him at the time about the harassment because I felt I wouldn’t be believed and it would lead to more harassment because I didn’t find him funny.The harassment by the Army captain, who cannot be named for security reasons, took place over a five-month period in , with Ms Murray later retiring due to deteriorating psychiatric condition in .Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up The tribunal heard that the captain repeatedly referenced her religion in front of others and had also referred to her as “the big cougar”.In one incident, he was reported to have said: “I need back up, I have an Irish Catholic girl armed and dangerous, come quick, need help.”During an office conversation about a concert, it’s also claimed that he said: “I bet you have tried to steal a cone, that is the Catholic coming out in you.”After starting the complaint process in September , the captain was eventually disciplined and transferred to another military posting.The tribunal awarded Ms Murray around £, to cover injury to feelings, psychiatric injuries, loss of previous earnings and interest. Not due to retire until , compensation for loss of future earnings was calculated in excess of £,.She added: “I’m just so relieved and pleased with the outcome. I feel great because I’m totally vindicated and at long last the truth has come out.”She said the admission of liability from the MoD was particularly important.I didn’t ask for any of this, I had every intention of working until retirement age. Because of what happened to me, my health broke down and I was left with no other option than to go through the process of ill health retirement.“It was just so stressful, it was a horrible feeling. I had confided in a few close friends who knew what I was going through. It was such a hard time.”She said finding the courage to eventually speak up had felt like a major risk at the time.“I was afraid I wouldn’t be taken seriously, especially the cougar comment, she said.“I know a lot of people, even women, can find that funny, but I don’t. He just came out with it, he had been talking about someone looking for me ‘because you’re a big cougar’. I nearly fell off the chair. I just don’t find that funny or acceptable. It was a horrible feeling, the worst thing to say to a woman.“On every occasion that he did say something, I was at my desk typing or doing my admin work. I didn’t ask for this, he came to me to insult me.”Askedshe felt the insults were down to vindictiveness or just immaturity, she replied: “I really don’t know what he was thinking. It just beggars belief what was going through his head. All I wanted was to do my job and head home, but I was absolutely dreading it.Ms Murray also thanked her legal team, solicitor Brian Archer and barrister Michael Potter, for their “total support” throughout the entire process.Most ReadCivil servants set for hybrid working policy in two months‘There’s loads of ways to be a family’: Derry dads make surrogacy historyCommunity heartbroken after Co Down man Kevin Gregory dies suddenly in UkraineStorms Dudley and Eunice: Amber and yellow warnings now in force as wind begins to batter Northern IrelandStorm Dudley: Weather warning brought forwardTop Videos \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Police ram car as #Divis Hoods# go on weekend rampage in BelfastPlay Lidl Ireland investigating incident involving security guards outside busy storePlayVideo: Mask or no mask  Belfast reacts as Covid restrictions are ltedLatest Northern IrelandUK hit with power cuts and travel disruption ahead of incoming Storm EuniceBigger rates bills on way for all NI householdsKillyleagh townsfolk want their Baron to be stripped of his titleCouncillors set to debate renaming of Prince Andrew Way in Co AntrimMurder trial jury told mum-of-three Jenner Dornan’s badly burned body covered in debrisLatestGovernment expected to scrap ‘golden visas’ provided to foreign investorsBob Saget’s family granted injunction to block release of death investigation recordsFacebook’s Mark Zuckerberg promotes Sir Nick Clegg to more senior role at MetaMother’s fears of another Port serial killer amid Met Police ‘shambles’Taika Waititi shares trailer for new HBO pirate comedy series,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Patrick’s sister Charley was their surrogate and they used a donor egg.It was a long and expensive process for the family, with heartache along the way after a first pregnancy ended in miscarriage.

That was something we could only dream of.

She told us her thoughts on it, how her family and her partner felt about it and how it would be for her children.”Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseBaby Wren FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueBaby WrenThe couple had considered using an egg donor clinic in Kiev but were encouraged to advertise in a local newspaper.They were stunned when they received a reply after a week, with the donor stipulating the egg should go to a gay couple. They subsequently attended a clinic in Belfast, with all family members having to go through counselling.Patrick said: “It was actually a really good gateway to open up questions that you might not have wanted to ask.“Charley [was] telling her children what way we would do things when she had the baby. “[We were asking], ‘Whatthere’s something wrong the baby  Who would decide what happens ”Jon said the couple were also prepared for facing intrusive questions about who the father of the baby was.“Who would ask that  But I’m sure plenty of people will be thinking it without saying it, so how do you manage people’s expectations ” he asked.Patrick added: “But the way the counsellor put it, why would we tell anyone who Wren’s ‘real’ daddy was before she knew “But it doesn’t matter. We’re both her daddy regardless of what has happened. “There’s loads of dferent ways to make a family.

And a lot of people did ask, ‘Whose sperm did you use ’”Jon added: “It’s a natural reaction, but we can tell people the boundaries about that. I have to say it was nieces and nephews that were the easiest to tell because they just accepted it.”Patrick said that Charley’s then three-year-old daughter was quick to correct anyone who congratulated her mum for becoming pregnant.He explained: “She would turn and say to them, ‘She’s not pregnant.

We have to follow the example of St Patrick and bring the light to recallsothers.ldquoWe have to start again, bringing the light of Christ into our hearts, our families and into our homes. We all know these are days of darkness, we have been living through them, days of fear and anxiety. We need the joy of the gospel, the joy of Christ, joy brought to Ireland by St Patrick.Fr Alexander continued: ldquoEach of us has to ask ourselves, what am I going to do to bring the light of faith to others  Generations of our ancestors kept the faith alive. What are you going to do to keep the faith alive  Let us revive our faith and go forward with St Patrick.Archbishop Jude Thaddeus told the congregation that St Patrick was not sent by to Ireland ldquoby God by chance.ldquoHis mission in Ireland was a deliberate intention of God, he continued. ldquoWe can read this in St Patrickrsquos writings and from the example he left behind. When St Patrick wanted to come back to Ireland, there was a lot of opposition. In his time, there were many missionaries, including bishops and priests. We have hardly heard of many of these, but we all know about St Patrick. This is very striking. Why is it so ldquoSt Patrick did not speak much, he didnrsquot write much. Today there are too many words ndash words, words, words ndash written words, spoken words, words on the internet, words on the microphone, words on the streets and the market places. There are too many words, just one word is important ndash the Word of God. If we could just listen to even a single Word of God.Referring to the Gospel readings for the feast of Candlemas, the Papal Nuncio added: ldquoOur Lady did not say anything at the Presentation of Our Lord, she kept everything in her heart. In the entire Gospel. St Joseph speaks only two words. Sometimes we speak too many words and we lose orientation and get confused. Only one word is important ndash the Word of God ndash we should listen to the Word of God. St Patrick listened to the Word of God.Speaking afterwards of his visit, Archbishop Okolo said: ldquoIt was indeed nice and uplting, praying together on that holy ground, on which St Patrick trod.Next week, the All Ireland Novena journeys to Slane where St Patrick lit the Paschal fire.The Novena can be watched online at pm via the parish webcam..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9Feburary2020_Panto.jpg","title":"Children on stage for The Wizard of Oz show  ","story":"THE abundance of musical and dramatic talent at the Patrician Youth Centre in Downpatrick is back on show for the first time in almost two years.A young and enthusiastic cast presented the pantomime, The Wizard of Oz, last week.Performing Arts and live productions at the Patrician paused in March  with the onset of Covid- and ensuing pandemic.Determined to get going again, staff and members worked on Tom Whalleyrsquos new pantomime production of the very popular musical The Wizard of Oz.Despite many ongoing Covid disruptions were delighted to have a performance which was live streamed last week.Unfortunately, in the lead-up to the event some of the principal cast members were Covid isolating.On the day before the performance leading lady Shona Gardiner, who was to play Dorothy, tested positive.In true showbiz tradition, the show had to go on and a telephone call from a former Patrician member saved the day.Mairead OrsquoHare, who played Dorothy in the Patricianrsquos  production of the Wizard of Oz, volunteered to stand in to read the role and sing the ever-popular songs. Mairead ed and performed like she never had been away.Senior youth worker Yvonne Maguire congratulated everyone connected with the production mdash the cast members, production team, friends of Patrician, parents, and families for supporting members, children and young people.She extended a sincere thank you to Mairead for standing in at the last minute and also paid tribute to Shona, who had worked so hard in preparing for the performance and regrettably did not get the opportunity to star.A recording of Shona singing will be available on Facebook.The principal cast members were: Mairead OrsquoHare , Aaron Mullan , Aedan OrsquoHare , Annie May OrsquoHare , Eamon OrsquoHare , Eva Bailie , Tyler Fung , Zoe Gaines .Chorus, dancers, monkeys, trees and crows: Caitie Cunlfe, Caragh Moore, Conal McDowell, Ella Grace Cunlfe, Emily Douglas, Georgia Savage, Jack McDonald, Katie Fegan, Kayleigh Rogers, Lilly Boyd, Maria Rooney, Megan Megahey, Molly Boyd, Molly Madine, Oisin OrsquoHare, Poppy Baggley, Poppy Woodall.Patrician Youth Centre would also like to thank the following staff team and friends for making the production possible: Caitriona Smyth, Anthony Frew, Bridin Wells, Eamonn Hanlon, Charlie Hanlon, David McBennett, Melissa Poland, Paddy Watters, Mark Hassett, Anna Murray and Teresa Sweeney.Thanks are also extended other team members and the centre trainee leader membership who supported the event..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9February2020_Sea.jpg","title":"Drive for better sea swimming facilities  ","story":"A SERIES of measures to improve the safety of sea swimmers in Newcastle have been suggested to Newry, Mourne and Down Council.The local authority has been asked to address the needs of the increasing numbers who enjoy swimming at the resortrsquos harbour.Council officials met recently with Mournes councillor Laura Devlin who is working to secure improved access to the water and the needs of those who enjoy cold water swimming.Cllr Devlin said while sea swimming has always been popular in the resort, there is an increasing number of people taking to the water as a result of Covid which prompted many people across the district to be more active.She said Newcastlersquos Harbour Heritage Association is bringing many people who use services at the harbour together to provide them with a ldquounied voice with the group including representatives of the sea swimming community.ldquoCold water therapy is now an established activity and the coronavirus pandemic will unfortunately have a lasting impact on mental health, continued Cllr Devlin.ldquoThis type of therapy is seen as a successful line of defence and even treatment for many, notwithstanding the superb physical benefits and enjoyment that cold water swimming brings.Cllr Devlin says there are many activities at Newcastle harbour which can sometimes lead to a congested slipway, explaining that there are ldquosignicant safety concerns when swimmers, boats and jet-skis are in the water at once.The local councillor, who met recently with council officials and was joined by local sea swimmer Fiona Davey, has also highlighted parking problems at the harbour which she said are ldquocontinuing to deteriorate.She continued: ldquoI have also consulted with The Harbour Heritage Association and we agreed a list of issues that need to be addressed which the local authority which is considering improvements to the water access point on the harbour side of the Rock Pool or at the Back Shore.ldquoAn extension of the ramp leading to the water is also required to allow for disability access, while a handrail to assist people entering and exiting the water as well as hooks for clothes and storage, and a seating area for changing is also required.Council officials have also been asked to provide buoys near the pier to section off the area for those jumping into the water and sea swimming in general.Cllr Devlin also highlighted the need for height markers on the pier wall in order that those who jump into the water will know the depth, explaining the water depth can be an issue during the summer months.Council officials have also been asked to provide distance markers, so swimmers know how far out they are.Cllr Devlin added: ldquoThis is a flavour of our asks and really is just a starting point. I donrsquot see any of the issues that have been highlighted as costing a signicant amount. If they can be implemented, they would make a tangible dference to harbour users. I hope that progress can be made soon for the good of all harbour users.Thanking Cllr Devlin for her work to improve safety for sea swimmers at the harbour, South Down MLA Colin McGrath said he looked forward to ldquomuch-needed changes in Newcastle.He also believes that the series of measures outlined for the harbour could be used as a template by the local authority for open water swimming and cold water therapy across the district.Mr McGrath added: ldquoWe are fortunate to be surrounded by such beautul coastline which has many locations for accessing the water, but itrsquos vital that we make the activity as safe as possible in a select number of locations that ensure an equitable offering across the council area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9February2020_CD.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  February 12th%2C 1992  ","story":"ARDGLASS ndash The fishing fleet in Ardglass is facing a potential crisis following a slump in the crucially-important prawn market.Demand for prawns has ped dramatically because of the recession, resulting in depressed prices and trawler men struggling to meet running costs.Yesterday, fishermenrsquos leader Dick James said: ldquoWe are not yet in a crisis, but one is fast developing.Mr James, who is chief executive of the Northern Ireland Fish Producersrsquo Organisation, has called on the Government to introduce a decommissioning scheme which would enable trawler owners to leave the industry.ldquoA decommissioning scheme would go a long way towards solving the problem. At present, we have too many boasts chasing too few fish, he remarked.Ironically, the situation has been partly caused by the fishermen catching too many prawns.Last monthrsquos good weather resulted in better-then-expected landing which further depressed the already-weakened market ndash prawn are currently selling at less than pound a stone, compared to pound a stone a year ago.However, the general recession in the economy has been the main stumbling block. As demand continues to drop, processors are keeping stocks in cold storage and are not in a position to buy additional supplies at the quayside.ldquoWe had good prices until last April. Then the market slumped and prices drop. Unfortunately, fishermanrsquos costs havenrsquot come down accordingly, Mr James said.Mr James said depression in other sectors of the industry has heightened the problem.He also believes the decommission scheme has the support of most trawler owners in Ardglass.ldquoWe are talking about the survival of the fleet as a whole. Decommissioning would help owners who are otherwise unable to get out of the industry.ldquoAnd because most of the boats are undermanned, it would to not lead to large scale redundancies among crewmen, he added.CROSSGAR ndash A Crossgar man who is renowned for his excellent time-keeping was honoured last week.Mr James McCormick, who has been winding the clock on the old Kilmore Parish Church Hall for over  years, has decided to hang up his key and retire from his conscientious job.James took over the job when the clock was repaired in  and has continued his labour of love ever since.Now the hall has been sold to the Ulster Wildle Trust for its new headquarters building, James has decided tocall it a day and has retired from his winding duties.In recognition of his timeless work over the years the development officer of the Wildle Trust, Mr Niall Timmins, presented Mr McCormick with a window box of herbs to remind him of his former winding le.STRANGFORD ndash The creation of a single committee to oversee the management of Strangford Lough has been widely welcomed.The Ulster Unionist MP for Strangford, Mr John Taylor, said the announcement represents a ldquomajor U-turn by the Government, while the Strangford Lough Nature Conservation Association described it as a ldquoserious attempt to ensure the future of the lough.The new committee is to be launched in the spring and will have a membership of around  drawn from special interest groups, such as agriculture, fishing, conservation and recreation.Member will also be appointed from nominations put forward by Down District and Ards Borough Councils, the National Trust and the Council for Nature Conservation and the Countryside.The announcement marks something of a turn-around by the Environment Minister, Mr Richard Needham, who less than six months ago proposed a two-tier management structure for the lough.The proposal was widely criticised by groups who argued that such a structure would be unwieldy and would prevent local people from having a proper influence over decision making.By scrapping that approach, Mr Needham appears to have bowed to local pressure. The Minister says the new initiative has been produced ldquofollowing extensive consultation with organisations and iniduals concerned with the future of Strangford Lough.SAINTFIELD ndash Work is to start next week leading to the provision of new traffic lights in Saintfield.The townrsquos Ulster Unionist councillor, Mr William Biggerstaff, said yesterday that preliminary work will begin on Monday for the provision of the lights at the main crossroads in the town.ldquoI welcome this commitment. At long last we are to get these light, he said.After meeting Roads Service officials, Mr Biggerstaff also announced progress on a number of other projects in the Saintfield area.He said the provision of a footpath along Middle Road is to go forward to the Departmentrsquos forward planning section, as well similar provision on the Ballynahinch Road, Saintfield, as far as Ballymaconnell Road.Mr Biggerstaff said he had also been assured that a footpath extension from Lislane Park to the new build on the Listooder Road, taking in the primary school area will ldquodefinitely happen this year.The Ulster Unionist councillor has also asked officials to carry out a study into a serious flooding problem during periods of heavy rain at Carsonstown Road Killybawn Road.NEWCASTLE ndash Down councillor, Mr John Ritchie, has claimed that the Eastern Health Board consultation process is the ldquokiss of death for Mourne House.In a strong address to the Eastern Health Council attacking the closer plan for Mourne House, Mr Ritchie said that in his experience consultation rarely results in a change to such a proposal.Mr Ritchie claimed the unit of management has looked at the Mourne House scenario from a narrow perspective and he voiced concern about the future of the elderly people in the outlying parts of the community.It was the local councillor who asked for the Mourne House issue to be put on the Council agenda for Thursdayrsquos meeting and he dominated the  minute discussion.During his address Mr Ritchie suggested the implementation of a two-year programme to deal with the renovations and the building could then be used as a base for a community care programme.Mr Ritchie explained that Mourne House first came to light in the dying days of the last Eastern Health Board when the policy and planning committee considered a plan for the Down and Lisburn Unit of Management.The proposal included reducing the number of beds to  and developing Mourne House as a base for a community care package with respite care, a  place day centre, and meals on wheels.Mr Ritchie said there were a whole range of suggestions which the Board felt made a ldquovery attraction option.CLOUGH ndash The Presbyterian congregation in Clough held a thanksgiving service on Sunday to bid farewell to their  year-old church hall which is being replaced.The hall which was built in , is being demolished to make way for a new hall which will be officially opened by the Moderator of the Presbyterian Church, the Rev Rodney Sterritt, in April.The services was conducted by the Rev Robert Craig, church minister, who researched the origins and construction of the hall at the turn of the century.The hymn, psalm and ure reading were the same as those used at the opening service.The ious organisations which used the hall over the years were remembered, including the Scouts and Guides, Boysrsquo and Girlsrsquo Brigades, the Girlsrsquo auxiliary, and the badminton, bowls and table tennis clubs.The congregation also remembered the many services and church socials which were held in the hall.In his address, Mr Craig pointed to the strong links between the current congregation and that of a bygone age.He said many of the original families still reside in the Clough area and belong to the congregation.Mr Craig said the congregation is still industrious and is currently busy erecting and paying for the new hall.

Fortunately for The Blues they had an able replacement in Christopher Magee.This early unsettlement, along with the travelling support, spurred the away side on and soon the league leaders were showing why they are just that.Gareth Keenan was denied a golden opportunity courtesy of a point blank save from Turley as Comber continued to apply pressure in the early stages. Kilmore responded well to this and remained calm on the ball.Following some quick passing from Matthew Stewart to team-mate Anton McGrattan, the Kilmore number ten played in strike partner Joe McKinney, who was adjudged to have been fouled in the danger area and won a penalty kick.Kilmorersquos McGrattan stepped up but his effort was fantastically saved by the outstretching Andrew Topping, who pushed the ball around the post and out for a corner to the frustration of the home fans.The resultant corner was headed over the Comber crossbar by Kilmore defender Jack Larkin as the away side relished in escaping potential punishment.The visitors went back in search of the opening goals immediately after, with Keenan again seeing his efforts thwarted by the Kilmore custodian.The game quickly developed into an end to end contest with chances coming thick and fast at both ends.Kilmorersquos McKinney saw his headed effort go wide with the goal seemingly gaping before his left footed effort blazed over the bar after he was neatly played through by McGrattan.Comberrsquos Brandon Nelson delivered an inviting corner to the head of team-mate Stuart Moore, although he failed to make the most of his chance.Despite the weather, things began heating up on the pitch with numerous crunching tackles on display.Kilmore captain, Niall McCarthy, escaped with just a warning following his high challenge on Comber winger Nelson although the visiting sidersquos Moore wasnrsquot as lucky after he was awarded a yellow for clattering substitute Magee.A new face was on show within the Kilmore ranks in the form of midfielder Barry Walsh. The former Killyleagh YC player impressed throughout his debut and controlled the middle of the park at ious stages throughout the game.With both the tempo and tensions high, the whistle sounded a full two minutes early to signal half-time.Comber kicked off after the interval but it was the hosts who would be awarded the first big chance of the half.Following a piercing run into the opposing defence, Kilmorersquos McKinney was brought down awarding team-mate McGrattan to test lsquokeeper Topping from  yards with the resultant free-kick.However, the Comber custodian wasnrsquot required to spring into action as the ball whisked past the wrong side of the upright.The visitors seemed to be pressed further back into their half and attempted to respond quickly.Dylan Wilson smartly dispatched of the ball on a quick counter-attack to team-mate and captain, Simon Hanna, although the number eight was halted in his tracks unfairly by Magee.For this, the Kilmore defender was the latest name to enter the refereersquos books. The home side had the advantage of the wind and decided to use this repeatedly through long ranged passes in hopes of manufacturing an attack.McKinney came close on a few occasions as he engaged in multiple footraces with Comberrsquos Reece Whittle, although often the home striker would stray onto the bounds of offside.Kilmore hit a purple patch in the opening quarter of the second half, with Comberrsquos first chance of the restart coming on the hour mark.Nelson was left unmarked at the back post after a ball was lofted into his path from skipper Hanna. However, he shanked his left-footed effort and allowed his Kilmore counterparts to remain unscathed.Despite this miss, Nelsonrsquos effort served as a reminder to the opposition that Comber was very much still a threat on the counter.The Kilmore support were up in arms minutes later when they thought a Comber hand was used to prevent a McGrattan strike from hitting its target, although these appeals were quickly shut down.Comber substitute, Ciaran Gillan, picked up a yellow card in his attempts to clear the ball from his half ndash much to the disagreement of his sidersquos management team.The visitors would be soon ruing more than a yellow card as the resultant free-kick proved costly on the  minute mark.A delicately placed McGrattan delivery floated into the path of captain McCarthy for the Kilmore skipper to head with conviction past Topping and finally open the scoring.Anton McGrattan picked up a rather needless yellow soon after for thumping the ball away amongst the celebrations as the atmosphere inside the park reached fever pitch.Comber defender Bradley Porter received a yellow card minutes later for his tackle on McKinney before the Kilmore striker suffered the same fate after he ended up on the ground in what the referee deemed as simulation.The trend of yellow cards continued with Comber captain Hanna, who landed his name in the book for exchanging some ill-advised words with the official ten minutes from full-time.As expected, the final minutes of the contest were a nervous affair for the home side, who werenrsquot committing as many bodies forward in hopes of securing a shutout.Naturally, this invited pressure from Comber, who desperately sought to spoil the Kilmore party.lsquoKeeper Turley kept his concentration for the full duration of the match and thwarted the last two efforts from Comber, with Wilson coming close before his team-mate Tumilson was denied dramatically in injury time.This signied the last piece of action as the referee brought his whistle to his lips to the relief of the Kilmore support.Following the conclusion goal scorer and man of the match, Niall McCarthy, gave his thoughts on his sidersquos impressive victory.ldquoIt was a battle, the pitch was very heavy and I think it just came down to who wanted it more, he said.ldquoWe knew with Comber coming down here that they are a very physical, very fit team, who are well-drilled.ldquoHowever, we firmly believe in our camp that we are the best team in the league. We work hard every Tuesday and Thursday night and itrsquos a credit to our manager, Michael Carvill, for the shape hersquos pulled us in to.Kilmore: C Turley, J McCarthy, M Stewart, J Larkin, G Kennedy, B Walsh, J Smyth, N McCarthy , J McKinney, A McGrattan, E McGrattan.Subs: C Magee, M Monan, M Carvill.Yellow cards: C Magee, A McGrattan, J McKinney.Comber: A Topping, M Gibson, L Walker, B Porter, R Whittle, S Moore, B Nelson, S Hanna , D Wilson, M Tumilson, G Keenan.Subs: S Fleck, C Gillan, K Gaw.Yellow cards: S Moore, C Gillan, B Porter, S Hanna..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16February2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Knockevin in £75k funding initiative  ","story":"KNOCKEVIN Special Schoolrsquos Parent Staff Association has unveiled details of an ambitious pound, fundraising initiative.The school has bases in Downpatrick, Dundrum and Castlewellan, with the parent and staff group hoping that the ldquoenchantment project will raise vital funds to purchase essential outdoor play and learning equipment.In addition, some of the pound, will be used to meet school bus running costs and other essential items at Knockevinrsquos three bases.Announcing details of the new fundraising initiative, the parent and staff group said pupils are in need of ious items to help combat social deprivation as a result of the ongoing pandemic.ldquoOur children may not always have the same opportunity for social inclusion as those in mainstream education, but to be able to provide them with an outdoor space they can safely and comfortably enjoy together which is fully accessible and tailored to all their needs would be a dream come true, said a spokesperson for the group.ldquoOur children and young adults are most deserving of this. and, as with all specialist equipment, a large price tag is included and we aim to hold as many fundraising activities and events as possible to ensure that we reach our goal.As Covid restrictions continue to ease, the highly acclaimed special school will be able to hold its th anniversary at Newcastlersquos Burrendale Hotel on September , with entertainment provided by the Booze Bros and Finbarr Keaveney the compere for the evening.ldquoWe are looking forward to getting together again to celebrate all that has been achieved in the past  years.

However, by pm the taped route was ready, the registration was complete and the nervous but excited youngsters were warming up in anticipation.Primary Four and under lined up, first the boys and then the girls. With vests down to their knees and a few anxious glances to parents, it seemed that they were almost too young for such a task but once the whistle blew they set off like rockets round the m circuit.Harry McVeigh, for Newcastle AC, was the clear winner in the boysrsquo race and Aoe Maguireheld a five second lead to win the girlsrsquo race.Primary Five saw the girls and boys combined in the one race and the winners were John McElroyand Emily Kerr . The  metres didnrsquot seem a bother to either of these young athletes.Ryan Thorntonwent off hard for the P win and Saorlaith McAleenanwas the epitome of focus as she headed to the line to come first in the P girls.With  entrants and the distance now one kilometre, it was a challenging race.The P looked an experienced bunch as they gathered at the start.Many have been racing each other in the Flahavanrsquos XC Series for schools so there were scores to be settled. Maisie McVeighwas taking no chances and after a short tussle, she shrugged off the rest of the field and ran solo to take the P girlsrsquo victory.Fiachna McAleenanalso showed his mettle leading home the P boys. This was raced over m.It was great to see the support for the younger ones, not just from parents but from older siblings and club mates, who ran along side each race yelling at the younger ones to encourage them to work hard right to the finish line.On more than one occasion there were groups breaching the line as an inseparable unit and joint times had to be awarded. This was exciting for spectators and a learning experience for the runners.In time they will develop the ability to pace over the course to keep their position but leave a little in the tank for a sprint finishrequired.The series is about participation as well as competition and all runners get a point for their club provided they finish the race.This helps to engender club spirit and creates a charged atmosphere.The post primary runners were well warmed up from their cheerleading efforts on the sideline so they were primed for racing when it was eventually their turn.In Years Eight, Nine and Ten, the girls outnumbered the boys in each category but by Year  plus, it was the reverse.Still, it was good to see healthy numbers out to take part overall in the post primary end of things. The distance for year eight was m and Erin Easton , who won the girlsrsquo race by eight seconds, looked controlled throughout. Aaron OrsquoBoylehad an exciting sprint to the line to snatch glory in Year Eight boys.Emma Stewartcovered the m Year Nine girlsrsquo race at great speed to place first girl and Alex Robinson seemed to revel in the extra running as the gap between him and the second runner stretched out as the race proceeded.Year Ten boys and girls ran together as there were  when combined.The m race allowed spectators to get multiple glimpses as the they looped round the field.Aaron Lennonwon his race comfortably and Edana Butterfieldhad a similar outcome in the girlsrsquo category.The finale was Year  and up. This had a mix of gender as well as year groups.

The commitment of the young runnersis highly commendable and the continued backing of McGrady Financial Services is much appreciated.These young folk are the future of our clubs and the sport in general and all those who are facilitating this, know that it is time well spent.The next race is in Tollymore Forest Park on March .

Finnerty eventually notched the next score for his Galway outfit, before the goal scorer, Conroy, would kick over from distance ndash albeit with some wind assistance.The hosts seemed to fighting an uphill battle as the wind battered around Pairc Esler in favour of the visiting side, with Conroy once again managing to point from long range.This opened up a five point winning margin with the Mourne men desperately needing scores on the board.However, the weather could not be at fault for all of their shortcomings as they struggled with the impressive Galway forward line.Walsh was once again involved when he surged past the Down defence before setting up team-mate Owen Gallagher for an easy score.Cormac McCartan attempted to get the home side back into the contest with what seemed like an easy kick over from  metres, although the wind made sure the ball hung in the air before ping comfortably into the hands of Galway lsquokeeper Conor Flaherty.Downrsquos Andrew Gilmore did convert his point three minutes later but as per the theme of the match, Galway replied quickly through Tomo Culhane, who took the mark and scored at the other end.Galway introduced the ing Damien Comer to the fray and with his first touch of the ball he also took the mark and made no mistake with his chance to secure another point for the visitors.Walsh was relishing the blustery conditions and was firing from will at all angles, with one such effort sailing over the black spot from around  metres before the half-time whistle.This signied the last score of a half that contained very few positives for McCartanrsquos side.Half-time: Down - Galway -.The Mourne men registered the opening score of the second half, courtesy of a Barry OrsquoHagan free.Two minutes later, home supporters were perhaps left a little surprised when a goal opportunity presented itself but Cormac McCartan opted instead to play it safe and fire over the bar.Nevertheless, Down had scored two points answered and soon OrsquoHagan would ensure a third after he took the mark and converted the chance.OrsquoHagan continued his impressive start to the second half when he kicked over once again following a turnover in possession.It was now Galway who was struggling with the wind, with Kieran Molloy witnessing his straightforward point from  metres halted by the breeze.Passionate ranting from Down manager, James McCartan, saw him pick up a yellow after exchanging words with the fourth official but there was no denying his side at their tails up.A wide mark from Galwayrsquos Paul Kelly encouraged the hosts further but Gallagher eventually notched his sidersquos first point after the interval following twenty minutes of action.Despite all of Downrsquos hard work, the scoreboard still favoured the visitors by five points in what was a sobering reminder of the home outfitrsquos poor first half display.It didnrsquot help the hosts when Comer notched the next score before Walsh followed suit with a trio of converted frees.Galway attempted to inflict further damage at the death as Tony Gill barrelled down on goal, although he was dragged down before he could unleash his shot.Continuing his impressive kicking form from frees, Walsh once again converted to complete his sidersquos scoring.However, it would be Downrsquos Gilmore who would register the final score of the contest with the last kick of the game, as he curled his left-footed effort over the bar in added time.Following the final whistle, Down manager James McCartan reflected on his sidersquos performance.ldquoWe are disappointed, the game was closer than the six point margin but we lost it in the first half, he said.ldquoWe let Galway play and we werenrsquot putting bodies on the line. I challenged the guys at half-time and there was a big improvement in the first twenty minutes of the second half.ldquoGalway hit us on the break and they went and got a couple of late scores to put a bit of gloss on it.

As the game moved into its middle stages, Down began to find their way back into the game with some eye catching counter attacks from their back three.Meanwhile half backs, George Thompson at scrum half and Ben Cassidy at out half, kicked well at key moments in spite of the wind, to capitalise on space left by Friends in their back field.Just before half time it was following one of these kicks that Down earned a penalty on the Friends ten metre line.Cassidy kicked to the corner and off the resulting line out Down mauled close to Friends line before Ryan Halpin saw an opportunity to barge over the whitewash for a well worked try.Cassidy then reduced arrears to one point with an accurate conversion.Down entered the second half confident with the strong wind now very much in their favour.Things didnrsquot always go their way with some periods when the green defence was severely tested.However, around ten minutes into the half Halpin found himself back on the scoresheet to give Down High the lead for the first time as he strode clear of the covering defence off a well-timed pass from rumbling front row forward, Mark Jackson. Cassidy added the two points to give Down a six-point margin in their favour.With ten minutes to go, Halpin played a key role Downrsquos crucial third try. Captain, Brett Kelly who had an excellent day both in attack and defence, laid the foundations for this score executing a pre-planned set piece play.Following this, George Thompson spotted an overlap on the blindside with Halpin ending up on the ball in a two versus one scenario with full back Alex Watson outside him space.The pass was timed superbly and Watson ed over in the corner for an unconverted try to take the score to -.To their credit, the home side didnrsquot accept that Downrsquos  point lead was a done deal and for the closing ten minutes, applied plenty of pressure.Indeed Friends crossed the line with one minute remaining on the clock for an unconverted try leaving a nervy finish for Down High as they sought to protect their six point lead.The restart offered some territorial respite and all in the travelling squad and those supporting them leapt high with joy when a Friends knock-on gave the referee the cue to blow the final whistle with time well past the  minute mark.Down High now face Sullivan Upper at home in the semi-finals on Saturday, February . In other games at home last week, Down High third XV bowed out of their plate competition at the quarter-final stage with a narrow - loss to Campbell College fourth XV in what was an entertaining fixture, while a select U-  team defeated Wellington College -.The other plaudits of the weekend went to the U- A team, who produced a captivating performance to defeat RBAI - on Saturday morning.The U- B and Cs, also playing RBAI, lost but put in some proud performances demonstrating the impressive depth in this squad..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13482881.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Most Fed policymakers are leaning towards increasing interest rates, as inflation in the US hits .%.In the UK, it is at a -year high of .%.And remember that it is people or businesses who have borrowed heavily, perhaps even irresponsibly, who gain when inflation is high. The real-terms value of their debt pile is cut by price increases.It is prudent savers who lose out. Their nest egg suffers the opposite fate, becoming ever less valuable.The Bank of England has control of inflation as one of its core targets.This has been allowed to go into abeyance due to the pandemic. Now is the time for control of prices toto the forefront of the central bank’s thinking.People are back out in shopping stores and in restaurants and bars and extreme pandemic fiscal measures such as abnormally low interest rates might soon start to become an economic problem, not a solution.

Conor Murphy said that the party had not though through the consequence of collapsing the executive.This is from a leading member of Sinn Fein, which was allowed to collapse of Stormont in  for three years until the other main partiesgranted it its price for ato devolution, an Irish language act.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.The DUP’s recent much more minor action of resigning from the executive shortly before an election is in an entirely dferent context, of major constitutional change having been imposed on Northern Ireland, compromising the principle of consent to placate nationalist Ireland.It is striking that the badly needed plan to overhaul the stadia has been stopped and the redevelopment of Casement is going ahead. Mr Murphy says it is an insult to describe the discrepancy as sectarian but it is not surprising that many football fans will interpret the dferent treatment in that way, particularly when the party defending the stadium decision is so reliably tribal and so reliably opposed to proposals that unionist politicians hold dear.It is appalling that the £ million earmarked for sub-regional stadia is not progressing.It is a huge setback for clubs such as Coleraine FC, which have waited so patiently for improvements, and which had drawn up feasible plans for them.As the IFA CEO Patrick Nelson has said see our back page, local football needs investment.Mr Nelson points out that the sub-regional funding was included in the  New Decade New Approach deal to restore Stormont.The only part of that deal that a Conservative and Unionist government intends to rush through is the part that Sinn Fein demands, relating to the gaelic language.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

It cannot be reformed it must go. Any unionists who do not believe me, need only look at the nationalist position on the protocol. They wholeheartedly support it because it promotes a united Ireland and a broken United Kingdom. Second, vocally declare their opposition to it. Indeed, all pro-unionists need to shout their opposition from the roof tops. And third, cooperate with other unionist parties to ensure unionism wins a thumping majority of seats in the May elections.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.Abandoning those elections in protest against the protocol is not an option. Nationalists and Westminster would both sell such a move as unionism accepting it has lost popular support. They would take the opportunity to set the protocol in stone. Indeed, anything short of a thumping victory for unionism would be similarly promoted. Votes cast for nationalist parties in May will be sold as votes for the protocol. If the nationalists win there will be no ditching or even ying the protocol. It will have been confirmed. There is meant to be a vote on the protocol in Stormont in . There is only one poll that matters, the forthcoming elections. The poll for and against the protocol is already upon us. If nationalists win now, the poll in  will be academic. A victory for nationalism will result in their next pushing for a border poll. In their shoes that is exactly what I would do. I would cite victory as proof that there is now popular support for a united Ireland. There is only one policy which matters in the May elections: what is your position on the protocol  Everything  is of subsidiary importance right now. And anything less than total opposition to it would takes us closer to a border poll and a united Ireland. We are where we are because successive British governments, particularly the current administration, have turned their back on Northern Ireland. When it came to Brexit, Boris Johnson had no qualms about throwing the province under a bus to deliver his faux exit from the EU. Even now, after more than a year of damage from the Irish Sea border, Johnson refuses to acknowledge the constitutional threat posed by the Protocol. He says it is a technical problem one that could be resolved by the EU being pragmatic. His naivety is deliberate and disingenuous. He does not want to face the problem and he does not need to face it. The thing which matters most to Johnson is remaining in office and there are no votes for him in Northern Ireland. He will not be coming to our rescue. The responsibility to save our union falls to pro-unionists in Northern Ireland and their leaders.Make no mistake,unionist parties do not win big in May, we will face a border poll as soon as this year. No unionist party could surely want such a thing. Now is therefore no time for weakness or party politics. Unionist parties must set aside their dferences and work in union for our union. We need a Grand Alliance of Unionism. Doug Beattie, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Jim Allister carry the hopes and expectations of pro-unionists not just in Northern Island but across the British Isles.• Ben Habib is a former Brexit Party MEP——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

We opened in the middle of things before a second lockdown – it was a harsh time to open a shop but hopefully it’s going back to normal now.”Stormont Finance Minister Conor Murphy said he wanted to get to a position where there was no need for any Covid- guidance.“We look forward to a time that we can remove all restrictions, and all guidance becomes a thing of the past,” he said yesterday.“But the pandemic is still going on, there are still people dying, there’s still people contracting the virus. And so there has to be a degree of caution in relation to that.”Health Minister Robin Swann confirmed on Monday that all legal restrictions in the Province would be replaced by guidance from yesterday.Mr Swann, who tested positive for coronavirus on Sunday, was advised by the attorney general last week on the potential legal complications of him replacing Covid regulations with guidance amid the current political crisis in the Province.But the lting of Covid- legal restrictions should not be viewed as “freedom day”, Stormont’s chief scientic adviser said yesterday.Professor Ian Young urged people to continue to wear face masks in certain public settings, even though it will no longer be a legal requirement.“When something changes from regulation to guidance it doesn’t mean that our behaviours need to change, or indeed that they should change,” Prof Young said.“I think most of our population are acutely aware of the dangers and risks which Covid has brought, the huge harms that have been done.“We all want people to get back to living as normally as possible – wearing a face covering in appropriate settings doesn’t stop that.”He added: “I would absolutely not use the term ‘freedom day’. This is not freedom day.”Hospitality Ulster chief executive Colin Neill, meanwhile, welcomed the change.“After nearly two long years, the hospitality industry will be relieved that they can begin to trade without pandemic restrictions limiting the viability of their businesses,” he said.“We must have full focus on rebuilding consumer confidence and supporting the hospitality industry as a key driver for the wider economy.”He continued: “The lting of the remaining restrictions, including mandatory passes at nightclubs and recording customer details, will hopefully signal a major turning point for the industry and see theof the thriving industry we once had which contributed over £bn annually to the local economy. “We want to see local customers ing and visitors from where with the opening of greater tourism opportunities. That buzz has been missed. “Now, attention must turn to the plan of action on how to best rebuild and revitalise the industry to ensure that it s to its former position as a signicant employer and economic generator. “Through a dedicated hospitality strategy, innovative plans and actions can be implemented which will help hospitality regrow, and help create further jobs and opportunities for the sector as we emerge from the pandemic.”Retail NI chief executive Glyn Roberts said: “We can now reopen our economy and accelerate the recovery of our High Streets.“However, we are disappointed that the statement does not include a clear commitment toto the workplace. Safely reopening offices and workplaces is not only vital to boost footfall for our high streets, but also for our economy and ing our society to normal.”He added: “Northern Ireland needs to catch up with other parts of the UK with its -to-workplace message.“Retail NI want to see the Executive establish a working group to produce a clear and co-ordinated plan for the safe and timelyof public and private sector staff.”Northern IrelandConor MurphyRobin SwannBelfastColin Neill  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularThis is no time for unionist weakness on the Irish Sea borderStorm warnings for Northern Ireland now include heavy snowNorthern Ireland Protocol could see a wide range of new regulations imposed on NI, says committee of MPsBelfast university culture spat: ‘No-one is convinced by efforts to portray the Irish language as cross-community’The RUC did not help in the aftermath of the McGurk’s bar bombMost PopularWhat’s going to happen in Season  of Netflix’s Bridgerton: what happens in Julia Quinn’s novels, where to buyHow to boost your home wi signal: the best wi router extenders  from BT, Netgear, Orbi, and AmazonRoyal Mint releases commemorative £ coin to mark  years of FA CupUnderwear for men UK : boxers, briefs and y-fronts from Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Armani and NikeMS have announced their Christmas dinner range for  - here’s what’s available, on sale now                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The next phase would be to transform a three-acre grass area beside the stadium into a G area for community use.The final phase of the vision is for an all-seater stadium with an international-size pitch accommodating between , and , spectators.

We do intend to do that through the [UK Government’s] ‘Levelling Up Fund’.“That in itself would give us a separate area where we could have all our youth groups, community groups, I don’t care who they are as long as the place is thriving, it’s vibrant, being utilised seven days a week.“That is always the aim of the club to bring the community into the area around the club. What it will do is regenerate the area of Coleraine which is an area of deprivation – that’s not me saying that, that is the statistics that are produced for Northern Ireland.”He added: “What we were looking for through the Sub Regional Stadia Programme was to create a North West Regional Stadium with state of the art training facilities and a community hub.“If you’re a team, say from Scotland, who doesn’t want to be going to Spain for pre-season training on an annual basis, Coleraine is right on your doorstep. There’s some great golf courses for a bit of rest and relaxation, great hotels – it all makes sense.”He said: “It was incredibly disappointing but not unexpected when the minister made the announcement.“I sincerely hope that we as a footballing family all come together and put pressure on the minister to reverse her judgement.“I would also strongly support engaging with the Gaelic community, I believe both communities need the facilities.“My thinking is that all the sporting communities should come together and put pressure on the minister to reverse her judgement.“It’s very disappointing that sport finds itself embroiled in a political situation, there are undoubtedly those who are using this is a political weapon, all they’re doing is depriving the youth and prosperity of all of society by their shortsightedness.”He added: “We’re proceeding with all our plans and hopefully further down the line after the election when there’s new candidates in, the money can be resurrected.”Intermediate club Bangor FC planned to use funding from the Department for Communities ill-fated stadia programme as part of the club’s push toto the Premiership.Largely based on cash from Deirdre Hargey’s department, the club – who have been absent from Northern Ireland’s top ision for more than  years – submitted a planning application for a new -seater grandstand and community hub.Bangor FC Chairman Graham Bailie said: “We are extremely disappointed about the news of the funding package for football stadia in Northern Ireland being shelved. “These funds were set to transform football club facilities across Northern Ireland. “A new modern grandstand and community hub are an essential step in the evolution of our plans to bring Premiership football back to Bangor FC. “Our ambition is to continue making progress on the pitch, and supporting the local community off it. “That is why we included a community hub at the heart of this project. “However, it was always dependent on securing a combination of public funds, from the Sub Regional Stadia Programme, and private investment opportunities.” He said the club now needs an answer to the question of whether the funding will now be available in the budget which spans  to . Mr Bailie said: “Bangor is one of the largest conurbations in Northern Ireland, and our continued vision is to upgrade the ground to match this position, as we progress through the leagues andto the Irish Premiership.”Despite the obvious setback, he said: “We need to keep trying to push forward, so as a board we are working through all other options which we think might be available. “The facility upgrade is needed in order for us to continue our progress.”——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityIn a letter to UK immigration minister Kevin Foster, representatives of the three devolved administrations claimed that processes for skilled workers looking to come to Britain were “inflexible, costly and bureaucratic” and had also served to “exclude many of the key workers that we need, many of whom have been crucial during the Covid- pandemic”.The letter, from Wales social justice minister, Jane Hutt, Scottish Europe minister, Neil Gray, and Northern Ireland economy minister, Gordon Lyons, states there are “severe labour and skills shortages” in all four nations of the UK.But they claim the UK Government has failed to “work constructively” with the devolved administrations to try to tackle the problem.The Welsh, Scottish, and Northern Irish politicians insisted the Home Office should “immediately reintroduce” regular four-way meetings where such issues can be discussed.They told Mr Foster: “The UK Government has said it wants the immigration system to work for all parts of the UK.“Without a commitment to regular and meaningful engagement with the devolved governments, this is simply not possible.”UK ministers were also urged to “immediately review the immigration skills and health surcharges and reduce additional fees”, with Governments in Edinburgh, Cardf and Belfast arguing these can be an “insurmountable barrier for both workers and employers”.They added: “As it stands, the UK has one of the most costly immigration systems and this cannot continueit is to be an attractive destination for global talent moving forward.”Ms Hutt, Mr Gray, and Mr Lyons repeated calls for the devolved administrations to be given a formal role in deciding which occupations there is a shortage of in their nations, in a bid to make it easier to recruit overseas workers to these posts..remove“We call upon the UK Government to act urgently,” they said.The three ministers told Mr Foster it was critical that their administrations are involved in the issue, arguing: “Migration is a cross-cutting policy area affecting many aspects of devolved competency including the economy, housing, healthcare and the delivery of local services.”However they claimed: “Sadly in spite of our efforts, the UK Government has consistently failed to consult, collaborate, or work constructively with the devolved Governments on any changes pertaining to the immigration system.“This is despite the severe labour and skills shortages faced across all four nations which can largely be attributed to the excessively restrictive UK immigration system.”They added: “We are doing everything within our respective powers to ensure that the needs of businesses are met, but the action we take must be supplemented by immediate changes to the immigration system in order to quickly access the labour and skills our nations need to survive the current crisis.”A spokeswoman for the Home Office said: “Our points-based immigration system is focused on talent and skills and makes it much easier for the brightest and best to live and study in the UK.“We continue to engage with the devolved administrations on immigration policies but it is important that employers make long term investments in the UK domestic workforce instead of relying on labour from abroad.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

We lost four players in January.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communitySchools are already required to teach in a politically impartial way, but this is the first Government guidance of its kind on how schools should approach the teaching of sensitive issues.The guidance suggests that the teaching of historical figures should focus on “factual information” about them, and that teaching of the British empire should be presented in “a balanced manner”.One scenario refers to teaching pupils about racism and cautions that teachers should be aware that campaign groups such as Black Lives Matter “cover partisan political views”.It says that “teachers should be clear that racism has no place in our society” when covering this topic with pupils, and should “help pupils to understand facts about this and the law”.It adds that some campaign groups such as Black Lives Matter may cover “partisan political views…which go beyond the shared principle that racism is unacceptable, which is a view schools should reinforce”.“Examples of such partisan political views include advocating specic views on how Government resources should be used to address social issues, including withdrawing funding from the police,” it adds.The guidance says that for recent historical events, “including those which are particularly contentious and disputed, political issues may be presented to pupils”.It adds: “This includes many topics relating to empire and imperialism, on which there are dfering partisan political views, and which should be taught in a balanced manner.”It says that schools should be free to teach pupils about signicant political figures, including “those who have controversial and contested legacies”.But it adds that this may need to be reserved for older pupils, and says that it could be advisable to focus teaching on “what these figures are most renowned for and factual information about them,”teachers think pupils may not be able to understand the full context of contested information about their lives..remove vw,vw,px, px\"Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi In the guidance, Mr Zahawi said: “Over the last few years, there has been much discussion about political impartiality in schools, often in the context of specic political issues and movements.”“I know that this has at times been dficult for school leaders, teachers, and staff, as they navigate how to handle and teach about these complex issues sensitively and appropriately,” he added.“That is why I’m pleased this Government is publishing clear guidance explaining schools’ existing legal duties on political impartiality.”The guidance states that when teachers are discussing the decriminalisation of homosexuality with pupils, they should not present discriminatory beliefs held at the time in an uncritical way, or as though they are acceptable today.It adds that pupils should not be presented with views that oppose fundamental societal values, such as views denigrating freedom of speech or the democratic process.When inviting politicians or campaigners to speak in schools, teachers should aim to invite a range of speakers with ying views, or teach directly about other candidates or political parties to promote balance.Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “It never been more important to facilitate and encourage discussions about political and contemporaneous issues as it is now.“Young people are exposed to a swirl of misinformation online, and an increasingly toxic discourse on social media as well as in political debate among those who should know better.”“Schools have a vital role in providing a safe space in which young people can examine and understand controversial issues.“The vast majority of teachers are very good at managing these discussions in a way that is balanced and impartial. We welcome anything which helps them to navigate this dficult territory.”He added: “However, we are keen that this should not be over-prescriptive as it could have the unintended consequence of deterring open discussions.”Mr Zahawi said: “I know one of the reasons many teachers feel so passionate about the profession is the remarkable role they play in young people’s lives, helping them understand more about themselves and their views of the world.“I don’t want there to be any barriers – real or perceived – to teachers’ vital work in this space, which is why I am reinforcing that no subject is off-limits in the classroom, as long as it is treated in an age-appropriate way, with sensitivity and respect, and without promoting contested theories as fact.“Clearer guidance on political impartiality is just one part of my wider work to give children the best possible education as the Government continues to prioritise skills, schools and families, to enable young people to reach the full height of their potential.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Schools given  uimpartiality guidance u on teaching of racism and British Empire article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_aaeadeaf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_aaedabdaaaddca   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1644849796034.jpg--covid_19___mon_14th_february_figures.jpg?164484979600","title":"covid  mon th february figures ","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows two further coronavirus related deaths and , new positive test results.

They are to be replaced by guidance after Mr Swann obtained support for the move from his fellow ministers. Social distancing, regulations on the number people allowed in homes and the COVID passport scheme are also gone. There are only a small number of restrictions left in place, said Mr Swann, who is isolating after testing positive for coronavirus, in his statement to the Assembly. In light of the current situation, and remembering the commitment that restrictions would only be in place as long as they are needed, I have decided that those remaining measures should no longer be set out in regulations. Instead, they should be placed in guidance to be followed by the public. I shall therefore be making an order on Tuesday, February  revoking the remaining restrictions and face-covering regulations. The relevant guidance will be updated.” He added that the changes do “not mean that Covid- has gone away or that we as a community are safe from its harm”. Mr Swann continued, “It is vitally important that we continue to observe the sensible measures we have all learnt to protect ourselves and others. Even with these powers in place however, it would almost certainly be impossible to introduce new restrictions in the absence of an Executive.
