He allegedly fathered a son with his aide Dr Henrietta Morton-King 20 months ago after an affair while she worked in his Westminster office in 2015She lives with her parents near Hastings, about 20 miles from Mr Merriman’s family home, and works at a beauty salon providing Botox-style treatments. A source told The Sun:  ‘Huw and Hetty started the affair while she was working as his assistant and it carried on after she moved to finish her medical training at Conquest Hospital, near Hastings.‘She later gave birth at the same hospital.’ The source added: ‘The relationship with Hetty is now over. Huw has stayed with his wife who is fully aware of the situation.’ Dr Morton-King, whose friends and family call her Hetty, went to the University of Bristol where she studied medicine.She then specialised in aesthetic medicine at North Cumbria University Hospitals and on Harley Street in London, which is renowned for its cosmetic surgery clinics.Dr Morton-King then took a career break and worked in her local MP Huw Merriman\u0027s office.It is believed that she then transferred to Conquest Hospital, Hastings, to continue her medical training after falling pregnant, and also had her son there.A year after his birth she joined the \u0027Beauty Barn\u0027 in Battle, where she offers dermal fillers and wrinkle relaxing using Botox just three miles from the home she shares with her parents. The affair is said to have begun shortly after Mr Merriman was elected to Parliament in May 2015. Dr Morton-King gave birth in October 2016.Mr Merriman, a former barrister at collapsed investment bank Lehman Brothers, married in 2001. A friend said: ‘There is no hostility towards Huw from Hetty or her family. They understand his place is with his wife and family.’   The married Tory, 44, (pictured left) was previously accused of telling solicitor colleague Patronia Campbell (right) he wanted to marry her after an alleged one night standLast night, Mrs Merriman declined to comment and her husband was unavailable. In 2016, Mr Merriman was accused by an ex-Lehman Brothers colleague of harassment.          Pattie Campbell told a tribunal Mr Merriman was a notorious womaniser who\u0027s had a string of affairsLawyer Patronia Campbell told a tribunal they had spent the night together in 2011.She claimed he told her he was ‘turned on’ by her legs and wanted to marry her. She later dropped her £250,000 claim against the MP.Mr Merriman always denied the one night stand took place. One witness said they saw him looking \u0027sheepish\u0027 in his pants the morning after, the tribunal heard.Describing the one night stand Ms Campbell told the East London tribunal in 2016: \u0027Huw and I cooked and drank more wine.\u0027He kissed me after dinner and we ended up in my bed and had sex.\u0027I woke up in his arms he asked me if I was OK and I said yes but that it would never happen again.\u0027According to Ms Campbell, the only person she told about the one night stand was her sister, but did reveal her house mate would have known Mr Merriman had slept in her bed.Ms Campbell told the tribunal their previous relationship in the late 1990s was not sexual and she ended it because Mr Merriman had a girlfriend in New York, who later became his wife.Following a Christmas lunch at The Gun pub in 2012 Mr Merriman \u0027insinuated\u0027 he wanted a sexual relationship, she told the tribunal.Ms Campbell, who claimed Mr Merriman was a notorious womaniser who\u0027s had a string of affairs, said he wanted to marry her after a Christmas lunch in 2012.Ms Campbell was made redundant in 2014, which she claimed was unfair. She later dropped her her £250,000 damages claim. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/26/09/4DA4581000000578-0-image-a-13_1530000957067.jpg","title":"Adorable moment little girl kisses sedated rhino better","story":"    Three-year-old Ava kissed Chuck the white rhino after he was dehorned at the Kragga Kamma Game Park in South Africa \u0027Her reaction was totally spontaneous, we think she thought her father was harming the rhino as she was visibly distressed watching the dehorning and immediately went to \u0027kiss it better\u0027,\u0027 she said.  Baffled scientists on a mission to discover what gives rare...Share this articleAva\u0027s affection for the rhino was a surprise to the group, Ms Cantor said. \u0027It is going to be up to her generation to save the rhino, our generation has certainly not been successful in stemming the flow,\u0027 she added.

The ban also covers ski masks and full-face helmets. The government said people still have full freedom on how to dress, except when it is necessary to have full facial contact - for instance in education and health-related situations.The ban does not apply to public streets, although police can ask an inidual to remove face-covering clothing for identification.Annelies Moors, professor of Anthropology and Sociology at the University of Amsterdam said: \u0027This is actually virtually a complete ban because the only spaces that are still available for women (who wear face-covering clothing) are the street and the private sector.\u0027And, of course, the private sector can also have their house rules, they could also possibly legislate against their presence.

Conflict: Merkel\u0027s sister party, the CSU, wants asylum-seekers who have registered in another EU country to be turned away at the German border, but the Chancellor says an agreement needs to be made with neighbouring countriesThe CSU meet on Sunday to decide whether to defy Merkel and introduce the new controls.If Seehofer goes ahead with his plans, many members of Merkel\u0027s CDU say she would be forced to fire him.That could lead to a breakup of the 70-year old alliance between the CDU and CSU and rob Merkel of a parliamentary majority.The main options then look like a Merkel-led minority government or a new election. It is also possible that Merkel, chancellor for nearly 13 years, may lose support in her own CDU.However, some commentators say the CSU has softened its tone in the last day or two, with some members saying the aim is not to bring down Merkel\u0027s government - even if they are not shifting on the main substance of their plans.Merkel\u0027s open-door migrant policy, which has led to the arrival of more than 1.6 million migrants in Germany since the start of 2015, is blamed for the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), now the main opposition party.

In between, he created a body of work that is without precedent in postwar photography.As his recent retrospective at the Pompidou in Paris made clear, South Africa was Goldblatt’s sole subject and his life’s work. I can think of no other photographer who has left behind such a deeply resonant expression of a country’s complex identity. For most of his working life, Goldblatt created a stark, but subtle depiction of the abnormality of apartheid without ever allowing his own anger at the injustices he witnessed to surface in his work. Instead, his detached documentarian’s eye captured the everyday experiences of ordinary people caught up in a landscape determined, like everything else in South Africa, by race laws created to reinforce and perpetuate white rule.One of his earliest series, made while he was still a teenager, documented the lives of black workers in the country’s gold-mining areas. The industry defined the environment he grew up in and, by the time he had become a professional photographer in the 60s, it defined white South Africa’s wealth, too, with nearly half the world’s gold being produced there. That wealth made the apartheid system, under which the black miners’ lives were controlled and devalued, even more grotesque.In 1973, he published On the Mines, which included an essay by Nadine Gordimer, who he later said had influenced his work more than any photographic predecessor. It was the first of several starkly evocative, black and white photobooks made by Goldblatt. In his commercial work, Goldblatt was not averse to shooting in colour, but photographically at least he saw South Africa in black and white. “During those years,” he said, “colour seemed too sweet a medium to express the anger, disgust and fear that apartheid inspired.” The monochrome tones and meticulous compositions of his landscapes and portraits emphasise not just his formal detachment, but his abiding sense of psychological isolation. His parents were Jewish leftwingers who had fled religious persecution in Lithuania, their experience surely informing his work. He famously described himself as “a self-appointed observer and critic of the society into which I was born”.Wandering through that recent retrospective of his work was to see it unfold with a cumulative power that instilled a sense of almost devotional quietude. Goldblatt had a keen eye for symbolic objects: a stacked arrangement of miners’ shovels in a salvage yard, shelves full of canned goods in a shop in Soweto. I was struck, too, by the austere poetry of his images. It is a language of suggestion, of atmosphere, of small but telling details: the craggy, unreadable faces of many of the older white Afrikaners the stern, almost imperial look of those three young white landowners on horseback the languorous but defiant gaze of the young, black, female shop assistant, born into a system where oppression and humiliation was a given. Goldblatt photographed them all with equal attentiveness, his detached but democratic eye allowing the viewer the space to see beyond the frame and sense the grotesque – but normalised – society that defined his subjects to such a degree.As a boy, Goldblatt had worked as a shop assistant in his father’s clothing store, where the customers were Afrikaners. He described them in years later as “austere, upright, unaffected people” who nevertheless supported the ruling National Party and its apartheid policy. “I had great difficulty,” he recalled, “in getting my head and heart around these contradictions.” That conflict is there, too, in his work, but one always sensed where his sympathies lay. In his portraits of his fellow white South Africans, there is a sense of a society in stasis, unchanging and doggedly resistant to the inevitable sweep of history and the increasingly clamorous global protests that apartheid provoked.When everything changed swiftly and dramatically in the wake of Nelson Mandela’s release from prison, Goldblatt continued photographing the world around him with critical fascination. He made contact with ex-prisoners who had served time for often violent assaults, recorded their own stories of survival and photographed them at the scenes of their crimes. It was an attempt to understand life in post-apartheid South Africa where, he said, the values “are not the same values that Mandela stood up for they are greed and self-congratulation”.It is for his images of apartheid-era South Africa, though, that he will be remembered, not least because their quiet observational power and moments of arresting drama – a 15-year-old boy staring straight into the camera, both arms encased in plaster following his arrest and detention by security forces – add up to an extended portrait of a place and a time that is without equal in modern photography.He was, above all, a master of the extended series, each building on the last until a portrait of an entire society, in all its contradictions, emerges. “I would look at Edward Weston’s work,” he said, “and envy the freedom to be lyrical … to photograph a landscape apparently without concern for the implications of its possession.” Those implications, though, are at the very core of photography, and he made us aware of them again and again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b93fd4b896f4fbc133277664e57c3a7c9e76639e/0_0_2100_1680/master/2100.jpg?w=480\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=5201b99ccd6ae0281b24f0d43c282327 960w","title":"i grew up with a mother behind bars but her innocence wasnt the only lie i was sold","story":"Australia has become a country defined by its love of locking people up and we see the most vulnerable in our society as a threat In a lecture hall at the University of Queensland, a woman in acid-wash jeans and cowboy boots sits with her legs apart addressing a rapt audience. She speaks in gritty tones that tell of a working-class childhood and a late education. Debbie Kilroy is the founder of Sisters Inside, an advocacy group for incarcerated women. She pulls no punches. Prison is big business. We must shut down the prison-industrial complex.I first learned of Sisters Inside when I was studying law. I had picked up a brochure about the latest Is Prison Obsolete? conference, which was to be held in Melbourne. I showed it to my mother. “Women who’ve been in prison can attend for free.” She registered immediately. It had been several years since she had been released after her final stint. She was living in Brunswick, studying a PhD in literature and nagging me to start dressing properly. We spent a memorable three days listening to prison abolitionists from around the world talking about injustices inflicted on women in custody. At 22 I was dimly aware that the issues being discussed both did and did not align with what she had represented to me as a child. Throughout the decade my mother had spent in and out of custody for a suite of dishonesty offences, she had maintained her innocence. It was a cliche to which I was oblivious. Even once I entered law school, I had still to be disabused of my belief in her. As Red tells Andy in The Shawshank Redemption: “Everyone in here’s innocent.”It was in 2009 that I first visited a prison as a lawyer. I was 26 and a junior solicitor at the North Australian Aboriginal Justice Agency, the Aboriginal legal service in the Northern Territory. The visitors’ centre at Berrimah was outdoors, covered by a tin roof, with open sides through which you could see the prison wall. Two white officers supervised the mostly black inmates seated at the wooden tables with their families or their lawyers.When I pushed open the heavy metal gate, I was flooded with memories of a long-ago prison visit, the first time my mother was held on remand. I had cried myself to sleep on a mattress on my cousin’s floor. My aunt drove me to the prison on Saturday and we stood beside the menacing prison wall until someone answered our buzz at the intercom. I saw my mother through the fence before they hauled the door open for me to run through and hug her. Her prison tracksuit felt strange against my face. I fought these memories off while I talked to my client at Berrimah. Fairlea women’s prison closed in 1996 as sections of the prison system were privatised. Unbeknown to my nine-year-old self, standing in the lee of its wall on that Saturday morning in 1991, Australia was poised to embark on a project of relentless penal expansionism. The ethical problems with private prisons are obvious. Companies profiting from mass punishment their continuing growth and profit potential becoming important to the economy. They also give rise to an apparent conflict of interest. The goal of prison, in theory, is to rehabilitate. When a company’s continued operation demands a robust prison population, there is no incentive to foster conditions that promote staying out of jail post-release. What’s more, with private prisons comes reduced accountability in a sector where accountability has been sorely lacking. It is very difficult to obtain records from a private prison through freedom of information, meaning that deaths in custody cannot be fully investigated for possible breaches of duty of care. For this reason, when the Ngaanyatjarra elder Mr Ward died in the back of a prison transport vehicle going through the Western Australian desert in 2008, records relating to what contractor Global Solutions Ltd knew about the faulty airconditioning in the vehicle could not be accessed. When I was very young, I accompanied my mother to court in Melbourne. She sat primly beside me, neatly dressed, legs crossed. I squeezed her hand and tried to put my arm around her shoulders, but she shrugged me off. The wait was interminable and each minute brought a new layer of dread. She had been to jail before she might be going again. She was an innocent woman, so I thought, being persecuted by the system. Her solicitor sat at the front of the court, laughing and talking with the other young lawyers. I couldn’t hold my mother’s hand tightly enough. “Why isn’t she sitting with you?” I asked, indicating the solicitor, whose insouciance I found offensive. “How can they be laughing like that?” Though I had a lot of the details wrong, my sense of injustice at the casual way people were deprived of their liberty has been vindicated. More than two decades later, we have become a country defined by our love of locking people up. It’s no coincidence that during the same years the penal system has massively expanded in Australia, immigration detention has also become a booming industry. We view the most vulnerable as a threat, whether their desperation manifests in ways that society has criminalised, or by trying to reach our shores to seek asylum. Either way, companies like Serco and G4S stand to gain. Criminal law posits imprisonment in the interests of general deterrence, specific deterrence and rehabilitation. At criminal law conferences, many judges and magistrates openly acknowledge that general deterrence is a fiction and that prison doesn’t rehabilitate. There is talk of justice reinvestment, the practice of redirecting funds that would be used to incarcerate people back into the communities they come from to create infrastructure, jobs and support programs, addressing the factors that led them to offend. In some communities, like Bourke in New South Wales, justice reinvestment programs are being trialled, but public pressure remains for governments to be “tough on crime”.From the modest stage in the lecture theatre at the University of Queensland, Debbie Kilroy matter-of-factly describes the strip-searches female prisoners must go through before they receive visitors. Before and after the visit they must undress, lift their breasts, part their cheeks and, if they are menstruating, take their tampon out. There is obvious discomfort among the audience at these words. Most women in prison have been the victims of sexual abuse. Many women opt to forgo seeing their family, or choose to speak to them in a room ided by a glass partition, rather than go through the searches.As I listen I recall train trips out to Laverton and the shuttle bus to the Dame Phyllis Frost Centre to see my mother as a teenager. The strip searches didn’t particularly bother her, she used to say, but they were terrible for women who had been through trauma. I realise I’d never thought to ask if one weekend suited her better than another. Sometimes I turned up unexpectedly. “I wasn’t expecting to see you today,” she always said. “What a nice surprise.” She once told me how she and her drug smuggler mate had tried to calculate how much money was made from the criminal justice system. Big business, they had concluded.I’m 34 now, and have only recently pieced together my childhood. It has taken years to fully understand that my mother’s claim of having been “set up” by the police was what people in the territory call “gammon” – bullshit. When I first heard Kilroy speak at the conference in Melbourne, I still believed my mother innocent. At the end of the conference, Kilroy had invited all the women in the audience who had been “inside” to rise to their feet. Women throughout the hall had stood stiffly and those remaining seated looked at them with something like admiration. My mother had left at lunchtime that day. If she had been there to rise to her feet, what would she have felt towards the daughter who had brought her along, her head still full of her mother’s lies?It has been some time since we have spoken. I just want you to admit what really happened, I had told her. This time, I’m here alone. To one side of me two heavily pierced women listen intently. In front of me sit several earnest-looking undergraduates. A few people stand up to leave. Kilroy picks up the microphone one last time.

The benefits for residents seem obvious – but what’s in it for the cities?For the first time in many years, Lance Dingman has food in his freezer.Dingman, from Hamilton in Ontario, Canada, lost one of his legs in 1988 as a result of a bone infection and now has a prosthetic he has also struggled with his mental health. He used to receive a disability benefit, but the amount was so low as to leave him no way out of poverty. Today Dingman, 56, is paid C$1,900 (£1,080) per month under the city’s basic income pilot project – and he says the difference is life-changing.“I’ve been able to plan ahead, especially for food,” he says. “My overall health has improved because my diet is better. I can also afford hygiene products – which was very difficult before.”Most significant of all is the impact on his confidence. “Basic income has given me freedom to live with some dignity with a little extra money to buy the essentials in life,” says Dingman. “I want to make the most of this opportunity and work up to a full-time job eventually ... I feel much more in control of my own life.”Hamilton, a city of about 551,000 people, is now a third of the way through its three-year experiment with a universal basic income (UBI) scheme. Funded by the provincial government, the pilot is testing whether a basic income of up to C$17,000 for all 1,000 participating iniduals –plus a C$6,000 supplement for those with a disability – is more effective in reducing poverty than its existing social security system.The basic income model offers double the amount that is standard for welfare in Ontario, and Tom Cooper, director of the Hamilton Roundtable for Poverty Reduction, says it has already started to yield positive results, with the most important being a “restoration of dignity”.“People who are participating in the basic income pilot seem to have a renewed sense of hope and are beginning to dream about their futures,” he says. “Personally, I believe basic income will become the preeminent social policy imperative of the 21st century.”Cities the world over are experimenting with basic income, with supporters arguing that it would help to alleviate inequality in society and give people a social financial foundation in an uncertain future. “Universal income will be necessary over time if AI takes over most human jobs,” Elon Musk tweeted two weeks ago. Jeremy Corbyn, Bernie Sanders, Mark Zuckerberg and the Nobel prize-winning economist Angus Deaton are also in favour.The benefits of money for nothing for residents seem obvious – but what are the benefits for cities?The first such scheme to be tested by an urban authority in Europe is Barcelona’s B-Mincome. Launched in October 2017, it is funded by the city council and a grant provided by the European Commission programme Urban Innovative Actions. The two-year pilot guarantees 1,000 households in the district of Besos, the city’s poorest area, income supplements of between €100 (£88) and €1,676 per month.Around 900 of the families are also participating in “social economy” projects relating to employment, housing and community action to inform analysis of the neighbourhoods and their openness to creative solutions to poverty, such as time banks in which participants trade their abilities and time instead of money.“We need to look at how we can better mobilise the community to help tackle poverty in cities, because public policies in the traditional way of the welfare state are not working,” says Fernando Barreiro, project manager for B-Mincome.One of the criticisms often heard of “free money” schemes is that they create a dependency class. The Hamilton pilot will evaluate whether participants’ physical and mental health improve with income security, and if they are able to maintain housing and stay engaged in work.However, Jim Pugh, co-founder of the Universal Income Project, says many studies have shown that very few people receiving basic income drop out of the workforce.“Some experiments have even found that basic income increases entrepreneurship, which would ultimately lead to more employment down the road,” says Pugh. “The truth is that most people want to contribute to society. If we can provide them with basic financial security, they’ll find a way to do it.”Next year Stockton in California will become the first US city to guarantee a basic income for some of its poorest residents, with about 100 families to receive US$500 (£377) a month – funded by philanthropic donors – for a 12- to 18-month period.“When nearly half of Americans can’t come up with $400 in case of an emergency, I think it’s likely this scheme will have a significant impact on recipients,” says Lori Ospina, the scheme’s director. “We think the current economic situation requires effective and innovative solutions and hope other city leaders will pursue measures that go beyond the status quo. This is hopefully just the start of a much larger national conversation.”Macau is ahead of the trend, having provided all residents with a small annual basic income since 2008. Permanent residents receive 9,000 patacas (£840), funded by huge profits from the city’s casino taxes. Nonpermanent residents receive about half that amount.This year Macau’s government has announced it will spend a total of $1.61bn on public subsidies. But views on the so-called wealth partaking scheme are not as positive as you might expect, with critics saying that the payout would need to be larger and more frequent for it to have any real chance of lifting residents out of poverty.For resident Stephanie Chan, 31, the payout is “just a little bit of extra cash” she might spend on travel or shopping: “For some poorer residents, they might find the money helps towards their rent. “Generally though, I think most residents would prefer the government to spend the money in more useful ways, like building more hospitals and housing or improving the city’s infrastructure – rather than just giving us the money.”Kwong says it served to boost positive sentiment for its first two years but became less effective from 2010. Now he and other critics of the policy believe the government dares not give up the policy for fear of protests.Even those who support the good intentions and bold design of UBI schemes have questioned their sustainability in the long term. In April Finland made headlines for concluding its basic income trial after two years, though this was influenced by a looming national election in early 2019.But the criticism that basic income would dismantle the welfare state is “rubbish”, says Guy Standing, founder and co-president of the Basic Income Earth Network. He is in favour of maintaining benefits for the most vulnerable people in society even with basic income, and has no doubt that it is affordable.“There is no reason why a city or country could not afford to have a basic income for everybody,” says Standing. “In Britain, tax reliefs for the wealthy and corporations come to about £400bn a year – this by itself could be used to pay for a basic income for everybody. “It’s not something that is unaffordable – it’s a matter of priorities.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f43d4822d6bfd8fafe96909c7f39bbc5d6b0e7e/0_68_2300_1380/master/2300.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e60ac1594183a93351b254e49519f19e","title":"aliens exist survival universe jim alkhalili","story":"A new study suggests that we could well be on our own in the universe. Yet loneliness might have its advantagesIn 1950 Enrico Fermi, an Italian-born American Nobel prize-winning physicist, posed a very simple question with profound implications for one of the most important scientific puzzles: whether or not life exists beyond Earth. The story goes that during a lunchtime chat with colleagues at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, the issue of flying saucers came up. The conversation was lighthearted, and it doesn’t appear that any of the scientists at that particular gathering believed in aliens. But Fermi merely wanted to know: “Where is everybody?”His point was that, since the age of the universe is so great and its size so vast, with hundreds of billions of stars in the Milky Way alone, then unless the Earth is astonishingly special, the universe should be teeming with life. This might include intelligent species advanced enough to have the knowledge and technology necessary for space travel. They ought to have colonised the entire galaxy by now. So where are they all?More recently, the late Stephen Hawking argued along similar lines. He said, “To my mathematical brain, the numbers alone make thinking about aliens perfectly rational.” Hawking was articulating the same popular argument as Fermi – that the sheer vastness of the universe all but guarantees we have company.In recent years, scientists have begun to take the subject more seriously again. One of the most exciting areas of research in astronomy has been the discovery of\u0026nbspextra-solar planets, worlds orbiting stars other than our sun. Many of them even appear to be Earth-like in size and climate. Astronomers now believe there are billions of these other worlds, many of which will have conditions suitable for life. The probability of life, maybe even intelligent life, existing on at least one of them must surely, therefore, be overwhelming.Now however, scientists at the wonderfully named Future of Humanity Institute in Oxford have poured cold water on Hawking’s and others’ optimism. They have carried out a thoughtful statistical analysis by dissecting a mathematical relation known as the Drake equation, which allows us to calculate the probability of extraterrestrial life based on the combined probabilities of all the ingredients for life being in place.Let me make clear at the outset that the Drake equation is not very scientific, for the sole reason that some of the factors that need to be fed into it are pure guesswork at this stage. Not the least of these is the big question: given all the things we believe are necessary for life (a source of energy, liquid water and organic molecules), how likely is it that life will emerge?Biologists, of course, hate all this silly speculation. They quite rightly point out that we still do not properly understand how life originated here on Earth, so how can we possibly have any confidence in anticipating its existence or nonexistence elsewhere? There are some who argue that life on Earth appeared pretty quickly after the right conditions emerged almost 4bn years ago, which was when our planet had cooled sufficiently for liquid water to exist. Doesn’t that mean it could easily appear elsewhere too? Actually, no. A statistical sample of one tells us nothing. It is quite possible that biology is a freak local aberration, the product of a chemical fluke so improbable that it didn’t happen anywhere else in the observable universe.So where do we stand? Well, there are reasons to believe that we may have an answer in the coming decade or two, one way or the other. Astrobiologists are about to search exoplanets for the gases produced by microbial life using sophisticated next-generation space telescopes. There is also the possibility of finding microbial life closer to home, under the ice of several of the moons of Jupiter and Saturn.I did say that the study also provided some cheer. Some have claimed we have not found ET yet because intelligent life (including us) always annihilates itself before it can successfully develop the technology for interstellar travel or communication. But maybe the silence is simply because no such alien civilisations exist. So, as the authors put it, pessimism about our own\u0026nbspfuture is therefore unfounded. We may be alone, but we may just survive.• Jim Al-Khalili is professor of physics and professor of the public engagement in science at the University of Surrey"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47b752c5055b59ee48f3e252810d8ed14022e106/124_89_905_543/master/905.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52c61467fb284a6e54b856a781e1a94b","title":"do people change google autcomplete","story":"Every day millions of people ask Google life’s most difficult questions. Our writers answer some of the commonest queriesGive a person the right resources and, within an hour or so, they could dramatically change their physical appearance. They might dye their hair or shave it all off. Change the colour of their eyes. Wear a prosthetic nose. Fake teeth. Seven-inch heels. The list of potential superficial transformations is endless.But if we go beneath the skin into our psychic architecture, is it possible to change the joists, supporting walls and foundations or who we are? What we believe, value and aspire to in life? How we behave, patterns we form? How and why our hearts break?We know that psychological trauma can have profound, lasting effects, not just on our state of mind, but even the way our cells behave. We also know that the brain is plastic and changes throughout our lives. There is a body of evidence that tells us regular mindfulness meditation exercises can lead to measurable changes in brain areas and networks associated with positive effects such as decreased anxiety. When we experience distress and ask for help, we know that interventions such as psychological therapy and medication can, in time, bring about a significant shift in how we’re able to cope with the gullies and obstacles of life. When a wave of depression breaks, we can reconnect with who we know ourselves to be. No mental state is concrete. The mind is always in flight. There would be no such thing as psychological therapy in the first place were there not centuries of study founded on the belief that because our brains are so clever, we human beings have the fundamental ability to analyse our thoughts, feelings and behaviours in order to evolve. Adapt. Learn what has caused us pain and fear and, hopefully, suffer less and live life more fully. There is a lot to be read these days about cutting “toxic” people, who will never change, out of your life to bring you a sense of peace. If we apply this way of thinking to abuse within relationships, a clean break can, in some cases, be a matter of life and death. Whether or not a person continues to be an abuser hopefully becomes a criminal justice matter. Within the system, you hope that rehabilitation is possible and further trauma is prevented. In this sense, you pray that people can change.We know that the electrical, chemical brain is not extricable from the subjective mind. Grey and white matter are constantly processing information and making decisions about emotional responses. This is where the concept of personality comes in. Our inidual differences in patterns of feeling, thinking and behaving are significant because personality is often what we talk about when we think someone has changed. Despite being encased in bone, these Daedalian structures we carry around inside our heads are quite fragile. To injure the brain, whether that injury is traumatic or acquired, can leave someone with significant changes in their emotional reactions. This may be perceived by those around the injured person as a personality change – something I’ve thought about a lot recently since I began working at Headway, the brain injury association. At Headway I’ve spoken to members who, alongside any impact on mobility or sensory processing, talk about feeling like a different person to who they were before their injury – an observation largely drawn from what others have said about their personality. To me, these conversations show just how much general perceptions of human behaviour depend on comparisons. But so does most of life. As Iris Murdoch said in her essay The Sovereignty of Good: “The development of consciousness in human beings is inseparably connected with the use of metaphor.”If the essence of a person is their personality, can it really be understood in terms of befores and afters? Can it, in some cases, even become disordered? If so, who gets to decide that it has? This very question is at the heart of the controversy and activism surrounding the DSM-5 diagnosis of “borderline personality disorder” – thought by many psychologists to be a diagnosis of invalidation and oppression, particularly towards women who, invariably, are trauma survivors. Although this “diagnosis” may feel like a helpful prism for understanding someone’s behaviour – I have heard people say this – if they have hurt us in some way, when that diagnosis is founded on very little evidence we must not take its “criteria” at face value. More generally, whether or not our personalities can change is a quandary that goes to the very heart of human nature. Do they change throughout our lives or are they set in stone? As with most things psychological, there’s no neat answer. It’s still very much an active research question. Personality is no foolproof predictor of behaviour, but it does give us some general ideas about how a person is likely to think or act. A major meta-study published this year provided further evidence that personality can change with treatment. The research showed that four of the “big five” personality traits showed statistically significant change through life. This is in contradiction to William James’ famous assertion that, after 30, personality is set like plaster. However, participants’ reported personality “change” after treatment may be explained by returning to how they functioned before the problem they sought help with in the first place began to feel unmanageable. Studies like this also raise questions about how – and why – we seek to measure who people are in the first place.I have the suspicion that, if I am typing this question into a search engine, I am most likely seeking some kind of clarity or explanation for behaviour that has caused me pain. Of course, there are no definitive answers to be found. Certain theories or platitudes – “A leopard never changes its spots”  “Once a cheat, always a cheat” – might stick for a while, but if we decide that someone is fixed in their ways are we not doing so because, on some level, creating an immovable barrier between their behaviour and our pain is a kind of protection against more pain? If we decide that our own behaviour is unchangeable, is it not because saying “this is just who I am” is easier than opening ourselves to questioning? To taking responsibility?Everyone has the ability to behave selfishly, callously and without care. We mess up and cause unbelievable pain to one another. But while it can be oddly soothing sometimes to decide someone is bad, the more we subscribe to the notion that a person can literally be or become a contagion, the more we move away from the wildly complex reality of human relationships and human character. We all bring our own tapestry of experience to the table and, sometimes, relationships don’t work out. The fabric stops fitting and there is rarely a precise reason for it. If we are seeking some kind of change in how we exist in relation to other people in this world the real question, annoyingly, is how much examination of ourselves we are prepared to do. • Eleanor Morgan is author of Anxiety for Beginners: A Personal Investigation, and is currently training to be a psychologist"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42f4f2ddc35f55447bc81b1f01a421cd9eb22348/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7b239e89f39acc723ce3b6ce2c92efc","title":"dark mofo hobart what happens when you spend 12 days at a festival","story":"Immersing yourself in the craziness of Australia’s Dark Mofo festival changes your body and brain and leaves you hungry by  Brigid Delaney in HobartImmersing yourself in the craziness of Australia’s Dark Mofo festival changes your body and brain and leaves you hungry by  Brigid Delaney in HobartWhat happens when you spend 12 days at a festival?

It’s navigating all the people pushing past you who are off their heads, all the 15-year-olds and all the 50-year-olds who are wild-eyed, wrecked, munted, lurching around looking for somewhere to charge their phone.Big, sprawling festivals – like Glastonbury and Burning Man ... and we can add Hobart’s Dark Mofo to the list – appear chaotic and things are left to chance. But they are carefully designed and curated to bend our minds.So it was for the last two weeks in Tasmania’s capital. Take for example last Friday, when one friend is trying to explain a performance he saw last weekend that really grossed him out (“There was a woman on stage and she had a tin of dog food and she was putting the dog food in her vagina then taking it out and throwing it at the audience, then putting it back in her vagina and spraying it in the front row”). In another context he might have been explaining a particularly pervy dream, or a porno but we knew it was real. Or almost real. Or real to him.The next day, I run into one of the party’s organisers and ask about the act. “She wasn’t spraying the dog food out of her vagina,” she clarified. “She sprayed it out her arse.”Dark Mofo’s afterparties are called Night Mass and are the hottest ticket of the festival. They are where the really crazy stuff happens. One year my friend Marcus got kidnapped, blindfolded, driven around Hobart in the back of a van and taken to an abandoned gym where he was photographed tied to a chair. He showed me the picture on his phone. He looked unsettlingly vulnerable tied up under the strobe lights.Another year, a fake hens night picked up random revellers off the street and took them out to a suburban field where the Glenorchy women’s football team performed some sort of weird dance on the oval and were then tackled by the fake hens who had taken off their clothes in homage to sporting arena streakers.That is what you hear about the early years. But it’s different this year. Popular. This year there was a lot of queuing in the rain, and hearing the next day about some unmissable DJ that was playing in the Bang Bang Bar and your friends would have taken you “but your phone was dead dude”.The parties are where the real Fomo happens.Flying in from Melbourne to Hobart and the first thing I felt was the weather: 7C but the app tells me it feels like 1C or 0C. Locked out of my Airbnb (the owners had hidden the key too well), stashing my luggage in bushes and creeping around someone’s suburban garden in the 5pm pitch darkness felt like a chaotic arrival and therefore a portent for the 12 days ahead.The first act was Tanya Tagaq at the Odeon, doing an Inuit throat singing thing in a performance where the song was unbroken and lasted for one hour and 15 minutes. It was entirely improvised and there was a choir behind her who made orgasmic, primitive and vaguely warlike sounds that reminded me of the boys in Lord of the Flies. Except this choir was much older and, I later found out, wasn’t even a choir. After that I went to see 73-year-old Mike Parr being buried under the road. A group of us watched from the old Mercury building, drinking red wine out of plastic cups, as the road was cut and a slab of bitumen lifted and Parr took a ladder down (the top of his head disappearing like a letter being dropped into a postbox) and was then sealed in. For all the good times of the festival, this was the cloud that drifted across the bright moon. You’d be having fun – at the winter feast, drinking a hot toddy – and you’d suddenly remember: Mike Parr is still buried under the road.The next night at the official opening drinks three or four people had repeated the same horrific rumour – one that you couldn’t help visualising in your mind. Mike Parr was going to kill himself in the box under the road. It was all part of his performance “his final performance” they intoned with emphasis on the word final.“He wouldn’t,” we said, aghast. And he didn’t. But there was the spectre. In this jaded age, looking for a genuine shock, this was performance art brought to its extreme conclusion.The drinks where I heard the Parr rumours were at Dark Park, a place I never saw during the day, but in the seemingly constant dark had the vibe of a satanic hunting lodge. There, amid low, long couches and bearskin rugs and drums of fire, you had to be about two inches away from anyone before you could recognise their faces.Outside, fires in the shape of a large cross burned. Week one turns into week two. Midweek, there weren’t the big parties but there were gigs and art to see. Tim Minchin played to a packed house on Monday and his songs about Los Angeles were melancholy and seemed to be from a sunny, sad place – very far away from here. On Wednesday Laura Jean, ice blond like Laura Palmer, played at the Avalon, a beautiful theatre from the 1930s, long closed but resurrected for the festival. It was both so new and so old that it wasn’t on Google maps and Uber drivers did confused laps in the rain. From the Airbnb, I moved to a hotel in town where no one ever went to breakfast, and at the bar at night women in business attire were neatly sick in the pot plants. In the morning, eastern European heavy metal bands who hadn’t been to bed yet would sit in the lobby in black leather trousers drinking the last quarter of their tequila, complaining about jet lag.I became nocturnal and started skipping breakfast too. Week two and I was beginning to feel I’d crossed a border into an entirely different country. In this country it is dark all the time, and everywhere there are crosses and the city smells like fire. Every night you go out and before each band the same playlist is on a loop – Echo and the Bunnymen, Jesus \u0026amp Mary Chain, Johnny Cash, Depeche Mode, Toto’s Africa and the lush orchestral arrangements of the Cure’s Disintegration album.On the shortest day of the year, we go to Mona, and in the late afternoon at the darkened tennis courts a woman in a fluffy white costume (like the bunny in Donnie Darko) beckons a small group of us down a path, past an empty rowboat along the water’s edge. We come to a small courtyard and look up. A heavy metal band plays down into our void – and on the other side the blade of light, Spectra – the giant 15km beam. This could be a dream, I think. When I do go to sleep my dreams are horrible, full of violence, blood and death. I wake up with a ringing in the ears and the stamps up my arm. BRUTAL.Later I run into the festival director, Leigh Carmichael, and tell him about the dreams. The uneven surfaces, the lack of street light, the red crosses, the loud music and the lasers and lights at the gigs, the sonic bass, the darkness, all overload the mind, he says. The festival has an effect on the subconscious which feeds into dreams.In the botanical gardens I go to an abandoned house that is very cold – colder than it is outside (It goes dark It goes darker still) – where I strap on some VR glasses and watch a Laurie Anderson-designed world, that is a black mirror to the already Dark city, and in the game I feel both trapped and free, as I fly between dark skyscrapers and the rain hits me on the face.The second weekend rolls around and those of us who have been there for a long time have sunken eyes, dirty clothes that stink of fire and have started sleeping during the day and forgetting about homes, jobs, families and friends back on the mainland. We had been here forever and would never leave. We were entombed here with Mike Parr. Our compadre – the heavy metal bands, Melbourne music reviewers and even the sunny PR people who had flown down from Sydney – were beginning to look waxy and vampiric. We had all gotten used to this perpetual night and dark clothes and the reflection on the black water of the red crosses and the reverberations of the bass that travelled up your spine, and the queues and the rain and the hot whisky and the strange bruises and constant uneasy feeling of low-level illness.By night 11, when just before midnight I entered the Odeon and hundreds of people were wearing sinister-looking bags on their heads and the balloons released from the ceiling were not the soft kind but hurt when they hit you in the face and when through the crowd walked a dozen identical drag queens whose sequinned images was also shown on a large screen on stage, creating a nightmarish double vision and the people that slammed into me when dancing had dead eyes and cold bodies and when someone I was with murmured, maybe with irony “this is Australia’s Burning Man”, I knew I had been too long at the fair. It was time to go home.

What will remain of us when AI takes over will be our creativity, and it is our creative spirit, our visionary sense of freshness, which has been Britain’s strength for centuries.”He said the arts were particularly important at what he described as the start of a new age, “the beginning of an explosion of digital visual creativity”.Schama added: “At the moment huge grey tidal flows of money from Russia, China and the Middle East are flowing in to what will soon be the archaic world of dealers and art advisers. Very soon it will not be that.”Zafirakou hopes to sign up an army of artists and arts organisations who will work with schools for fixed periods, whether a day or a full academic year.She said subjects such as art, music and drama were being squeezed out of the curriculum at a time when they had never been more important. “They’re not only essential for personal growth and self-understanding but they also teach young people to think creatively, learn to communicate effectively and build resilience. All these skills will be important for the jobs that they are likely to do when they leave school.”Lord Bragg said: “The curious thing, and it has baffled me for years, is that the only people in the country who don’t get it are the politicians. I go the theatre quite a bit and I never see a politician … I wonder if they read books.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6cb76b5c5b694e244c7700b5cd885f800206058b/0_119_5200_3121/master/5200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b008ccd646e0e82ece45b162cc20abe8","title":"life outside lectures how to make your university club great","story":"How do you get people to sign up and show up? Here’s your guide to being president of a student societySo you’ve been elected president of your student society – congratulations. But what next?The first thing you need is backup. You don’t want to take all the work on yourself, so meet with your committee and keep this going throughout the year. No need to sacrifice your degree delegate the work to your team.That said, it’s best to avoid becoming a mini dictator. Unless you want a mutiny on your hands, it’s a good idea to listen to your committee’s views. Set up a group chat where members can pipe up and discuss society matters.Just like a successful country needs citizens, a society won’t last long without members. Free pizza and the promise of a hangover at regular intervals throughout the year are a tried-and-tested way to get people to sign up and show up. Gemma Paine, former president of the pole fitness society at the University of Sussex, invested a lot of money into making socials memorable – from air hockey to a Halloween pub crawl. She also suggests creating branded kit or clothing. Seeing your members wearing the society’s hoodie or T-shirt around the campus is not only good publicity, it can create a sense of unity and belonging.However, a large membership alone is not enough to ensure your society’s long-term survival. “It’s great to have people signed up and have them pay the membership fee, because that’s where you get your money from,” Paine says. “But at the end of the day if, by April, you only have 10 members turning up to things, then you’re not running the society the right way.”Retention can be one of the biggest challenges of running a society. Unlike sports such as rugby or football, which students are already familiar with, the more niche clubs like pole fitness struggle to be taken seriously. The sport is difficult to learn at first, so once the initial novelty wears off, a lot of new members give up.You need to do a hard sell of whatever member benefits your society does offer. Tell them exactly what they’re getting for their money. As well as offering a low annual membership fee that includes the cost of the classes, Paine made sure there was a clear structure to the sessions. She says before she became president, members learned a party trick or two but nothing more substantial. Now the instructor teaches the skills and moves needed to perfect a whole pole routine, with members working towards a clearer goal.If you want members to stick around, make them feel like they are part of something more than just a fun distraction. That’s why Tanita Lewis’s street dance society at Leeds University has a competitive edge when it enters and wins tournaments. “People want some form of recognition, something external to confirm that it has been worth the hard work. It’s definitely a case of getting a reward for everyone,” she says. “The whole experience of rehearsals and the competition bonds people. That’s what keeps them going.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9a86ddf2b76c7913394523f7c0b4db3569c225f/158_382_1321_792/master/1321.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bfbd8c6647c5cde81830ced1c71277d9","title":"rising seas florida climate change elizabeth rush","story":"Sea level rises are not some distant threat for many Americans they are very real. In an extract from her chilling new book, Rising, Elizabeth Rush details how the US coastline will be radically transformed in the coming yearsIn 1890, just over six thousand people lived in the damp lowlands of south Florida. Since then the wetlands that covered half the state have been largely drained, strip malls have replaced Seminole camps, and the population has increased a thousandfold. Over roughly the same amount of time the number of black college degree holders in the United States also increased a thousandfold, as did the speed at which we fly, the combined carbon emissions of the Middle East, and the entire population of Thailand.A teenager, wrists lined in aquamarine beaded bracelets, rubs sleep from her eyes. Returns her head to its resting position in her palm. The man seated behind me roots around in his briefcase for a breakfast bar. No one raises a hand.“In the ocean,” Hal continues. “That heat is expanding the ocean, which is contributing to sea level rise, and it is also, more importantly, creating the setting for something we really don’t want to have happen: rapid melt of ice.”A woman wearing a sequined teal top opens her Five Star notebook and starts writing things down. The guy behind her shovels spoonfuls of passionfruit–flavored Chobani yogurt into his tiny mouth. Hal’s three sons are perched in the next row back. One has a ponytail, one is in a suit, and the third crosses and uncrosses his gray street sneakers. The one with the ponytail brought a water bottle the other two sip Starbucks. And behind the rows and rows of sparsely occupied seats, at the very back of the amphitheater, an older woman with a gold brocade bear on her top paces back and forth.A real estate developer interrupts Hal to ask: “Is someone recording this?”“Yes.” The cameraman coughs. “Besides,” Hal adds, “I say the same damn thing at least five times a week.” Hal, who is in his early seventies and has been studying sea level rise for over 40 years, pulls at his Burt Reynolds moustache, readjusts his taupe corduroy suit, and continues. On the screen above his head clips from a documentary on climate change show glacial tongues of ice the size of Manhattan tumbling into the sea. “The big story in Greenland and Antarctica is that the warming ocean is working its way in, deep under the ice sheets, causing the ice to collapse faster than anyone predicted, which in turn will cause sea levels to rise faster than anyone predicted.”According to Marco Rubio, the junior senator from Florida, rising sea levels are uncertain, their connection to human activity tenuous. And yet the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change expects roughly two feet of rise by century’s end. The United Nations predicts three feet. And the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates an upper limit of six and a half feet.Take the 6 million people who live in south Florida today and ide them into two groups: those who live less than six and a half feet above the current high tide line, and everybody else. The numbers slice nearly evenly. Heads or tails: call it in the air. If you live here, all you can do is hope that when you put down roots your choice was somehow prophetic.But Hal says it doesn’t matter whether you live six feet above sea level or sixty-five, because he, like James Hansen, believes that all of these predictions are, to put it mildly, very, very low. “The rate of sea level rise is currently doubling every seven years, and if it were to continue in this manner, Ponzi scheme style, we would have 205 feet of sea level rise by 2095,” he says. “And while I don’t think we are going to get that much water by the end of the century, I do think we have to take seriously the possibility that we could have something like 15 feet by then.”It’s a little after nine o’clock. Hal’s sons stop sipping their lattes and the oceanographic scientist behind me puts down his handful of M\u0026ampM’s. If Hal Wanless is right, every single object I have seen over the past 72 hours – the periodic table of elements hanging above his left shoulder, the buffet currently loaded with refreshments, the smoothie stand at my seaside hotel, the beach umbrellas and oxygen bars, the Johnny Rockets and seashell shop, the lecture hall with its hundreds of mostly empty teal swivel chairs – will all be underwater in the not-so-distant future.One of the few stories I remember from the Bible vividly depicts the natural and social world in crisis. It is the apocalyptic narrative par excellence – Noah’s flood. When I look it up again, however, I am surprised to find that it does not start with a rainstorm or an ark, but earlier, with unprecedented population growth and God’s scorn. It begins: “When human beings began to increase in number on the earth.” I read this line and think about the 6,000 inhabitants of south Florida turning into 6 million in 120 short years. “The LORD saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become.” I think about the exponential increase in M\u0026ampM’s, Chobani yogurt cups and grande lattes consumed over that same  of time. The dizzying supply chains, cheap labor and indestructible plastic. “So God said to Noah, ‘I am going to put an end to all people, for the earth is filled with violence because of them.’” And then the rain began.I do not believe in a vengeful God – if God exists at all – so I do not think of the flood as punishment for human sin. What interests me most is what happens to the story when I remove it from its religious framework: Noah’s flood is one of the most fully developed accounts of environmental change in ancient history. It tries to make sense of a cataclysmic earthbound event that happened long ago, before written language, before the domestication of horses, before the first Egyptian mummies and the rise of civilization in Crete. An event for which the teller clearly held humans responsible.Dig into geologic history and you discover this: when sea levels have risen in the past, they have usually not done so gradually, but rather in rapid surges, jumping as much as 50 feet over a short three centuries. Scientists call these events “meltwater pulses” because the near-biblical rise in the height of the ocean is directly correlated to the melting of ice and the process of deglaciation, the very events featured in the documentary footage Hal has got running on a screen above his head.He shows us a clip of the largest glacial calving event ever recorded. It starts with a chunk of ice the size of Miami’s tallest building tumbling, head over tail, off the tip of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Then the Southeast Financial Center goes, displaying its cool blue underbelly. It is a coltish thing, smooth and oddly muscular. The ground between the two turns to arctic ice dust and the ocean roils up. Next, chunks of ice the size of the Marquis Residences crash away then the Wells Fargo Center falls, and with it goes 900 Biscayne Bay. Suddenly everything between the Brickell neighborhood and Park West is gone.The clip begins again and I watch in awe as a section of the Jakobshavn Glacier half the size of all Miami falls into the sea.“Greenland is currently calving chunks of ice so massive they produce earthquakes up to six and seven on the Richter scale,” Hal says as the city of ice breaks apart. “There was not much noticeable ice melt before the nineties. But now it accelerates every year, exceeding all predictions. It will likely cause a pulse of meltwater into the oceans.”In medicine, a pulse is something regular – a predictable throb of blood through veins, produced by a beating heart. It is so reliable, so steady, so definite that lack of a pulse is sometimes considered synonymous with death. A healthy adult will have a resting heart rate of 60 to 100 beats per minute, every day, until they don’t. But a meltwater pulse is the opposite. It is an anomaly. The exception to the 15,000-year rule.From 1900 to 2000 the glacier on the screen retreated inward eight miles. From 2001 to 2010 it pulled back nine more over a single decade the Jakobshavn glacier lost more ice than it had during the previous century. And then there is this film clip, recorded over 70 minutes, in which the glacier retreats a full mile across a calving face three miles wide. “This is why I believe we are witnessing the beginning of the largest meltwater pulse in modern human history,” Hal says.As the ice sheets above Hal’s head fall away and the snacks on the buffet disappear, topography is transformed from a backwater physical science into the single most important factor determining the longevity of the Sunshine State. The man seated next to me leans over. “If what he says is even half true,” he whispers, “Florida is about to be wiped off the map.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0efd1d83066d67c6851253a24404b317d4678a84/0_277_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05857694272e27a88ba6028c69631609","title":"are englands trees disappearing","story":"The first national ‘tree champion’ is charged with reversing the fortunes of the country’s woodlands and beleaguered urban treesEngland is running out of oak. The last of the trees planted by the Victorians are now being harvested, and in the intervening century so few have been grown – and fewer still grown in the right conditions for making timber – that imports, mostly from the US and Europe, are the only answer.“We are now using the oaks our ancestors planted, and there has been no oak coming up to replace it,” says Mike Tustin, chartered forester at John Clegg and Co, the woodland arm of estate agents Strutt and Parker. “There is no oak left in England. There just is no more.” Earlier this month, the government appointed the first “tree champion”, who will spearhead its plans to grow 11 million new trees, and conserve existing forests and urban trees. Sir William Worsley, currently chairman of the National Forest Company, has been given the task of overseeing trees in England and Wales, including England’s iconic national tree, and ensuring that trees are not felled unnecessarily. Worsley is a former chief of the Country Land and Business Association, which represents landowners and rural businesses.Trees were once fundamental to the British economy, from the days of Magna Carta, a large section of which concerned forestry rights, to the “Hearts of Oak” centuries of the empire-building Royal Navy, up to more recent times when millions of homes were needed, and the Forestry Commission was set up immediately after the first world war to grow the material to make them, while providing jobs for returning soldiers.Planting 11 million new trees, as well as 1 million in urban areas, may appear a tough target, but Tustin notes this would require just 4,400 hectares, compared with the 800 hectares currently planted annually. “It’s a drop in the ocean,” says Tustin.Timber prices have risen sharply in recent months, from about £45 a tonne last year to £65 to £70 a tonne at present. Forested land is a good investment, as owners need not pay inheritance tax or capital gains tax on commercial forests, and government grants are available to cover much of the average £3,500 per hectare cost of planting trees.However, forest owners planting native broad-leaf species for their amenity value, rather than for commercial timber, lose many of the tax benefits.Despite the government incentives, the rates of new forests being planted remain stubbornly low in England, where the high prices of land for farming and for housing development discourage tree-planting, as even the most popular commercial species such as Sitka spruce can take 30 to 50 years to reach maturity for harvesting.One of the first tasks Sir William Worsley will face is establishing the extent of the UK’s forests. John Tucker, director of outreach at the Woodland Trust, says there is little reliable information on how much land is covered by trees in the UK, and there are few protections even for ancient trees, on public or private land. “We are simply not collecting the data, we don’t know where we are,” he says. Without knowing the baseline of how many trees there are now, measuring progress will be impossible.Jeremy Barrell, director at Barrell Tree Consultancy, and a member of the Institute of Chartered Foresters, said: “There is strong anecdotal evidence and improving research evidence to confirm that urban canopy cover is declining around the world, and that is certainly my experience in Britain. Successive UK governments have failed to recognise the threat and act to reverse the adverse impact on ordinary people.”He said the appointment of a national tree champion was “the best chance there has ever been to formally recognise and introduce the importance of urban trees into mainstream built-environment management”.Worsley will also have to address the issues at Network Rail, which has been felling trees for the past decade as part of track management plans that will continue, in an £800m plan that will encompass all leaf-bearing trees on 20,000 miles of track. Jo Johnson, the rail minister, called a pause to the plans after the ’s revelations of tree-felling activities, but there is still no certainty over the long-term plans.Local authorities also face dilemmas, following protests in Sheffield over the felling of more than 6,000 trees there. Council members argued that the felling was needed as the trees posed a hazard to vehicles and pedestrians, but many local people objected. Cash-strapped councils must balance the amenity value of trees with the cost of maintaining them, and the potential insurance risks if they are found to contribute to accidents.

The wind had moderated slightly but the flag on St Mary’s church still stood out strongly from the pole on the tower. Beyond it, the severe northern flanks of Cadair Idris slid in and out of focus as clouds swept across the mountain, their speed reinforcing my doubts about taking a high-level route alone. Today, I decided, was one for the lowlands – a decision that, coincidentally, allowed time for a cooked breakfast.I followed the river westward, the sound of wind in the oak trees merging with that of water moving past the rounded cobbles of the streambed. As in the other rivers I had crossed that morning, the water level was low, after a period without serious rainfall. The flow was sluggish, the water dark, and swirls of foam moved idly with the current. Tall, mature grasses – heads robust with seed – pressed in from the edges of the path, and foxglove spikes, their open flowers haunted by bees, swung heavily in the breeze. The deep scent of the honeysuckle, tendrils tangled around the low oak foliage, lay in heady swathes across the trail as the heat of the sun began to warm the air. In the tumbledown pasture, wet and stalked by little egrets, flag iris blooms added stabs of bright yellow, while arcs of dog rose carved sharp trajectories up from the overgrown hedges.The tide was high when I reached the narrow wooden toll bridge at Penmaenpool. As the wind-driven water moved impatiently against the stone bluffs to the west of the bridge I was struck by the similarity of this corner of Wales to the landscape of the southern Lake District. These craggy remnants left after the glaciation of the valley, their close-cropped pasture topped by tight groups of trees, sit hard against the water just like those at the northern end of Windermere. As muddled memories of Cumbria and Cambria flooded in, I enjoyed a satisfying moment of dappled sunshine and warm breeze before heading on towards the coast."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1581a86fbefcae9adb1586fe87c075bb7a73bb8f/0_213_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8837aa28f186b24489d791744a868dc","title":"red deer isle rum scotland in pictures","story":"A team of six scientists has descended on Rum, a small island in the Inner Hebrides on the west coast of Scotland, to catch red deer calves.

The loss in 2017 recorded by Global Forest Watch was 29.4m hectares, the second highest recorded since the monitoring began in 2001.Global tree cover losses have doubled since 2003, while deforestation in crucial tropical rainforest has doubled since 2008. A falling trend in Brazil has been reversed amid political instability and forest destruction has soared in Colombia.Forest losses are a huge contributor to the carbon emissions driving global warming, about the same as total emissions from the US, which is the world’s second biggest polluter. Deforestation destroys wildlife habitat and is a key reason for populations of wildlife having plunged by half in the last 40 years, starting a sixth mass extinction.“The main reason tropical forests are disappearing is not a mystery – vast areas continue to be cleared for soy, beef, palm oil, timber, and other globally traded commodities,” said Frances Seymour at the World Resources Institute, which produces Global Forest Watch with its partners. “Much of this clearing is illegal and linked to corruption.”The new data is based on 30m resolution satellite data and records all forest loss, including that from forest fires. Human destruction causes virtually all deforestation in the tropics, a vast haven of both carbon and wildlife. Fires are dominant at higher latitudes, causing roughly two-thirds of losses in Russia and Canada, and may be becoming more common due to climate change.Brazil, with its vast Amazon territory, is vital in fighting deforestation and for a decade from 2005 a government crackdown lead to falling deforestation. But tree felling is now rising fast again, as political strife distracts the authorities. “What we are seeing today is the backlash,” said Carlos Nobre at the University of São Paulo, Brazil.More than a quarter of Brazil’s tree losses in 2017 were due to fires deliberately set to clear land. “Global warming makes much hotter temperatures, making forests more vulnerable to human-set fires and natural-caused fires,” said Nobre.Indonesia has seen severe deforestation but this fell sharply in 2017, as a damp year cut fire losses and government protection of peat forests took effect. “One year’s data does not make a trend, that is true,” said Putera Parthama, director general for climate change at Indonesia’s Ministry of Environment and Forestry. “But we believe we are starting one.”The destruction of trees does not just harm the environment, said Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, UN special rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples: “Along with this violence against the Earth, there is growing violence against the people who defend these forests.” She said half of the 197 environmental defenders killed in 2017 were from indigenous groups.“Indigenous people have long stewarded the world’s forests that are crucial to the fight against climate change,” said Tauli-Corpuz. “The new data finds the rate of tree cover loss is less than half in community and indigenous lands compared to elsewhere.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ace7c1005fa86ee58caa88204c18ea20ffc7bab/0_103_4484_2691/master/4484.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d52145df223887d12f6778fbf67df55","title":"england fans exploit loophole travel without tickets","story":"• Some ticketless fans thought to have arrived in Russian exclave• FSF obtained a number of Fan IDs with same reference numberHundreds of England fans could expose a loophole in the Russian security service’s ticketing system to travel to Russia for the World Cup as excitement grows behind Gareth Southgate’s team.England supporters have begun to trickle over the border from Poland and Lithuania into the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad for the final group game against Belgium on Thursday. Security was tight at both land-entry points but it has emerged that some fans could exploit weaknesses in the visa protocol to enter Russia without tickets.The Football Supporters’ Federation was able to obtain a number of so‑called Fan IDs, which allow visa‑free travel into Russia to those who have a ticket for matches. Stringent checks are supposed to be limited to one Fan ID per ticket. But the organisation managed to obtained a number of them using the same ticket reference number, raising the prospect of hundreds of England fans travelling to Russia without a ticket and hoping to obtain one on the black market. understands a number have travelled to Kaliningrad without tickets as a sense of anticipation has grown in the wake of impressive victories against Tunisia and Panama. The Football Association, through the England Supporters Club, has sold its allocation of 1,600 tickets for the Kaliningrad Arena. The newly built stadium holds 35,000 and it is expected that very few tickets will be available through other channels.It is thought the official supporters’ group has had only a slight increase of interest in tickets for the last-16 match. England will play in Moscow or Rostov-on-Don in southern Russia depending on their result against Belgium, which will dictate whether they win or finish second in Group G.There are a number booked to arrive on chartered coaches from the Polish city of Gdansk to the west and Kaunas in Lithuania to the east on match day.

Gareth Southgate is considering his team selection for the game in Kaliningrad on Thursday, when the section will be claimed, and is expected to make a handful of changes to freshen up his side’s approach.Yet Kane is confident he will be granted the chance to add to his tally from the start, with the forward potentially to be withdrawn in the second half to offer one of his understudies game-time.“His scoring record of goals per game is outstanding,” said Southgate, who has yet to confirm the selection to his players but is well aware of Kane’s desire to finish as the top scorer in Russia. “He has shown his value to us already both before the tournament and now during the tournament.Asked specifically if Kane would start against Belgium, Southgate added on Talksport: “As a manager you have to think of the whole squad and then your second thought is for iniduals and their own situations, and that is a really complex balance in any business where you are managing people. But I am sure we can get that right.”Danny Rose and Gary Cahill are expected to begin the game in Kaliningrad while checks will be made on the fitness of Dele Alli, who missed the Panama game with a thigh strain, Harry Maguire and Kieran Trippier. Fabian Delph will be involved, with the Manchester City midfielder then planning to fly home for 48 hours to attend the birth of his third child – his wife’s due date is on Saturday – before returning to Russia before the team’s knockout game early next week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16d57605b4c047750a422c92cd97560889376bba/0_41_4496_2697/master/4496.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9064bf607b14e802cc16b03db020b191","title":"england unknown unknowns world cup trajectory","story":"I don’t know what is happening, but … I think I like it? I certainly like the fact that most England fans’ joy cheerfully acknowledges that it’ll probably go tits-up any minuteNobody knows anything, runs William Goldman’s famous line about Hollywood. Part of its appeal is the sheer range of trades to which it could be applied. Many people get up and go to work every day in places they regard as almost comically clueless and dysfunctional – and some of them may not even be journalists.Nobody knows anything. One of Alex Ferguson’s best lines is so memorable because it acknowledges the decisive part of chaos in one of his most artfully strategised campaigns. “Football, bloody hell …”Nobody knows anything about England’s trajectory this World Cup. Or do they? Depending on which chaos turns up, Gareth Southgate could turn out to be England’s Great Knower of Things – perhaps the last such inidual in a nation hurtling towards highly systemised cluelessness in all other departments, especially government.Or he might not. As Donald Rumsfeld once said, in a peroration for which he was unfairly maligned (even though he did turn separately out to have been unforgivably, homicidally clueless): “There are known knowns there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns – the ones we don’t know we don’t know.” (ITV not having Rumsfeld on their pundit panel is arguably the biggest miss of the tournament thus far.)All of us are currently required to have pub conversations or internet discussions or write articles in which we mask our general cluelessness about what is going on with England. Some will be fortunate and have their takes retroactively lent credence by events which could quite as easily have gone the other way others will simply deny they ever said them takes. Generally, the media’s relationship to any England side is much as Sybil Fawlty characterised Basil’s relationship to the hotel guests: “You never get it right, do you? You’re either crawling all over them, licking their boots, or spitting poison at them like some benzedrine puff adder.”So yes, I do hope you didn’t make the hilarious mistake of thinking I have the first clue about where England are headed in the wake of their 6-1 win over Panama. I don’t know what is happening, but … I think I like it? Ask me again on Friday.I certainly like the fact that most people’s joy cheerfully acknowledges that it’ll likely go tits-up and spill over into mindless recrimination any minute. Things may be totally precarious – but by God, at least they’re jolly. England’s current tournament status is a lot like Westley’s recollection of working for the Dread Pirate Roberts in The Princess Bride (William Goldman again). Every night he’d be told: “Good night Westley. Good work. Sleep well. I’ll most likely kill you in the morning.” A nation’s hopes are in much the same position. And as Westley points out: “It was a fine time for me.”Well quite. I could even develop survivor guilt if this carries on much longer. Looking at the Argies’ dysfunction – nervesmutiny rumoursemotional rollercoaster group games – is like getting on board a long-haul flight and seeing someone whose baby is having meltdown, when you’ve been though that precise experience yourself in the past. You give them a sympathetic look that says “I’ve been there” – but mainly you feel a vast, exhilarating relief that it’s not you.And, metaphorically speaking, England supporters have taken a lot of screaming babies on flights over the past few tournaments. It was only two years ago on Wednesday that England went out of the European Championships to Iceland – an event that was itself just four days after Britain went out of the EU to Nigel Farage.That fateful night in Nice was just the latest in a long line of performances confirming the suspicion that to don the England shirt was to pull on a psychic pall. Players who performed brilliantly for their clubs were rendered hopeless by the garment. It seemed mad that we spent billions on aircraft carriers and whatnot, when the MoD should really just have done a procurement deal with Nike. In the event of World War III, the tactic would have simply been to drop payloads of England shirts on enemy troops and watch them go to pieces.Yet now, this. Surely Gareth Southgate should be given an honorary doctorate in psychology from one of the better Viennese schools? Back in June 2016, you’d have looked at England, then looked at Brexit, and regarded the former as the slightly larger and more complex problem to solve. But what a turnaround – and don’t forget there was a whole Allardyce interregnum in there too.Indeed, why have I yet to read an article this week suggesting how much better the Brexit process would have been handled if Gareth Southgate had been in charge of it? Come to think of it, why have I yet to write one? Whatever the reason for the oversight, I have absolute faith that it will surface somewhere in the delirious commentary landscape over the coming days. Should we beat Belgium, suggestions Southgate should at least consult to the Brexit process will become only semi-ironic should we eventually make it past the quarters, the calls for Southgate to be seconded as Dexeu secretary will become formalised and deafening.In the land of clueless, someone who can get you to the quarters is king. Or to put it another way: Knowing something! Knowing something! Our kingdom for a man who knows something!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5955fbcd0d6552b08d3fdc8ee58ea28f59ee9b5/220_8_2417_1450/master/2417.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea7ba9ce379eb026abefa463bb97e179","title":"manchester united hope marouane fellaini sign new contract","story":"Manchester United are hopeful a breakthrough has been achieved in negotiations with Marouane Fellaini and that the midfielder will make a U-turn and sign a new contract.The 30-year-old’s deal expires at the end of this month and he is understood to have told several of his Belgium teammates at the World Cup that he will agree fresh terms.Fellaini had been expected to leave United after refusing to sign the new terms offered to him last September.

That meant they were going into Group G with Belgium it also meant that, sitting watching the draw at home, Thomas Vermaelen had an awkward question for his English wife, Polly Parsons. “I asked her straightaway who she was supporting,” he says. And? “And, of course, she gave a good answer,” he adds, smiling and moving on quickly.On Thursday they meet in Kaliningrad. “It’s a nice game for us and I think England is very interesting,” Vermaelen says. “I know in England you’re usually all very negative about your national team but I think now with the qualities you have – young, talented players – it’s not going to be easy for us. You have a very good side.”If England are outsiders, Vermaelen attributes a similar status to his own country, yet there is something in the way he says it that suggests greater ambitions. “Maybe we’re a team people should look at as one of the outsiders,” he says. “We’re going there to win it, otherwise there is no point.“We’re going for the quarter-finals. But there are a lot of big teams there. It’s the World Cup and once you pass the group stage you’re definitely getting a very difficult game.”Curiously enough, it may be even more difficult for the team who win Group G than the runners-up. There’s luck there, too.“You look back at the Euro and we were unlucky,” Vermaelen adds. “The buildup to the Wales game was good, but then Jan Vertonghen broke down in the last training session, which was a big blow, and then in the game itself for the first 15 minutes we were hammering them: we could have won that three-or-four-nil but the game just slipped out of our hands and we lost it. So luck is always an element.”Luck alone may not explain it, though. Belgium look different under Roberto Martínez – “a strong tactical coach,” in Vermaelen’s words – from how they did as relationships broke down with Marc Wilmots in France two years ago. And if England have talent, this may be the finest generation Belgium have ever had, underlined by eight goals in the opening two games. They are ranked No 3 in the world and over the last two years Belgians have been runners-up in the votes for the Premier League PFA player of the year award: Kevin De Bruyne this past season, Eden Hazard the year before. They will be vital, Vermaelen believes.At club level Vermaelen plays with Lionel Messi with his country he plays with Hazard. It may be a leap but there are similarities between them.“I think there are some, yes,” he says. “Of course it’s difficult to compare anyone to Messi for the way he has done it over so many years, year in, year out. But they are both quite small with that low centre of gravity so they can turn and twist very quickly. They have that element of surprise in their game you don’t know which way they are going to turn and they can move so quickly. The form he is in, Eden is world class. Messi’s been up there for 10 years but Eden can get right up there.”As for De Bruyne, Vermaelen says he is not surprised at how well the Manchester City player performed last season. “The thing is when I first saw him in the national team I was already impressed with his qualities,” he says. “And he develops because he is playing for a massive club, showing it every week: big games, small games, it doesn’t matter. It’s not just his qualities, it’s his development.“He’s a clever player, very technical his passing is unbelievable and his shot as well. But don’t underestimate his physical qualities: he can run and he is strong in the battles too.“You can’t forget that the English league is so tough that you have to be physically prepared. Players like De Bruyne have that: there’s the technical ability but they’re physically strong enough to cope. De Bruyne is maybe the best player and he can definitely help us.”All of which leaves one question. What did Polly say when the draw was made? Vermaelen laughs. “That she was supporting me, of course.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/994ca5138e1dc19fcda015254a05d6af15142bcf/0_0_4788_2873/master/4788.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cfa87e23d3409e8bd1b8285b336de545","title":"world cup 2018 reaction argentina win nigeria germany brazil mexico buildup live","story":"Marina Hyde is liking this new England team who aren’t embarrassing the nation...Kári has avoided too many relationship issues despite Scandinavian rivalry...He notes: “I’m Icelandic and my girlfriend is Finnish.

If Serbia get it right on the night then it will be an intriguing watch.Amy Lawrence has looked at the Mexico team and their dreams of going through...Some potential fun to be had in the World Cup today, as it is not completely unimaginable that Mexico, Germany and Sweden could all end up with six points after their final group games later.Sweden have the ability to defeat Mexico who might be a touch tired after their early exertions in the tournament, so far, while Germany should see off South Korea. Then we get into the fun and games of head-to-head, goals for and against and who has the biggest car.I, for one, hope it all comes down to this.For every victor there must be a loser and Nigeria were the unfortunate victims last night in Russia. Their centre-back, and friend of the show, Will Troost-Ekong expressed his emotions via Twitter early this morning.Beating Tunisia and Panama has proven that football is certainly coming home, so Paul MacInnes has written about the original song.It was very generous of Richard to say I have a plan. Instead what I do have is a bottle of water and plenty of anecdotes about my parents being inexplicably in St Petersburg last night despite neither caring about football in any way, shape or form.Alas, that’s it from me, Richard Parkin. Thanks again for your correspondence - it feels an increasingly learned football family we have here on the  liveblog there’s something very comforting about that.Will Unwin is our man with the plan to usher in today’s big four clashes, and as discussed, aren’t there some tasty morsels in store once more. So sneak out from work to load up on snacks or book the conference room with the projector screen at the far end of the office. Essentially, channel your inner Mascherano, and do whatever it takes to get through.And speaking of those of you from England awaking as we speak, here’s a cheeky good news story.Being a trouble-averse so-and-so I’m not really sure of the risk v reward trade off on that front, so as always - if pain persists, please consult your travel specialist. I don’t know that “the  told me too” will stand up as an excuse at the border, by the way. Especially after we hammered Poland yesterday on the blog.Good news also in that captain Harry Kane appears raring and champing at the bit for the Group G showdown with Belgium. But remember. Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. (#ichichfch)I am a little intrigued by the situation in Group F it’s almost assumed as a fait accompli that Germany are in the box seat to progress compared with Sweden given their marginal advantage, courtesy head-to-head record.But South Korea have proved a tough, disciplined side to break down in the past, and with the lottery that appears to be VAR (I’ve attempted dear reader to go one day without banging on about it, I promise!) the false comfort of a one-goal margin can swiftly disappear, as we’ve already seen ample example.Will Mexico look to rest or rotate, thus handing Sweden perhaps the marginally easier opponent or is it just assumed that without their captain South Korea will be meat-and-drink for the champions?Of course, if the East Asians can upset Germany by what is it, one or more, and the Swedes fall to Mexico, then neither European nations will find themselves in the reckoning!The permutations are leaving me frazzled I’ll let you fresher-brained northern hemisphere folk work those out for me!Mexico have undoubtedly been one of the surprise packages of Russia 2018 - not perhaps to those that know them - but indeed their shock 1-0 win over Germany did set the scene for some of the high drama we’ve seen in recent days.With six points already, you’d expect to find the Concacaf winners home and dry, but such are the machinations of Group F, they’re mathematically at least not yet there.Their clash against Sweden could yet produce some very interesting ramifications for the tournament and if that’s the fixture today that you’re most intrigued by, perhaps our old friends World Cup Football Daily might be the best place for you, featuring Swedish football expert Olof Lundh:Speaking of the exotically-haired one, a fun fact emerging out of Argentina’s game yesterday was the scoring of goal number 100, across the tournament.Pretty decent pedigree in this department across recent tourneys.A subject of less speculation will be Brazil’s line-up for their crunch match against Serbia, with coach Tité already intimating he’ll rely on an unchanged lineup.The 1993 Campeonato Gaúcho (Segunda Divisão) winner and now Brazil coach has been at pains to take the attention off his stuttering star Neymar, seemingly in contrast to the player himself who’s taken considerable efforts to ensure it’s always on him.Good thing Philippe Coutinho appears up for it at least, then.So how should Germany approach this one?Commenter Sooda Bondai has his preferred XI:Some plucky omissions there, although I for one haven’t been overly amazed by what I’ve seen from Thomas Müller this tournament especially for a player who’s finished in the top two goalscorers at the last two World Cups.Will we see widespread restings some rotations or perhaps just one or two changes to try some combinations?As discussed (see earlier) with a possible Germany-Brazil round of 16 encounter lurking, the score 7-1 necessarily rears its head.For Cesc_12 however it may not be the usual suspects on the end of it, next time:These defenders should stop acting like midfielders and start defending. I have a feeling Germany will be picked apart (Brazil 7-1 style ) once they face a big team.Indeed with Kimmich employed as perhaps the world’s first right backNo10 and Jerome Boateng already pushing the self-destruct button for Germany, it’s not been the most emphatic of defensive showings thus far from the four-time champions. Even the normally-unflappable Hummels was crucially at fault for Mexico’s winner.One more consideration for the be-T-shirted “Trainer” to ponder. And for South Korea’s Shin Tae-yong to perhaps exploit.That well-oiled machine that is Die Mannschaft has of course picked up a fair handful of grit in its engine thus far in Russia if a shock loss against Mexico wasn’t a sufficient warning that not all cylinders are firing, then needing 94 minutes to break to resolve of the sturdy Swedes certainly was.For those that like your more cerebral match dissections, Jonathan Wilson offers a fascinating insight into the dilemmas facing Germany’s coach Joachim Löw:But my pick of the analysis this week goes to that scamp David “all cylinders, all the time” Squires who managed to thread two of my personal favourite things into one terrific cartoon, aimless trips to Scandinavian furniture emporiums and slow-moving Nordic noir to explain Germany’s last outing (and some other games):But! That was then, and now is now now! And so to four more enthralling encounters today as we find out who will emerge from Groups E \u0026amp F.Walter Hesse has chimed in in what might become known as “the cabbage derby”:Indeed, it does appear a tough ask for South Korea, who are staring at their 8th group stage exit in ten World Cup appearances not aided by injury to their captain Ki Sung-yeung. What also to say about Iceland, and their remarkable fans, who gave us football’s endearing antidote to the Mexican Wave, the Viking Clap. I dare you to watch this video from Iceland’s return from Euro 2016 and not positively wee your pantaloons just a tiny bit. And as if powered by Thor and striving for Valhalla, didn’t they give it absolutely everything against Croatia:It was a full-hearted effort, and we salute you, departing Iceland.Especially in contrast to that other overnight all-European affair, “the Moscow midweek kickaround”, “the Luzhniki lie-down”.France and Denmark’s gentleman’s agreement produced Russia 2018’s first 0-0, and what a tepid, insipid affair it was.Statistics can be overstated, but the following gives you a pretty cast iron idea that there wasn’t too much intent to chase a win in this one:Both coaches may have taken the opportunity to rest players, having through their combined actions effectively secured progression.Unlucky for fans who shelled out hard dollars to watch that one, a rare blip on an otherwise all-action tournament thus far.Australian fans, better than most, can appreciate what this result meant to Peru and its much-loved armada of travelling supporters.Having waited 32 years between their first appearance in 1974 and their first win in 2006, only the most one-eyed of Socceroos supporters would begrudge their Peruvians counterparts. Last at a World Cup in 1982, many have waited a lifetime to see their beloved La Blanquirroja in action, and after a 40 year wait, they’ve once again won a World Cup game.Indeed, they were one of the more popular travelling groups at Russia 2018, as many have attested, with their colour, noise and general joyfulness:That is, of course, all except for this guy:For pragmatic Dutch coach Bert van Marwijk, the campaign was a disappointment, but by no means a disaster.“Not a success but also not a failure,” was his verdict. “I think everyone saw that we got a lot of compliments for the way we play, only you don’t win games with compliments.” And then of course, there was Tim Cahill.What more can you say about the guy? Australia’s all-time leader goalscorer, who came on for a record-equaling fourth World Cup appearance (joining Matildas greats Cheryl Salisbury and Melissa Barbieri), and came a blocked shot within joining an incredibly elite group of players to have scored at four World Cups. To underline just how special that achievement is, in the last 48 hours we’ve seen players like Luis Suárez and Lionel Messi join him in scoring at three.His absence will be keenly felt in coming years for a team that in fairness has struggled not just at this tournament, but in truth for years, to find routes to goal from open play that aren’t The Golden Forehead.Kieran Pender had more from Van Marwijk in Sochi:“Against France, in football we were at least equal against Denmark, in football we were even better. Today I have the same feeling. But in all three of the games we couldn’t really make the difference in goals.” It was the end of the Russia 2018 journey for two more nations last night, the plucky Iceland on their first ever World Cup adventure, and Australia’s Socceroos, and given perhaps there’s a few more of them awake right now, let’s start with Australia.Nick Ames took in the action from Sochi:And amid the twitter hysteria (NATIONAL INQUEST NOW), John Davidson offered a more sombre assessment of where perhaps the 43rd ranked nation are at, especially faced with three sides at tournament’s draw considered in the world’s top 12.And like the tremendously courageous Iran before them, you can’t help but feel shattered for Nigeria who under Bordeaux legend Gernot Rohr had galvanised into a formidable team unit, and outside of the desire perhaps to see Messi continue at this tournament, might have been the sentimental favourite of many a neutral.No two sides have met more at World Cups then Nigeria and Argentina. If life’s guarantees are death, taxes and Germany making the semis, then for West African fans going out to Argentina must feel equally a fait accompli. Five times they met at the World Cup, five times they’ve lost to Argentina. Perhaps none as heartbreaking as this one.If you somehow missed any of that match, here’s Sid Lowe’s report from St Petersburg:And let’s not forget that before Rojo’s remarkable redemption strike, the Argentine centre half could have broken the hearts of his nation with an incongruous handball, off his own head, that in keeping with VARs scattershot approach to ball-to-hand incidents in the box this World Cup could have very, very possibly been given.That was very much the opinion of Nigeria’s crestfallen captain, Jon Obi Mikel. “I don’t understand how that was not a penalty: it was a clear handball,” he said post-game. “It was worse than the one that Portugal were given yesterday.” Messi for his part, admitted to the tremendous strain he and his fellow Argentines were under as he so eloquently put: “I don’t remember having ever suffered so much.” Sid Lowe again with the post-match wash up: And one fan lived ever ball in the manner perhaps in which he’s lived his entire incredible life. Kicking every ball, feeling every feeling - riding the complete rollercoaster: the one, the only, Diego Maradona.At times he wasn’t his best, it has to be said, and there was genuine concern at full-time for one of the true maestros of the game.Here’s wishing the legend from Lánus a full recuperation.So. Where to even start with Group D!We’ve not wanted for excitement in Russia 2018, but these two final games were something else. At one stage this topsy-turvy pool almost boasted the following:Iceland lose to Nigeria Nigeria lose to Argentina Argentina lose to Croatia Croatia loses to Iceland. Football, eh?And if I’ve got these back-of-envelope calculations correct, it went a little like this:And that doesn’t even factor in Iceland fighting away in the background, being from 0-53 min and 76-90 min just a goal away from sending either of the above sides out.No wonder La Albiceleste and Super Eagles fans were going through the ringer!Cometh the 86th, cometh the man. No, not that man. Or even that other man. Or that man who was involved in the alleged palace coup on Sampaoli. Or that new man who started in goal. Or that man who plays for Juventus. Of all Argentina’s storied stars it was perhaps the most unlikely of heroes who emerged to resolve one of the most unpredictable of plotlines escape from Group D.If Scandinavia gave us A-ha, South America gave us Ro-jo. And after being unceremoniously dropped after #Icelandgate, it was the unfancied central defender, on his weaker foot, who rescued perhaps the proudest nation of all from World Cup ignominy.And so having seen one of the stuttering “big favourites” sneak through, today we turn to two more great under-performers will there be a scare or two in store for Germany or Brazil? And then equally as important perhaps how will Groups E \u0026amp F resolve - and even if the heavyweights get through, will it be only to set up a mouth-watering round of 16 rematch of the Mineiraço of four years ago?Seven of the eight teams remain in contention (no matter how slender South Korea’s chances are) so we should be set for four more compelling clashes, in a tournament that’s thus far delivered in spades. Here’s how it will unfold today.As always do enrich the lives of your fellow readers by chiming in, via email (richard.parkin.casual@the) or twitter (@rrjparkin), or simply below the line.

Unlike in the US, the seizures – concentrated in west, central and north Africa – have largely consisted of the drug tramadol, followed by codeine.  The report said that while fentanyl and its analogues remain a problem in North America, tramadol – used to treat moderate and moderate-to-severe pain – has become a growing concern in parts of Africa and Asia.  The report added that the global seizure of pharmaceutical opioids in 2016 was 87 tonnes, roughly the same as the quantities of heroin impounded that year.  The figures on pharmaceutical opioids were rivalled by global cocaine manufacture, which the agency said had reached the highest level ever reported in 2016, with an estimated 1,410 tonnes produced. Most of the world’s cocaine comes from Colombia, but the report also showed Africa and Asia emerging as cocaine trafficking and consumption hubs. “The findings of this year’s world drug report show that drug markets are expanding, with cocaine and opium production hitting absolute record highs, presenting multiple challenges on multiple fronts,” said the UNODC’s executive director, Yury Fedotov. “Non-medical use of prescription drugs has reached epidemic proportions in parts of the world,” he added. “The opioid crisis in North America is rightly getting attention, and the international community has taken action.  “However ... the problems go far beyond the headlines. We need to raise the alarm about addiction to tramadol, rates of which are soaring in parts of Africa. Non-medical use of this opioid painkiller, which is not under international control, is also expanding in Asia. The impact on vulnerable populations is cause for serious concern, putting pressure on already strained healthcare systems.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d25dec1d59d151323a34ad7b7c5d4484f8a29b1f/0_75_8992_5396/master/8992.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4697df677d4d950a51a51ff698cba5b0","title":"baked salmon roast chicken giorgio locatelli tom kerridge 20 best easy summer recipes","story":"Pork burgers for the barbecue and roast chicken with basil for a sunny Sunday lunch – the best recipes to take you through the summerAt the restaurant in the summer we often tuck a basil leaf or two under the skin of the chicken breasts, just before roasting. The skin perfectly protects the delicate leaves, and allows the green shape to be visible when served.Serves 6organic or free range chicken 1 x 2.5kg basil 1 bunch onion 1 medium, peeled and roughly choppedcarrot 1, peeled and roughly choppedcelery 2 sticks, washed and roughly choppedsmall leek 1, cut lengthwise, washed and roughly choppedfennel bulb 1 small, washed and roughly choppedbay leaves a few thyme a few sprigs butter 50g olive oil 2 tbsp garlic 2 cloves, crushed to a creamsalt and pepperlight chicken stock 500ml white wine 150mlTrim the excess fat and skin from the neck end of the chicken and remove the parson’s nose. Pick the leaves from the basil and roughly chop the stalks. Keep a few small basil sprigs or leaves for garnish.Using your fingers (nails cut short and no bejewelled fingers ideally!), gently lift the neck end skin away from the breast meat as far as possible towards the leg end and over the thighs. Place as many large basil leaves as you can in one layer over the meat, then press the skin back down firmly into the original shape.Preheat the oven to 180Cgas mark 4.Place the vegetables, bay leaves, thyme and basil stalks in a heavy oven dish or roasting pan and then the chicken, breast side up. In a small pan heat the butter and olive oil with the garlic and pour this evenly all over the chicken. Season with salt and pepper.Roast for 20 minutes or until the skin has started to colour. Turn the oven down to 170Cgas mark 3 and continue to cook for 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and with tongs carefully turn the chicken over. Pour the stock into the roasting pan and return to the oven for a further 40-50 minutes or until the juices of the thigh run clear when pierced with a skewer. Remove the chicken to a bowl and cover either with a lid or clingfilm.Meanwhile, skim the excess fat from the roasting dish and scrape the vegetables and juices into a small pan. Bring to the boil with the white wine, remaining basil leaves and any juices which may have drained from the chicken. Simmer for a few minutes, skimming if necessary, then strain, taste and adjust the seasoning. Serve the chicken whole, garnished with the basil sprigs, with the sauce on the side and a dish of steamed leaf broccoli, spring cabbage or wilted spinach.Alternatively, place the chicken on a chopping board, remove the legs and cut in two at the drumstickthigh joint. Trim away the drumstick end to neaten. Remove the wing tips, then the 2 breasts whole from the breast bone. Cut these in half at a slight angle then remove the wishbone from the carcass in one piece. Place the jointed chicken on a warm serving platter and spoon the sauce over, scatter the basil garnish over and serve as above.The carcass, trimmings (not the raw fatskin) and vegetable debris will make a delicious stock or broth. Simply place all into a heavy-based pan, cover with cold water, add sprigs of herbs and simmer for up to an hour, skimming when necessary. Strain, chill as quickly as possible and store in a fridge for up to three days. Remove the thin layer of fat which will have set on the surface before using.From 30 Ingredients by Sally Clarke (Frances Lincoln, £25)Cooking salmon on a bed of paper-thin potato slices is both efficient and delicious: as the fish cooks it infuses the potatoes with flavour. Make sure to buy the fish in one big piece, like a roast with the skin on pre-portioned pieces of fish will be done before the potatoes are tender. All you need to make this a meal is a green vegetable. Wild-caught salmon is always preferred to farmed fish, but in a simple preparation like this it really makes a difference.Serves 4baby potatoes 570g garlic 4 clovesextra virgin olive oil 3 tbspfine sea saltskin-on salmon fillet 680g, in 1 piece, preferably wildfresh thyme 4 sprigsPreheat the oven to 190Cgas mark 5. Scrub the potatoes well under cold water, but don’t peel them. Using a mandolin or plastic V-slicer, cut the potatoes into paper-thin rounds. If you have good knife skills, you can slice the potatoes by hand, but using a slicer is a better way to get the thin, consistent slices you want here. Cut the unpeeled garlic in half lengthwise. Put the potato slices and garlic on a large, rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with half of the oil, toss well with your hands, and spread out on the sheet as thinly as possible. Drizzle with the remaining oil and season with the salt.Pat the salmon dry with kitchen towels. Run your fingers over the flesh side to detect the protruding ends of any thin white pin bones. Use your fingers or heavy tweezers to pull out and discard the bones. Season the flesh side with salt. Place the salmon skin-side up on top of the potatoes. Scatter the thyme over the salmon and potatoes. Be sure to put the fish with the skin side up – the skin will help you determine when the fish is ready.Roast the salmon until the skin comes off easily when pulled with kitchen tongs, about 20 minutes. Start checking for doneness after about 15 minutes, but do so at the thicker end of the fish because the thinner tail end will be done first.If the skin does not come off easily, just keep checking every few minutes until it does.To serve, remove and discard the skin and cut the salmon into serving portions. Season with salt and serve with the potatoes.From Downtime by Nadine Levi Redzepi (Ebury Press, £27)This is a really fresh salad with some nice acidity and sharpness from the apple.

Add the vinegars and leave for a minute to allow the salt to dissolve. Whisk in the olive oil, with 2 tablespoons of water, until the liquids emulsify. Now you can pour the vinaigrette into a clean squeezy bottle and keep it in the fridge for up to a month. It will separate, so just give it a good shake before you use it.With kitchen scissors, cut each quail in half. Put into a large dish or container and scatter with the garlic and chilli, add the rosemary and drizzle with half the olive oil. Leave in the fridge to marinate for 12 hours, or overnight.When ready to cook, lift the quail from the marinade and pat them dry with kitchen paper. Preheat the oven to 180Cgas mark 4.Heat a griddle pan or sauté pan that will transfer to the oven and cook the halves of quail, skin side down, until the skin is crispy. Transfer the pan to the oven for 3-4 minutes, until the quail meat is cooked through. To check, insert a sharp knife into the thighs and the juices should run clear.In a large bowl mix the lamb’s lettuce, frisee and apple and toss with Giorgio’s dressing, then transfer to a serving dish, place the quail on top, and finish with the rest of the olive oil and the balsamic vinegar.From Made at Home by Giorgio Locatelli (Fourth Estate, £26)Serves 4For the burger mixminced pork belly 800ggarlic 3 cloves, gratedcracked black pepper ½ tspflat-leaf parsley 2 tbsp, choppedsage 1 tsp, choppeddry breadcrumbs 40gEnglish mustard 1 tbspshallots 3, finely dicedsalt 1 tspFor the sauce gribichehard-boiled eggs 2, coarsely grateddijon mustard 2 tbspred wine vinegar 1 tbspcornichons 1 tbsp, roughly choppedsuperfine capers 1 tbspparsley 1 tbsp, choppedchervil 1 tbsp, choppedgood extra virgin olive oil 150mlFor the burnt onionsvegetable oil 1 tbspbutter 25gonions 4, finely slicedsalt ½ tspTo servebrioche buns 4, toastedgem lettuce 1, broken down into leaves and washedTo make the pork burgers, combine the pork mince, garlic, cracked black pepper, both herbs, breadcrumbs, mustard, diced shallots and salt, then work the meat mix for a minute or so until it forms a large ball.Divide into 4, roll each into a burger shape and chill in the fridge for 2 hours or so, to firm up and let the flavour work into the meat.For the gribiche dressing, place all the ingredients in a mixing bowl and give a good stir, then pop it in the fridge until needed.For the burnt onions, warm the vegetable oil in a large shallow frying pan until hot, then add the butter and heat till foaming. Next, add the onions and salt, stirring from time to time until they start to colour. Fry the onions till they are dark and glossy, adding a little more butter if required. When the onions look like they are beginning to char remove them from the heat and leave to cool.When your barbecue is ready, lay on the burgers and cook for 4 minutes each side. Remove from the heat and rest for 3 minutes.Lay each burger on the bottom half of a bun and add a large spoonful of the burnt onions, then a generous spoonful of the dressing and the gem leaves. Top off with the bun top and serve.Tom Kerridge is the chef-owner of the Hand and Flowers, MarlowThis is one of the most marvellous of all Sichuanese culinary ideas. I don’t actually use a recipe for it, any more than I would use a recipe to mix up a vinaigrette, so it’s different every time I make it. The following version is lip-smackingly wonderful, but do please think of it as a template and improvise as you will. You might want to add more chilli oil in winter, or more refreshing vinegar when the weather is hot and sultry, while a spritz of crushed garlic can be quite enlivening. You can also serve the dressed chicken on a bed of sliced cucumber, or toss some salad leaves, perhaps rocket or watercress, into the mix.In China, they normally poach a whole chicken, then chop it up bones and all, but you can equally well use boneless meat. And don’t forget that this is also a marvellous way of using up leftover roast chicken or turkey.Serves 2-3 with other Chinese dishes, or with salad and bread for a Western style mealcold, cooked chicken 300-350g without bones (see note opposite)spring onions 3 salt ¼ tsp sesame seeds 1 tbsp (optional)For the saucelight soy sauce 2 tbsp Chinkiang vinegar 1½ tsp caster sugar 1½ tsp chicken stock 1 tbsp chilli oil 3-4 tbsp with ½ tbsp of its sediment (or more, if you wish)ground, roasted Sichuan pepper 14-12 tsp, to tastesesame oil 1 tspCut or tear the chicken as evenly as possible into bite-sized strips or slivers and place them in a deep bowl. Cut the spring onions at a steep angle into thin slices. Mix them and the salt with the chicken. If using sesame seeds, toast them gently in a dry wok or frying pan for a few minutes, until they are fragrant and turning golden, then tip out into a small dish.Combine the sauce ingredients in a bowl. When you are ready to eat, pour the sauce over the chicken, and mix with chopsticks or salad servers. Arrange on a serving dish and sprinkle with sesame seeds, if desired.To poach a chicken: You may use any cold, cooked chicken for the recipe, but poached chicken is particularly silken and succulent. The classic Chinese method is to place a whole bird in a measured amount of boiling stock, return it to a boil, then leave it to cool in the liquid. If the measuring is accurate, the chicken will be just cooked by the time the stock is cool, but still a little pink around the bones. This produces chicken flesh that is moist but still a little taut, exactly the way Chinese gourmets like it. It’s a little dicey for home cooks, because of the health risks if the chicken is not sufficiently heated, so in general I recommend using the following method.Allow the chicken to come to room temperature before you start. Bring to a boil enough water to immerse your bird, without too much room to spare in the pan. Place the chicken in the water, return it quickly to a boil, then skim. Add a piece of ginger, unpeeled and slightly crushed, with a couple of spring onion whites, also crushed. Partially cover the pan with a lid, reduce the heat so the liquid just murmurs gently and poach for about 30 minutes, depending on the size of the chicken. Pierce the thigh joint deeply with a skewer to see if the bird is done: the juices that emerge should run clear, not pink and bloody (you may find it easiest to remove the bird from the pan to do this). When the chicken is just cooked, remove it from the pan and rinse it in cold running water. Set aside to cool.From Every Grain of Rice by Fuchsia Dunlop (Bloomsbury, £25)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79015e616f88c33a9c695a4680eaa72447696085/0_315_6570_3942/master/6570.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b9b5e26026cf1d5d3029f19f3d15545","title":"manchester makes a beeline for new dutch style cycling network","story":"£500m is being spent to fund cycling networks in Greater Manchester A thousand miles of safe cycling and walking routes are to be created in Greater Manchester after an Olympic gold medallist persuaded town hall bosses to spend as much on cyclists and pedestrians as Amsterdam and other cycling nirvanas.The network – named Beelines, in homage to Manchester’s civic symbol of the worker bee – includes 75 miles of Dutch-style segregated lanes and will be the largest joined-up network in the UK.The plans, published on Wednesday, have a combined cost of around £500m and represent a first step in £1.5bn planned investment.Andy Burnham, Greater Manchester’s mayor, has allocated £160m of the government’s Transforming Cities fund to the project’s first four years, bringing the total spend on cycling and walking in Greater Manchester to around £15 per head. This funding is at the levels seen in cycling Meccas such as Copenhagen and Amsterdam and higher than in any other UK city, according to Chris Boardman, the region’s walking and cycling commissioner.Boardman, who won gold at the 1992 Olympics and wore the Yellow Jersey in the Tour de France, is also lobbying the government to allow him to change traffic lights to give cyclists and pedestrians more time and priority to cross busy junctions safely.He said he was “absolutely unapologetic” that his plans would take space away from cars and could make motor journeys slower in what is already a traffic-snarled region.“If you want to make people change their habits you’ve got to give them a viable alternative and in some cases that’s reprioritising streets and that’s what we are doing,” he said in an interview with the .“You’ll feel comfortable if you follow this sign. If it’s on a major road it will be segregated, if it’s on a minor road it won’t be,” he said.Since his appointment last year, Boardman and his team have worked with each of Greater Manchester’s 10 combined authorities on the plans. Each borough has been allowed to choose one key route where segregated lanes will appear over the next six years, with most opting for a busy road into Manchester itself. The proposals, which are subject to formal approval by Greater Manchester combined authority on Friday, also includes plans for 1,400 safe crossings that will facilitate the majority of routes and 25 “filtered neighbourhoods”, where the priority is given to the movement of people and where spaces to sit, play and socialise are created.Burnham, said: “Greater Manchester has a long history of doing innovative things and our approach to Beelines is no different. This proposal is bold and I make no apology for that. If we are to cut congestion and clean up our air, decisive action is needed. I want to make Greater Manchester one of the top 10 places in the world to live and it is action of this sort which will help to deliver that promise.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/667f4097a889df954a14064b479345b1c62bbe40/0_0_1238_743/master/1238.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf03e8839d990d14130ab08d96342ef3","title":"expedia booking compensation hotel","story":"I booked and prepaid through Expedia for two rooms at the Ryad Boustane hotel in Marrakech. The confirmation clearly stated: “No need to call to reconfirm this reservation.” We arrived at the hotel at 9pm to discover that no booking had been received and we would have to find accommodation elsewhere.We called Expedia, which seemed oblivious to the stress for two women in a foreign country late at night with nowhere to stay. We were on the phone for two-and-a-half hours while it offered inferior hotels or a room with a shared bed. The calls kept disconnecting while we were kept on hold, and Expedia never once called back – we had to ring and go through the initial screening process each time.Eventually, around midnight, we were told rooms had been found at a hotel across town and we had to accept. The call disconnected while we were on hold and, after an hour, we called the alternative hotel ourselves. The manager said he had rooms spare but had received no call from Expedia, so we had to fund a taxi to get there and pay the £220 for the rooms ourselves. By then, it was 1am, and I was starting to feel ill with the stress. Next morning I had to spend another three hours on the hotel phone negotiating with Expedia either to find us alternative accommodation, or pay for where we were. Yet again, I was put on hold for up to an hour at a time. It eventually agreed to pay for our stay at the new hotel and offered money towards our meals, but insisted I claim back the first night’s accommodation, phone and taxi expenses once back in the UK.We had lost half a night and a morning of our holiday. Moreover, we’d booked and paid for a traditional Moroccan hotel in the city centre and ended up in a modern hotel with poor food in the countryside, and had to pay £44 for a taxi into town each day. On my return I asked for a refund of the extra £285 I’d had to spend, but all I’ve been offered is a £75 voucher.It’s a disgrace that more than six weeks after receiving your complaint, Expedia had done nothing to atone for your spoiled £800 holiday. Within a day of hearing from the Observer, however, it was galvanised into action. It offered to refund your expenses in what it calls a “goodwill gesture,” and added £100 compensation and £200 in vouchers should you wish to risk your leisure time with it again. In an abrupt statement it says it apologises for the stress but declines to explain how it messed up so appallingly.If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

The report found that high housing costs turned London from the highest income region of Britain to below the national average. Before housing costs, typical incomes were £28,600 in London compared to £26,400 in the rest of the UK, but once housing costs are taken into account incomes in London were £21,350, compared to £22,250 across the UK.The thinktank said the average household in London is now paying a £5,400 “housing failure bill”, reflecting the extent to which rising housing costs had outpaced income growth over the last 50 years. Falling home ownership meant London was now the only region of the UK where the typical household had no net property wealth.Countering the view that the capital has been out-performing the rest of Britain since the financial crisis of a decade ago, the thinktank said London’s weak productivity was holding the country back.Stephen Clarke, senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: “London has always played a key role in the UK economy. But that role has changed over the last decade and is often misunderstood.“People assume London’s economy has been running away from the rest of the UK since the financial crisis. But London’s economic growth is purely down to its population explosion, with hospitality replacing banking as the big growth sector in the capital. Sectors that have traditionally powered London’s productivity growth, from finance to IT, are if anything going backwards. “This shift has been great news for employment. But it means that London, far from racing ahead, has actually been holding the country back on productivity, with troubling consequences for pay and living standards.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26e5d688c17f8261a7bce7e356ea314584aab93a/56_563_4528_2717/master/4528.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6005f3d7ffd65039f0c74ea8c44bd89e","title":"amateur dramatics my week playing for simon rattle","story":"What’s it like to be directed by the great conductor? One amateur violinist found when she joined the Berlin Philharmonic’s BE PHIL orchestra for five inspiring days Simon Rattle is looking straight at me, eyes flaring, fist shaking. I am straining with every fibre of my being to give him what he wants. I would die for this man right now. I’m desperate to shape the phrase just as he’s showing, sustaining the long note and getting louder over the arpeggio. But I over-push the sound, my notes crack, I lose my focus and have to break eye contact to look at the music, ashamed of myself. I’m reminded why I decided not to become a professional musician.Yet for five days in May, with 100 other amateur musicians, I was allowed to dream. We were the guests of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, selected (by video audition) from 1,900 applicants from 30 countries to be part of the BE PHIL Orchestra, conducted in Brahms’s First Symphony by Sir Simon himself. When we meet for the first time in the foyer of the Philharmonie, we are like giddy children who have won Willy Wonka’s golden tickets. Over the first two days, we rehearse with conductor and Berlin Phil violinist Stanley Dodds, one of the brains behind the project. He balances and tunes us, points out important lines, characters and details, makes us listen to each other, and gives us an idea of Rattle’s tempos. On day three we learn that Rattle is in the building – a buzz goes round the coffee room and everyone tries to act normal. And then he’s on the podium welcoming us. “I’m so delighted. Thank you so much … I can’t wait. Let’s just play some Brahms.” And how we play: our focus and energy are through the roof.In our six hours of rehearsal with Rattle, his enthusiasm and commitment never wane. He offers historic context: Brahms only added the introduction after hearing Wagner’s Tristan und Isolde, so although usually his music should never sound like Wagner this is an exception. There are narratives to help bring out the emotional complexities: one bar, Brahms is full of longing for Clara Schumann the next he remembers he’s living in the house of her husband and his mentor. Jokes: Woody Allen’s one about his brain being his second-favourite organ (for when the double basses aren’t following the baton). Analogies: Siegmund Nissel of the Amadeus Quartet’s likening of the string quartet to a bottle of wine applies also to orchestras: the cellos are the bottle, the first violins the label – but the second violins and violas are the wine itself.We also witness flashes of frustration: when people don’t watch him, play too loudly, forget instructions and especially when we don’t go with his tempos. A few times he taunts us on our tuning, but gently, despite how much it must grate to hear such muddy imperfection. It’s a little wounding, however, that in some bars he conducts every beat to help us stay together, as if we are a school orchestra. Interlaced with the frustrations are moments of intense joy. I’m reduced to tears hearing the yearning oboe and violin solos in the second movement, and the alpine theme in the horn and flute, played exquisitely by my new friends, knowing that they too are doing this for love and fulfilment. At the glorious last-movement theme, I am brimming with love for Brahms, my colleagues, for sheer joy of being alive. We prove the cliche that music is an international language. We come from countries and cultures as various as Brazil, Bolivia, Trinidad, Taiwan and Turkey we range in age from 10 to 75. Some of us went to conservatoires, some not among us are students, postmen, teachers, software developers, office managers, doctors, airline pilots and scientists. I sit next to a Japanese research scientist, and even though our conversation is sometimes stilted, it’s easy to play with him. It’s the cultural mores beyond the music that are confusing: whether to shake hands or hug after the concert the toilet queue that forms because none of the non-Germans understands the flush system.Our concert is part of the Philharmonie’s open day. Around the building are concerts by children, students and Berlin Phil players, masterclasses, tours, a horn flashmob, world music, premieres. More than 10,000 people pour into the building 6,000 more watch on the Digital Concert Hall and 200,000 on Facebook.At the end of the dress rehearsal, Rattle exhorts us to have fun, tell our story – and make mistakes. We take him at his word. Our performance is full-throttle, but some things we rehearsed don’t work. Most do. It doesn’t matter, though, because we’re giving it all we have. Rattle is, too. The audience goes wild and he gets three call-backs as we stand on stage dazed and a little heartbroken that it’s all over. Back in London, aglow with the stardust that’s been sprinkled on my musical life, I return to my regular amateur group, Corinthian Chamber Orchestra. Contrary to a popular narrative, most of my orchestral friends are not “posh”. Most got into playing music at school and through the local authority-funded services and youth orchestras that have been devastated in recent years. As the effects of the government’s policy of excluding arts subjects from the Ebacc core subjects are becoming apparent, access to a life with music is increasingly limited to those who can afford it. Rattle himself recently wrote a letter to the Times about the current destruction of music education. “The future may be uncertain and difficult for the next generation, but unless they have access to a vital cultural education they will be utterly unprepared for what this new world might require.”This is not just about children, though. What of the consequences 30 years down the line? What then of amateur music and its benefits to the inidual and to society – the friendships and social networks, good mental and intellectual health, creativity and sheer joy? As we face existential crisis, along with epidemics of dementia and loneliness, amateur music-making is more important than ever.For many professionals, amateurs are the untouchables of the classical music world – unglamorous and unteachable. Rattle and the Berlin Phil’s unique initiative is a visionary act of idealism and generosity that demonstrates their stated commitment to the benefits of music from cradle to grave. If I may pile yet another expectation on the conductor’s arrival in the UK as music director of the London Symphony Orchestra, it is this: I hope he brings this big-hearted, inclusive, life-changing approach with him, and that politicians, cultural institutions and his colleagues take note. Playing Brahms with him in the Philharmonie will always be a privilege – one of the greatest of my life – but having an active and inspiring music life, at any level, should not be."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe0d8d437fa9e9cb93606db649ae7ec7243ea186/244_73_1527_916/master/1527.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90d54f9e7533c05e33164b9f80ba903e","title":"young fathers disinvited and then reinvited by german arts festival","story":"U-turn by Ruhrtriennale festival comes after group were dumped over their support for pro-Palestinian groupA leading German music and arts festival has been thrown into disarray after its organisers disinvited – and then reinvited – the Scottish band Young Fathers over their support for the pro-Palestine Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement.The artistic director of the Ruhrtriennale announced earlier this month that the British hip-hop trio would be dropped from the lineup of the festival, which takes place from 18 August to 30 September. In a statement, Stefanie Carp said although she did not believe that criticising the politics of the Israeli government was antisemitic, the Mercury prize-winning group had “regrettably failed to distance itself from BDS”.But on Thursday, the festival organisers made a 180-degree turn. Not only did they reinvite Young Fathers, but also encouraged them to explain their position on the stage.“As a German, it is of course difficult for me to be linked to a movement that boycotts Israel,” Carp said. “But I have invited the Young Fathers and not the BDS.”A spokesperson for Ruhrtriennale told the  that Young Fathers had informed them that they could not take up the reinvitation.Some artists who had initially withdrawn from the Ruhrtriennale in solidarity with the Scottish group, including Lebanese guitarist Sharif Sehnaoui, said they had accepted their places in the festival programme. Ruhrtriennale organisers said the rest of the events would go ahead as scheduled, with the addition of a panel debate on the reasons behind the fallout.Nonetheless, Carp’s U-turn was criticised in Germany by local Jewish organisations and Isabel Pfeiffer-Poensgen, the culture minister for the state of North-Rhine Westphalia. “It cannot be excluded that this decision will give the BDS campaign a platform at the Ruhrtriennale,” said Pfeiffer-Poensgen. “At times of increasing antisemitic crimes and other incidents, sadly also in North-Rhine Westphalia, this is the wrong signal.”Over the course of the last 10 months, mayors of German cities including Berlin, Munich and Frankfurt have likened BDS’s call for boycotts against Israel to practices from the Nazi era. There have been calls for a ban on the use of public spaces for BDS activities.In a letter to the , 75 artists and cultural figures criticised what they believed were “attempts to impose political conditions on artists supporting Palestinian human rights”, describing the initial decision to drop Young Fathers as “censorship, ‘blacklisting’ and repression”.Signatories of the letter include Patti Smith, who performed at the Ruhrtriennale in 2005, and Massive Attack, who played the festival in 2013.The Young Fathers performance is the latest in a series of concerts recently cancelled in Germany in connection to artists’ support for the BDS movement. In 2017, Young Fathers were one of a number of bands who pulled out of Berlin’s Pop-Kultur festival after it had emerged that the Israeli embassy had donated €500 (£440) to help to cover the travel costs of performers coming from Israel. The Israeli embassy was listed as a partner on event posters.British musician Richard Dawson, as well as UK-based acts Shopping and Gwenno, have withdrawn from the lineup for this year’s Pop-Kultur festival, with the former citing the shooting of Palestinians in Gaza by Israeli border forces as a reason for cancelling his appearance.Last September, English performance poet Kate Tempest cancelled a concert at Berlin’s Volksbühne theatre after what her management said were “personal threats via email and over social media” over her support for the BDS movement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65a74da6bcb324fd412fedf8441915deb47126c0/0_195_2390_1433/master/2390.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc7a436be9c57cd8e8deac51c4e7356f","title":"tory justine greening rules herself out of london mayoral race","story":"Putney MP reveals decision after being tipped for 2020 campaign against Sadiq KhanThe former education secretary Justine Greening has ruled herself out from running as the Conservative candidate for London mayor, leaving the party without a big name in the race to take on Sadiq Khan.The Putney MP had been tipped as the favourite to challenge the incumbent Labour mayor in the next contest, which takes place in 2020.Many Tory insiders believed that Greening, as a socially liberal woman with a newly found independent streak who was the first openly gay woman in the cabinet, was ideally placed to present the modern face of the party.The Tories were badly tainted by Zac Goldsmith’s unsuccessful campaign in 2016, which was criticised for its racist undertones and which many London Conservative politicians feared did the party permanent damage to its reputation in the capital.Greening also gained a wealth of experience in transport – a key responsibility for the mayor – during her stint as transport secretary, as well as a clear passion for social mobility, founded in her working-class, comprehensive-educated background, and crystallised during her time as education secretary.She revealed her decision in a tweet to a grassroots campaign group, JustineForMayor, which also featured a video setting out her plans for improving social mobility. Sources close to the MP confirmed to the  she had ruled herself out of the mayoral race. Greening tweeted: “All your support is hugely appreciated, but as an MP I’m focusing on socialmobilitypledge.org to drive opportunity for people across our whole country so won’t be putting my name forward.”The Conservatives began their process of selecting their candidate this month, giving them a two-year campaign to unseat Khan, who is expected to be the favourite to win in 2020.The timetable for the Tory selection means that nominations close in July, with a summer campaign culminating in a final vote in September. The Conservatives are understood to feel that Goldsmith was not given enough time to establish his campaign, having only been selected in September 2015 before the vote in May 2016. His campaign also suffered from the allegations of using dog-whistle tactics against Khan. Since leaving the cabinet in January, Greening, a vocal remain campaigner, has been outspoken about the need for the Tories to broaden their appeal to younger, socially liberal voters. Her majority was slashed at the last general election, from more than 10,000 to just 1,554.Labour are polling ahead in London, although the Conservatives have been buoyed by better-than-expected local election results, in which Labour failed to take target councils including Barnet and Wandsworth. Other candidates who have been tipped to run for London mayor include the MEP Syed Kamall, who was defeated by Goldsmith to be the Tory candidate in 2016.A senior Tory party source said: “Justine would have made a great mayor, I have no doubt. I get why she wants to focus on Westminster.“We have a number of interesting and impressive people talking to us about running with some great ideas for London. These people, and their plans, will show what a weak mayor Khan has been and how much better the capital would be under a Conservative mayor.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e62f6506dbad4919c144968845f5c8d3ff3b698/0_16_4134_2480/master/4134.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ce78d3415840409ae95fd41a3be7026","title":"unions join business leaders to demand urgency in brexit talks","story":" TUC and CBI release rare joint statement as cabinet tensions flare into the open over issueBritish and European trade unions and business organisations have joined forces to demand that “pace and urgency” be injected into the Brexit talks as complaints about the lack of progress made in negotiations intensified ahead of this week’s EU summit.The TUC and the CBI released a rare joint statement with their continental counterparts calling for “measurable progress”, a day after the car industry called for a Brexit deal that delivers “single market benefits” and cabinet tensions over the issue flared into the open.The workers’ and business organisations said: “We are calling on the UK government and the EU to inject pace and urgency in the negotiations, bringing about measurable progress, in particular a backstop arrangement to avoid a hard border in Ireland. “Decisions will be needed in June and October to finalise the withdrawal agreement and the transitional arrangement, and put economic interests and people’s jobs, rights and livelihoods first.” It added: “The cost of disagreement between the UK and the EU would be dire for firms, workers and the communities where they live.”Earlier on Tuesday, car manufacturers said there would be no “Brexit idend” for the industry, with investment in the sector and thousands of jobs being put at risk unless the government rethinks its red lines in negotiations.Ministers have been forced on the defensive since the end of last week after Airbus and BMW said jobs in the UK were at risk if manufacturers could not easily import components from the EU after Brexit. But the CBI and TUC said their concern spread further, to 23 industrial sectors which want “regulatory alignment” post orce.They range from banking and financial services, through to energy, broadcasting and professional services all of which seek mutual recognition of each other’s regulatory systems post Brexit. Such agreement was of “utmost importance”, said the TUC and CBI in remarks approved by Frances O’Grady, the TUC general secretary, and Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI director general.May tried to allay some of the concerns on Tuesday by saying it is “right that we listen to the voice of business”, in a corporate summit sponsored by the Times, as she also attempted to counter some of anti-business remarks made by other cabinet colleagues over the last few days. “We have listened carefully to the voices of business throughout, and your input has helped to shape our negotiating position,” the prime minister added, two days before she is due to head to Brussels for a European Council meeting which is likely to be dominated by arguments over migration and see little substantive progress on Brexit.The prime minister’s remarks also amounted to a rebuke of Boris Johnson, who effectively admitted in the Commons that he had said, in response to corporate lobbying, “fuck business” at an industry event last week. “I don’t think anybody could doubt the passionate support of this government for business,” the foreign secretary told MPs, before adding: “It may be that I have, from time to time, expressed scepticism about some of the views of those who profess to speak up for business.”The former Brexit minister David Jones criticised Clark’s stance, telling the Daily : “There is a risk he is unwittingly participating in Project Fear mark two, which is being orchestrated by EU-based businesses.”Cabinet members were told by David Davis in the morning that the government would try to provide more details of its plans when its long-awaited Brexit white paper is published on Monday 9 July.That will come after an away day held the Friday before at the prime minister’s Chequers retreat. All cabinet members are expected to attend the event, which will conclude with a working dinner, a move that is expected to help May because the proportion of loyalists is greater amongst the full team.Labour accused the government of botching Brexit “by bickering amongst themselves” rather than “negotiating a sensible deal with the EU”. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, added: “Time is running out. Business, consumers and workers need certainty and workers, not endless chaos, egos and melodrama.”The car lobby told the government on Tuesday that it needed “as a minimum” to remain in the customs union and a deal that delivered “single market benefits”. “There is no Brexit idend for our industry,” Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), said.He said Brexit uncertainty was thwarting investment and repeated calls for the UK to stay in the customs union until the government came up with a “credible plan B”. Negotiators had to get on with the job of agreeing a deal that would put an end to uncertainty and prioritise the needs of the automotive sector, because investment was slowing and time running out, the SMMT said at a day-long summit.  BMW, which employs 8,000 people in the UK, said it needed to know by the end of the summer what the Brexit strategy was as that was when key decisions would be made. Ian Robertson, the most senior British executive at the German firm, said: “We are not turning our backs on the UK.” But he said that any delay in Dover “would start to impact” upon manufacturing and its competitiveness. He added that BMW was not intending to move any car production to any of its other plants around the world but it would be “foolhardy” not to have “contingency ideas”.Hawes told reporters at the International Automotive Summit in London that “signs were more ominous” for investment this year after eight years of growth.“If we cannot cut through the fog of the uncertainty there will be casualties,” he said. “For this year are more ominous, contingency planning, job losses, investment halved to less than £350m so far year, that’s the cost of uncertainty, that that’s the price we pay for slow decision-making,.”A spokeswoman for the Brexit department said it agreed with business leaders. “We are confident that we can make progress if both the EU and UK engage constructively,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/218af353f4a11fa96180384215927670d4c11fe5/0_131_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5783b1a6494185e668521e79c9cdfb0","title":"labour mp calls for takedown law to tackle extremism online","story":"Firms could be required to remove extremist material within 24 hours of a complaintGoogle, Facebook, YouTube and other sites would be required by law to take down extremist material within 24 hours of receiving a complaint under an amendment put forward for inclusion in new counter-terror legislation.The addition to the counter-terrorism bill passing through parliament has been proposed by the Labour MP Stephen Doughty and would echo “takedown” laws that came into effect in Germany last year.The counter-terrorism strategy unveiled by the home secretary, Sajid Javid, this month, said the Home Office would place a “renewed emphasis on engagement” with internet providers and work with the tech industry “to seek more investment in technologies that automatically identify and remove terrorist content before it is accessible to all”.But Doughty, a member of the home affairs select committee, said his amendment was needed because the voluntary approach was failing. He said a wide variety of extremist content remained online despite repeated warnings.“If these companies can remove copyrighted video or music content from companies like Disney within a matter of hours, there is no excuse for them to be failing to do so for extremist material,” he said.“It is clear we now need a robust regulatory system and appropriate sanctions to require proactive investigation by tech companies of what they are hosting and swift takedown of content and accounts which glorify and encourage terrorist organisations and extremist views.”Doughty’s amendment would also require tech companies to proactively check content for extremist material and take it down within six hours of it being identified.The bill is at the committee stage as it passes through parliament, where a detailed line-by-line examination takes place. After the Westminster attack in March 2017, Javid’s predecessor, Amber Rudd, met the likes of Facebook, Twitter, Google and Microsoft to discuss what more could be done to tackle terrorist content online. This led to the companies setting up the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT).In February this year Rudd flew to Silicon Valley in California to meet tech executives and discuss further ways they could improve tackling extremist content online.

Yet the rightwing relegation of it as secondary to national interest rather than part of it and the kneejerk leftwing reaction against anything American-led, is leaving this alliance in danger of fracture“We need leaders both sides of the water explaining its importance and seeking ways of strengthening it.”Blair, who maintains close relations with Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, mainly over the middle east, will not directly accuse the president of populism, but his speech makes little attempt to hide his dislike of this political style.He is due to say: “Globalisation and its advocates are on the back foot. Populism of left and right meet at a certain point in denunciation of free trade arrangements, migration and international alliances. All are portrayed as contrary to putting inidual national interest first.“Once it is clear the populism isn’t working because, ultimately, it offers only expressions of anger and not effective answers, the populists may double down, alleging that failure is the result of half-heartedness and that only more of the same will work. “Who knows where the dynamic of that scenario takes us. Then the comparisons with the 1930s no longer seem far-fetched.”He will also bluntly tell US diplomats not to imagine that either Brexit or a wider break-up of the EU will be in US interests.“America needs Europe united and standing with it, not isolated as inidual nations, able to be picked off one by one by the then emerged new powers”.He will also weigh in on the state of the Brexit talks: “We cannot go on like this. I have never been more worried about the future of our country than now, with competing emotions of anxiety and rage.“We have a government whose every move is a calculation not about the interests of the nation, but the internal balance of advantage between the factions of the Conservative party, with the prime minister more a hostage than a leader. “Meanwhile the leader of the Labour party neglects to lead the fight here at home over an issue which literally determines the future of Britain and where he could play a decisive role.”Blair will call on MPs to assert themselves, adding: “the UK needs to plan now for the possibility we need to extend the March 2019 deadline for the end of the negotiations”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49b87a4a7c08acf50111722f4959a765faf3c0c0/5_327_3590_2154/master/3590.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=274828c86fd738adf9922bfa038ab3f8","title":"adopted children barely surviving in high pressure schools","story":"Adoption UK says pupils are falling behind in their studies and struggling emotionallyAdopted children who have suffered traumatic early experiences are “barely surviving” in the current high-pressure school environment and need greater support if they are to have an equal chance of success, a charity has said.They are falling behind in their studies because they are struggling to cope emotionally with the demands of the current education system which “prizes exam results at the expense of wellbeing”, according to a report from Adoption UK.In a report it identifies what it said were gaps in understanding, empathy and resources in some schools where teachers are increasingly judged on academic performance. As a result adopted children are prevented from having an equal chance to succeed at school.Previous research carried out by the charity suggests adopted children were 20 times more likely to be excluded from school than their classmates and they were more likely to leave education without any qualifications. As part of its Bridging the Gap report, the charity conducted a survey of 4,000 adoptive parents and children to explore adopted pupils’ emotional wellbeing at school. Three quarters of the children who took part said they did not feel their teachers understood how to support them.The report’s author Becky White, a former teacher, said: “The reality is that in the current school environment, many adopted children are barely surviving, let alone thriving. The root of the problem is an education system that prizes exam results at the expense of wellbeing.“Many teachers have told us that they are less able to build proper relationships with their pupils, and their most vulnerable students are dramatically falling behind. It will take leadership from governments and schools to turn this around.”The charity’s new Equal Chance Campaign has called on the government to rethink the way schools educate the most vulnerable children and address a perceived shortfall in support needed in classrooms.Adoptive mother Charlotte, a teacher by profession whose son David was permanently excluded from his school, said she thought all teaching staff needed a better understanding of adopted children and how to help them in the classroom. “The teachers put David in isolation when he did something wrong. They didn’t understand the huge sense of shame and rejection that adopted children feel. Whenever there was a chance for the school to be negative about David they would take it.“He was temporarily excluded on a number of occasions and was then permanently excluded. That has been the ultimate rejection for him. He was sorting his head out about his own rejection but now he’s in a pupil referral unit. His behaviour has gone drastically downhill and there’s been a knock-on for the whole family.”A spokesperson for the Department for Education said the government was determined to support adopted children and their families.“Schools receive £2,300 of pupil premium plus funding for each child adopted from care, and from September schools will be required to appoint a designated teacher for children adopted from care to help them at school,” the DfE spokesperson said.“As well, trainee teachers must show they understand how a range of factors can affect a pupils’ ability to learn such as social and emotional issues – and how best to overcome these – to gain their qualified teacher status.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86176a2986463a45cc67c55dcdb7c1a04a6f2efc/463_299_1932_1159/master/1932.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=524d69fc2b423ac9b590ed841338f171","title":"the 25 best british plays since jerusalem","story":"It is the hit that transformed British theatre. As Jez Butterworth’s epochal drama returns, our critic chooses the 25 best plays since Jerusalem – from exploited boxers to warring kingsFinance shot to the top of the theatrical agenda in the wake of free-market crises and capitalist corruption. What hit one about Lucy Prebble’s play, charting the rise and fall of a Texan energy company that ended with debts of $38bn, was the element of fantasy in the corporate world. “We’re not an energy company – we’re a powerhouse of ideas,” claimed Enron’s hubristic chief exec. Rupert Goold’s astonishing production heightened the Citizen Kane aspect of a play that beautifully blended political satire and multimedia spectacle.Bola Agbaje first attracted attention with the Olivier award-winning Gone Too Far!, which looked at sibling rivalry. This follow-up was an even richer play that showed a young, high-flying black couple caught in a pincer movement between economic recession and loyalty to a council estate mate just out of jail. As played by Ashley Walters, this last character became a charismatic fantasist tempting the couple with mad money-making schemes. Although Agbaje has been accused by some of stereotyping shiftless black males, it would be fairer to praise her for telling uncomfortable truths.Few writers are better than Roy Williams at using sport as a political metaphor. He did it with football in Sing Yer Heart Out for the Lads. This time it was boxing, as we saw two black kids training in a south London gym in the 1980s under the tutelage of its Thatcherite owner. Seemingly liberated by success, they end up as pawns in the hands of white promoters for whom they are meal tickets. Daniel Kaluuya and Anthony Welsh were magnificent as the two fighters and Miriam Buether’s design turned the Royal Court into a boxing ring full of sweat and resin.Howard Brenton, after a long sojourn writing for TV’s Spooks, has turned out a lot of plays in recent years: none better than this one, which offered a radically revised view of its heroine who was seen as Protestant champion rather than sexual predator. Secret meetings with Biblical scholar William Tyndale led her to procure a copy of a book that persuaded the Tudor monarch that a king’s prime allegiance was to God rather than the pope. Staged with Henry VIII at Shakespeare’s Globe, Brenton’s emerged as much the more interesting play.I’ve kept musical theatre out of my list but this verbatim piece, with book by Alecky Blythe and score by Adam Cork, was too outstandingly original to be overlooked. Comprising interviews with the residents of an Ipswich street that had witnessed the murder of five sex workers, it focused less on the horror of the situation than on the healing process. We saw a community reconstituting itself through floral competitions and quiz nights and, under Rufus Norris’s direction, Blythe and Cork brilliantly found a musical pattern in the fragmented rhythms of everyday speech.Freely adapted by Richard Bean from a classic Goldoni play of 1746, this provided the funniest theatrical evening since Frayn’s Noises Off or Ayckbourn’s The Norman Conquests. It was also the making of James Corden who, as a failed skiffle player working simultaneously for a snooty toff and his disguised lover, showed a porpoise-like delicacy and profound geniality that has since served him well on American TV. Much of the evening’s joy was provided by Cal McCrystal’s physical comedy, which required an octogenarian waiter to serve a bowl of soup, fall backwards down a flight of stairs and bounce back like a rubber ball.The 400th anniversary of the King James Bible in 2011 was marked by epic readings, modern updates and this fascinating play by David Edgar reminding us that the Bible is a product of its time and a composite of previous translations. Dramatically, the highlight was an imagined debate between Bishop Lancelot Andrewes and William Tyndale, a radical who wanted the scriptures rendered in a comprehensible vernacular. The moment I remember from this RSC production is when an aged cleric announced that “he who is without love and mercy shall never come to Christ”.James Graham has firmly established himself, in a tradition created by Hare and Edgar, as the liveliest recorder of our recent history. Following plays about the Suez crisis and Thatcher’s childhood, he turned to the perilous survival of the Labour government from 1974-79. This was a brilliant play about the daily process of politics with the government facing either a hung parliament or a wafer-thin majority. Although the play showed the sick and dying wheeled in to vote, it offered a surprising testament to the tenacity of parliamentary democracy.Half the battle in drama is finding the right subject. Lolita Chakrabarti hit on an excellent one in recalling the prejudice faced by the African American actor Ira Aldridge when he played Othello at Covent Garden in 1833. His presence caused dissent in the company, hostility in the press and shock in the audience when he passionately kissed Desdemona. The play also reminded us that Aldridge was a theatrical pioneer, and it was fascinating to see Adrian Lester (who was about to play Othello at the National) magically combining innovative realism with 19th-century gestural acting.There may be a trade war between China and America, but US president Donald Trump has described Chinese leader Xi Jinping as “just great”. That odd love-hate relationship lends extra pertinency to Lucy Kirkwood’s epic play about the parallels and differences between the world’s rival superpowers. In America, she shows a photographer being acclaimed for his tireless pursuit of a supposedly exiled Tiananmen Square demonstrator in Beijing, a man pays a price for protesting about the smog-induced death of a neighbour. Rather than scoring ideological points, Kirkwood wittily and energetically shows why Niall Ferguson coined the word “Chimerica” to describe two nations joined at the hip.No one, except those involved, knows what really happened at the weekly meetings between the Queen and Thatcher in the 1980s, but it doesn’t stop people speculating. What was just one episode in Peter Morgan’s The Audience became the subject of Moira Buffini’s hilarious and oddly plausible play. Her thesis broadly is that, given the Queen’s attachment to the Commonwealth, there must have been dismay at her PM’s unwillingness to impose sanctions on apartheid South Africa and at her reluctance to accept majority rule in Zimbabwe. As in all modern plays about the monarchy – including those by Alan Bennett and Sue Townsend – the Queen came out on top.Barney Norris, then only in his mid-20s, displayed a mature understanding of old age in his debut play. Set in a farmhouse on the edge of Salisbury Plain, it showed an elderly married couple falling into disrepair. Instead of displaying the pity that is often close to contempt, Norris focused on the security of married love and the ailing couple’s delight in a shared past. With beautiful performances by Robin Soans and Linda Bassett, the play won all kinds of awards, evoked memories of the quiet compassion of David Storey and signalled a promise fulfilled by Norris’s next play, Eventide, and his debut novel, Five Rivers Met on a Wooded Plain.Is it likely our future king would, within a month of assuming the throne, create a constitutional crisis by refusing royal assent to a parliamentary bill? Once you accepted the premise of Mike Bartlett’s play, it assumed an unstoppable momentum and acquired a tragic grandeur. That was partly because of Bartlett’s canny use of blank verse and evocation of Macbeth and Richard II. But it was also because of a magnificent performance by Tim Pigott-Smith, who sadly died after the play’s run but not before it had been recorded for TV. He invested Charles with a principled anxiety as he declared: “Without my voice and spirit, I am dust.”“A king has no friends,” says James II in the central play of Rona Munro’s ambitious seven-and-a-half-hour trilogy, which reminded us of the inescapable solitude of monarchy. The great virtue of the trilogy, covering Scotland’s history from 1421 to 1488 under the rule of James I, II and III, was its vigorous, unsentimental portrait of a kingdom beset by fractious, feudal in-fighting: as Sofie Gråbøl’s sceptical Dane, marrying into the royal family, asked: “Who would want the job of ruling Scotland?” Jointly presented by the national theatres of Scotland and Great Britain, the trilogy once again showed a female dramatist defying gender stereotypes by displaying an appetite for the epic.We are no longer surprised to see science on stage. This work by Tom Morton-Smith turned out to be the best play about nuclear physics since Michael Frayn’s Copenhagen. What it caught excellently were the contradictions of the father of the atomic bomb and leader of America’s Manhattan Project. In John Heffernan’s performance, he seemed cold-blooded in his ability to ditch former sexual partners and communist associates yet fervent in his development of the bombs to be dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. All plays about nuclear physics raise moral issues. Morton-Smith’s also created a flawed tragic hero.Sometimes it is hard to separate the play and the performance. Denise Gough rightly won every award going for her portrayal of an actor, fuelled by drink and drugs, who breaks down during a performance of The Seagull and checks into a rehab clinic: it was a brilliant performance in which Gough caught the addict’s mix of vulnerability and obduracy. Credit also belongs to Duncan Macmillan for showing the irony of the heroine’s resistance to the kind of confessional techniques she would have employed as an actor. As well as a fine character study, his play offered a fierce critique of a chaotic society that produces multiple forms of addiction.The Sunday Times critic Harold Hobson looked for rapturous, single moments in a play. I had a Hobsonian experience watching David Hare’s play about the foundation in 1934 of a country opera house at Glyndebourne in Sussex. When Roger Allam as John Christie launched into a speech saying that his dream was to offer audiences a glimpse of the sublime, I was moved by his highly unfashionable endorsement of the power of great art. The play also told us a lot about Christie’s devotion to his wife and Glyndebourne’s dependence on European refugee talent, but it was the ringing defence of opera’s potential for ecstasy that made it memorable.“Posh tosh,” said the critic of the Daily Mail. I’d beg to differ. Like most of Caryl Churchill’s recent work, this one had a packed minimalism. It said a lot in 50 minutes. We listened raptly to the seemingly random chat of four women sitting in a sunlit garden: they dwelt lovingly on old times, broke into a rendering of a 1963 Crystals hit and yet relished the benefits of living today (“whole worlds in your pocket,” said one of mobile phones). Their talk, however, was punctuated by a series of monologues envisioning global catastrophe. The mundane and the apocalyptic sat side by side in a way that was characteristically Churchillian.Every so often a play comes along that leaves you profoundly shaken Edward Bond’s Saved was one, Sarah Kane’s Blasted another. David Ireland’s play was in the same league. It was a study of a Belfast loyalist, rivetingly played by Stephen Rea, who believed that the Protestant cause was being destroyed by “the Fenians” and that his five-year-old granddaughter had the same face as Gerry Adams. While Ireland’s play was about a man uncertain of his own identity, it also vividly demonstrated the madness of sectarian hatred.Ella Hickson’s epic boldly pursued one woman’s trajectory through a  of almost two centuries. Starting as a Cornish farmer’s wife in 1889, she ended up in the same county in 2051 depending for survival on a Chinese visitor’s miracle of renewable energy. Along the way, Hickson tackled empire, the environment and, above all, mother-daughter relationships. She seemed to imply that women’s progress was accompanied by a growing loneliness and sense of estrangement from family. Oil is a play that gnaws at the memory.Lucy Kirkwood is the only writer to get two entries in this selection. Deservedly so, because this three-character play raised a host of big issues. Set on a Norfolk farm following a nuclear catastrophe, it brought together two long-separated female scientists responsible for building the contaminating plant. In the intervening years, one had borne four children, the other none. This allowed Kirkwood to explore topics including whether parenthood increases a sense of social responsibility and how people in the future will react to the poisoned legacy of the present. A humane triumph.“Let’s kill all the lawyers,” says Dick the Butcher in Shakespeare’s Henry VI Part Three. Nina Raine doesn’t go that far but she subjects them to fierce moral scrutiny in this probingly intelligent play. In particular, she asks if rape cases should be subject to point-scoring courtroom narratives and suggests that dealing with violent, dishonest people may have a corrupting effect on lawyers. Raine captures the clubbiness of the law and the sadness of a soured marriage while allowing the audience to make its own judgment.A box office hit even before it opened, Jez Butterworth’s play deserved the accolades heaped upon it. Combining the gangland politics of Mojo with the rural rituals of Jerusalem, this was a story about the power of unspoken love. Down on a farm in County Armagh in 1981, a reformed IRA activist could never quite articulate his feelings for his brother’s wife while two aunts were haunted by the loss of their loved ones. The political and the personal seamlessly intersected, but it was the power of private passions that fuelled this multilayered award winner.Inua Ellams – poet, graphic artist and playwright – had the bright idea of setting this piece in six barber shops in two continents on a single day: as it happens the one in 2012 when Chelsea beat Barcelona in a Champions League semi-final. The beauty of the play lay in Ellams’ ability to see that, for African men, the barber’s is a mix of pub, political platform, social centre and soapbox. The range of subjects covered was astonishing, the language racy and vigorous, and Bijan Sheibani’s production was like a party the audience had been invited to join.Like Winsome Pinnock’s pioneering Leave Taking, Natasha Gordon’s exhilarating debut play showed a family acknowledging its Jamaican past while living in the London present. The title referred to the Jamaican tradition of a nine-night funeral wake, but what was cheering about Gordon’s play was its suggestion that you can inhabit two worlds simultaneously. The family’s bright, young graduate was happy to suspend her rationalist scepticism while her aunt – joyously played by Cecilia Noble – took an active part in traditional rituals and still ensured she got home in time for EastEnders. Resentment at Britain’s historic hostility to immigrants was combined with Gordon’s fundamental faith in a twin cultural existence.• Jerusalem is at the Watermill, Bagnor, until 21 July."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65cd8859169435a4cb20572e77734d2fc7c701e4/0_70_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=675ce332f208d6bf595226050c22fafa","title":"cookery shows are too difficult bake off professionals","story":"Series like Bake Off: The Professionals are testing their contestants to the limit, and turning off have-a-go home chefs in the processAs a culotte-wearing, peach-cheeked, dairy-overweight teenager, I once decided to cook my family savoury stuffed pancakes for dinner after watching a particularly thrilling episode of 90s TV staple Ready Steady Cook. Maybe I was mesmerised by the lightning-fast chopping of one of the decade’s many new celebrity chefs, or perhaps it was Fern Britton’s cream blazer that a freshly upholstered armchair, but I was hooked like a halibut. The resulting meal, needless to say, was four parts egg, two parts cream and 10 parts underfried chaos.While Ready Steady Cook’s pancakes may have outfoxed me, they’re nothing compared with the challenges being set by this decade’s equivalents. Forget your £5-a-pop, pre-tea sprint round a four-ring hob. Anyone worth their salt on modern cookery television is expected to go far further: whip up a flock of tuiles, erect a croquembouche, re-create a meal blind (no recipe, no instructions, just a single taste beforehand), gut pigeons, cook without gadgets or simply blow through a ische windtorte in a matter of seconds. From Bake-Off: The Professionals to MasterChef, modern cookery shows have become difficult, bordering on the impossible.Last week’s Bake Off: The Professionals disaster, which saw Hideko and Theo’s giant romance-themed sugar sculpture – a Hallmark card made edible – fall and smash across a marble worktop like so many broken hearts, is just the latest in a series of cookery show cockups to delight and disquiet audiences. It can all be fun to watch, of course, but in an age of austerity, food banks, climate concern, political polarisation and intergenerational loathing, do we really need such a smörgåsbord of weeping, back-biting, wastage, petty criticisms, personal demolition and uneaten food?I know, I know, it’s just telly, but, as anyone who has ever tried to force a home-cooked green meal into a fussy child will tell you, role models matter and watching an endless circus of perfectly edible, carefully cooked food get treated like a handbag full of lightly baked human turds by a pantomime critic hardly breeds a healthy attitude to cooking, food and our role in sustainability. Meanwhile, the idea that anyone watching a heavily sweating chef wrestle with a disintegrating mille-feuille while presenters stand by aghast is going to encourage anyone to walk into their kitchen and actually, you know, cook something isn’t just laughable, it’s insulting.While Bake Off: The Professionals and MasterChef: The Professionals vie for the crown of greatest telegenic failure, the US Netflix show Nailed It, which returns for a second series this week, has thrown in the tea towel, done away with any pretence that these challenges may be either possible or inspirational, and simply jumped straight to the car-horn hilarity of cartoon failure. There are chocolate-filled hot tubs, volcano cakes, biscuit self-portraits and, why not, an edible finger, all put together by hapless amateur chefs set up like stars of You’ve Been Framed. It’s a different means to the same ends: expensive ingredients and unlikely dishes, plus the constant knowledge that your every dropped spoon is getting captured on five rolling cameras.There is still, of course, the odd television cookery show that seems designed to help viewers cook. Jamie’s Quick \u0026amp Easy Food deserves some mention here for its simple five-ingredient approach as well as Lorraine Pascale’s Fresh and Easy Food and Simply Nigella, in which dazzlingly good-looking women show you how to make food even you can manage in your hellhole of a kitchen. Sure, they don’t include an against-the-clock scavenger hunt for the ingredients like America’s Top Chef or a round-the-world ticket for the presenter like ol’ Rick Stein’s many odysseys, but at least they can give you an idea what to do with that carrot, bit of cheese, egg, bag of flour, bunch of spinach and pint of milk you have sitting in the kitchen.My advice would, of course, be to whip up a round of savoury stuffed pancakes. With maybe a side of fresh herb fougasse and a hazelnut dacquoise to finish, just to show you have tried."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acae534e140204eda88eb667f0534dc139c686a8/0_86_4200_2521/master/4200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9cb679d8dbf27e900f98294f713c2b0","title":"us immigration must reunite families separated at border federal judge rules","story":"Federal ruling also prevents officials splitting up families who crossed the US-Mexico border illegallyUS immigration agents can no longer separate immigrant parents and children caught crossing the border from Mexico illegally and must work to reunite those families that had been split up in custody, a federal judge has ruled.The US district court judge Dana Sabraw on Tuesday granted the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) a preliminary injunction in a lawsuit filed over family separations.Sabraw ordered US border authorities to reunite separated families within 30 days, setting a deadline in a process that has so far yielded uncertainty about when children might again see their parents.If children are younger than five, they must be reunified within 14 days. Sabraw, an appointee of President George W Bush, also issued a nationwide injunction on future family separations, unless the parent is deemed unfit or does not want to be with the child. His ruling requires the government provide phone contact between parents and their children within 10 days.More than 2,300 migrant children were separated from their parents after the Trump administration began a zero-tolerance policy in early May, seeking to prosecute all adults who crossed the border illegally, including those travelling with children.The ACLU had sued on behalf of a mother and her then six-year-old daughter, who were separated after arriving last November in the US to seek asylum and escape religious persecution in the Democratic Republic of Congo.While they were reunited in March, the ACLU is pursuing class-action claims on behalf of other immigrants.President Donald Trump issued an executive order to end the family separations on 20 June, but the government has yet to reunite about 2,000 children with their parents. A Department of Homeland Security statement over the weekend on reuniting families seemed only to sow further confusion.Before the preliminary injunction ruling, the government urged Sabraw not to rule that it stop separating and quickly reunite migrant families after they illegally cross the US-Mexico border, saying Trump’s executive order last week largelyaddressed those goals. But the judge disagreed. “The facts set forth before the court portray reactive governance responses to address a chaotic circumstance of the government’s own making,” Sabraw wrote. “They belie measured and ordered governance, which is central to the concept of due process enshrined in our constitution.”The ruling is a win for the ACLU, which filed the lawsuit in March involving a girl who was separated from her Congolese mother and a 14-year-old boy who was separated from his Brazilian mother.“Tears will be flowing in detention centres across the country when the families learn they will be reunited,” said the ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt.It is not clear how border authorities will meet the deadline. The health and human services secretary, Alex Azar, told Congress on Tuesday that his department still had custody of 2,047 children separated from their parents at the border. That is only six fewer children than the number in HHS custody from last Wednesday. Democratic senators said that was not nearly enough progress.Azar refused to say how long it would take to reunite familiesadding that his department undertook extensive vetting of parents to make sure they were not child traffickers.Also challenging will be the requirement the judge set on phone contact. At a Texas detention facility, immigrant advocates complained that parents got no answers from a freephone number provided by federal authorities to get information about their children.Attorneys have spoken to about 200 immigrants at the Port Isabel detention facility near Los Fresnos, Texas, since last week, and only a few knew where their children were being held, said Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg of the Legal Aid Justice Center in Virginia.“The US government never had any plan to reunite these families that were separated,” he said, and it was now “scrambling to undo this terrible thing that they have done”.Many children in shelters in southern Texas have not had contact with their parents, though some have reported being allowed to speak with them in recent days, said Meghan Johnson Perez, the director of the children’s project for the South Texas Pro Bono Asylum Representation Project, which provides free legal services to minors.“Things might be changing now. The agencies are trying to coordinate better,” she said. “But the kids we have been seeing have not been in contact with the parents. They don’t know where the parent is. They’re just distraught. Their urgent need is just trying to figure out, ‘Where is my parent?’”The judges’ decision came as 17 states, including New York and California, sued the Trump administration on Tuesday to force it to reunite children and parents. The states, all led by Democratic attorneys general, joined Washington DC, in filing the lawsuit in federal court in Seattle, arguing that they are being forced to shoulder increased child welfare, education and social services costs. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for a comment on the multistate lawsuit.In a speech before the conservative Criminal Justice Legal Foundation in Los Angeles, the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, defended the administration for taking a hardline stand on illegal immigration and said the voters elected Trump to do just that.“This is the Trump era,” he said. “We are enforcing our laws again. We know whose side we are on so does this group and we’re on the side of police, and we’re on the side of the public safety of the American people.”Outraged by the family separations, immigrant supporters have led protests in recent days in states including Florida and Texas. In Los Angeles, police arrested 25 demonstrators at a rally on Tuesday before Sessions’ address.Outside the US attorney’s office, protesters carried signs reading, “Free the children!” and “Stop caging families.” Clergy members who blocked the street by forming a human chain were handcuffed by police and led away.Later, protesters gathered outside the hotel where Sessions gave his speech. As his motorcade arrived, the crowd chanted, “Nazi, go home”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cab0161c42e7340c7e7a738548deda0e8b45fb75/0_270_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ee088ea01eef6eff1c5cff14b610572","title":"yangtze at 100km intervals a photo essay","story":"Mother River is a four-year project for which the British-Chinese photographer Yan Wang Preston photographed the 6,211km Yangtze river at precise 100km intervals with a large-format film cameraMother River is a four-year project for which the British-Chinese photographer Yan Wang Preston photographed the 6,211km Yangtze river at precise 100km intervals with a large-format film cameraThe Yangtze river is usually celebrated by idealistic images of iconic places. But with Mother River, Yan Wang Preston wanted to undermine the deep-seated preference towards certain river places and their landscape representations. By selecting photographic sites at equally spaced locations, she did not necessarily produce a picturesque view. Instead, the project is filled with random landscapes that have rarely been photographed before. The project aims to tell a story of the entire width of China from its western highland to its eastern coast and demonstrates that in an era of abundant satellite mapping and saturated imagery, fresh views can still be created by a simple mapping exercise.“In modern China though, it is the Yangtze that has been promoted by the central government as the main national icon. This is to do with the Yangtze’s importance for China’s development. It provides the most important trade route into the wealthiest area of China. It is the physical and metaphorical frontline of China’s modernisation, with over 30 hydroelectric dams planned or constructed on it. It provides an analogy for China’s political unification as it is the longest river in China which ‘connects’ all the regions from Tibet to Shanghai. For all these reasons the Yangtze is in focus, and that’s why I wanted to work on it.”“My journey began at 5,400m above sea level in the uninhabited zone known as the Tibetan Plateau. From here, the Yangtze river flows through majestic mountains with almost no access at all, before hitting the industrial lowland near Shanghai.”“Inhospitable terrain and huge distances made this project a modern-day adventure, with many potential hazards including high-altitude sickness, off-road driving, floods, sandstorms, earthquakes, landslides and mudslides.”“Not surprisingly, the process of realising the Mother River project wasn’t without incident. Two locations (Y15 \u0026amp Y16) remain unreached to this day, while 24 locations (Y39 - Y62) were originally depicted in poorly exposed images, because I loaded the films back-to-front by mistake.

In May, Kanji Kato, a lower house MP, said women should have multiple children and warned those who preferred to remain single that they would become a burden on the state later in life.Later that month, Koichi Hagiuda, the party’s executive acting secretary general and an Abe confidante, said childrearing was a woman’s job, and suggested that being raised by their fathers could impair children’s development.“We talk about cool ideas such as gender equality and men’s involvement in childrearing, but they are unwelcome ideas for children,” Kyodo quoted Hagiuda as saying.About 941,000 children were born in Japan last year, the lowest number since records began in 1899. The country’s birthrate remains low despite the introduction of financial and other incentives to encourage couples to have bigger families."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81d75dc8d2747c92e2cd3f8c5ab11cd5de0ea999/0_77_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8fc40fd4a11e87e8284bf5af03759cf3","title":"libya urges un to block oil sales after clashes between rival factions","story":"Move comes after strongman Khalifa Haftar takes control of key Gulf of Sirte oil terminals Libya’s oil industry – the sole reliable source of revenue for the strife-torn country – has been plunged into chaos after its United Nations-recognised government was forced to urge the UN to block any sales from its main oil terminals. The key terminals in the east of the country were captured from local militias last week by the so-called Libyan National Army, headed by strongman Khalifa Haftar. But on Tuesday Haftar announced his forces would send the revenues to a rival oil corporation in the country’s east rather than the UN-recognised National Oil Corporation (NOC).Haftar won control of the key oil terminals in the Gulf of Sirte from militia last week after 10 days of fierce fighting that left more than 300 people dead. The transfer of the ports, including Libya’s biggest, Es Sider, threatens to unsettle markets as purchasers are left struggling to identify legitimate Libyan traders. Haftar, the dominant figure on the east of the country, clearly feels he will benefit if the Tripoli-based government of national accord is starved of oil revenue. His decision threatens to deepen isions between the east and west of the country, and makes it hard for oil firms to know who to deal with. The clash will also complicate efforts by European leaders to reach agreements with Libya on controlling the flow of migrants through the country.The current populist surge in Europe has largely been fuelled by the three years of migration from Africa to Italy. The absence of political unity in Libya has made it easier for the traffickers to operate in the country. Muammar Gaddafi was ousted as president in 2011 after more than 40 years in power. But deep ision between his supporters and adversaries persisted. An internationally recognised National Transitional Council took over, but quickly succumbed to schism, particularly between east and west.The transitional authorities found it impossible to extend their writ across the whole country, which was splintering into myriad factions: former regime loyalists, revolutionary brigades, local militia, Islamists, old army units, tribes, people trafficking gangs.A General National Congress was elected in 2012 and established itself in Tripoli. But when a national parliament was elected in 2014, the GNC refused to accept the result the new body had to install itself in the eastern city of Tobruk. Libya now effectively had two governments - the former buttressed by Islamist militias in its Tripoli stronghold, the latter supported by Khalifa Haftar, a renegade army colonel now head of the armed forces.Libya has become too unsafe for diplomats and most aid workers. The UN pulled its staff out in 2014 and foreign embassies followed suit. Tripoli international airport is largely destroyed by fighting.The conflict has killed 5,000, ruined the economy, driven half a million from their homes and trapped hundreds of thousands of migrants seeking to get north to Europe in a nightmarish network of brutal camps. Diplomatic attempts at reconciliation have proven fruitless thus far.Despite the turmoil, the Libyan National Oil Corporation, headed by Mustafa Sanalla, had managed to remain largely above the political fray, and gradually brought production back up to nearly 1m barrels per day – helping to finance the UN-recognised government which controls the west of the country.Outside governments are ided over whether to back Haftar – whose LNA is a coalition of military unites and local militias – or the Tripoli-based government of national accord, which is recognised by the UN. Many had hoped that presidential elections scheduled for December might bring about reconciliation. The Tripoli government said: “Handing over oil terminals to an illegitimate entity only exacerbates the ision.”Sanalla said: “UN security council resolutions are very clear oil facilities, production, and exports must remain under the exclusive control of NOC and the sole oversight of the government of national accord. We are confident that the GNA and our international partners will take the necessary steps to stop all exports in breach of international law.”He added: “Libyans want a country of laws, not of guns. Instead of defending the rule of law in Libya by handing the Gulf of Sirte ports over to the operational control of the legitimate and internationally recognised NOC, the Libyan National Army has decided to put itself above the law.”Leaders from east and west of the country had met in Paris to agree a timetable to stage elections this December, but Sanalla said “the LNA has turned its back on the Paris accords and on the path to peace”. Sanalla also said it would sue any company that tried to buy oil from the eastern authorities and that no purchase contract signed with them would be honoured.Claudia Gazzini, the Crisis Group’s senior Libya analyst, said that Haftar’s decision not to hand over the oil terminals to the NOC could reignite wider conflict in Libya."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e88d9f3d7c68ea588c90b7fb371309ceb7ce71ee/0_230_3704_2222/master/3704.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa1b33c305157303d9ff04642800c1a6","title":"najib raids 273m of goods seized from former malaysian pms properties","story":"1,400 necklaces, 567 handbags and 14 tiaras among the goods seized from Najib Razak as part of embezzlement investigationThe cache of jewellery, handbags and watches seized from the houses of former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak is worth up to $273m, according to Malaysian police, who described it as the biggest seizure in Malaysian history.Police Commissioner Amar Singh confirmed that in the raids on six properties linked to Najib and his wife Rosmah Mansor, as part of the 1MDB investigation, the police seized a treasure trove of expensive goods, including 1,400 necklaces, 567 handbags, 423 watches, 2,200 rings, 1,600 brooches and 14 tiaras.The total market value of the goods was estimated to be between $223m and $275m. The most expensive item was a gold and diamond necklace worth $1.6m.The value of the Hermes handbags alone was $12.7m, while the watches, which were from 100 different makes including Rolex, Richard Mille and Chopard, were valued at $19m. 274 pairs of designer sunglasses, made by brands such as Cartier, Versace and Dior, were also part of the seized stash.The raid on Najib’s properties are part of the ongoing investigation into his role into the 1MDB scandal where billions of dollars were embezzled from a government fund and fraudulently spent. $681m of 1MDB money went into Najib’s personal bank account, where it is alleged it was used to fund the lavish spending habits of Najib and his wife. He has denied responsibility for the scandal.Najib was cleared of all wrongdoing when he was prime minister in an investigation widely viewed as a cover-up, but since he lost power in May, the new government, led by 92-year-old prime minister Mahathir Mohamad has made a renewed 1MDB investigation the priority. Mahathir said last week that they had an almost “perfect case” against Najib on charges such as bribery, theft of government funds and embezzlement. It is thought his arrest is now imminent. The large amount of jewellery seized in the raid also puts the spotlight further on the role of Rosmah in 1MDB. She has denied putting any pressure on Najib to provide funding for her ostentatious lifestyle, but a profile in the Wall Street Journal this week claimed that her “pursuit of the trappings of wealth played a crucial part in pushing Najib’s administration deeper into graft, ultimately leading to the government’s downfall”. The report alleged that she had been the one to set up the connection to Jho Low, the Malaysian businessman at the centre of the 1MDB embezzlement allegations, and led efforts to block the 1MDB investigations. Rosmah denies these claims. Mahathir said this week it was hard to prove Rosmah’s involvement as her signature, unlike Najib’s, was not on any 1MDB documents."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2254bc920c45c6a61dbec4c77b03618208a2974f/0_114_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34b884fd952a36ef1ec5c81b295fd635","title":"north korea nuclear reactor upgrades summit pledges","story":"Monitoring group says work shows why a denuclearisation deal rather than a ‘statement of lofty goals’ is neededNorth Korea has continued to upgrade its only known nuclear reactor used to fuel its weapons program, satellite imagery has shown, despite ongoing negotiations with the US and a pledge to denuclearise.Infrastructure improvements at the Yongbyon nuclear plant are “continuing at a rapid pace”, according to an analysis by monitoring group 38 North of commercial satellite images taken on 21 June.The cooling system for the plutonium production reactor has been modified and at least two new non-industrial buildings have been built on the site, possibly for use by visiting officials. A new engineering office building has been completed and construction has continued on support facilities throughout the complex, according to a blog post written by Frank V Pabian, Joseph S Bermudez Jr and Jack Liu.The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, has committed to “complete denuclearisation” in meetings with Donald Trump and South Korean president Moon Jae-in, but the details of how and when that will happen have not yet been decided. Kim announced earlier this year the the North’s nuclear arsenal and weapons capable of striking the US were complete, and the North closed its only known nuclear test site in May.“Infrastructure improvements continue at Yongbyon,” Jenny Town, managing editor of 38 North, wrote on Twitter. “Underscores reason why an actual deal is necessary, not just a statement of lofty goals.”The status of various parts of the nuclear complex remains unclear, and experts cautioned linking ongoing improvements to negotiations with the US.“Continued work at the Yongbyon facility should not be seen as having any relationship to North Korea’s pledge to denuclearise,” the experts warned. “The North’s nuclear cadre can be expected to proceed with business as usual until specific orders are issued from Pyongyang.”Despite the lack of clarity on any nuclear deal, South Korea has pushed ahead with diplomatic efforts. The two sides met for military talks this week aimed at restoring communication lines, and railway officials agreed to explore connecting the two countries by rail.Checks will begin next month on long-unused lines that once allowed travel across the entire peninsula. Talks began a decade ago, but were suspended amid rising tensions. South Korea already has a gleaming steel and glass station just south of its highly militarised border with the North, with tracks marked for service to the North’s capital, Pyongyang.Kim singled out the South’s advanced railway infrastructure during his meeting with Moon in April, acknowledging in a rare admission of weakness that the North lagged far behind its neighbour. But progress on the nuclear issue and the lifting of sanctions would have to come before any joint rail projects."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b64b6faedf2eab290e57a2bf36388bbc397d52b3/2133_239_4587_2752/master/4587.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b55cba6cc3eb8f2583a7b67d2d7cad47","title":"wednesday briefing with brexit speed is the hardest word","story":"Unlikely alliance presses May for progress … major moorland fire threatens homes … cities so sweet for modern beesUnlikely alliance presses May for progress … major moorland fire threatens homes … cities so sweet for modern beesGood morning all, Graham Russell here with what’s happening in the middle of your week.Arranging a Brexit deal was never going to be a swift process, but the current rate has caused enough alarm to bring together unions and business groups from across the UK and Europe to demand “pace and urgency”.

The army was on standby to help as fire crews tackled intense heat and challenging terrain, said Phil Nelson from the Greater Manchester fire and rescue service. No injuries have been reported as a result of the fires, which were revived by the heatwave.

The judge granted a preliminary injunction after a lawsuit was brought by the American Civil Liberties Union.Dark days ahead – Today’s rampant nationalist populism and widespread rejection of multilateral alliances has brought back the spectre of 1930s politics, Tony Blair is expected to say in a Chatham House speech. The former PM will say he has never been so worried about the UK, and will criticise movements that brought Donald Trump to power, saying: “Once it is clear the populism isn’t working because, ultimately, it offers only expressions of anger and not effective answers. The populists may double down, alleging that failure is the result of half-heartedness.” Blair will call on the US president to affirm that the transatlantic alliance matters or face weakening the west in its struggle with China.Not content to sit idle – Google, Facebook, YouTube and the like could be forced by law to remove extremist content within 24 hours under a Labour push to replace a voluntary approach it says is failing.

On Tuesday night the Alliance Party councillor was voted by members to be Mr Ford’s successor following a contest with the former Belfast mayor Nuala McAllister. The 52-year-old, a former Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council mayor, will will take over from Mr Ford when he officially steps down as an MLA on Sunday, June 30th, 20 years after he took his seat in South Antrim on July 1st, 1998.John Blair currently represents the Glengormley urban district electoral area on Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council.

Photograph: Eric LukeMinister for Justice Charlie Flanagan secured Cabinet approval on Tuesday to lift the restrictions placed on asylum seekers working, including the abolishment of the €1,000 payment for an employment permit.The proposals, which will be announced on Wednesday by Mr Flanagan and Minister of State David Staunton, come a year after the Supreme Court found the ban on asylum seekers working in this country was unconstitutional.According to the current rules, asylum seekers must secure a job that pays a starting salary of at least €30,000 per year, and may not work in any of 60 different sectors, including in hospitality, food, healthcare, social work, childcare, marketing, administration, textiles, printing, housekeeping and construction.It is understood Mr Flanagan will relax this system and will allow for broad access to occupations and easier access to work permits. The Minister for Justice will also be in charge of granting such permits.A Government source said the decision to deny access to the Garda, the Defence Forces and the Civil Service was due to the permanency of the positions.“It is not clear whether all asylum seekers will become permanent residents and therefore until that is clear, they will not be in a position to work in those three sectors. However, they will be able to work elsewhere.”Access to social welfare payments will also be permitted to those who find employment. Currently, asylum seekers living in direct provision have a weekly allowance of €21.60 and can buy food using a recently introduced points system.Figures show 5,096 people were living in direct provision in December 2017.Many have been in the system awaiting a decision on their future for years.The old scheme, which will remain in force until a full work-permit system is drawn up for asylum seekers, has been strongly criticised by advocates. Not one work permit has been issued since the ban was lifted.Last year, the Supreme Court heard a case from a Burmese man who had spent eight years in direct provision before getting refugee status.

Mr Harris is currently the Deputy Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland. Photograph: Cyril Byrne The Government expects newly appointed Garda Commissioner Drew Harris to recruit his own leadership team when he takes up his position later this year.It is a sea change for the Garda to have a leader from another jurisdiction and it is the first time in its history, but political sources said Mr Harris’s profile as someone from outside but with close knowledge of the force made him ideal for the role. The Garda has suffered from years of controversy over various scandals, with the last two commissioners retiring abruptly.Government figures said they expected and were “hopeful” Mr Harris would recruit his own team to assist him with his new position. All resources would be made available to ensure that happened, one stressed. However, this is likely to be contentious for many within the Garda force.The selection process was independent of Government, but Ministers enthusiastically welcomed the move on Tuesday with Mr Varadkar hailing the appointment from the steps of Government Buildings. The Cabinet yesterday ratified the appointment of Mr Harris, who is currently the Deputy Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, nine months after the departure of former commissioner Nóirín O’Sullivan from the role.Mr Harris will replace Acting Commissioner Dónall Ó Cualáin, who will be retiring from the force in September. Mr Harris will be paid a salary of €250,000.Speaking after the appointment was confirmed, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar defended the decision to appoint an outsider to the role and to oversee the State’s national security.Mr Varadkar insisted Mr Harris would be “loyal to the police and loyal to the State” and would steer policing in the right direction.“It is a good moment for Irish policing, it is an opportunity for new leadership and for policing for the community,” Mr Varadkar added.On taking up the post, Mr Harris will be required to make a solemn declaration under section 16 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 including to uphold the Constitution and the laws of the State.Mr Harris is entitled to dual Irish and British citizenship because he was born in Northern Ireland, and a Government spokesman confirmed he had applied for an Irish passport.Mr Harris was one of five iniduals in the final round of interviews for the role. Assistant Commissioner Leahy and Deputy Commissioner Twomey were the only two internal candidates to make through to the last stage of the competition.The others were based in Scotland and England. However it is understood one of those withdrew from the process in recent weeks.Mr Harris has served principally in Northern Ireland, including 12 years in senior leadership roles.

Photograph:   EPAWill OliverBritish and European business and union leaders have joined forces to call for urgent progress in the Brexit negotiations to agree on regulatory alignment, frictionless trade and how to avoid a hard border in Ireland. They urged British and EU negotiators to make faster progress on finalising the Withdrawal Agreement and to put economic interests and jobs first.“We are calling on the UK government and the EU to inject pace and urgency in the negotiations, bringing about measurable progress, in particular a backstop arrangement to avoid a hard border in Ireland,” they said.“The UK government and the EU will need to agree on all aspects of regulatory alignment, which is of the utmost importance, without jeopardising the integrity of the single market. This must involve preserving value chains and avoiding non-tariff barriers to trade finding a solution for intra-corporate transfer (ICT) arrangements barrier-free and frictionless trade in goods and services and a mechanism for agreeing a mutually acceptable level playing field for workers’ rights.”The unprecedented joint statement from the general secretaries of the British Trade Union Congress and the European Trade Union Confederation and the directors general of the Confederation of British Industry and Business Europe came ahead of a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels this week.It follows warnings from manufacturers including Airbus and BMW about the consequences of a no-deal exit, and an assertion by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders on Tuesday that investment in the British car industry had halved because of uncertainty over Brexit.In a speech to chief executives in London on Tuesday, Theresa May said her government had listened to business throughout the Brexit process despite recent remarks by ministers\u0026nbspcriticising companies for warning about the dangers of a poor deal or no deal at all. In the House of Commons, foreign secretary Boris Johnson did not deny saying “f**k business” at a meeting recently but implied that he was referring to lobbyists.“I don’t think anybody can doubt the passionate support of this government for business. It may be that I have from time to time expressed scepticism about some of those who profess to speak up for business,” he said.In their joint statement ahead of this week’s summit, the unions and business leaders called on both sides in the negotiations to consult them more and to put prosperity before politics.“Employers and unions have already developed a consensus on issues such as the need to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland, and the rights of UK citizens in the EU and EU citizens in the UK. We are calling on the UK and EU to consult us in a meaningful and more structured manner on a joint basis so that we can contribute to identifying and designing practical solutions that will work,” they said.“The cost of disagreement between the UK and the EU would be dire for firms, workers and the communities where they live. Amid uncertain times we appeal to negotiators on both sides to put jobs and prosperity before politics when seeking solutions that will matter for generations to come.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Tom BrennerThe New York TimesA US judge has ruled immigration agents can no longer separate immigrant parents and children caught crossing the border from Mexico illegally, and must reunite those families that had been split up in custody. United States District Court Judge Dana Sabraw granted the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) a preliminary injunction on Tuesday in a lawsuit filed over the family separations. More than 2,300 migrant children were separated from their parents after President Donald Trump’s administration began a “zero tolerance” policy in early May, seeking to prosecute all adults who crossed the border illegally, including those traveling with children. “The facts set forth before the court portray reactive governance responses to address a chaotic circumstance of the government’s own making,” Judge Sabraw wrote. “They belie measured and ordered governance, which is central to the concept of due process enshrined in our Constitution.” The judge ordered the government to reunite parents with their children younger than five years old within 14 days of the order, and children five years old and older within 30 days of the order. The ruling could force the administration to rapidly address confusion left by Mr Trump’s order, and government agencies to scramble to reunite families. The administration can appeal. The ACLU had sued on behalf of a mother and her then six-year-old daughter, who were separated after arriving last November in the United States to seek asylum and escape religious persecution in Democratic Republic of Congo. While they were reunited in March, the ACLU is pursuing class-action claims on behalf of other immigrants. Mr Trump issued an executive order to end the family separations on June 20th, but the government has yet to reunite about 2,000 children with their parents. The ACLU said on Monday that mr Trump’s order contained “loopholes”, and proposed requiring that families be reunited within 30 days, unless the parents were unfit or were housed in adult-only criminal facilities. Before the preliminary injunction ruling, the US government urged Judge Sabraw not to require that it stop separating and quickly reunite migrant families after they illegally cross the US-Mexico border, saying the executive order last week “largely” addressed those goals. Judge Sabraw, who was appointed by Republican President George W Bush, had on June 6th rejected the government’s bid to dismiss the case, saying forced separations could “shock the conscience” and amount to a violation of constitutional due process.Read more about how and why Donald Trump\u0027s administration is sending shockwaves around the world"},{"url":null,"title":"ancestry websites tell viking complete bunkum says expert ancient","story":"digitalservices@telegraphDr Tom Booth, a bio-archaeologist who specialises in ancient DNA, warned people against basing their identities on the resultsAncestry companies who say they can link you back to the Vikings is “complete bunkum”, according to a scientist who worked on the DNA of Cheddar Man.Dr Tom Booth, a bio-archaeologist who specialises in ancient DNA, warned people against basing their identities on the results from such companies, saying that results can become unclear past three centuries.“What I really don’t like about these companies is that they market themselves as linking you to medieval populations, which is complete bunkum, you can’t do that.”He said results begin to get “too cloudy” around three centuries into the past, adding: “The adverts that show they can tell you whether you are Viking or Saxons, I’ve got a problem with that because they can’t.“Because everyone in the 9th century, if they’ve successfully passed on a descendant, is your ancestor.”Dr Booth worked alongside Dr Selina Brace to understand the DNA testing of Britain’s oldest known skeleton, Cheddar Man.Dr Booth worked alongside Dr Selina Brace to understand the DNA testing of Britain’s oldest known skeleton, Cheddar ManSpeaking at Chalke Valley History Festival on Monday, Dr Booth spoke about the significance of modern DNA testing on ancient bones and how this technology had allowed scientists to discover the identity of the skeleton.He warned against people “constructing their entire identities around tests” from DNA companies saying it was “not a good way to go”.Ancestry companies are more limited in their capabilities to trace results as they are often relying solely on saliva samples. In the research of Cheddar Man, scientists were able to drill bone and analyse teeth, giving them much more detailed results.Please review our commenting policyHeterosexual couples should have right to civil partnerships, Supreme Court rulesZimbabwe president says he suspects political faction linked to Grace Mugabe was behind rally blast UK weather: Heatwave health warnings as temperatures could soar to 33CJapanese hermit forced to give up his remote island paradise after nearly 30 years living naked and foraging for foodSaddleworth Moor fire: Homes evacuated and Army on standby as blaze declared \u0026#39major incident\u0026#39What is the \u0026#39First Past The Post\u0026#39 voting system?What is Article 50?

Now you can build your own authentic replica Routemaster. Engineered with exceptional detail including working lights and bell.Week by week follow simple instructions to construct this iconic bus. Build the Routemaster. Issue one just £1.99.During the TV ad, white text appeared on the top right-hand side of the screen, stating “130 issues. Usual price £8.99”.Eight people complained to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) that the adverts, which were still running online yesterday, were misleading since it was not made “sufficiently” clear that you would have to buy 130 editions of the magazine, with 128 editions at a \u0027normal price\u0027 of £8.99.Model fans said they were left bewildered by the cost of completing the replica.One, calling himself Martyn, complained: Good God! it\u0027s £1,157 - you could by a real one for that!The total cost of building the replica model - which has working headlights, removable fuel cap and even a \u0026#39stop the bus\u0026#39 bell - came to  £1,157.70A model maker calling themselves Victoria Line wrote: I was really excited by the advert on telly - a project during the dark, winter evenings - but I could buy a little run about car for that money.”Another, called Frank, wrote: £1,157 - at that price I would expect it to start taking fares.The ASA has now banned the advert for being misleading, saying that the on-screen text \u0027130 issues. Usual price £8.99\u0027 was “not sufficiently prominent and likely to have been overlooked by consumers”.It stated: “The text was placed in the top right-hand corner of the ad, which may have been overlooked by viewers. Furthermore, the text was in a significantly smaller font than the £1.99 price claim and was not referenced by the voice-over, which instead referenced the £1.99 cost of the first issue.”The ASA added: Because the ad did not make sufficiently clear the total number of magazines consumers had to purchase and did not make clear the normal selling price of the magazine, we concluded that the ad was misleading.”Hachette Partwork, which produced the magazines, said it was “made clear” on its website that it would take 130 editions to complete the model - and that customers could get their money back if not satisfied.The front-engined AEC Routemaster first appeared in February 1956 and ran until it was withdrawn from service in December 2005. The following year it was voted one of Britain\u0027s top 10 design icons alongside Concorde, the Mini, the Spitfire and London’s tube map.One Routemaster heritage route still operates in central London.Transport and industryHeterosexual couples should have right to civil partnerships, Supreme Court rulesZimbabwe president says he suspects political faction linked to Grace Mugabe was behind rally blast UK weather: Heatwave health warnings as temperatures could soar to 33CJapanese hermit forced to give up his remote island paradise after nearly 30 years living naked and foraging for foodSaddleworth Moor fire: Homes evacuated and Army on standby as blaze declared \u0026#39major incident\u0026#39What is the \u0026#39First Past The Post\u0026#39 voting system?What is Article 50?

It’s just a nice thing to have.

I think it is a bit strange if they chose dads”.Just weeks earlier, Kanji Kato, a lower house member of LDP, also came under fire after saying that single women were a “burden on the state” and declared that newly-weds should have “at least three children”.Please review our commenting policyHeterosexual couples should have right to civil partnerships, Supreme Court rulesZimbabwe president says he suspects political faction linked to Grace Mugabe was behind rally blast UK weather: Heatwave health warnings as temperatures could soar to 33CJapanese hermit forced to give up his remote island paradise after nearly 30 years living naked and foraging for foodSaddleworth Moor fire: Homes evacuated and Army on standby as blaze declared \u0026#39major incident\u0026#39What is the \u0026#39First Past The Post\u0026#39 voting system?What is Article 50?

Information Research Department has led to some on the hard left branding him a ‘reactionary snitch’To many, he came close to being a secular saint.George Orwell, born 115 years ago on Monday, was the writer who challenged the iniquities of imperialism and capitalism, who took a bullet in the throat fighting fascism, and who taught a Western audience about the horrors of Stalinist communism.That he

War,\u0026nbspthe John F\u0026nbspKennedy of English letters”.Death may also have saved him from curdling into the kind of bitter, contrarian conservatism that seems to have been the fate awaiting many a one-time youthful socialist.Instead, Orwell is often remembered as a man of “genius”, the “greatest political writer of the 20th\u0026nbspcentury”.The commonly accepted view of the man is encapsulated in the aims of the foundation bearing his name.\u0026nbspThrough the coveted Orwell Prize, the Orwell Foundation seeks “to celebrate honest writing and reporting, to uncover hidden lives, to confront uncomfortable truths, to promote Orwell’s values of integrity, decency and fidelity to truth”.And yet there is one blemish – or complication – in the reputation of St George.It lay hidden until 1996 when Foreign Office file FO 111189 was made public under the 30-year rule.The hitherto secret file revealed that in 1949 the great writer had, via his friend Celia Kirwan, given a semi-secret government propaganda unit called the Information Research Department\u0026nbsp(IRD) what became known as “Orwell’s List”.Orwell effectively handed over to the British authorities the names of 38 public figures whom he thought should be treated with suspicion as secret communists or “fellow travellers” who sympathised with the aims of Stalin’s Russia.When the existence of Orwell’s List was revealed in 1996, and when the Foreign Office finally ulged who was on it in 2003, the initial reactions seemed tinged with sadness and hedged about with qualifications.But the internet was young then.Now it has grown into a giant bristling with social media channels and anger\u0026nbspswift to judge, slow to reflect.And so George Orwell, a hero to so many, is now demonised online as a “fake socialist”, a “reactionary snitch”, a traitor, a McCarthyite “weasel”.“Orwell’s List is a term that should be known by anyone who claims to be a person of the left,” declares one fairly widely circulated condemnation.\u0026nbsp“At the end of his life, he was an outright counter-revolutionary snitch, spying on leftists on behalf of the imperialist British government.”“He was an anti-socialist,” asserts another indictment, “corresponding with British secret services and keeping a blacklist of writers.”So widespread has the vilification become,\u0026nbspthat “Orwell as snitch”\u0026nbspis sometimes played with – not entirely seriously – as an internet meme.“I can’t get very worked up about the list,” he says mildly.\u0026nbsp“I don’t see it particularly as a mistake. \u0026nbsp“You just have to see it in the context of the time.”And that context, reveals Taylor, was explained to him by the left wing former Labour leader Michael Foot.Taylor recalls: “Foot told me that the great difficulty if you were a left wing Labour MP in the 1940s was working out exactly where your friends stood.\u0026nbspYou didn’t know whether some were listening to you and agreeing, and then going straight to the British Communist Party’s headquarters in King Street and telling them everything.”“Another example of the kind of thing they were facing,” says Taylor, “was the man who worked in the Foreign Office in the room next to Orwell’s IRD friend Celia.\u0026nbspHis name was Guy Burgess.“There were at least a dozen elected parliamentarians taking their orders from a foreign country,” adds Taylor.\u0026nbsp“What could be more traitorous than that?”Years after Orwell listed him as giving the “strong impression of being some kind of Russian agent”, the Mitrokhin Archive of KGB documents revealed that journalist Peter Smollett had indeed been a Russian agent.Driberg, who was\u0026nbspnamed on Orwell’s List as well as the KGB papers (Getty)Also listed by Orwell, and as a KGB agent by Mitrokhin, was the leading Labour MP Tom Driberg.Laying aside the irony that Michael Foot was himself once falsely accused of being a KGB agent, it is, then, perhaps no coincidence that the IRD was in fact set up, not by a headbanging Tory, but by Labour foreign secretary Ernest Bevin.“This was at a time when the Soviet Union was swallowing up what had previously been independent East European states,” says Taylor. “The IRD was producing reasoned expositions, pamphlet literature, telling people on the ground in Eastern Europe why they should resist this kind of stuff. \u0026nbsp“But a lot of British people were still seduced by the idea of our ally ‘good old Uncle Joe Stalin’, when in fact the bloke was a mass murdering psychopath.\u0026nbspAnd you were also dealing with some really hardline ideologues.“So Orwell’s idea was, if you are going to get somebody to write these kinds of pamphlets, they have to be genuine democrats.“He was a democratic socialist who wanted democratic socialists, not right wingers, to be writing this propaganda.\u0026nbspBut he wanted them to be people who had seen through the Soviet illusion, not covert stooges for Stalin’s Russia.”And so Taylor’s anger – such as it is – is reserved, not for Orwell, but for those like the late Labour MP Gerald Kaufman, who greeted the revelation of the list with the “pathetic” remark: “Orwell was a Big Brother too”.“This wasn’t Orwell denouncing anybody,” says Taylor.\u0026nbsp“He wasn’t writing public articles in the press saying ‘these people are evil’.It should perhaps be noted that Celia Kirwan was a bit more than just a friend.\u0026nbspThree years earlier, Orwell had actually proposed marriage to her in the emotional turmoil that followed the death of his first wife Eileen.Kirwan rebuffed his advances, but some have suggested that Orwell, aware of his failing health, might have been seeking the comfort of a beautiful woman when\u0026nbspon 6 April 1949\u0026nbsphe wrote offering to name those who “should not be trusted as propagandists”. \u0026nbspHe certainly knew the list was not for Kirwan’s eyes only.\u0026nbspAs noted by Timothy Garton Ash, the historian who persuaded the Foreign Office to reveal the document in 2003, Orwell sent his list to Kirwan with a reference to “your friends” who would read it.And as Garton Ash also noted, the IRD did not confine itself to relatively innocuous pamphleteering.In the New York Review of Books article that formed the first detailed analysis of the list’s contents, Garton Ash wrote: “By the late 1950s, IRD had a reputation as ‘the dirty tricks department’ of the Foreign Office, indulging in character assassination, false telegrams, putting itching powder on lavatory seats\u0026nbspand other such Cold War pranks”.When he sent his list to Celia Kirwan in 1949, Orwell might not have known that this was the IRD’s direction of travel, but of all people, the author of 1984, who envisaged the Ministry of Truth, should surely have been aware of the possibility.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThat said, as Garton Ash also wrote, not much seemed to have happened to the people on Orwell’s List (apart from missing out on the IRD pamphlet-writing gig).\u0026nbspIt seems their names weren’t even passed to MI5 or MI6.In America, Hollywood actors blacklisted during the McCarthy era\u0026nbsphad their careers and lives ruined.\u0026nbspIn England, Michael Redgrave appeared on Orwell’s List in 1949 and starred in the film adaptation of Orwell’s novel 1984 seven years later.Peter Smollett, named by Orwell as a likely Russian agent, got an OBE.2017 isn’t ‘1984’ – it’s stranger than Orwell imaginedREAR WINDOW: COLD WAR:The British Ministry of PropagandaBig Brother with a high moral senseIn other words, what happened to those on Orwell’s List seems to have borne no comparison to the fate of Big Brother’s fictional victims or the real millions who died in the purges and repression ordered by Stalin.What if Orwell had given the government a list of closet Nazis, he wondered.\u0026nbsp“Would anyone be objecting?”And in truth, there does seem a certain asymmetry in the online articles of denunciation.Indeed it is hard not to sense the inspiration of Private Eye’s (fictional) veteran class warrior Dave Spart in some of the articles condemning Orwell as “a social democratic traitor collaborating with the capitalist state against revolutionaries trying to create socialism.”“Sure, the USSR did a lot of objectionable things,” says one writer.\u0026nbsp“But … Western imperialist countries commit much more heinous crimes throughout the world every day.”Which is one way to gloss over the Gulag.The 15 best opening lines in literature115 Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen“It is

The first time Yossarian saw the chaplain he fell madly in love with him.A stronger charge against Orwell might be that of antisemitism.\u0026nbspThe private notebooks that formed the basis of the list he sent to the IRD included labels like “Polish Jew”, “English Jew”, and “Jewess”.But Orwell did also devote an entire 1945 essay to discussing how best to combat antisemitism, while having the honesty to admit – and regret – his own occasional lapses into jokes at the expense of Jews.And at the moment, antisemitism might be a problematic charge for some left wingers to level.Taylor, though, is convinced that some amongst “the newly emergent hard left” would secretly love to unleash something against Orwell.And yes, by “newly emergent hard left”, he does mean some Corbynistas.Younger party members, Taylor concedes, might not have the personal memories of the Cold War, still less an instinctive understanding of the context in which Orwell produced his list in 1949.But, he adds: “I am a Labour Party member.\u0026nbspI have been to hear Corbyn speak and noticed how an awful lot of the people there were aged left wingers for whom there had not really been a place in the Labour Party for the last 20 or 30 years.“An awful lot of the hard left these days would pay lip service to Orwell as a beacon of sanity, while secretly having doubts.“There are still a load of extreme lefties out there to whom Orwell is this snivelling little Trotskyite telling them things they don’t want to hear and pointing out things that shouldn’t be pointed out because they get in the way of the revolution.”And to the ideological, Taylor would add the psychological: “Tall poppy syndrome – Orwell is this secular saint, so let’s have a go at him.”This battle over Orwell’s reputation, of course, is more than just a matter of idle literary historical curiosity.Its relevance to the political struggles of today is suggested by the remark of one of the more ferocious online critics.“George Orwell,” he says, “was the first in a long line of Trots-turned-neocons”.It is certainly true that far-right commentators have started trying to co-opt Orwell to their cause, even to the point of suggesting that the man who once chased a fascist across a battlefield with a fixed bayonet would deplore the Antifa movement.This, says Taylor, is pretty much what Orwell feared.“At the time he was giving Celia Kirwan his list, 1984 was about to be published.\u0026nbspOrwell’s great fear was that right wingers would use it as a piece of anti-communist propaganda, and that’s what happened.\u0026nbspImmediately after\u0026nbsp1984 was published, it was used by the CIA as a propaganda tool.“Orwell wrote a very interesting letter to people in the US saying: ‘Look, this is not so much anti-communist as anti-totalitarian.’“He feared what right wingers would do with 1984, but thought it was the price you had to pay for exposing evils like totalitarianism.“And a writer can’t be blamed for how their books are used by people who are determined to twist meaning for malignant ends.”Taylor, though, can’t help wondering whether Orwell would really have been that upset by the comments of “slightly disconnected people” on the far left of the internet.Orwell himself, he points out, never sought secular saint status.\u0026nbspQuite the reverse: “He was very wary of that kind of thing.\u0026nbspIn an essay on Gandhi he effectively says that when people start being referred to as saints there is something very odd about them and it usually ends in disaster.”Instead Taylor has a sneaking suspicion that Orwell might have been rather amused by his online detractors.“People undervalue Orwell’s wry sense of humour,” he says.\u0026nbsp“David Astor, who used to edit the Observer and employed him, told me about the time Orwell came to him saying, ‘You should hear the abuse I have been getting from some of the communist newspapers.’“Orwell said: ‘They call me a fascist octopus.\u0026nbspThey call me a fascist hyena.“Then he paused: ‘They’re very fond of animals’.”\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The motion was backed by practically\u0026nbspall the mainstream centre right, centre left, liberals, greens and left-wingers on the committee.Conservative Home Affairs spokesman Daniel Dalton MEP, who voted against recommending the triggering of Article 7, attacked the “one sided” criticism of Hungary and said the EU should stay out of “domestic political controversies”.“Article 7 should only be used as a very last resort on strictly legal grounds upon the decision of the European Council and the European Commission,” he said.This is a damning indictment of the state of British European policy and completely destroys any credibility the Tories might have left.\u0026nbsp“The extremely one sided report I voted against today was an inappropriate attempt by the European parliament to insert itself into domestic political battles.\u0026nbsp“Recent attempts to raise domestic controversies to a European level are both wrong and counter-productive, alienating many citizens who feel their countries are being unfairly targeted by the European institutions.”Hungary’s foreign minister, Peter Szijjarto, was quick to reciprocate the Conservatives\u0027 support in Brussels, breaking ranks from other EU countries and telling the Daily Mail: “If we are not able to come to a deal with a country that represents 14 per cent – or one seventh – of our economy, that would lead to a situation that would be very devastating for the EU.”Hungary considering making offering food to refugees illegalHungarian government plans powers to ban NGOs that help migrantsWhy Hungary and Poland are turning away from democracyHow Orban is destroying democracy in HungaryMr Szijjarto, a leading member of Viktor Orban’s Fidesz party, went on the BBC’s Newsnight programme the same day to defend his country’s record.\u0026nbspAsked whether he stood by Mr Orban’s claim that refugees were “Muslim invaders” bringing terrorism to Europe and that his policy was based on xenophobia, he said: “Calling a country xenophobic is an insult, especially if you put it into consideration Hungary. No one can take away the right to decide with whom we would like to live together.\u0026nbsp“Yes, it is our intention to keep Hungary a Hungarian country and yes we do not agree with those ones who say that multiculturalism is by definition good.” He added that he stood by “of course all the statements of my prime minister”.Following the recommendation to trigger Article 7 against Hungary by the MEP committee the issue will now be voted on by all MEPs. Given the broad support amongst the largest political groups in the parliament it is expected to pass.Sophie Int Veld, a senior liberal MEP, criticised the Tories’ decision to back Hungary, warning: “This is a damning indictment of the state of British European policy and completely destroys any credibility the Tories might have left.\u0026nbsp“On the one hand calling for sanctions against Putin, on the other hand supporting one of his closest allies in the EU.\u0026nbsp Even Conservative governments of the recent past were always promoters of democracy and the rule of law in Central and Eastern Europe, but in providing cover for Orban’s descent to authoritarianism, they have today trampled on this legacy.\u0026nbsp“Prime Minister May tells us she will stand up for the international rules based order and for a stable, democratic and secure Europe, but in reality she is jumping into bed with Viktor Orban’s destructive vision of illiberal democracy. Voting with Orban is the true Tory Brexit: the exit from European values. A sad day.”She added: “Today the European parliament has sent a strong message to Viktor Orban and those who wish to spread his illiberal vision the European Union will defend its values.”Brexit: 10 of the most ridiculous headlinesThis wholly false headline merited the first ruling by IPSO (the press regulator) under clause 1 of the revised Editor\u0027s Code of Practice.

To participate in the state’s primary you must have registered by 5 June. To vote in partisan races, voters had to register as a Democrat or Republican, but other party affiliated voters can cast ballots in nonpartisan races such as those for school boards.\u0026nbspPolling places can be looked up on the Board of Elections site.\u0026nbspThere are several online voting guides to help familiarise voters with issues before heading into the booth. A valid form of identification is required and can be in the form of a state driver’s license, state issued ID card, passport, student or military ID. A current utility bill or pay stub listing your name and address also works. Those without identification can request a provisional ballot, which will be counted once the information is verified. Incumbent Governor Larry Hogan is running for a second term at the helm this year. Though a Republican, he is considered a moderate and worked to put distance between himself and Donald Trump on issues like healthcare and gun control. His popularity is a pleasant surprise for a state that is considered to be largely Democrat and has voted that way for decades in presidential elections. Going against Mr Hogan are eight Democrats. Perhaps the best-known candidate is Ben Jealous, former president of the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People\u0026nbsp(NAACP). He has managed to get endorsement from Senators Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris and is seen as the progressive challenger to established Democrats in the state, part of a national movement this year to make the party more erse, inclusive, and less reliant on corporate contributions which wield influence. However, candidate Rushern Baker polled at a relatively close second. The official from Prince George’s county, which borders the eastern half of Washington DC, has won the endorsement of former Democratic Maryland Governor Martin O’Malley and is seen as having closer ties to the establishment wing of the party. While Maryland is seen as a reliably blue\u0026nbspstate, there is one red\u0026nbspRepublican pocket and Democrats are looking to change that in voting booths along the Eastern Shore part of the state. Andy Harris has been the Republican Representative in the US House for eight years and has not faced a real challenge in that time. Unlike other parts of the state, the Eastern Shore is predominately white and voted for Mr Trump by 29 per cent in the 2016 election. What Mr Harris faces now is not just his vote against Obamacare, and that only 26 per cent of Maryland voters are registered Republicans, but also that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has made his seat a target and throwing political weight behind challengers like Jesse Colvin, a former Army intelligence officer, who has raised a large amount of money. Five other Democrats are challenging Mr Colvin for the nomination.

As far as Senate seats go, well-established Democratic Senator Ben Cardin is running for re-election.

The former US Army intelligence analyst who was convicted in 2013 for the largest leak of classified information in history moved to Rockville after Barack Obama commuted her sentence. Though\u0026nbspattention focused on her Senate bid, she has not been able to challenge Mr Cardin’s $4m in contributions and 30 years of experience.

As of last week, more than 170,000 voters had already cast early ballots, but experts warn this is not an indicator of winners since early voting is usually pushed far more by Democrats than Republicans.After the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration failed to send updated voter rolls to the Board of Elections, almost 19,000 voters are required to fill out provisional ballots in order to participate in the primaries. The agencies called it a “computer programming error” affecting any voters who updated their addresses between 22 April 2017 and 5 June 2018, as the Washington Post reported.In total 18,700 changed their addresses and 7,300 changed their party affiliation. There are efforts to contact all voters impacted by the error, but concerns were raised since the problem was discovered only three days before the primary.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

I feel like I can do anything,” Bayan al Soumady says over the phone from Riyadh. The excitement in her voice is infectious.\u0026nbsp“I drove myself to work today.\u0026nbspMaybe it’s just a little thing, but everything feels like an adventure now.”The 24-year-old pharmacist is one of thousands of women across Saudi Arabia who took to the road for the first time on Sunday after the kingdom abolished its long-standing ban on women driving.\u0026nbspAs the clock struck midnight, in a show of solidarity and celebration, women did victory laps around the centres of Riyadh, Jeddah and\u0026nbspDammam,\u0026nbsptrailed by Saudi television crews and the rest of the world’s media.Throughout Sunday – the first day of the Saudi working week – women who had already managed to convert their foreign driving licences\u0026nbspstepped into newly purchased cars, or borrowed those belonging to fathers and husbands, to commute to work and run errands alone. Some headed out of the cities on the long, straight desert roads to drive fast for the pleasure of it.\u0026nbsp“Life can feel very complicated here sometimes,” says\u0026nbspBayan, who is half Syrian and learned to drive while\u0026nbspstudying in Damascus.\u0026nbsp“It’s frustrating not being able to rely on yourself for simple things like going to the supermarket 10 minutes away. I know it doesn’t fix everything – but being able to drive is a big step,” she adds.The historic moment gives women unprecedented freedom in a country where the male ship system effectively renders them second-class citizens, unable to make many important decisions for themselves.\u0026nbspSaudi Arabia’s tiny activist community has fought against the ban since it was enforced by police and licensing agencies in 1990. A surprise royal decree from King Salman last September, however,\u0026nbspannounced the end of a policy which has been perhaps the foremost symbol of the oppression faced by women in the conservative kingdom. The move, designed to help get more\u0026nbspwomen into the Saudi workforce, is part of a raft of wide-ranging social and economic reforms installed by crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\u0026nbspin the year since his appointment.\u0026nbspSaudi Women celebrate their freedom to driveA Saudi woman gestures while driving in Dhahran, Saudi ArabiaA Saudi woman drives at night in Al Khobar, Saudi ArabiaSaudi women embrace as they celebrate the lift of the female driving ban in Saudi ArabiaA Saudi woman drives to work in Jeddah, Saudi ArabiaFadya Fahad is one of the first female drivers for Careem, a ride sharing company in Saudi ArabiaA Saudi woman stops at a petrol station while driving to work in Jeddah, Saudi ArabiaA Saudi woman waits for coffee on the commute in Jeddah, Saudi ArabiaA Saudi woman gestures while driving in Dhahran, Saudi ArabiaA Saudi woman drives at night in Al Khobar, Saudi ArabiaSaudi women embrace as they celebrate the lift of the female driving ban in Saudi ArabiaA Saudi woman drives to work in Jeddah, Saudi ArabiaFadya Fahad is one of the first female drivers for Careem, a ride sharing company in Saudi ArabiaA Saudi woman stops at a petrol station while driving to work in Jeddah, Saudi ArabiaA Saudi woman waits for coffee on the commute in Jeddah, Saudi ArabiaTo hammer home the message that change in Saudi Arabia comes from the top down, in the weeks leading up to the lifting of the ban 17 prominent activists have been arrested. Eight are still being held without access to their families or lawyers, and no charges have been brought against them.\u0026nbspDespite the crackdown, many ordinary Saudis embraced what one national newspaper called “history in the making”. \u0026nbsp“The logistics of half a country suddenly being able to learn to drive are quite something,” Susan Newbon, a British driving instructor training Saudi women to teach their own students, tells\u0026nbspThe Independent. “Honestly, I’ve never seen anything like it. It’s a very strange but very important occasion.”\u0026nbspSome women will have to wait a while to get behind the wheel\u0026nbspthere are huge waiting lists for gender-segregated lessons across the country, and a course of classes can cost hundreds of dollars. That is an extravagant expense in a country where households are tightening the purse strings following a global plunge in oil prices and amid national austerity measures.\u0026nbspLSE Saudi Arabia academic: Lifting ban on women driving is being used to deflect bad newsLearning to drive will also still depend on the goodwill of husbands, fathers or sons – meaning women from conservative families will not be enjoying their new right yet.\u0026nbspOn Sunday, at least, the mood across the country was jubilant, with “tawakkali wa intaliqi”, or “have faith and drive”, celebratory events taking place across the kingdom.\u0026nbsp“I’ve been using my husband’s car today,” Bayan says. “But I’m going to get my own as soon as possible.

Staff shortages pose big threat to safety on wards, say medicsHe said: If forced to take on more and more work without additional funding, workforce and resources, the consequence will be that the quality of work will be compromised, and unsafe in the case of patient care.It will drive the contractors insane, morale will become so poor that he will quit or become insolvent.He added: This is exactly what is happening to GPs.Dr Narang, of BMA\u0027s Gwent and South Powys ision, told the conference that GPs in Sweden are expected to see just 13 patients a day, with half-hourly appointments.He warned increasingly complex and intense consultations cannot be managed within 10-minute slots.GPs will be driven insane without a cap on workloadsThe day has limited hours and only so much can be managed without compromising the safety, he said.For the sake of quality and safety of patient care and the sanity of its troops, we urge the BMA to take a fresh approach by defining and agreeing what is a safe workload.Dr Sridhar Sampalli, from BMA\u0027s Salisbury ision, told the conference some GPs are reportedly seeing more than 70 patients on exceptional days, while the safe standard in other countries is 25.Dr Mary McCarthy, speaking in favour of the motion, said seeing 25 patients daily was a reasonable amount of work to do.I think this should be viewed like a speed limit, and I speak as someone with points on their licence, she said.That there are occasions when you do break it, that there are obviously flu epidemics or a busy day in which you do see more.GPs are reportedly seeing up to 70 patients a dayBut that you do recognise that you\u0027re working at an unsafe level, other countries recognise this.However Dr Gary Marlowe, chair of London regional BMA ision, warned an arbitrary cap would tie my hands to the detriment of my patients.In virtually every one of my sessions, there is a patient with a serious medical problem that would be impossible to identify without that consultation, he said.That patient could be the first appointment of the day, or the 26th appointment.Should we choose a cap of say 25, as has been suggested, what happens to that 26th patient?Do these charts prove the NHS is in trouble?                     Getty Images1 of 9A spokesman for the BMA said: GPs are in favour of a sensible workload to ensure they deliver the best care to their patients and do not put their own health and welfare at even greater risk.Today\u0027s Motion does not define the number of consultations, or a timeframe or scale for any capping.Appropriate limits on workload will depend on the unique circumstances of each practice and the preferences of each inidual GP, as well as the complexity of their patients\u0027 needs and the type of consultation being provided.As we outlined in our GP workload strategy paper in March of this year, it is imperative that we spell out what\u0027s safe and what\u0027s sustainable so that practices can put in place systems and processes to support and rebuild general practice for the sake of both doctors and their patients."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/590x/waitrose-980249.jpg","title":"waitrose store closures full list john lewis","story":"Waitrose is closing five storesFour convenience stores and one small supermarket will be cut in the restructure.\u0026nbspThe John Lewis Partnership made the announcement as it issued a profit warning.The group, which is hosting a strategy day, said that it does not expect to make a half year profit, while profits for the full year will come in substantially lower than last year.The company pointed to market uncertainty and cited significant extra costs at the partnership as a result of greater IT investment, which it said will be a big driver behind the profit change.

I’m out of here.”Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith has told Mrs May to turn the tables on “bullying” Eurocrats when she returns to Brussels this week.He believes she is in her strongest ­position yet to get them to discuss their relationship with Britain when we leave on March 29 next year.In the 15 months since Article 50 was triggered, they have refused to discuss trade while our own MPs argued among themselves.But Mrs May’s hand was strengthened last week after she saw off the rebels to get the EU Withdrawal Bill through ­Parliament.Tory MP Mr Duncan Smith warned she must show her mettle as she faces the biggest test of any PM in peacetime at next week’s Brussels showdown.He told The Sun on Sunday: “Theresa May now has the upper hand in these talks.They have been watching us fight among ourselves over Brexit for months and didn’t have to do anything because her position was so weak.“They knew there was an outside chance it wouldn’t happen, so they’ve dug in on all the practical stuff such as trade and bogged us down with other details.“But now it has been voted through. We are leaving. They cannot stop it.“I’ve advised Theresa to tell them bluntly to agree to talk about trade or she is leaving.“If they refuse to engage, she must have the resolve to get up and leave the table — making clear she will take our ­£40billion contribution with her.“Theresa must put her cards on the table and tell them she wants to talk about trade now.“If they tell her they don’t want to, she should put her business card on the table and say ‘Tell you what.There’s my ­number. Give me a buzz if you change your minds.Meanwhile, we’ve got nothing more to say to you’.“Then she should turn to her aides and say, ‘We can catch the ten past six if we hurry now.Can you get some cars because we’re on our way.We’ve got work to do. Nice to see you all. OK, guys. Take care. Goodbye!’“That will bring them to their senses rather quickly.“The 27 other EU countries are desperate for a deal so they can sell us their cars, cheeses and potato products.“They’ve tried to push us around for the past couple of years but Theresa has the upper hand now and she must show them who’s boss.”Slamming the way EU officials have treated Britain as “disgusting”, Mr Duncan Smith said: “Undiplomatic doesn’t begin to cover it.“They’ve done their level best to ­humiliate and be rude to us. They are meant to be our friends and allies.”Singling out chief negotiator Michel Barnier, European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker and ­European Parliament co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt, he added: “Come this week, we can tell them their days of behaving like ­playground bullies are over.”He said Wednesday’s flagship vote was THE most significant bill passed in the Commons since the treaty to join the fledgling ­European Economic Community in 1973.Crucially, it removes any chance of Brexit being derailed and the clock really has begun ticking towards our departure in 278 days.Brexiteers now warn that the PM must finalise a deal by November, to leave time to clear it all by February.Mr Duncan Smith said: “She is in a stronger position than she’s been in for some months.Getting the most critical bit of legislation through last week means she goes to the European Council knowing our departure is now settled.“That means she is back in charge of the negotiation and there is no way they can stop Brexit.“Now it’s down to raw negotiation, and the question facing the EU is how much they want to have a good relationship.“We do, and the Prime Minister has been open about that. But she has to be ready to walk away.“I’ve done negotiations in business and that’s what you do. You say, ‘There’s nothing on the table that I can agree to here. Sorry, I’m off’.“Never buy a car until you’ve attempted to walk out of the showroom at least twice.There is no better way to get the price down than to say, ‘I’m off, it’s too expensive, I’ll go somewhere else.’It’s not so much calling their bluff. It’s calling them out.“It’s kind of like poker — and Theresa has to force them to show their hand.”Last week’s decision to pump an extra £20billion into the NHS — partly funded by savings from EU contributions — will also send a clear message to Brussels that Britain is leaving.Mr Duncan Smith said: “It’s a down-payment that says we have to leave.“It shows she knows we’re leaving and we won’t be paying them any more money after a set time.”But has Mrs May got what it takes to face down the Brussels bully boys?Mr Duncan Smith said: “I think she has the steel to surprise them.“We’ve seen before what she’s like when she really digs her heels in.

Definitely, a real connection.”Who, of course, apart from Adam, who was going to be trouble from the moment he introduced himself as: “Not the serious man you see on Instagram.”A personal trainer unencumbered then by the flab of self-doubt who’s got a hint of the Blutos about him and flags up the moments he’s about to be cocky by ­saying: “Not being cocky but . . .”You can’t argue with the female ­reaction, though. Kendall, Megan, Rosie and Zara have all fallen for the swaggering great berk and Adam’s dumped all but the last of them with a smirk of self-satisfaction.As a way of endearing yourself to the core audience, it’s not good. As reality TV baddies go, however, he’s gold.It was inevitable then, I suppose, the fun police would also start taking an interest in him.Sure enough, there they were above the caption “Is Adam’s behaviour unacceptable?” on Thursday’s This Morning, where Katie Ghose, from Women’s Aid — who you’d hope had better stuff to do — was claiming: “Adam’s behaviour is a form of emotional abuse.”It didn’t take a genius to make the obvious point here. It took Towie’s Lauren Goodger, who said: “It’s just a TV show” and Adam’s merely taken the ­multiple dating rules at face value.So, if you have a genuine moral objection, take it up with ITV rather than feeding their publicity machine.Personally, I don’t. I have, though, had a nagging sense something was missing from this year’s run and it wasn’t until last week I worked out what it was either. The opposition.Big Brother, which is normally, head-to-head with Love Island, has disappeared and, I can almost guarantee, none of you have noticed or regretted its absence either.So not only has Love Island been funny, entertaining, immune to political correctness and proved a point, it’s removed the pox of Big Brother in the process.And if that isn’t public service broadcasting of the highest order and worthy of a plug, I dunno what is, frankly.The BBC failing to put Mark Lawrenson out of his obvious misery. Gary Lineker using apparently random World Cup trivia to draw attention to his goal-scoring exploits.The main BBC News actually doorstepping Lord Sugar over one stupid bladdy Tweet.This Morning’s Russell Grant spraying his astrological BS all over Love Island with the claim: “Rosie gave way to Adam too quickly ’cos of Mars in Venus and Venus and Leo.”And host Phillip Schofield failing to deliver the very obvious response: “Your head in Uranus.” TIME was, BBC comedy would make fun of Rick from The Young Ones, and all his ridiculous right-on pretensions.These days he’s running the show, in the guise of a man called Shane Allen who, not withstanding a thousand layers of state bureaucracy, has the easiest mission statement in television – make the viewers laugh.Apparently not, though. According to Shane, running BBC comedy these days is about finding “the diversity story”.Which sounds a bit like awarding the World Cup trophy to Switzerland, on the grounds of the squad’s ethnic mix.Except he doesn’t really mean diversity. It’s just those groups the BBC likes that Shane wants to employ, having made it abundantly clear “Oxbridge white blokes”, who’ve punched well above their weight, historically, are no longer required.So, at a stroke, you deny yourself any chance of finding talents and shows as brilliant, era-defining and clever as Sacha Baron Cohen (Ali G/Borat), Pete and Dud, Python, Fawlty Towers, Jimmy Carr, Fry \u0026amp Laurie, The Goodies and Not The Nine O’Clock News, while still very much lumbering us with the likes of Mel \u0026amp Sue, Famalam and Tittybangbang.For the privilege of institutionalising this failure and replacing an imagined prejudice with a very real one, I’ve also just learned we pay the BBC’s Head of Comedy £208,000 a year.Laugh?I didn’t.The Chase USA, Brooke Burns: “What South American country comes first alphabetically?”Mark: “Zimbabwe.”The Chase Australia, Andrew O’Keefe: “Beginning with the letter J, what word means liquid extracted from fruit?”Carroll: “Glucose.”Andrew O’Keefe: “What sedimentary rock is an anagram of the word leash?”Karen: “Coal.”And Andrew O’Keefe: “Which wig-shaped New York building was ­constructed in 1902?”Hat: “Trump Tower.”No, but I like the way you’re thinking, Hat.NEXT up from BBC2’s department of really dumb ideas?You take two of the greatest and most original comic talents of the last 30 years, Bob Mortimer and Paul Whitehouse.And send them bloody fishing.A combination which, in terms of things I don’t want to watch, is right up there with Vic Reeves \u0026amp Harry Enfield restoring vintage cars and Mel \u0026amp Sue attempting stand-up comedy.Mind you, the point of Gone Fishing also seemed lost on Bob Mortimer, as he trudged off to a Norfolk lake, angling for tench and asking his new mate: “What do we hope to achieve by the end of this, Paul?”Long pause.“A bit of inner peace?”What’s in it for the viewers became less and less clear as the silent pauses became longer.To the extent that, if you were lucky, Gone Fishing may just have been television to fall asleep to.If you weren’t, the last thing you may ever have heard was Bob asking: “Anything, Paul?”“No. Nothing.”On the plus side, though, corpses will have missed the moment where the BBC suddenly abandoned the fishing trip and, genuinely (I’m not making this bit up) sent Bob and Paul to a local micro-brewery.The resulting p***-up, you might not be wholly surprised to learn, wasn’t particularly well organised.Lee Dixon: “It’s a must-win game and Germany need at least a draw.”Phil Neville: “Mexico thoroughly deserve their 1-0 victory at half time.”Pablo Zabaleta: “At 3-1 down Tunisia need a goal to equalise the game.”Jason Mohammad: “One of the impressive things about Germany, the whole tournament, they were just so German-like.” Compiled by Graham Wray.THIS week’s winner is Sir Reg Holdsworth, in a wig, and Sir Reg Dwight (Elton), in a wig.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Italy is also expected to join too.Today Theresa May was urged to boost Britains defence budget to £60billion a year to convince the US to stay in Nato.The powerful Commons Defence committee warned that UK forces cant be a useful ally of the US without a cash boost from the Treasury.Meanwhile, Brussels has insisted that Britain will lose security perks after we quit the bloc next year.The UK will be excluded from key partnerships such as the European Arrest Warrant and EU crime databases, the EUs chief Brexit negotiator has said, but said we will still cooperate strongly to fight terror and cyber attacks.But his comments prompted a firm intervention from the GCHQ boss Jeremy Fleming, who revealed that vital intelligence from Britain has helped foil four terror plots against Europe in the last year.He said the UK had played a critical role - firing a warning shot to Brussels bosses who say they will boot us from working together after were gone.After discussions at Nato headquarters, he said: We’ve played a critical role in the disruption of terrorist operations in at least four European countries in the past year.

I never took a gap year and Id always fancied doing a bit of travelling - and what destination could be more adventurous than the final frontier?It only took a few hours before I heard back with the good news - Im in, which means I can vote on the direction of Asgardias future and, hopefully, be eligible to leave the planet one day when Asgardias first space expeditions get off the ground.Citizens from over 200 territories have applied to become Asgardians, and its current citizen count makes it the 172nd largest country in the world.Within 10 years, Asgardias leaders hope to have recruited 150 million people, and the dream is that the first ark - a satellite like the International Space Station - will be able to launch within a few decades time.Low Earth orbit is already well developed in terms of successful short-term human habitation, Lena De Winne, Asgardia’s Deputy Head of Administration, told us. However, for permanent habitation, we will need to address the issues of a lack of gravity and cosmic radiation.We’re planning on building space arks equipped with artificial gravity and shields from cosmic radiation and other space threats to allow for permanent human habitation.So far, the nation hasnt put anyone in space, but it has launched its own unmanned satellite, Asgardia-1, which is currently deployed in low-Earth orbit, moving at speeds of 7.6km per second.Next up, the country plans to establish its own digital currency, dubbed the solar, and bigger upcoming projects include designing a protective shield to guard humankind from space debris and asteroids.So far, the UN hasnt let Asgardia into the club of Earth-dwelling nations, but the nations founder says he is in informal talks with a few heads of state to get Asgardia recognised as a real country.Asgardia is the brainchild of Dr Igor Ashurbeyli, a billionaire Russian-Azerbaijani businessman and scientist who was formally inaugurated as Asgardias head of state at a grand ceremony at Viennas Hofburg Palace on Monday.Bizarrely, he was sworn in by former partner of Cheeky Girl Gabriela Irimia, Lembit Opik - a keen advocate of space exploration and one of Asgardias most high profile citizens.While his terrestrial political career is long over, Opik has been successfully elected to one of the 150 seats on the Asgardian parliament, along with Nigel Evans, President of the British Parliamentary Space Committee.“Today, it’s time to open space up economically, socially and culturally for all humankind, Opik says. That’s Asgardia’s mission.”“As the United Kingdom leaves the European Union, the country is liberated to invest in a truly global space community, and the Government has recognised this with substantial investment in the UK space sector.“Asgardia welcomes British citizens who share the dream of human opportunities in space for all countries, not just the privileged few who can afford a presence in space.There was a time when only the British Upper Class could travel abroad. Now it’s possible for all to do it.Dr Yun Zhao, Asgardia’s Head of Supreme Court, told Sun Online: There is no law that says that a nation should be attached to the surface of the Earth. Therefore, we are able to say that we have our territory free from the surface of the Earth.We are a nation whose population happens to reside in different countries—there is no law that says that as a citizen of a nation you must live there, there is no law which states that a nation must be big enough to host all of its citizens at one time.Ashurbeyli fears Earth will soon be destroyed by environmental degradation or a catastrophic nuclear war, and so he thinks its important that humanity can leave the planet before its too late.As such, he wants to start again with his own country and put space politics over geopolitics... a grand ambition which he has bankrolled entirely on his own so far.A qualified engineer, Azerbaijan-born Dr Igor Ashurbeyli made his fortune in a string of successful tech businesses.His exact net worth is not known, but its widely reported that Ashurbeyli is comfortably in the billionaire club.He founded software company Socium in 1988, before moving to Moscow to work with a string of military and scientific companies.Hes previously worked as a consultant for the UN, advising on how to protect Earth from asteroids and space threats, and he has edited an international space journal, ROOM, since 2014.Space has been a lifelong passion, and hes poured his own money into Asgardia, which he formally founded around 20 months ago.  In the future, he plans on charging a 100 euro annual citizenship fee, as well as collecting income and business taxes from members, to sustain the grand and expensive Asgardian dream.There are also plans to one day vet citizens by IQ, but at this point it looks like Asgardia will take anyone they can get, so long as theyre committed to a future away from our planet.The timeline for leaving Earth behind? Just 25 years, by which time Ashurbeyli hopes to establish a permanent human settlement on the moon.In the meantime, hes trying to find some political backing for Asgardia on the world stage, and iron out pesky admin stuff... like actually building life-supporting arks and getting millions of people into space.“This day will certainly be recorded in the annals of the greatest events in the history of humankind,” Ashurbeyli said in his inaugural speech.“We have thus established all branches of government. I can therefore declare with confidence that Asgardia – the first space nation of the united humankind – has been born.”Asgardia may be slowly heading towards recognition as an official country, but theres still a long way to go. Its probably safe to say that we dont need to worry about facing them in the group stages of the World Cup any time soon.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

As we approached the beach she took her shoes off just like any other kid would at a beach and I was taking the bags off the buggy.She continued: My friend had come with their dog. We saw a log so I said we would go and sit there.Emily ran over to it, but the next thing I knew she was screaming and saying her feet were hot and burning.I think she had walked on to a bit of sand where someone had had a barbecue or a fire.Im wondering if the log had been alight overnight and thats what made the sand so hot.Quick thinking Jill rushed Emily down to the water to cool her feet.The mum-of-four said: She was screaming they were burning.Ive never seen her in so much pain. We filled up her bucket with water and we had a bag of ice so I was using all that to try to cool them down until my partner arrived to take her to hospital.Jill and her partner, John Russell, 35, drove Emily to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh, and were given immediate attention.Jill said: They took her very quickly. Her feet and toes were all blistered.The doctors used sterilised water and cotton. The hospital burst the blisters and removed the burnt skin. We had to pin her down because she was so distressed.Jill will take Emily back to the hospital on Thursday to have the burns checked, and said shes worried Emily is never going to want to step on a beach again.Jill posted a plea on Facebook for people having barbecues or fires on the beach: Please, please make sure you put it out right.Her post was shared more than 600 times within a few hours.She explained: I was surprised at how much it was shared and how supportive people have been.The council also urged people to make beaches safe after barbecues.Environment convener Councillor Lesley Macinnes said: We want the public to enjoy all of the citys open spaces during the sunny weather, including our beautiful beaches.However, we would remind people that if they choose to have a barbecue they are responsible for clearing it up safely.All the remains of the barbecue and any other litter should be disposed of carefully, if necessary by taking it home, for the benefit of everyone."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/veterans-debate.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"labour accused of abandoning military veterans as just one of its mps turns up to commons debate on armed forces witch hunt","story":"A solitary shadow minister was the only one of all of Jeremy Corbyn’s 260 MPs to grace the Commons green benches for the event on Monday night.The debate was called by ex-Army officer turned Tory MP Leo Docherty to vent protests about the investigations into incidents during the Troubles in Northern Ireland.Some span back more than 40 years, and have been blamed for leaving ageing vets traumatised.The SNP’s 37 MPs were also all missing from their seats.In contrast, more than 50 Tory MPs turned up, including Armed Forces minister Mark Lancaster, as well as most of the DUP’s 10 MPs.Ex-Scots Guards officer Mr Docherty dubbed the opposition’s no show as “disappointing”.He added: “It reflects a distressing lack of interest and commitment to the Armed Forces community by Labour.“It would have been far better to have sent a cross party message to the Government.”Some Labour MPs were attacked by their constituents on social media when images of their empty benches circulated.One, MP for Exeter Ben Bradshaw, replied when challenged if he had been there: “It was the daily end of day adjournment debate.“Many of these are worthy, but they have no legislative impact \u0026amp limited opportunity for MPs other than the sponsor to speak.

He said: If they had involved us, our heritage department would have liaised with the regional government and got advice over the best way of handling the restoration.The mayor also complained that there was in general a lack of control over the Churchs heritage, which should be in the hands of public administration.He added that churches received money from the public and that there was a need for greater control to ensure something like this never happens again.Carmen Usua, who works for art restoration company ArtUs, shared details of the vandalism of the statue on social networks and claimed that it looks like a ninot (a cardboard sculpture typical of the Fallas festival in Valencia).She said the restoration had involved covering any cracks in the statue using plaster and then painting it with a totally new colour scheme that bore no resemblance to the original subtle colouring of the 16th-Century artist.She added: The livery of the horse was originally coloured silver with subtle gold lines and although dirty, it was not lost and could have been recovered with careful restoration. Instead everything has been covered in red paint in an act of vandalism that defies belief.Miguel Zuza, a member of the Navarre Council of Culture, told local media that this statue had the typical characteristics of a gentleman of the 15th or early 16th Century. Now it has been butchered and looks like a carousel figure.Saint George was born between 256-285 A.D and he died on April 23, 303.Since his exact birth date was never determined it is unclear how old he was when he died.According to legend he is said to have slain a dragon that was terrorising a town in modern day Libya.Many of the townsfolk were being killed by the dragon so they started feeding it two sheep a day to appease it.When the town ran out of sheep, legend has it that the king devised a lottery system to feed the hungry dragon local children instead.But, one day his own daughter was chosen and as she was being led down to the lake Saint George happened to ride past.The story goes that George offered to slay the dragon  but only if the people converted to Christianity.They did, and the king later built a church where the dragon was slain.His feast day is celebrated on April 23, the anniversary of his death."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000416316727.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"pm told to end freedom of movement","story":"In its strongest attack yet, Migration Watch demanded the PM get on with publishing plans to slash low-skilled immigration from the EU.And they urged her to separate immigration policy from trade talks amid fears the PM will give way on border controls to gain greater access to the single market.They said it defied belief Brits were still in the dark about the Government’s immigration policy just nine months out from Brexit Day.Migration Watch said the Government could offer visas to highly-skilled EU workers, brickies and agricultural workers and still cut 80 per cent of migration from the Continent.Lord Green, the think tank’s chair, stormed: “These proposals comprise a clear way forward on immigration that would benefit all sides.“The government must not let immigration get mired in trade negotiations. “They should stop dithering and get on with it so that people in companies know where they stand.”The attack came as Business Secretary Greg Clark admitted the Cabinet had not yet even discussed what a post-Brexit immigration policy should look like.

And, indeed, free trade is what most people thought they were ­voting for in the 2016 referendum.Free trade, cunningly styled “no deal” by pro-Remain spin doctors, has always been the best option, but has become even more attractive, now that the intransigence and arrogance of EU ­negotiators has become clear.Fair play, Theresa May and David Davis — you gave the negotiations with the EU your best shot but it’s now time to take the road to freedom.Carping critics say they could have done better, but the public instinctively knows that you’ve tried hard and that it takes two to tango.So, let’s be bold and scrap all tariffs on Brexit day, March 29, 2019.It will immediately boost living ­standards, by reducing prices, and will be especially beneficial for the less well-off. Juncker will cry into his claret at the new, competitive UK.Even companies such as BMW and Airbus, which urged us to join the euro and asked their workers to vote Remain, will benefit.Their engines, and other components imported from the EU, would continue to be free of tariffs. However, ­components from outside the EU would also become tariff-free, which is not usually the case today. Not only that, but their workers would be better off too, which is a plus for any business.And instead of sending £39billion into Brussels’ unaudited coffers, let’s invest the money here.Dividing it equally among our 650 MPs would allow each one to spend £60million in their constituency, on local projects. If MPs don’t like that suggestion, the £39billion could instead be used to reduce taxes or government debt. Our democratically elected Parliament can debate the best approach and decide.Most of us understand Chancellor Philip Hammond’s dogged attempts to get public expenditure under control, after the trauma of the credit crunch.But, it must make sense to invest this money in the UK, rather than the EU.Finally, free of Juncker’s shackles, we can regain control of our fishing waters, boosting the morale and income of our beleaguered coastal communities.No longer will 60 per cent of fish in UK waters be landed by EU boats.The public, too, has its role to play now. Project Fear, promoted by the CBI, the Financial Times and big businesses, has tried to frighten us with threats of gridlocked Channel ports and lorry parks across Kent when we leave the EU.Few believe them, but let’s call their bluff. UK consumers and businesses should now start to favour and prefer non-EU and British products wherever possible, dramatically reducing pressure on those ports.Wetherspoon has started by swapping champagne for UK and Aussie sparkling wine, and German wheat beer for the English and Welsh equivalent.As a result of this tactic, the public is benefitting from equal or better quality and lower prices. And there are a large number of other EU products that can be replaced in all pubs and supermarkets in the next year or two.The public instinctively understands the benefits of world trade, so let’s make buying non-EU a national goal for the next few years.It’s tough on our excellent EU ­suppliers, of course, but that’s the price the continent is paying, unfortunately, for a failing and undemocratic system, with unelected apparatchiks like Juncker and Barnier in charge.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was a large green metal box that just looked so out of place.We tried calling the council who couldnt help and then BT themselves. I asked why they had not taken the location into account.“Eventually they sent out a team of workmen who put in the new-look box.It is certainly an improvement and blends in much better with the street scene. But we would still rather that it was not there.This is a picturesque little rural village and the box had impact on the environment - we were persistent and then said that they could wrap it up to blend with the background.Acting chairman of the parish council Graham Lee said: I noticed some activity around the box and assumed they were finishing the wiring.“But as I returned I saw they were meticulously covering the box in a printed material which exactly matches the old flint wall it backs onto.The result is remarkable - and full marks to BT and Openreach for going the extra mile to help what could be deemed as an unsightly metal box blend in to our village.Parish councillor David Finch, who admitted he had not noticed the new box said:It looks reasonable enough - and the village does need better broadband.Another villager commented: It looks terrific - its been very cleverly done to blend in. it was a bit of an eyesore when it was just a large green box on the pavement.“Driving through now most people passing through wouldnt even notice it.“But the problem now is that while the box is there we still havent been connected up to faster broadband. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

These are likely to go unfulfilled, because he flaunts them so crassly.Yet before acknowledging that the Armed Forces need more money, which they do, we should recognise how hard it is to configure Britain’s defence and security posture at a time when threats and the means to address them are changing at awesome speed.Countering terrorism in some ways represents the least ­difficult element, because it is the only peril the public really cares about.It is evident to all save ­disciples of Julian Assange that electronic surveillance through GCHQ, supported by the intelligence services, armed police and military special forces, deserves generous funding, which it nowadays receives.It is much more difficult to identify the appropriate tools with which to equip the Armed Forces to meet the strategic threats, of which Russia ­represents the most obvious.When President Putin favours hybrid warfare embracing covert special forces, fake news, cyber attacks and subversion, are tanks and infantry battalions the appropriate responses?When US backing for Nato is wavering and key nations such as Germany forswear a serious combat capability, alongside what allies can we hope to present a common front?These are big and hard ­questions.A couple of months ago at a round-table dinner, some of Britain’s top generals and ­strategic gurus held forth about the threats as they see them.Afterwards, the former Defence Secretary Michael Heseltine, who was among the guests, told me that he had been disappointed by the ­unoriginality of the ideas expressed.Here were the brightest and best in the war studies ­universe, he suggested, still thinking inside the parameters of the familiar, when much that is unfamiliar is evolving all around us.In planning for the future, Army commanders deserve sympathy, because they are compelled to observe ­constraints imposed by public sentimentality, to which ­ministers make obeisance.For instance, the chronically under-recruited Scottish regiments should be reduced, instead of having their ranks filled with Fijians (yes, really), but that is politically unthinkable.Nobody dares to axe a foot guards battalion, because the Guards Division remains a powerful trades union.The Gurkhas, whose infrastructure and dependants’ costs now make them uneconomic, cannot be touched because no minister will risk Joanna ­Lumley once more taking to the streets on their behalf. ­Politicians, in their own defence, are entitled to point out that the leaders of the Armed Forces are often poor judges of strategic planning.The admirals of two decades ago begged, fought and pleaded for the Navy’s two preposterous carriers, which I have compared to the Egyptian pyramids — huge consumers of resources for negligible practical utility.It was always obvious that the F-35 aircraft for which they were designed are properly unaffordable by modern Britain.Beyond being described by Americans as “the planes that ate the Pentagon” because of their fantastic cost, recent assessments show them ­performing poorly in the key ground attack role, as do the RAF’s Typhoons, conceived as high-altitude interceptors.Moreover, it was always plain that almost the entire Royal Navy’s residual strength will be required to escort the carriers on active service, while they are incapable of inshore operation.A strong government and Defence Secretary would mothball the behemoths in a display of courage such as was last shown by Denis Healey in 1968 when he decided to withdraw British forces from east of Suez.Forces need more of almost everythingThey would also scrap the Trident deterrent replacement, again a big willy gesture for a little willy nation, inappropriate to our diminished status in the world.I know almost no one whom I respect in the defence loop — military or civilian — who favours trying to sustain a nuclear capability on the ­Trident scale.More money must be found to recruit, train and exercise a credible Army.The only certainty about ­Britain’s defence needs is that more soldiers are wanted, to meet a range of future threats.Something much more serious than the fanatics of IS could well confront Britain in the coming decades.American military friends often remind me that Britain’s Armed Forces today command respect neither from friends nor foes.I remember General Sir Mike Jackson saying ­ruefully, as head of the Army 12 years ago: “Mass matters, and we don’t have it.”Our rulers may sometimes be forgiven for lying to us, but should never be forgiven for lying to themselves, as ­members of this Government do repeatedly.Bits of Britain’s Armed Forces are still superb, but it will not do for ministers merely to keep reciting the tired mantra about how terrific the SAS is.This is a niche force, no more capable of frightening Russia or China than the England cricket team.Gavin Williamson is dead right, that our Armed Forces need more of almost everything.Such a pity, then, that he himself has no more credibility at Westminster than an England cricket coach.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Prime Minister began by seeking to charm her audience, insisting their creativity and innovation were vital for the nation, as was the wealth created by business.She added: \"A Conservative government will always listen to your voice and back you every step of the way as you grow our economy and create more good jobs.\"Recounting some of the ways in which she believes her government is working with business successfully, for example by financing the biggest investment in the UK\u0027s railways since Victorian times and embarking on the biggest road-building programme seen since the 1970s, Mrs May went on to insist that she was making \"good progress\" in the Brexit negotiations and that the voice of business had helped shape those negotiations.\"If only,\" muttered at least one suited figure.This is the kind of stuff business leaders love to hear: it provides them with reassurance that politicians are thinking about the state of the world and helping future-proof the economy.Unfortunately, it was followed by a light scolding, as the PM reminded her audience that many people do not feel a free market economy is working for them. There were, she said, only two responses: reform the system or resort to \"simple, populist answers that seek to smash that system\".The primary function of the economy, she insisted, was raising people\u0027s living standards.That peroration was followed by a brief interview with Danny Finkelstein, The Times columnist, who is also now a Conservative peer.It was the journalist in Lord Finkelstein that emerged, however, as his first question dealt with the allegation that Mr Johnson had said \"f*** business\". There was a collective intake of breath, followed by nervous laughter, some of it from the First Lord of the Treasury herself. Was this really, she mused, what Times journalism had come to? What the audience wanted to hear was a comprehensive condemnation of Mr Johnson\u0027s comments. What it got was a guarded response in which the PM avoided the question, but at least made clear she disagreed with Messrs Johnson and Hunt, arguing: \"It\u0027s right that we listen to the voice of business. It\u0027s right that business makes its voice heard.\"It was a missed opportunity from the leader of the self-styled party of business to build bridges with a constituency that is feeling increasingly unloved by both the major parties.Before long, Mrs May had moved onto Brexit, shrugging off a question from Lord Finkelstein about whether warnings from business about Brexit were either \"Project Fear or Project Reality\" and insisting she was still focused on obtaining a good deal for the UK on both trade and security.A hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland was again ruled out."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/06/2048x1152/skynews-royal-queen-harry-meghan_4346643.jpg?20180627001222 ","title":"queen joins harry and meghan to honour young leaders at star studded bash","story":"\"You are the hope and optimism the world needs and we will all do everything that we can to support you in it,\" he added.He and Meghan met a group from Australia, New Zealand and Tonga at the event ahead of their royal tour to the Pacific countries later this year.It come after Meghan\u0027s father reportedly criticised the Queen for agreeing to meet US President Donald Trump before him.

The Trades Union Congress (TUC) and Confederation of British Industry (CBI) heaped pressure on Theresa May to speed her talks with Brussels. It heaps pressure on the Prime Minister just as she prepares to summon her entire Cabinet to Chequers next week to sign off her plan for trading goods with the EU. The invite to the entire Cabinet - not just the 11-strong Brexit-backing \u0027 war Cabinet \u0027 - has prompted speculation Mrs May is about to announce a \u0027Soft Brexit\u0027.  Brexiteers like Boris Johnson want the PM to cut Britain free of EU rules - \u0027hard Brexit\u0027. But talks are in deadlock as Brussels warns the UK will lose benefits of being in the club. And with an October deadline looming, and the EU Council meeting this Thursday, Mrs May is under huge pressure to choose a path. Last night she faced an open demand to keep close ties with the EU by her Business Secretary, Greg Clark.  In a slapdown to Cabinet colleagues, Mr Clark said people should listen to businesses because they put evidence before ideology. He hit out at Tories like Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson, who attacked firms like Airbus for warning they could pull investment out of Britain. Mr Clark said those firms were in the actual world, not a theoretical exercise in which you take decisions over the lives of people in imagined worlds. Today\u0027s joint TUC and CBI warning was joined by union and business leaders on the continent too.  The organisations, which represent 45 million workers and 20 million employers across Europe, said: We are calling on the UK Government and the EU to inject pace and urgency in the negotiations, bringing about measurable progress, in particular a backstop arrangement to avoid a hard border in Ireland.  “The cost of disagreement between the UK and the EU would be dire for firms, workers and the communities where they live. Amid uncertain times, we appeal to negotiators on both sides to put jobs and prosperity before politics when seeking solutions that will matter for generations to come.” The EU has as a customs union. This means the 28 member states trade EU goods for free - and set an equal tariff on non-EU goods. For example, US car imports to the EU carry a 10% tariff. Being in the customs union benefits the UK, because the EU is our largest trading partner and it prevents lorry checks at the border. But Theresa May wants the UK to leave the customs union because otherwise, Britain will have to follow EU rules and cannot strike trade deals around the world. She is considering two options. Customs partnership: This would see Britain collect tariffs on all imports on behalf of the EU. If the UK tariff is lower than the EU one, then firms would be able to reclaim the difference. Maximum Facilitation - \u0027Max Fac\u0027: This would use high-tech tracking devices to monitor the flow of goods. Businesses would operate as “trusted traders” and would be able to pay any tariffs at regular intervals rather than every time they cross a border. A Government spokesman said: We absolutely agree. That\u0027s why we have put forward workable proposals to the EU on a range of areas from the backstop to security, and the White Paper - which will be published after June Council - will continue to drive this process forward. We are confident that we can make progress if both the EU and UK engage constructively. But shadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey said: The Tories have spent over two years botching Brexit by bickering amongst themselves. Time is running out. Businesses, consumers and workers need certainty, not endless chaos, egos and melodrama. The EU has a customs union. This means all 28 member states can trade with each other without any checks or duties on goods. Theresa May has said Britain will leave this after December 2020, so she can sign trade deals with non-EU countries. But officials have warned a new UK customs system won\u0027t be ready in time. So they\u0027ve devised a \u0027backstop\u0027 - a backup plan that will carry on some EU customs rules in the UK if there\u0027s no deal. It is designed to stop ports grinding to a halt and Northern Ireland setting up border posts, which could lead to violence. Yet Brexiteers were furious because it had no set end date. In a huge Tory row, they warned it would trap Britain half-in, half-out the EU. After frantic last-minute talks, and threats to quit by Brexit Secretary David Davis, a time limit was put in - December 2021. Yet the government only expects to follow that time limit. It is not legally binding. And the EU poured cold water on it. Britain and the EU also disagree about what the backstop will do. EU plans back in March would have kept Northern Ireland aligned with Brussels customs rules, but Theresa May rejected this because it draws a border between the province and the mainland. So she drew up Britain\u0027s own backstop, which is now being put to the EU for discussion. The UK plan is a temporary customs arrangement allowing totally tariff-free trade between the EU and the whole of the UK. So the UK would carry on being in the EU Customs Union in all but name until December 2021. But the UK also wants to sign new trade deals with nations outside the EU. Britain even wants to implement parts of these deals that don\u0027t relate to the backstop. Brussels has repeatedly said this won\u0027t be possible - so the new plan is setting up for a big battle with the EU. And as time ticks on, the backstop will become less of a Plan B and more of a Plan A. It\u0027ll turn from backstop... to frontstop."},{"url":null,"title":"tory liz truss jokes burning","story":"NewsTory Liz Truss jokes about \u0027burning\u0027 Michael Gove and lashes out at colleagues in extraordinary blue-on-blue attackThe Cabinet Minister declared herself \u0027disruptor in chief\u0027 and launched a string of thinly veiled attacks on senior colleagues\u0026nbspShareByMikey SmithPolitical reporter22:29, 26 JUN 2018Updated00:38, 27 JUN 2018NewsLiz \u0027The Disruptor\u0027 Truss (Image: PA)\u0026nbspShareGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTory minister Liz Truss joked about ‘burning’ Michael Gove in an extraordinary blue-on-blue assault. The Treasury chief secretary launched a string of thinly veiled attacks on senior Cabinet colleagues in a speech, and declared herself the “disruptor in chief”. And an earlier version of the speech, mistakenly published on a government\u0027s website, would have seen Ms Truss lash out at plans announced by Gove with the backing of the Prime Minister to ban plastic drinking straws. She said it was hard to shake the feeling that rules get in the way of consumers\u0027 choices and lifestyles. A passage in the text of the speech but not in the delivered version highlighted messages about healthy living and not drinking from disposable cups through plastic straws.  Mr Gove and the Prime Minister have made tackling plastic waste a key plank of the Tory strategy to help clean up the environment. Ms Truss joked about the Environment Secretary\u0027s plans, including measures to tackle air pollution, in a speech at the London School of Economics. Many of the rules that we have in place are important in guaranteeing public safety, she said. But it\u0027s hard to shake the feeling that sometimes they just get in the way of consumers\u0027 choices and lifestyles. And Government\u0027s role should not be to tell us what our tastes should be. Too often we\u0027re hearing about not drinking too much, eating too many doughnuts, drinking from disposable cups through plastic straw, or enjoying the warm glow of our wood-burning Goves... I mean stoves. I can see their point: there\u0027s enough hot air and smoke at the Environment Department already.  She added: Unnecessary red tape restricts business and consumer freedom, so I believe we should cut it wherever we can. Ms Truss, who said she saw her role as disruptor in chief, also called for more action to build homes, claiming restrictions on building are holding cities up. She said urban development rules in Japan were relaxed in the early 2000s giving people the freedom to change their property as they see fit and commercial developers are free to do as they please in designated zones. As a result property prices in Tokyo have been much flatter than in London, she said. It\u0027s restrictions that are causing problems, so we need to liberate, she said. We should densify our built environment and look at making it easier for local neighbourhoods to raise the height of their houses.

Tuesday officially became the hottest day of the year as the mercury hit 30 Celsius in Hawarden, Wales - making it warmer than Monday\u0027s sweltering conditions.  Temperatures were so hot yesterday that it caused trains to slow down as rail tracks began to buckle under the intense heat.  It seems the hot conditions are set to last as weather forecasters now predict up to eight more heatwaves before the summer has finished.  AccuWeather’s Jim Andrews said: The UK is looking at a range of five to eight more spells which we would call heatwaves this summer. It would certainly be reasonable to expect 93.2F (34C) highs.”  “It would certainly be reasonable to expect 34C highs this summer, most likely in late July and early August.      “Heat will build in the UK this summer due to high pressure, the sun heating the land, and heat arriving from as far away as Spain.”  The Met Office issued a Level 2 warning as temperatures are set to soar to almost 33C during this week\u0027s heatwave, urging people to take precautions to prevent sun or heat-related injury.  The alert means social and healthcare services are at the ready to reduce harm from a potential heatwave. Dr Thomas Waite of Public Health England urged people to keep in mind those who may be vulnerable, including the elderly, young children and those with underlying health conditions for whom he said the summer heat can bring real health risks.  The heatwave claimed its first victims as water safety groups and police warned of dangerous situations in the hottest weather of the year so far.

The Openreach cabinet was originally green in colour when it was erected on a street in the 650-year-old village of Stanstead, Suffolk. But after locals complained that it looked so out of place, the company camouflaged the box to match the flint wall behind it. And the results are remarkable. At a quick glance, the 4ft tall, 4ft wide box is barely visible, with the printed material covering it an almost exact match with the wall.  Wall owner, Ervin Xhafa, who had contacted BT about the box in front of his 16th century home, said it now blends in much better.  The 35-year-old property executive told The Sun :It is certainly an improvement and blends in much better with the street scene.  But we would still rather that it was not there. BT teamed up with council officials to disguise the box. Graham Lee, acting chairman of the parish council, described seeing workers meticulously covering the box in the wall-themed material.  The result is remarkable - and full marks to BT and Openreach for going the extra mile to help what could be deemed as an unsightly metal box blend in to our village, he said. Another local praised the terrific work. But they claimed that while the stealthy cabinet looks great, they are still yet to be connected to faster broadband. Earlier this month, it emerged that BT is to replace its chief executive, Gavin Patterson, amid waning support for the company\u0027s trajectory.

A study of more than 9,000 consumers revealed spenders can be split into eight ‘attitudinal segments’, with each group possessing unique attitudes and characteristics which inform how they manage their money. ‘Trend Spenders’ emerged as the most prominent – those who are ruled by their heart when it comes to money and don’t feel worried about loosening the purse strings as long as they can maintain their lifestyle. More people found themselves in this category than in ‘Sensible Sage’ or ‘Skilled Savers’, which describe those who are more prudent when it comes to their spending. Becky Moffat, Head of Personal Banking and Advance at HSBC UK, which carried out the research, said: “Brits are notoriously reluctant to talk about money and this can impact our financial behaviour.  “Forty-five per cent only check their main bank account once a week or less and one in 10 only check it once a month. “We want to encourage Great Britain to start thinking about how their financial personality could affect how they manage their money, which is why we’ve released the Bank-Life Balance test.” The research also found London is home to a higher number of ‘Driven Achievers’ than the national average. These are people who spend time doing their research, allowing them to make savvy decisions, and are comfortable pushing their financial boundaries if they think there’s going to be a pay-off. Meanwhile, millennials are most likely to be ‘Sensible Sages’ – people who are very considered and see no point in getting into debt unless they can pay it off in full every month.

The Duchess of Sussex accompanied her new hubby Harry to the Queen\u0027s Young Leaders Awards, which honours youngsters from across the Commonwealth.  The event was streamed on the Royal Family\u0027s Facebook page, meaning people could watch it live from around the world.  But one royal fan was shocked by something she spotted - the way Meghan was sitting.   In the lead up to her wedding and at events since, we\u0027ve seen Meghan adopt the ever-so-ladylike Duchess Slant while sitting at formal events.  It\u0027s a firm favourite of Kate Middleton and Princess Diana also sat in the same way all the time. But shockingly Meghan, who was wearing a pink Prada dress for the occasion, decided to sit a different way at the event - the horror. Instead of clasping her knees and ankles together and slanting her legs to one side, she simply crossed them. Naturally, somebody on social media pointed this out within a matter of seconds.  She wrote: Duchess of Sussex has her legs crossed wrong. What a disrespect to the queen. All royal ladies cross at the ankles or put both legs off to the side. And she wasn\u0027t the only one, as another fan added: Meghan don\u0027t cross your legs Queen doesn\u0027t like that. However other royal fans were outraged that people were giving her such a hard time and rushed to Meghan\u0027s defence. One commented: Let\u0027s focus on the wonderful honourees and NOT legs , dresses or etiquette - these young people deserve more focus.  Another added: Pretty sure the Queen is more concerned with Meghan\u0027s passion and commitment to the Commonwealth than how she crosses her legs. Someone wrote: Omg. She is still in the learning process. Go away judgmental woman. While one supporter pointed out: Actually she would be taught how to cross her legs which Kate often does too - she has been in the public eye for years - she knows what she is doing....give her a break. Another said: Give Megan a break 36 years of crossing your legs is a hard habit to break. The Duchess Slant was named after Kate Middleton, even though it\u0027s been used by royal women for years.  But it\u0027s not just a weird official rule, there\u0027s actually an important reason behind it. Etiquette expert Myka Meier, from Beaumont Etiquette, explains: It is the perfect pose for when a camera is shooting directly in front of you because by slightly slanting the knees to create a zig-zag effect when wearing a dress or skirt, your legs are angled so that the camera only shoots the sides of your legs and protects your modesty. Prince Harry had the important job of opening this year\u0027s awards.

She is keeping the arachnid in a plastic box at the property, with a small hole for breathing, a leaf and water to stay hydrated. Willow took to the Internet to read up on the creature after discovering it earlier this week, the Hull Daily Mail reports.  After warnings it could be linked to the dangerous Black Widow family of arachnids, she put the plastic box over the animal. Her little boy suffers from bad asthma and she is worried about him coming into contact with the spider because of his health problems. She has therefore vowed to keep it safe and alive until she can clarify for definite whether it poses any harm to the pair of them. “I’ve seen a lot of spiders in my time like Daddy Long Legs and things like that but this is the first one I’ve seen like this, she said. “It doesn’t look like it belongs in Hull but obviously I’m no spider expert. I was up for a few hours last night researching it and it is possibly a family member of the Black Widow. Because some of them change colours.  “I want to be definitely sure before I release it because my son has a very weak immune system. He can catch every little thing and it can make him really ill.” According to a zoologist from the area, the spider appears to be of a completely harmless species and nothing exotic. While her research continues, Willow has promised to keep the creature safe – despite the health risks she fears it could pose. She has insisted she will not kill the animal because she believes that all species should be treated the same. “I don’t want it to be killed or harmed in any way, she said. To me a spider is the same as a child or family member. I’m very protective of every single species.” Internet theories on the spider have ranged far and wide.  According to Willow, some have told her it could be linked to the Black Widow whereas others believe it is part of the enoplognatha ovata species of spider. That species is native to Europe and more commonly known as the “candy stripe” spider because of its appearance. That species is harmless and Hull-born zoologist Tim Cockerill believes Willow has nothing to worry about. Dr Cockerill said: “It looks to me like Enoplognatha ovata , one of the tangle-web spiders. It is completely harmless and is native to the UK, so nothing to worry about. “It\u0027s hard to be 100 per cent sure without a better photo, but that\u0027s what it looks like to me and it\u0027s almost certainly nothing exotic.

The big blazing orb in a cloudless sky has us all walking round with big grins as Britain catches Summer Fever. It has led to an unusually optimistic sense that three months of sunshine and fun are here. A heatwave, a winning footie team and a host of other events have combined to lift spirits. Many of us wonder if Summer 2018 could turn out to be Britain’s brightest ever. Here are quite a few reasons why... England at World Cup  They said they’d win it and now we’re daring to believe. England’s stonking 6-1 defeat of Panama has convinced us that Harry Kane and the lads really could be World Cup champions again and bring home the 18-carat gold prize. Its predecessor in 1966, the Jules Rimet Trophy, was stolen only to be found by a dog called Pickles. And Pickles happens to be what Jordan Pickford’s mum calls him. See – it’s fate.  You love it or you love to hate it, but Love Island is THE summer TV hit. And this year we, like, get an extra, like, week of being pied, getting muggy and having The Ick. Like. Music festivals  There’s no Glastonbury this year as the Somerset farm needs a break but festival season is well under way. And fans flocking to Reading, Bestival, Latitude or Leeds may actually avoid the traditional mudbaths and waterlogged tents. In other huge music news, pop princess Britney Spears is doing three nights in Scarborough. And she will no doubt be delighting locals with her greatest hit, “Gi’ us another clout, flower.” Chance to show Trump how we feel about him  President Donald Trump will be full of his own importance on a three-day visit here next month. But some of the 53,000 protesters taking to the streets to protest will prick his pomposity. They have crowdfunded a giant Trump Baby balloon to fly above London as Britain says “Up Yours.” Markle Sparkle and the Fab Four  Meghan and Harry’s wedding kicked off our red-hot summer but the Markle sparkle continues at a string of engagements for the new Duke and Duchess. We’ll also see the Fab Four reunited as they join William and Kate at Prince Louis’ christening next month. Mamma Mia! The sequel...  Dancing Queens everywhere are bursting out of their spandex jumpsuits with excitement. After a 10-year wait, Mamma Mia 2 hits cinema screens on July 27. Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) is pregnant and single but her mum and her mum’s pals rally round – and Cher even turns up as her nan! Murray at Wimbledon  Will that iffy hip hold up and allow Andy Murray to smash his way to Wimbledon glory this year? Well, the tennis ace says he’ll only play on Monday if he feels in good shape and he is not putting himself under any pressure. And neither are we, Andy. (Go on, you know you want to....)  Our summer fruit favourite is cheaper and sweeter than ever because the extreme weather has led to a glut. Big, extra-juicy strawberries are flooding aisles in shops, perfect for plonking in Pimms and on pavlovas. But it probably won’t affect the outrageous prices for strawberries and cream at Wimbledon. Doing the Floss dance craze  Dabbing is dead, the bottle flip has flopped – The Floss is the latest kids’ craze. The hip-swinging, arm-swaying dance was started in 2016 by a US kid on the internet. Now adults, including Charlotte Hawkins and Kate Garraway on Good Morning Britain, are all doing it (badly) and it’s making the nation smile. Lewis Hamilton’s Formula 1 heroics  A convincing French Grand Prix victory has put Lewis Hamilton back on top of the F1 World Championship. There’s still a way to go before he can claim a fifth crown but a British GP win at Silverstone next month would be another summer highlight. We’re right behind you, Lewis. Rather like Sebastian Vettel. Great Exhibition of the North Three million people are expected to flock to Newcastle and Gateshead for the Great Exhibition of the North which opened in a blaze of fireworks and fountains last week. As well as being great family fun, the 80-day festival of art, culture, design and innovation is expected to bring \u0026pound184million into the North East economy. Heatwaves  And it is getting even hotter! The UK is scorching in wall-to-wall sunshine and the temperatures are expected to hit 33C (91.4F) by the weekend. Weather forecasters predict July will be the hottest on record and the whole summer will be a sizzler. All of which will mean more staycations and a boost to our struggling seaside resorts. Biggest Pride march  Rainbow-coloured flags will be out in force across the nation as this year’s LGBTQ celebrations are bigger and bolder than ever.

The boxing champ\u0027s widow, Lonnie, has listed the estate in Berrien Springs, Michigan, in the USA, for $2,895,037 USD (\u0026pound2,180,165). The \u002737\u0027 in the price tag is reference the total number of knockouts Ali amassed in his career - and inside there is no shortage of boxing memorabilia and apparatus. The sprawling estate comes with two houses, 81 acres, as well as a steam room, massage room and a basketball court. Ali both lived and boxed in the home, which is family reportedly bought in 1975, 10 years before The Greatest was diagnosed with Parkinson\u0027s disease.  He died on June 3, 2016 aged 74 from septic shock. The listing agency, Cressy and Everett Real Estate, says it has received interest from people in Chicago, New York, and even the UK.  Once known as the Louisville Lip for his brashness, Ali used the home in his later years to have some serenity from the intensity of fame, as well as the perfect spot to recover. The estate, built in 1990, comes with four bedrooms, two bathrooms, as well as security. There is also a man-made pool, as well as a river, pond and vegetable garden. According to listing agent Tim Mitchell, the estate was previous owned by one of Al Capone\u0027s lieutenant bodyguards, Louis Campagna, and Capone himself lived down the river.

It was, of course, ever thus when predicting what may be in store for a football club.On the pitch, however good the squad may look, successful results can never be taken for granted.The season just ended is an example of that. While it would not be realistic to expect Dundee to finish in the top four, there was reason to believe the players should have been good enough to have mounted a serious challenge to make the Premiership’s top six.That they didn’t was disappointing but, despite some complaint about that, the reality of a club the size of Dundee is that any campaign that ends with them still in the top division has to be acceptable.The hope has to be that, with the right additions, next term will see that top-six challenge materialise.If it does, it can become a regular occurrence.As for the new stadium, it goes back to that phrase – seeing will be believing.The plans are impressive and the feeling the best bet for the future is to move away from Dens, home for the last 119 years but now ageing and in many ways impractical, is a sensible one.But the aim was the first spade would be in the ground at what’s been dubbed “Nou Campy” just north of the Kingsway and adjacent to Camperdown Park at some point this summer.Yes, there’s another couple of months to go before that becomes a false promise but, with no final planning permission in place as yet, time is running out.Of course, even if that’s what comes to pass, it doesn’t mean the stadium won’t be built.As we’ve seen up the coast at Aberdeen, such projects can be delayed, delayed and delayed again.If Nou Campy never gets off the ground, it doesn’t have to follow the club will be plunged into the latest of what down the years have been many crises.For many fans, wherever the team is playing, so long as it continues to be backed by the Keyes cash and is riding high in the Premiership, that bright future will have arrived.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2d0ee006656-836x564.jpg ","title":"bowmans new dundee united role is vital says boss csaba","story":"\t\t\t\t\tManager Csaba Laszlo is delighted Dundee United legend Dave Bowman has agreed to take on the new role of the club’s Scottish scout.It will see ‘Bow’ take on responsibility of identifying players already operating north of the border who could become signing targets for the Tangerines.And during the season he will be the man who makes sure Csaba knows exactly what to expect from future opposition.“I am very happy about Bow’s decision to be our scout. He will look for new players for us and he has experience in this direction, so I know he will recommend the right people,” said Csaba.“He will also look at opposition and this is vital for us. He is very close to the first team and it is an important position.“Paul Sturrock is doing a lot of work, but he will more or less be down in England and Bow will be here as our man on the ground.”Meanwhile, having signed nine players already this summer, the pace of the rebuilding is set to slow, though there will be more new arrivals in the coming weeks.For Csaba it is important that most of the players he wanted were secured in time for pre-season training getting under way on Thursday.“For the pre-season, more or less 90% of the team must be ready,” added Csaba.“You have to prepare the team, so it was important we had made these signings.“The majority of players we wished for and who we talked to are here.”United are still in the market for another central defender, while one more striker could be added to the squad in the coming weeks.That could see a number of trialists joining up for training and possibly even games, though Csaba has decided against arranging a closed-door game in which an entire line-up of players looking to earn a contract would be used.“Maybe there are one or two possibilities for that (trialists), but if you have to go on trial, for me, there is something wrong.“I am not against loan players but they must be one who can help the team and they have to have ambition.”Fans will get their first look at the new signings in a friendly at Brechin on Tuesday week.So far that’s the only pre-season game fixed up, but at least one more is likely to be confirmed soon.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b3205e49eee8-376x564.jpg ","title":"developer submits plans to build 20 more dundee homes","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe redevelopment of a housing estate is set to continue after fresh plans for 20 new homes were submitted to Dundee City Council.Homebuilder Strathmore Homes is hoping to construct the three-bed homes on brownfield land to the east of Foggyley Gardens, near Lochee.It represents the second stage of redevelopment out of a possible three in the Foggyley estate, which was home to a number of multi-storey blocks until a decade ago.Work is already under way to build 14 semi-detached and seven detached homes on land to the north of the street, off Harestane Road, after permission was granted back in 2016.In the meantime, Strathmore has lodged this new application with city planners in order to continue with its three-stage housing plan. Each home will have driveway parking space suitable for two cars, alongside bicycle parking and bin storage, should the application be approved.A planning diagram included with the application shows the 20 homes would face west, onto Foggyley Gardens, extending down towards the main road.Planning agents Andrew Black Design said: “It is proposed to develop the land adjacent to Foggyley Gardens with 20 semi-detached, three bedroom houses.“The site is located in the suburban area identified in the current local development plan.”Foggyley was historically a part of the Cox brothers’ estate which included the adjacent areas of Clement Park and Beechwood.After the Second World War the jute mansions in Foggyley and Beechwood were demolished and the land was developed into housing schemes.These included homes to the west of Foggyley Gardens, still there today, as well as the four 10-storey blocks and two 16-storey blocks that sat to the east of the road and have since been demolished.The developers are also requesting permission to cut down or trim back a number of trees on the site.However, some of the greenery is subject to a tree protection order, meaning parts of the land cannot be redeveloped.Strathmore aims to appeal to city planners by satisfying a need for more homes in the area, which in turn will generate extra income for the economy.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee kid henvey signs new dark blues deal","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee kid Matty Henvey has signed a new one-year contract.The 18-year-old striker broke into the first team near in late December and went on to make four appearances.He was side-lined by an injury suffered as he scored a dramatic late goal in the win at Hamilton Accies at the end of January and missed most of the rest of the season.Matty\u0026#8217s goals in the first part of the season were key to Dundee\u0026#8217s runners-up position in the development league.He joined the rest of the first team squad last week for pre-season training.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b1f819d44b02-423x564.jpg ","title":"dundee people customer base like a little community","story":"\t\t\t\t\tchoosing what to have for lunch in a bustling city centre can be a task, however, Brodie’s Takeaway has you covered.The blue-fronted shop on Bell Street is often the go-to place to grab a whole range of tasty homemade grub and it is all thanks to Cate and Ron Brodie who opened the shop almost 14 years ago.Cate said: “We already owned Brodie’s Coffee Shop in Forfar and we wanted to branch out and open another shop.“The premises we are in were already a takeaway when we took over.”After three years of running both businesses the couple decided to sell the coffee shop and focus on their Dundee business and their two children.Cate said: “We found with running two businesses and having two kids that we were just too widespread between the shops and we decided to sell the coffee shop.“It was a really hard decision to make, but with business you have to either go really big and hire managers or stay small and in control so that is what we have done.“It has also allowed us to get our weekends back to spend with our children.”Now the takeaway is thriving with masses of hungry locals heading in five days a week for the huge range of homemade food on offer.Cate appreciates though that the shop is in an ideal location with the High School of Dundee, Abertay University and the DC Thomson offices in close proximity and full of willing customers.“We have a huge amount of regulars now from all the local businesses.“The shop is now like a meeting point with everyone like a little community and we all know each other.“I also like to introduce people to each other while they are waiting in the queues for their food.“It is a way for them to network and meet new people and it’s also great for me getting to know everyone who comes in.”Now after more than a decade the owner couldn’t imagine not having the takeaway shop.“Although it is very hard work with my days lasting easily 12 hours and starting between 5-6am, I couldn’t imagine myself not having Brodie’s.“People may think it is easy, but there is a lot of work that goes on in the background that customers don’t see.Whatever you fancy to eat Brodie’s is more than likely to have it with an extensive menu ranging from homemade soups, sandwiches and burgers to daily specials including chicken curry and stovies, there is something for everyone.But owner Cate says it wouldn’t be possible without her three employees and her 81-year-old dad, Gordon Bruce.She said: “My dad is basically on call whenever we need him.

She is a spirit medium full time.From her studio, Sacred Spirit in Carnoustie, she is able to give messages from those who have passed away to those who were closest to them.Karen has been able to connect to the spirit world her whole life but only began developing the skill about seven years ago.She said: “I really began my development seven years ago when I travelled down south to meet with Tony Stockwell.“He noticed straight away that I had the ability to be a great medium so he became my first teacher.“I then became a guest on the Scottish dates of his tour.“People think that you can either talk to the spirit or you can’t – and while not everyone has the ability to, if you can connect with the spirit world you need to develop your skills and gain understanding of what they are communicating to you.“For instance if a spirit shows me a sandcastle I know that means someone has been married in a castle. However, you need to work at it to be able to gain that understanding.”Whilst Karen appreciates there is now a greater understanding and interest in mediumship, there are people who see it as a “circus act”.Mediums are especially in the spotlight now as it is portrayed on a bigger platform with TV programmes dedicated to the skill.“There is such a big interest in this kind of work that it has become incredibly accessible with people even going live on social media, but I feel that takes away the personal aspect of it.“I try to give very personal details to people so they know I am telling the truth and I am reputable.“I have even been featured in magazines who have done “psychic under the spotlight” tests and gave me full marks for accuracy.“I feel incredibly lucky that I am able to do this job. I get really emotional but you can’t not get emotional!“I have ladies who sit opposite me in a state of grief and I feel anyone who comes to my events or for a one-to-one session is hurting or grieving and I am able to help those people. I am doing this to bring comfort to people and to help heal them and that is really important to me.“I wouldn’t change my ability at all, I love it.”As well as providing spiritual readings Karen also teaches mediumship to those who have the ability.She said: “I can instantly tell if someone is a medium or has the ability to be, I don’t know why, it’s just a connection.“I travel the world teaching mediums and also have regular students here in the studio. About 80% of those students are here because I have picked up that they have the ability.“I also do online teaching, so if anyone believes they could have the ability to reach the spirit world they should get in contact to develop their skill further.”Karen will be on stage at the Whitehall Theatre on Wednesday June 27.Tickets are priced at £16 and can be purchased from the box office.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b14fff717cc5.jpg ","title":"dundee people residents celebrate after saving post office from closure","story":"\t\t\t\t\tHilltown residents were rejoicing after the community saved the local post office from closure.Following the retirement of the sub-postmistress in 1991, the Post Office announced the branch would be closed.The plans caused an uproar, with residents and councillors all pulling together to oppose the plan, which was finally shelved.Betty Hand, of the Ladywell off-licence, who was a customer of the branch, supplied bottles of bubbly for the celebratory party.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2cf8557f688-848x564.jpg ","title":"dundee people student jim 73 gets third degree","story":"\t\t\t\t\tStudents of all ages packed out City Square as the Caird Hall hosted the  University of Dundee’s graduation ceremonies.Among those receiving a degree was 73-year-old Dundonian Jim Ashwood, who picked up his MA(Hons) in American History.Lifelong learner Jim was born on Small’s Wynd, which now forms part of the university campus itself.He said he was “absolutely chuffed” to be picking up his third degree.Hilltown mum Fiona Dixon, 47, is one of the university’s first part-time students to graduate with honours after collecting her First Class MA in English and History.Fiona said: “It’s been a brilliant experience.

between £400,000 and half a million.While that will be more than welcome as United prepare for another money-losing season in the Championship, with the player’s likely move to England coming out of the blue, it is not something they budgeted for.That means the further signings being planned will not be hit by the fact Celtic do not have to pay up straight away and, if they choose, could stagger the payments over two or three years.What the money could become is a nice extra for manager Csaba Laszlo if he makes moves in the transfer market during the January window.Right now he is looking to put the finishing touches to rebuilding a squad that’s already seen eight new first-team players fixed up.He remains in the market for another striker and a central defender, in particular.Potential target Callum Morris completed a moved to second-tier rivals Ross County at the weekend – along with former Tannadice team-mate Keith Watson.Morris was still on a list of possible signings but after securing stopper Frederic Frans earlier this month, a footballing defender is being sought.Former striker David Goodwillie could complete a move from Clyde to Premiership new boys Livingston this week if the clubs can agree a fee.United were aware of his likely availability during the close season but, given his off-field issues, there was no chance of him being handed a third spell at Tannadice.Monday saw the players start their first full week of pre-season training at their St Andrews base.They are due to see action for the first time tomorrow week in a friendly at Brechin and more games are set to be pencilled in.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ex dundee united boss ray mckinnon moves to put medical record claim straight","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFormer Dundee United boss Ray McKinnon has moved to set the record straight after a suggestion not all his signings at Tannadice were put through medicals.Earlier this week current Tangerines boss Csaba Laszlo had stated that was the case and although he did not name McKinnon, he did mention the period during which his predecessor was in charge at the club.McKinnon, now in charge at United’s Championship rivals Morton, has responded by issuing a statement.“In light of reports in the press this week regarding the signing of players at Dundee United during my period as manager, I feel I have no option other than to clarify the following point,” it read.“I deal in facts only and the fact is that in my time as manager every single player signed was put through a medical by the medical staff at Dundee United.“I am disappointed that I have had to make this statement because although things did not work out the way I would have wished, I left the club on good terms.“I have moved on and my focus is on an exciting new challenge at Morton.”He would make no further comment and it’s understood he now considers the matter closed.United, meanwhile, were back at work on Thursday as pre-season training kicked off.Almost a full squad was on duty, with only goalie Deniz Mehmet unable to do any work following surgery.Midfielder Fraser Fyvie didn’t do any ball work but was able to put in some hard running as

from 20p bus travel for kids around dundee during school holidays","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA school holiday bus scheme that helps families with young kids to get out and about is to relaunch this week.Dundee City Council has teamed up with city bus operators to bring back the Holiday Hop scheme, offering a 20p fare for children when they travel with an adult fare payer or concession ticket holder.The local authority said the 20p scheme, which was launched last year, had led to “significant increases” in the number of bus journeys a day taken by young people compared with previous Easter, summer and October holidays.City development convener Lynne Short said: “It is difficult to overestimate the importance of this scheme to hard-pressed families across Dundee.“The difference that it can make between holidays spent in or near the house and the ability to get out and see the many places of interest we have in the city is significant to the lives of parents and their bairns.”The scheme is backed by Smarter Choices Smarter Places – a Scottish Government programme that advocates taking less car journeys – as well as operators Xplore Dundee, Stagecoach and Moffat \u0026amp Williamson, and spans the entire “ABC” Dundee bus zone.Running from Saturday until August 13 and again from October 6-21, the scheme will allow families to discover the city by bus.Up to three under-16s can get the bargain fare per paying adult – including those with season tickets and weekly passes.Ms Short added: “I’m really pleased that the bus operators have committed to the summer and October holidays and I hope that not only will it open up the city to some bairns who might not have got the chance before, it will also create a new generation of confident, self- reliant bus users.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b32069b78095-490x564.jpg ","title":"football is a labour of love for refreshed dundee united coach craig easton","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAnyone who’s come across him down the years will testify enthusiasm has never been an issue with new Dundee United reserve team manager Craig Easton.As far back as when he was part of the youth system he’s now spearheading, Craig’s huge appetite for the game was always apparent.Even he, though, admits a spell out of the game a couple of years back was a perfect reminder of just how good life in football is.It came when financial problems at Torquay United forced him into an unexpected move back to Scotland and left him searching for work.Not content to sit around waiting for his next job, Eastie ended up working in the building trade and admits it was one of the best moves he’s ever made.“I was in England for 12 years and I didn’t even think of coming back up to Scotland to be honest,” he said.“But in football you can’t plan what’s going to happen, especially as a player and then, when I was coaching, I found things could change as well.“I was with Torquay working with the U/19s and college kids. It was my first real job in coaching and their academy was doing well but the club got relegated to the Conference and couldn’t afford to run their academy.“It’s a big outlay and, unfortunately, it folded and jobs went with it. I would have loved to have stayed, it was a great job and I had an excellent lifestyle.“The job wasn’t there so I came back up the road and there wasn’t much happening. I applied for jobs and I got close to a couple.“I ended up doing a bit of labouring and it was great, it was the best thing for me. I kept myself busy.“I was taking down cabins, near St Andrews funnily enough, and then building. I’d never had any experience of it but enjoyed it. Every day was different and the guys were brilliant. A lot of good people – I still keep in touch.“I always appreciated what I had as a footballer but sometimes you need to go out of it and get back in just to be reminded what you have.“So getting out for a bit was good, it got my appetite back without me realising I’d lost it. And just doing something different, seeing another side of life, meant I learned a lot.”His return to football came at Raith where an excellent record with the youths sparked interest from others.Determined to repay the faith Raith showed in him, he rebuffed the chance of a quick move but when United came calling he admits his affection for the place where his career started made it an offer he couldn’t refuse.“I enjoyed Raith, there were good people, a good club and it was tough to leave but I couldn’t turn this job down.“This is a big responsibility because United have produced some great players over the years. There’s a lot of good players come through and a lot of good people looked after the kids here, so there’s a lot to live up to. I was lucky to work with a lot of those people.”In recent years, the conveyor belt of young talent at Tannadice has slowed but Craig’s confident, along with assistant Scott Robertson, talent will flow.That’s in no small part because the mechanism required to produce players is still in place.“We know how important it is to keep bringing players through at this football club and there is talent here.“There is so much that goes on before us to get it to the stage where we take the players. It’s not about us, it’s about everything that goes before that to get them to the point where Scott and I take them.“Brian Grant (academy head) is on top of that and making it better all the time. It’s about us then doing the extra wee bit to take them to the first team.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/06/image.jpg1_.732112.jpg ","title":"infant feeding cafe opens at ninewells to support breastfeeding","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn infant feeding cafe has been set up at Ninewells Hospital to raise awareness of National Breastfeeding Week.The cafe is held on Wednesday and Friday mornings in ward 38 and offers support to families.Mums, dads, babies, siblings and grandparents are invited to pop along for a chat and to meet other families before they are discharged from hospital.The cafe is also open to families whose baby is being cared for in hospital after the mother is discharged.Breastfeeding adviser Marianne White said: “The cafe has a mixture of antenatal and postnatal mums who are choosing to feed their babies via breast, bottle or expressing.“It provides an informal setting for families to ask questions and gain peer and professional support for infant feeding before they are discharged to the community.“We support all families and ensure that when they are discharged, they are happy and confident in their chosen method of feeding.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/07/image.jpg@1.633048.jpg ","title":"michelin dundee in call for more female engineers","story":"\t\t\t\t\tEmployees from Michelin Dundee marked International Women in Engineering Day by calling for more women to apply for roles in the engineering field and said a wide variety of careers are available.The firm has 15 female engineers employed in Dundee following the completion of apprenticeships at its training centre.Gill Bannister was Michelin Dundee’s first female apprentice in 1986, when she began a four-year apprenticeship as a maintenance fitter.Ms Bannister said: “I left school with no training but I thought engineering sounded interesting so I applied for a Michelin apprenticeship and against 800 other applicants I was successful.“It has worked out really well for me and I’m glad that I have my Michelin training behind me.“We don’t just train our technicians to work for Michelin, the apprenticeship covers a range of maintenance engineering subjects which are very useful in the wider world too.”Her colleague, Sarah King, has just completed an apprenticeship with Michelin. After concluding her training in May, she now works in a maintenance team supporting machinery across the factory.Sarah said: “I decided to go into an engineering apprenticeship because it is something I have always had an interest in.

It’s knowing that somebody has been in and among all your things,” he said.“I didn’t realise I had left the window unlatched before I went out that night.”Duncan believes the thief entered his flat from the pathway to the rear of the tenement block.“It was sometime between 10pm and 3am – they must have come in through the hopper window in my bedroom, which was open,” he added.“They’ve taken an iPad and a PS4 and some games – all at some point while I was out. I just went to the pub.“I didn’t even realise for five minutes that someone had been in until I went looking for a charger and realised it wasn’t there.“There’s no sign of forced entry or anything like that – I think they’ve just come in through that window.“But they would have had to have come in through the backies as well.“I think they might have seen the iPad lying on the bed through the window and that’s tempted them.“They had absolutely no business being in the backies though. They shouldn’t be round there.”Forensic officers visited the flat in Bellefield Avenue in the West End to look for fingerprints.Duncan said he had been reassured by the visiting officers that there were “standard procedures” for dealing with such thefts – and he hoped that locals would keep an eye open for his goods turning up.Thieves who make off with expensive electronics have been known to try to sell them to unsuspecting customers in pubs.“It felt like a pretty routine thing for the police. It was actually reassuring that they had a procedure for it,” Duncan added.“My parents’ house was broken into 20 years ago but I’ve had nothing similar since.“The police think they’ve got a complete fingerprint.

I said ‘if you can do it, sign’.“It’s a really good club – even if it’s the rival of my team! I’d prefer if he signed for Dundee but it’s still a good club.“United have got a good goalkeeper in him. He’s massive, really tall and his English is perfect so that won’t be a problem.“He’s good on the ball and can pass well. Even under pressure you can pass him the ball and he can deal with it, he’s calm and experienced. He’s dominant in the box, too, and comes for crosses.“At Vaduz there were two goalkeepers and they switched all the time but I really enjoyed playing when Benjamin was in goal.”Konrad is considering offers from Holland and Germany but says he’d be happy to return to Scotland.“I would go back to Scotland, I really enjoyed my two years there, though I’ve not had any options there. If there was a good offer I would go back.“A year ago at Vaduz we were relegated and weren’t able to go back up last campaign.“We had a poor start to the season with basically a new team. You could compare it to Dundee United’s season in the Championship. There was one team that had a good start and just kept winning.“It was nice in Vaduz, a good place to play. I can’t compare it to Scotland, though.“The fans in Dundee were mad for football and the stadiums were great. I don’t know if the fans in Vaduz and Switzerland don’t like football much but it isn’t the No 1 sport and it was really calm in the stadiums.”That’s something he couldn’t say about derby days in Dundee – some of his best memories of his time at Dens Park.“I had the two best years of my career at Dundee.“The derby win after 10 or 11 years and beating them at home was great.“The first game at Celtic Park was also a good memory. It is a really famous stadium, even in Germany.“All the derby wins were really good experiences and I feel really proud to have been a part of those games.“I like the rivalry in Dundee. It’s not a nasty rivalry compared with some places in Germany, there’s no fighting, but a lot of banter and people have a bit of a laugh about it.“I still keep an eye on Dundee.

obstructive parking.\"Inconsistent and obstructive parking is a nuisance in our communities and greatly impacts on our ability to easily get around by foot, and so it is critical we empower local authorities to tackle this important issue,\" he said.Today a coalition of disability and mobility organisations called on Highland Council to develop an Inverness Street Charter, setting out measures to improve accessibility.Produced by the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) in liaison with Autism Rights Group Highland, Guide Dogs Scotland and Highland Cycle Campaign among others their \"manifesto\" \u0026ndash Putting Inverness Streets Ahead \u0026ndash identifies pavement parking along with other issues such as street clutter and shared spaces for vehicles and pedestrians as restricting safe access.RNIB campaigns manager Catriona Burness said: \"For too many people our streets remain a daily obstacle course.\"We believe a Street Charter would help to enhance the quality of life for residents and, vitally, boost the reputation of Inverness as an open and welcoming tourist destination.\"Elsewhere, after wheelchair user David Sansum, from Kinmylies, branded the parking

claimed that in some instances, drivers were forced to park on pavements by the lack of any alternative.He said that it is often impossible to find a space and blamed Highland Council for not providing parking as part of new residential developments.Speaking about the situation in his own street he said: \"I may also add everyone parks on one side of the pavement, leaving the other side

National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) in collaboration with groups including Autism Rights Group Highland, Guide Dogs Scotland and the Highland Cycle Campaign.It sets out a range of barriers it says prevents Inverness being truly accessible to all, including too many bollards of different types and heights, unfenced cafe tables and chairs spilling into pavement areas and refuse bins on narrow pavements forcing pedestrians onto the road.The coalition want the council to adopt a Street Charter which would dictate conditions to be applied to any future planning or licensing applications.RNIB Scotland campaigns manager Dr Catriona Burness said: \"For too many people our streets remain a daily obstacle course.\"We believe a Street Charter would help to enhance the quality

buildings","story":"\u0026nbspURGENT action is needed to prevent people from being injured or killed by debris falling from crumbling Inverness buildings, according to a former city provost.Councillor Jimmy Gray spoke out in support of Labour colleague and MSP David Stewart who is pressing for a new law compelling property owners to safely maintain their properties.Mr Stewart is contacting Highland Council chiefs to discuss his idea of regular surveys to gauge wear and tear, and to make owners carry out essential repairs.His proposal comes just a week after two people narrowly avoided being struck by falling debris in the city centre as Storm Hector hit.Earlier this year an apprentice stonemason also prevented another potential disaster when he spotted a masonry block hanging loose over Academy Street, apparently pulled loose by a banner attached to it.This week the Inverness Townscape Heritage project launched a new maintenance guide for owners of traditional properties, setting out key areas for them to consider, including the benefits of regular inspections.However Cllr Gray suggested a far tougher approach may be necessary.\"We cannot wait until there are serious injuries or deaths before stronger action is taken,\" he said.\"I\u0026rsquove been concerned for some time about the condition of buildings not only in Inverness but across Highland.\"We\u0026rsquove spent years trying to persuade owners of buildings to act responsibly. It hasn\u0026rsquot worked. We need to bring about a cultural change whereby owners take greater care and pride in their properties.\"I believe this will need to be supported by legislation which makes it compulsory for buildings to be checked regularly.\"He suggested surveys every three years, adding: \"We\u0026rsquove spent years in and around Inverness trying to persuade the owners of buildings to act responsibly and it hasn\u0026rsquot worked.\"\u0026nbspHighlands and Islands MSP Mr Stewart was successful in having legislation revised four years ago to allow local authorities to recoup money they spend on serving notices or for work carried out if a building is deemed dangerous.In January, kiltmakers Duncan Chisholm and Sons in Castle Street was served with a dangerous buildings notice by Highland Council and the local authority appointed contractors to make the building safe. It will recover the costs later.In March it also ordered building owners with glazed canopies to check they had adequate inspection and maintenance arrangements in place.This followed incidents at both the Inverness and Inshes retail parks in 2017 and earlier this year where panels fell from their fixings, in one case resulting in a shopper having stitches to his head after being hit with broken glass.Mr Stewart said: \"Although councils can act if buildings are deemed dangerous and go on to recoup money from owners if they carry out work, there\u0027 more that can be done to bring in more preventative measures.\"Businesses are under severe pressure at the moment with rising city centre costs. But a crisis incident could not only injure people but affect their insurance and their reputation.\"A council spokeswoman said: \"We regularly remind building owners that the responsibility for ensuring the safety of members of the public in and around their buildings lies with them \u0026ndash whether commercial, retail, business, public or privately owned.\"The new maintenance guide can be downloaded at https://academystreet.org/Wednesday 27 Jun 2018 10:35 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116299.jpg","title":"Woman identified as man to get into hostel dorm","story":"\u0026nbspA WOMEN\u0026rsquoS rights group has expressed concerns for the safety of guests staying at a Highland hostel after one of its bloggers was able to book herself into a male-only dormitory.Inverness Youth Hostel in Victoria Drive allowed Trina Budge to stay in a men\u0027 room after she told a receptionist she self-identified as a man.She went on to write a blog post about her stay and said she is concerned women could be at risk as a result of people taking advantage of the self-determination policy.She said: \"There are huge concerns over safety.

Angola and Namibia during celebrations of boys becoming men.Children would be taken away from their communities by elders, and trained in practical, religious and spiritual practices for between three and six months in a process called Mukanda.Sisters Diana and Antoinette Powell-Cotton, from Kent, made a two-year trip to Angola and Namibia, recovering 3,000 pieces, 130 of which were donated to the university.After more than 70 years in storage, the suit and a number of other artefacts will now be on display as part of an exhibition on growing up around the world.Rachel Rydquist, a museum studies student at the university, said: “By the time the sisters came back, it was the middle of the Second World War, and they were drafted in to be nurses in London.“So there’s a bit of a lack of information about it, because they were tied up with the war.“I don’t believe that it’s been put on display.“There’s so much stuff in the university collection, and it might just not have been a fit for any of the exhibits that were being done.”She added: “It’s also really difficult to put something out when there’s not a lot of information on it.”Rachel had taken the lead on researching the suit before it was put on display in the exhibition.The new project, which opened earlier this month in the King’s Museum, is to commemorate the Scottish Government’s Year of Young People.The exhibit, called Growing up: Different Journeys, is split into four sections – rites of passage, which the net suit is a part of, education, disruption and stories.According to Rachel, the exhibit aims to explore not only how different cultures experience growing up, but also the universal nature of becoming an adult.She said: “We thought it would be fitting in the Year of Young People, and to have artefacts that show the process across the world.”The exhibit will be open in the King’s Museum until November 30.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"new stretch of aberdeen bypass

He is trying to raise awareness of the need for these two groups to be brought together.In his words: “It’s not that these people are not out there, they just don’t know who to get in touch with.”His running partner is Leona, who has Usher syndrome.Ben said: “I’d been a runner for 10 years and I was looking to do something to help others but that also fit into my lifestyle.“When I watched the London Marathon in 2017 I saw people guiding and thought it would be a good thing to get into. But when I tried googling information that’s when I realised there is a shortage of it in Scotland, which spurred me on to create the group.“I initially got in touch with North East Sensory Services (NESS), who paired me up with Leona.“She needed a new guide for last year’s Great Aberdeen Run half marathon.“She’s a really strong-willed individual and has done things like climbing Kilimanjaro.“Talking to her she said: ‘This is something we need in the north-east.’”Ben, through the Granite City Guide Running Facebook page and his sessions, is now trying to expose as many people as possible to what guide running entails and how to get started.However, because of Disclosure Scotland legislation designed to protect vulnerable groups, Ben can’t personally introduce prospective guides with sensory-impaired runners.He aims to do this by eventually becoming affiliated with, for example, Grampian Disability Sport.He said: “I’m a point of contact, to find out about guide running and how to get involved.“The long-term aim is to connect people who want to guide with people who need a guide.“At the moment the page is for advice, information and I put on classes (to demonstrate).“I can then put people in touch with NESS or Grampian Disability Sport (who can partner people up).”Ben wants bodies like Scottishathletics and Scottish Disability Sport to make it easier to partner guides and runners, and he’s building evidence to show there is real demand for it. He added: “One thing I am doing is keeping a record of the people who want to guide and the people who need a guide.“So I can go to Scottish Disability Sport and say: ‘you’ve got X amount of people in the north-east alone who want and need this’.“The Facebook page has 170 people who’ve shown an interest.“I’ve had close to 50 people contact me directly saying they want to be guide runners.“There’s been at least a dozen or so (sensory impaired) people who have said this is something they’d look for.”Ben’s next challenge is to get as many people as possible to join him and Leona in taking part in the Great Aberdeen Run. He’s even encouraging non-sensory-impaired pairs to try using a blindfold to understand the challenges a sensory impairment creates.For more information, visit Granite City Guide Running on Facebook.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 21","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 27/05/18, 5:12 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Many thanks to Robert Wakeham, writing in last week’s Advertiser, for his questions regarding the nesting colony and status of common gulls within the former oil depot, currently the Mid Argyll hub and museum construction site.I am happy to address these questions.Historically, this species was first named in the 1700s and thought by many to come from their association with grazing or ‘common land’ and in the more recent past the name ‘uncommon gull’ may be more apt.In the UK they are essentially restricted as a breeding species to Scotland where numbers continue to decline, with this being reflected in Argyll, principally due to predation by the American mink, as pointed out.Studies at the Lingerton landfill site have shown that, unlike the larger gull species at the tip, Common Gulls do not scavenge there, as was perhaps claimed, but use the tidal mud flats of Loch Gilp and surrounding fields to find invertebrates, fish and vegetarian foodstuffs. As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer. This can be anything from yoga, walking in the sunshine (I walk everywhere) or taking your favourite class at the gym.While you’re getting fitter and feeling healthier, you’ll be raising money to fund the highest quality research and essential information and support services that will save lives from bowel cancer.Take on the challenge and sign up at bowelcanceruk.org.uk/stepupfor30.Gaby Roslin, TV and radio presenterPICS:The common gull has been seen nesting at the disused oil depot. no_a21Gleanergull01Gulls at the former Gleaner site. no_a21Gleanergull02\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 1 2018","story":"\t\tHannah O\u0027HanlonUpdated: 30/05/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThere are certain moments that just simply enchant us.One such moment happened this week when we were holidaying in Dunkeld.Almost every day we visited the wildlife centre at the Loch of the Lowes and delighted in our times watching the osprey.From the webcam we could see every detail.We watched with great anticipation to see when the chicks would emerge from their eggs, of which there were three.One of the days we went to the centre there was great excitement as one of the eggs was about to hatch.The staff there are dedicated volunteers who love sharing their knowledge of these wonderful birds.To our total delight we witnessed the birth first-hand as the shell cracked open and out struggled a tiny little chick as the mother bird looked on anxiously.I could hardly believe that this tiny scrap of life would be strong enough to fly to Africa in just a few months.Shortly, the father bird arrived with a very large fish and I was amazed at the tenderness of this great strong bird as he gently fed his baby.Since then we have been \u0026#8216hooked\u0026#8217 as we follow this wee family at the beginning of their journey of life.Soon the chicks will be given flying and fishing lessons and will leave the safety of the nest.My prayer is that they will all safely complete their long journey to Africa and that they will come back next year to enchant people once again.When they go, sometime in September, I fear that I will suffer from \u0026#8217empty nest syndrome\u0026#8217 till they come back again next spring.Scripture tells us: \u0026#8216Seek information from the birds of the air.\u0026#8217\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 22","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 31/05/18, 11:50 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.CalMac management’s shocking handling of our ferry service is taking its toll on local businesses which depend on Islay’s growing tourist trade.We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.Also, I have been unimpressed with our roads department management’s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from residents and myself about the potholes across Islay.Councillor Alastair Redman, IslaySir,I\u0026#8217m inviting your readers to get their walking boots or trainers on for the Stroke Association and sign up to the summer marathon challenge, Walk Your Way.In April 2013, a year after my own stroke, I took on​ the London Marathon. It was a huge step in my recovery and helped to draw attention to this devastating condition while raising money for a wonderful charity that I\u0026#8217m proud to be an ambassador for.Walk Your Way takes place between 17 June and 1 July to raise money to support stroke survivors and their families.  You can walk the whole 26.2 miles in one go, do it over a few days or spread the distance over the two-week period and get sponsored to do it. It’s your chance to take on the distance of a marathon on your own terms.For many stroke survivors like me, getting your life back means overcoming life-changing disabilities and emotional difficulties.

After a pit stop in the Royal Burgh it was on to Fort William, then Inverness and back home again- all to raise money for Cancer Research UK and Target Ovarian Cancer.Spokesperson for Breast Way Round, Laura White, said: ‘This year was full of fun, laughter, meeting new family members and although the daily miles are hard going, the weather and the beauty of the Scottish scenery made it that little bit easier.’As well as the sponsored trek, the bikers raised money in more traditional ways, such as bucket shaking (the men wearing bras) and hosting a raffle and auction in Caol Community Centre. The most coveted item, a patchwork quilt made by rider Cathy Anderson, went for a whopping £700.The annual trip was started in 2008 by Shirley-Ann McKnight as a last tour of Scotland for fellow biker and close friend, Alyson Porter, who was suffering from cancer. Sadly, Alyson never made it to her trip and now each year the journey is retraced in celebration of her life and all those affected by cancer.Since 2008, more than 600 riders have participated, each clad with a pink mohawk courtesy of Hairy-RS, and the team has raised £347,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.

The pair were seeded car 30 in the two wheel drive section, run first on the day in a new schedule being piloted by the rally, the two wheel drive cars covering the stages before the four wheel drive cars followed in the afternoon.With the dry conditions in the weeks running up to the event dust would be the main problem for those running further down the field. Douglas attacked the first stage, Twiglees, and was catching the car in front when, unfortunately due to the dust being created by that car, came out of a 90 degree corner with zero visibility and connected heavily with a rock, damaging the suspension and forcing his early retirement.The car, and the driver, are noticeably quicker  each event they compete in and it\u0026#8217s only a matter of time before the results are there.The other Argyll car out on the stages was Ally Currie from Mull and Grant McNiven in the Ford Fiesta ST picking up 9th overall and 1st in Class 6.The next round of the Scottish Championship is Argyll Rally, based in Dunoon on June 23 \u0026#8211 the closest round for most Argyll rally enthusiasts and one not to be missed. The stages look absolutely breathtaking this year and well worth a watch.The Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship continues as well with round three being the Granite at Leuchars Stages hosted by Aberdeen and District Motor Club at the MOD base in Leuchars, Fife.Argyll was well represented both in the drivers seat and the co-drivers. All Argyll crew Willie and Steven Beattie were out in the newly finished and beautifully finished Escort MkII. They were absolutely flying and really getting to grips with the car when a sixth gear lock-up threw them into a spin and off the stage, clouting a fairly substantial fence post in the process.The navigators side now looks decidedly second hand, but nothing a few hours in the workshop won\u0026#8217t sort. A bent bottom suspension arm put paid to them re-joining but they will take the positives and the blistering pace into the next round for sure.Willie Beattie Snr in his equally exquisite Escort was also beginning to get the hang of the car, with some more seat time this year, not to mention experienced co-driver, Phil Sandham, pushing him on. He, after making sure his boys were okay when they didn\u0026#8217t show up at service after their spin, continued on to secure 12th overall and second in class: his first honours since building the car.The next round may see some family ties severely stretched, at least until the final results are announced.Ian Parker was also out in familiar machinery, co-driving for Fraser Smith in his Canal Garage-prepared Honda Civic. The pair were also making good progress up the class rankings until the diff decided to implode and finished their rally on Stage six.The drive of the day was not in question. Alan Kirkaldy led from start to finish despite some interesting issues in the first test. His door came loose after about a third of stage and he continued, holding the door shut by the open window whilst steering, changing gear and waving with the other.Astonishingly he still managed quickest stage time by five seconds. His co-driver for the day could forgive himself for being a little green about the gills after that.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was lucky enough to win the seat in a charity auction at the Annual STRC Dinner earlier in the year. An experience he is unlikely to forget in a hurry, although some of the memories may be a little bit blurry and perhaps just a little sideways. The top three were rounded out by Ian Forgan, ably guided round in his Subaru by his daughter in her first rally and the final position on the podium went to Ian and Allan Paterson, also in a Subaru.The next round is this weekend at Crail where the Beattie boys will be back out, Ian Parker swaps a Civic for an Escort MKII and Donald Bowness is set to get back out in the Nova.PICS:Photos: Gavin Brown, West Coast PhotosRed Escort (Car 1) Alan Kirkaldy/Eoghan Anderson (first overall) no_a24rally01\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"high tech preparation for mid argyll art show","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 14/06/18, 7:45 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThis year has seen a lot of preparatory work ahead of the 2018 Mid Argyll Art Society exhibition in August.The popular show will again be held in the Drill Hall, Lochgilphead and will run from August 6-11.As in the last few years, the Mid Argyll Camera Club will have photos on display.The society is harnessing modern technology in a campaign to raise the profile of this year\u0026#8217s event.There is now a Mid Argyll Art Society Facebook page that can be used to get updates on what is happening.There will shortly be a website giving details about the art society, its history, information on the exhibition and how to participate, and photos of past exhibits to give a flavour of what the event is like.A lot of work has been done on modernising the entry process. There will be the option of pre-registration for exhibits the automatic production of labelling for the paintings and photos instant printing of receipts and immediate production of a list of entries to guide visitors.As in past years, people who come to view the exhibition will have free entry, with the option of making a suitable donation to the funds of the society. There is also a small fee to be paid by each exhibitor for every painting or photo that is hung, and this goes to help to cover running expenses.With over 500 people having visited the exhibition in 2017, organisers hope this excellent support from the community will continue. Both professional and amateur artists in the area are encouraged to make use of the exhibition to display their work.The overriding aim of the exhibition, since its beginning in 1967, has always been to foster interest in locally-produced art and to give people from the community the opportunity to let others see, appreciate, and maybe buy their works.Organisers wish to thank the Army Cadet Force for permission to use their building.Details about how to enter exhibits will appear in adverts in the Argyllshire Advertiser, Facebook and on the exhibition website.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One.

He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a poignant prizegiving for tarbert afc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/06/18, 6:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert AFC’s annual football dance was held on Saturday June 16 in the Islay Frigate Hotel.Players and their partners were joined by the wider circle of people who are involved with the club.This annual dinner dance is also the end of season awards presentation.Nikki MacDougall took home awards for Top Goal Scorer and Referees\u0026#8217 Player of the Year.

This is the same distance Mark averaged every day during his epic cycle round the world in 80 days last year.In other words the team of 80 intrepid cyclists will pedal the equivalent of Mark’s incredible feat – taking them around the world in a day.Participants are asked to raise a minimum of £240 each for the STV Children’s Appeal, which supports children and young people affected by poverty in Scotland, with the hope of raising as much as £80,000 for the charity.Mark said: \u0026#8216This stunning route from Argyll to Aberdeen was my last 16-hour training ride before I set out on the world challenge and it holds fond memories \u0026#8211 but it is very long and very hilly, so I’ll be impressed by everyone who signs up for this epic day of endurance.\u0026#8216The STV Children’s Appeal has gone from strength from strength, supporting so many brilliant charities and causes across Scotland. The last time I crossed Scotland for the appeal I was swimming and running, so cycling has to be easier… right?\u0026#8217He added: \u0026#8216Thanks to everyone who gets involved and I look forward to riding with you.\u0026#8217Mari Slavin of the STV Children’s Appeal said: \u0026#8216Mark is a fantastic ambassador for the Appeal and we are all in awe of the gigantic challenge he’s about to take on, together with cyclists from across the country.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

It is the latest diversification at Corton Farm, just outside Ayr. Customers can buy a litre glass bottle for \u0026pound2 and use it again and again at the milk machine. And farmer Alison Kerr said: “You cannot get any fresher. “We’re really hoping it catches on so we can sell more and more directly to local people.” The Kerrs – five generations at Corton since 1925 – have constructed The Milk Hoose and the Milkbot vending machines providing “untampered, non-homogenised” milk from the Corton herd.  Customers on Friday gushed praise on the creamy taste, saying it is nothing like mass-produced products. The Kerrs are charging \u0026pound1.50 per litre and say it cuts out plastic waste from supermarket bottles. Although it is more expensive than supermarket pricing, they say their milk compares favourably to speciality gold top products. Willie and Alison, both 46, have been joined working the farm by son David,19, and are being helped by daughter Joanne,16, when she is not at Belmont Academy. Willie said: “It would be a dream to sell every litre we produce right here. “But we have had a great start and it has been so well received.” The farm produces between 5000 and 6000 litres of milk a day, depending on the time of year.  That is courtesy of the 220 Friesian-Holstein milkers. The Kerrs own 260 acres and rent another 250. Fourteen years ago they expanded into the Corton Plants nursery and 14 months ago the Coo Shed coffee shop. But Alison said: “The Milkbot really completes the story of selling your own product. “We siphon off what we need into churns to be pasteurised and it is put into the Milkbot. “I guarantee it tastes completely different as all the fats and proteins have not been stripped out. “It is non-homogenised and the cream settles on top like the the old-fashioned milk.” At the moment it is thought only three farms in Scotland are selling direct via a vending machine.  Alison added: “People now are so detached from where the food comes from and I think supermarkets are to blame for that. “Some kids think milk comes from a bottle in a supermarket. “Plastic has just become a huge issue and it has been good timing for us. “People are loving our branded glass bottles.” Peak time for the new vended milk is between 5pm and 7pm and there can be 20 cars in the car park at a time with people leaving work keen to top up their supply. Alison added: “Hopefully this continues to grow. Milk is sold too cheaply in supermarkets and farmers have been down-trodden for a long time. “We have just had to take what we can get and be paid sub-30p a litre. At the moment the Milkbot is doing a couple of hundred litres a day so we have a long way to go to reach 5000 a day.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"girl 4 stuck playpark equipment","story":"NewsGirl, 4, gets stuck in playpark equipment and needs fire brigade to rescue herPetrified Lily-Mags Rodman ended up wedging her wee leg in a metal car in Belleisle near Ayr.\u0026nbspShareBySarah Hilley16:44, 20 JUN 2018Updated19:45, 20 JUN 2018NewsLittle Lily-Mags had her leg stuck in the toy car for 40 minutes\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA four-year-old girl got stuck in playpark equipment for 40 minutes as firefighters struggled to get access to her. Petrified Lily-Mags Rodman ended up wedging her wee leg in a metal car in Belleisle. Her father David and other parents were unable to free her, sparking an emergency services rescue. But crews faced a major delay as access to the park through the main entrance was blocked off due to fencing at the Belleisle Hotel. The crew had to abandon their fire engine some distance away and run across the grass to reach Lily-Mags. After assessing the situation, they were forced to backtrack their appliance through the main exit and find another way in.  Mum Clare said: “Luckily my daughter wasn’t badly hurt, but if it was a life-or-death situation and a child had fallen from equipment it may have been too late.” Clare, who was working from home outside Ayr, rushed to the park after her husband phoned. Clare, 33, said: “I drove in a panic. “Her leg was wedged in the car at a funny angle. “I could hear her screaming over the phone. My husband and others tried to get her out but it hurt so they called the fire brigade.” Firefighters calmly cut off the side of the car to free the tot.  She emerged unscathed but with bad pins and needles during the incident a week past last Wednesday. Now Clare and Lily-Mag’s gran Anita O’Connor are calling for an emergency services route to the wooded park. Clare said: “The fire service were really fantastic but it took them 10 minutes to figure out how to get the fire engine in.” Anita said: “She was stuck for well over 40 minutes as the fire engine couldn’t find a route through to the park because of the fencing. “Fortunately she has not sustained any injuries, but she is extremely traumatised. “This issue regarding access needs to be addressed ASAP and not sat on for days until the council have their next meeting.”  Belleisle Hotel owner Campbell Inns erected more fencing on June 6, which has blocked off access to the playpark through the main driveway. The alternative entrance is now through Greenfield Avenue. Anita said emergency services should have been notified of the issue. A council spokesman said: Due to layout changes affecting the main access road at Belleisle, emergency services had to enter via an alternate route. “We are contacting the emergency services to advise them to use the alternative entrance for the time being.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"pair young lads saved squirrel","story":"NewsPair of young lads saved squirrel that was lying in agonyNow the caring boys - Max Bryson and Ben Edwards - have been praised for their caring capers.\u0026nbspShareByStephen Houston10:10, 21 JUN 2018NewsMax Bryson, left and Ben Edwards (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA squirrel lay in agony after plunging from a tree in a park ... only to be protected and saved by two young lads. Now the caring boys - Max Bryson and Ben Edwards - have been praised for their caring capers. And Ben’s dad James said: “I am immensely proud of them both. “Too often people these days would just walk past and, although concerned, would not intervene. “Ben and Max got stuck in and worked out a rescue plan.” The 12-year-olds, who have just started second year at Kyle Academy, had been out cycling in Rozelle Park last Tuesday.  They came across the bashed-up critter at the side of the duck pond and sprang into action. Onlooker Lorna Barclay said the boys deserve recognition. She said: “The squirrel was obviously hurt and fretting on the path. “We approached to see if we could help but were pleasantly surprised they had the situation under control.” They had already called the SSPCA and protected the frightened furry animal from dogs. When the charity said they’d be an hour the boys went home and got a strong bag filled with straw - leaving Lorna on guard.  And Max’s mum Liz and dad Douglas, who own the Inverlea Guest House in Ayr, said: “He loves animals so wanted to help. “I am so happy both boys decided to intervene. “They did it all on their own and I knew nothing about it. “What the lady said about the boys was amazing.” The lads returned to the squirrel within 15 minutes with their custom-made bed all ready for the SSPCA inspector. Lorna added: “It was lovely to see how concerned and compassionate the boys as well as using their problem- solving skills.  “Many other people would have walked on by without any interest in helping.” Ben already has a busy household with dad James, mum Sarah, sisters Lizzie and Emily, two cats, a tortoise and a fish. Scottish SPCA Chief Superintendent Mike Flynn said: “At this time of year we receive a lot of calls about people concerned about wildlife. “We all have a responsibility to look after and care for the wildlife in Scotland and these two boys went above and beyond on this occasion to help this poor squirrel. “They should be very proud.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12713526.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_070618ecrepont_10JPG.jpg","title":"talented youngster finn ecrepont walking","story":"NewsTalented youngster Finn Ecrepont is walking on AyrDubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:00, 18 JUN 2018NewsAyr United\u0027s Finn Ecrepont (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMost success stories in football start with a rejection somewhere along the line. And 15-year-old Ayr United starlet Finn Ecrepont is no different. Dubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football. The Kilmarnock school has dedicated facilities for bright talents in the footballing world. And after leaving Alloway Primary, Ecrepont’s aim was to join the set-up at the Grange - but he was told he wasn’t good enough at his trial for the performance school. But the left-back, who also went to Glenburn Primary, refused to give up on his dream. Ecrepont, who has played with Ayr United since he was nine, said: “Getting that knock back is key to where I am today, because that has made me realise it’s not as easy as just walking into a team. “I didn’t get through the first trial so that made me focus and I knew I had to work hard. “I guess there was choices to make and sacrifices to make, but I was willing to make these changes for my football.  “I had training at Ayr the night after I got my knock back so I went to ask my coach Ross Armour for advice, so that’s when the work began. “I went away and worked on my game and a year later I got into the performance school at the Grange, which is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.” Ecrepont worked his way up through the ranks at Ayr and has now signed a three year deal with the first team. Just last season he was training with the under 17s, but his progress has been off the scale and he is now training with the senior side. He has been getting day release from school on a Thursday to train with the first team, but after signing his new deal he will train four mornings a week with Ian McCall’s side. And despite most schools refusing to take him in due to his football commitments, Ayr Academy were good enough to take him in. And dad Eddy, who runs Cafe Ginger in Ayr, claims teachers from Ayr Academy have offered to work overtime to help Ecrepont through his studies. Ecrepont is delighted to get his chance so early with Ayr.  He said: “The coaches thought I was playing well so I got more of a chance through my training and playing more with the under 20s last season. “I just love being in and around the first team, and the boys have been great with me so I am happy to be where I’m at at the moment. “Everyone at the club has been brilliant with me, through all the age groups. All the senior players and coaches have been really accepting of me and I couldn’t have asked for anything more. “Ian McCall and all of the other coaches are great because they always give me feedback. “Whether it’s positive or negative they are always keeping me right. That has been key to my progression. “If I was to ask anyone a question at Ayr they would answer it no problem, and that’s exactly what I look for and it’s why I’m here.” Despite the gruelling schedule of being a footballer, Ecrepont claims he is still fully focused on his school work.  He said: “Adapting to be a footballer hasn’t been much different as I enjoy it and it’s more like a hobby. I play football for fun and that’s what’s most important to me, so I guess it’s just normal. “It can take a lot out of me, but again because I enjoy football so much I don’t really realise how much I am doing. “I don’t think it’s had an effect on my school and I think it’s going good. Hopefully I have done well in my exams which I’ll find out in August. “I’ll get a Wednesday off from training so I can hopefully work towards getting my highers. “This year I’m studying higher English and PE, next year I’ll do something like Chemistry and Biology. And despite his age, Ecrepont has already been involved in a number of big games. He scored for Scotland under 16s against England, but for Ayr under 20s he was involved in a league decider last season against Morton. He said: “Unfortunately we lost the game 1-0 from a penalty, but I played the full game and it was a great experience and the boys played really well.  “There was quite a few Ayr United fans there so they gave us a great support.” But Ecrepont refuses to forget where he came from, he is sure to consistently help his dad Eddy in Cafe Ginger. Ecrepont said: “I signed for Ayr on the Tuesday, I was washing dishes for my dad on the Friday and on the Monday I was training with Scotland. “I work with my dad at the cafe which has been key to keeping me grounded. I know for a fact he wouldn’t let me get big-headed so I couldn’t thank him enough for that. “I’ve been asked before where I see myself in five years, but the honest answer is I don’t know. “For all I know I could get injured tomorrow and break my leg. “I have been told many times that I haven’t made it, and I know that. “My hard work starts now, so I just need to take everything as it comes and take each day on its own.” "},{"url":null,"title":"selkirk-common-riding-2018-when-faced-with-adversity-peters-your-man","story":"WHEN faced with adversity, there\u0027s only one man to call - Royal Burgh Standard Bearer Peter Forrest.\nOn Friday morning the 26-year-old joiner led his town with both authority and calmness as Souters celebrated and honoured their historic traditions.\nYet the countdown couldn\u0027t have been more nerve-racking or distracting.\nDelays in Selkirk town centre renovations meant a reshuffle of vantage points for the iconic Casting of the Colours ceremony.\nAnd on the eve of the Common Riding itself, Storm Hector rampaged through the Royal Burgh tearing down bunting and leaving a trail of destruction and debris.\nIf the build-up wasn\u0027t distracting enough, a thoughtless thug spent the Nicht Afore the Morn spray-painting graffiti on landmarks including the War Memorial.\nBut just a few hours later the 2018 Standard Bearer remained the picture of calm as the sun gently rose on Friday morning.\nThe weather had relented, the debris had been cleared, the bunting had been restrung, and the vandalism was covered.\nAnd as Souters frae a\u0027 the airts linked arms and belted out the songs they\u0027d learned as children, all the woes were soon forgotten.\nSelkirk shone as it always does on Common Riding morning.\nAfter returning the Burgh Flag, Standard Bearer Forrest told us: \"I have been calm all week and even managed to get a good three hours\u0027 sleep last night.\n\"I\u0027m not sure how I manage it, but I don\u0027t get nervous at all, and despite everything that has happened, for me the Common Riding couldn\u0027t have gone any better.\n\"I\u0027ve loved the build up and I have loved every second of being Standard Bearer - I don\u0027t think the smile has left my face since the minute I got up this morning.\"\nWhether it was the four years he served as an Attendant - behind James Cheyne in 2009, Douglas Gunn in 2010, Gavin Henderson in 2012 and Kieran Riddle in 2017 - that equipped Peter for taking his duties in his stride, we\u0027ll never know.\nBut his composure and welcoming smile wasn\u0027t lost on any of the dignitaries around him.\nHonorary Provost Jake Wheelans said: \"After all the bad weather and everything else it was great to have Peter as our Standard Bearer.\n\"He was impeccable in every part of his duties today, and he upheld all of our traditions as a Standard Bearer should.\n\"Selkirk has enjoyed a tremendous Common Riding with a fantastic Standard Bearer.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"keep-calm-its-only-the-common-riding","story":"THE calming influence of Standard Bearer Peter Forrest made sure Selkirk Common Riding ran like clockwork on Friday.\nJust hours after Storm Hector had ripped through the region, Souters awoke to a serene and surprisingly relaxed morning.\nAnd about to head their day-long celebrations was to be the most relaxed of them all - Standard Bearer Forrest.\nThe Flute Band\u0027s Rouse Parade set the tone for a day few will forget.\nHundreds gathered at the War Memorial to honour the brave sons of Selkirk who didn\u0027t come home.\nAnd as the First Drum was sounded at 6am in the Market Place, the hundreds who do come home year after year from far off lands burst into song.\nHer Bright Smile has rarely sounded so good.\nThe build-up had well and truly begun.\nAnd by the time Standard Bearer Forrest was officially installed by Lady Busser, Dylis Wheelans, on the balcony of the Victoria Hall the hundreds had grown to thousands.\nA total of 281 riders followed the 2018 Standard Bearer doon the Green, across the Ettrick and up the Linglie.\nEveryone one of them was safe oot and every one of them returned safe in, some two-and-a-half hours later.\nOfficial reports later confirmed only three minor falls occurred throughout the entire procession.\nAs Standard Bearer Forrest, duly assisted by his Attendants Craig Monks, Robbie Reilly, Thomas Willmott and Liam Cassidy, led the cavalcade beyond Tibbie\u0027s towards the Three Brethren, beneath in the ancient streets of Selkirk the Hammermen, the Weavers, the Fleshers, the Colonials, the Merchants and the Ex-Soldiers began to muster ahead of their march to the Toll.\nAll the pomp and ceremony, headed by the trusty Silver and Pipe bands, brings out the best in this small rural burgh.\nIt\u0027s a place where pride and passion go hand in hand with smiles and laughter.\nSongs are sung, friendships rekindled and customs observed as the crowds patiently await the Coming in of the Burley.\nAnd they didn\u0027t have to wait long at Selkirk\u0027s northern most entrance as Standard Bearer Forrest, aboard the grey-dappled Lizzie, arrived to a cacophony of cheers and shouts of encouragement.\nProud parents, Ann and Rob, as well as girlfriend, Emma Pearce, were the first to offer him their congratulations as a well-deserved breather is taken at The Toll.\nAnd, in time-honoured fashion, his mounted followers made their own spectacular galloping return to the auld toon.\nJoyce Wright, representing the Ladies section of the Rig Committee, presented the traditional riding crop to Standard Bearer Forrest before he remounted to conclude his duties.\nAnd what a conclusion it is.\nThe Casting of the Colours pays homage to the heroic Fletcher, who returned from Flodden with a captured English banner and defiantly cast it around his head before dying.\nTo Up wi\u0027 the Souters Standard Bearer Forrest brought his ceremonial duties to an end with an impeccable cast.\nReflecting on his day, Peter told us: \"Being Standard Bearer was everything I knew it would be and more.\n\"I enjoyed the Marches - really enjoyed it - and my horse Lizzie was great.\n\"You think it can\u0027t get any better then it does. Coming in at The Toll was unbelievable and the Casting was something that will live with me forever.\n\"It has been a truly amazing day and I\u0027d like to thank everyone who came out and supported me.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"casting-their-places-in-history","story":"SELKIRK Common Riding is undoubtedly a festival steeped in tradition and commemoration.\nBut it is also a day of contrasts for the followers as well as the ones lucky enough to take part.\nFrom the high-adrenaline riders returning at the Toll, the ecstasy and elation is quietly absorbed by reflection and respect as the colourful procession heads into town.\nBeneath silver skies the rearranged scarlet plinth within the Market Place awaited not only Royal Burgh Standard Bearer Peter Forrest, but the six accompanying Standard Bearers selected by the town\u0026rsquos ancient Societies and Associations.\nTo the growing thrum of expectation, as the hidden clock ticked past eleven, all seven gathered beneath the steps to await a brief minute or two that will live with them forever.\nSince the tragic cast of a blood-soaked English banner more than 500 years ago, this re-enactment both commemorates and celebrates, defiance and pride in equal measure.\nAnd as the Silver Band leads the way with Up wi\u0026rsquo the Souters, each Standard Bearer in turn re-enacts and relives this defiant and proud act.\nStandard Bearer Forrest, as he had been all morning, was assured and relaxed as he turned the Royal Burgh Standard above his head.\nIt was as deserved a cheer as any Standard Bearer has received as he smiled, waved and made his way from the gaze of five-thousand eyes.\nCollege lecturer Mark Easson \u0026ndash a painter by trade \u0026ndash resumed where Standard Bearer Forrest had left off. Armed with the Incorporation of Hammermen Banner, the 49-year-old showed a steady hand and perfect timing to provide an impeccable cast.\nHis smile was as deserved as the loud cheer that followed him down the steps.\nFletcher himself was a weaver before that bloody battle in 1513, and Michael Pepper made sure the fabric of the historic Corporation continued unblemished for another year.\nThe 27-year-old textiles worker may have looked a little nervous but as his cast continued his smile grew. Again, the appreciation was richly deserved.\nFormer farmer Jackie Johnston brought experience with him as he provided a perfect cast of the Incorporation of Fleshers Flag.\nIf there were nerves, they didn\u0026rsquot show as the self-employed excavator took it all in his stride, even managing a thumbs-up to the conductor of the Silver Band before dismounting.\nWhile the other Standard Bearers have enjoyed several weeks\u0026rsquo of practice under the guiding gaze of those who have gone before them, Colonial Standard Bearer Alisdair Piercy has been using two broom-handles taped together with an old Scotland flag in his garage in Toronto.\nBut casting the colours is in his blood - the 39-year-old was following in the footsteps of his father, Drew, and grandfather, Archie, by casting the colours.\nAnd the 2018 Colonial Standard Bearer was perfect in every way as he cast the striking yellow banner above his head.\nFollowing the ceremony Alisdair revealed: \u0026ldquoI watched the casting so many times when I was a boy growing up in Selkirk.\n\u0026ldquoBeing up there was amazing \u0026ndash I was ready to start but when that drum sounds it hits you right in the heart.\n\u0026ldquoI was trying not to listen to the band and keep counting in my head, like I\u0026rsquod been told, and I think it worked.\nThe wave and grin from Alisdair were deserved as he savoured every moment on the scarlet plinth.\nOne Standard Bearer who is more familiar with the new-look Market Place than most is architect Stuart Davidson.\nThe 37-year-old dad-of-three has been heavily involved in the ongoing redesign of the town centre.\nStuart was a picture of concentration throughout most of his faultless cast, only allowing himself a huge smile of relief during the final bars of Up wi\u0026rsquo the Souters.\nArguably the most poignant of all is saved for last.\nFormer KOSB Martin Young brought with him all the military discipline and reliability you would expect as he carried the Ex-Soldiers\u0026rsquo Association Flag onto the scarlet plinth.\nThe father of two, who is a now a traffic policeman, provided another faultless cast with the Union banner before leading this close-knit community in two minutes of silence and reflection.\nWith the centenary fast approaching of the end of the Great War, the sacrifice made by so many is being brought even clearer into focus.\nThat defiance of tyranny and pride in one\u0026rsquos own beliefs and customs, shown by Fletcher, has carried on in Souters down the centuries as decade after decade they have made the ultimate sacrifice.\nThose two minutes of impeccable silence and reflection were only broken by the haunting strains of The Liltin.\nAnd for yet another year, Souters can return home safe in the knowledge that the past won\u0026rsquot be forgotten and the future is one of hope.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"new-route-planned-for-tonights-melrosians-rideout","story":"FOLLOWERS of Melrosian

InChorus subsequently performed with Dougie at the Amber Festival in Perth.\nThe trip to New York was hugely memorable with the choir singing on the Red Steps in Times Square, at the annual NYPD concert, at various September Concerts in the city, and, most poignantly, at the British Memorial Garden to the relatives of the British people who had died on 9/11.\nMoira Pearson, who is one of the founding members and choir manager from 2009 to 2012, told us: \" When the advert for a New Peebles Choir was placed in the Peeblesshire News in September 2008 no-one could have imagined just how important InChorus would become to so many people.\n\"It was a great privilege to be the choir manager for three years, during which time we travelled to New York to support and sing at commemorative events for the 10th Anniversary of 9/11.\n\"The fundraising effort to enable the journey was immense but made much easier by the unstinting support of the Peebles community.\"\nAlthough the 9/11 concert will remain a highlight of the InChorus story, the successes and landmark achievements continued after they came home.\nThe next year, 2012, saw the choir performing to another full house at the Festival Theatre, this time raising funds for other charities which is what InChorus likes to do.\nThe following year they embarked upon their \u0026lsquoChoirathon\u0026rsquo in aid of Comic Relief, when they sang from 9.30am to 9.30pm in the sleet, but raised \u0026pound3,500 in the process.\nIn 2013 they also had their first foray to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in what was to be come a biennial venture, winning the covered sell-out laurels in 2013, 2015 and 2017.\nIn 2014 the choir decided to try its hand at competition winning themselves a \u0026lsquoChoir of the Day\u0026rsquo award at the Scottish auditions of Choir of the Year, proving that even a very large choir can be sufficiently disciplined in all the nuances of choral singing to make a good impression.\nOver the years InChorus members discovered they rather liked performing at music festivals and have sung at T in the Park, Meadows Festival, Fringe by the Sea at North Berwick, Big Burns Supper in Dumfries, Eden Festival, Lindisfarne, and last year on the main stage between Texas and the Manic Street Preachers, at the BBC Children in Need\u0026rsquos Carfest in front of an audience of 20,000 people. How do they top that?\nThey also love weddings and travelled to Dublin in 2016 to sing at the wedding of a choir member\u0026rsquos son. While there, they performed on the bandstand in St Stephen\u0026rsquos Green and at the famous Cobblestone pub, as well as appearing as a flash mob all over the city.\nAly Skidmore, herself a long serving choir member, took over as Musical Director in 2014. Aly was responsible for the huge flash mob \u0026lsquoDancing in the Street\u0026rsquo event last year, involving the whole community.\nShe told us: \"Whilst singing is at the heart of everything that InChorus has achieved over the last 10 years, it\u0026rsquos never been only that.\n\"Through this organisation we have seen people\u0026rsquos friendships, confidence, skills, self-esteem and both emotional and physical health all flourish and grow over the years.\n\"In return the members give their time freely and generously to learn, rehearse and perform music for the benefit of others.\n\"In its time InChorus has achieved and given so much more than any of us really ever anticipated at the outset and I think every member feels so proud about that.\nIt\u0026rsquos amazing what a community can achieve when they group together, take a collective breath and burst into song.\"\nThey say that into every life a little rain must fall, and InChorus has not escaped, losing three much loved ladies to cancer.\nIn 2016 it was founder members Kitty Lyle and Celia Hayton and, just a few weeks ago, Bernice Brown - all are missed greatly.\nThroughout its 10 years the choir has raised over \u0026pound60,000 for other charities, both through its own concerts and through specific charity events.\nThis is something that is at the core of InChorus, something of which they are proud, and something which will continue in the years to come.\nAt one charity dinner they even put up an InChorus performance as an auction prize and were \u0026lsquosold\u0026rsquo for over \u0026pound1100. This, in turn, led to a performance at a very prestigious charity dinner in aid of breast cancer.\nTo celebrate its 10th birthday, the choir will be travelling to Barcelona in October for a long weekend of performances.\nBut before that they have a bit of a party planned in Peebles.\nOn September 1, the actual birthday weekend, they have organised their \u0026lsquoTen out of Ten\u0026rsquo day - when they will sing throughout the day from a list of at least ten different favourite songs, at ten different locations in Peebles.\nAlthough the earlier locations have yet to be revealed the finale will take place at the Eastgate Theatre, where it all started ten years ago, for an evening concert.\nThis will also be the final event of the 2018 Creative Peebles Festival.\nThe choir hopes you will join them or, at least, come and say hello.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"united-front-to-boost-the-borderlands","story":"HUNDREDS of stakeholders had their say on proposals to transform the Borderlands economy at a special conference in Dumfries on Monday.\nLeader of Dumfries and Galloway Council, Elaine Murray, welcomed more than 370 business representatives, public sector organisations and individuals to the first Borderlands conference.\nShe said: \u0026ldquoI am delighted that so many people attended on the day, this shows what an important project the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal is.\n\"One attendee described the conference as an \u0026lsquoIlluminating and fantastic event\u0026rsquo, which reflected the enthusiasm I perceived on the day, that this is a once in a generation opportunity which must be seized.\nFive local authorities from north and south of the border are working in partnership to put together a proposal that should have huge implications for those who live, work and visit the area.\nIt was the first opportunity for interested parties to hear about the themes that are being developed to underpin the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal \u0026ndash and to give their views on the major projects they believe would kickstart transformation.\nThe conference was held at a key time for the partnership, made up of Carlisle City, Cumbria County, Dumfries and Galloway, Northumberland County and Scottish Borders Councils.\nResponses from the conference will help the partnership to build a case to present to both the UK and Scottish Governments later this year.

And we look forward to negotiating the detail of that deal when the partners are ready with their proposals. This is a key part of our commitment to 100 percent coverage of deals across Scotland.\n\u0026ldquoWe want to see an ambitious deal that focuses on driving inclusive growth and the priorities that will make a difference and help the economy thrive. We want a deal that helps address the area\u0026rsquos connectivity challenges, supports growth in sectors particularly important in the Borderlands, and creates more opportunities for all to attract people to the area.\n\u0026ldquoWe are working to tackle the economic challenges in the South of Scotland, having already committed to establishing a South of Scotland enterprise agency, and we want to ensure that priorities align to maximise impact and success.\nSpeaking ahead of the conference the Secretary of State for Scotland, David Mundell said:\n\"The Borderlands Growth Deal represents a unique opportunity to provide a real shot in the arm to the economy of our region, a region that faces similar challenges wherever you live or work within it.\n\u0026ldquoWorking with the proposals that have been prepared by local authorities, businesses and individuals, we will spend the summer shaping these in to a coherent deal that will support the economy of the region by encouraging people to invest in new opportunities, by building on our strengths and improving the lives of those who live here.\n\u0026ldquoIn that way, we will bring to the Borderlands the benefits that are now being seen across the UK as investment in City and Growth Deals progresses.\nDumfries and Galloway Council Chief Executive Gavin Stevenson said: \u0026ldquoCrucially we now sit between the emerging powerhouses of the central belt of Scotland and the Northern Powerhouse in England. Unless we act they will continue to suck up our young talent and skills.\n\u0026ldquoWe need to re-position ourselves, we need to stabilise and to stop our productivity falling and then we also need to reinvent. This feels like a once in a generation opportunity.\n\u0026ldquoWe know our potential, our children will not forgive us if there are no jobs in the future.

Before that, in December 1828, Peebles Town Council had agreed that if a gas company was set up, it would be allowed to open up and lay pipes in the streets and if that proved successful, it would then have the street lamps lit by gas.\nInitially a site for a gasworks on the Old Town Green (now Greenside) was chosen, but it proved to be unsuitable. A site was found on the area of ground lying to the west of the Parish Church. Today the site is still visible and forms part of the parkland and walkways close to the modern swimming pool.\nOne of the factors which made the development of a gasworks feasible was the great improvement in major roads serving the town following the Turnpike Acts. That allowed coking coal to be brought to the town from the coalfields of Lanarkshire and Midlothian.\nTo begin with gas was produced for only ten months of the year and the street lights were lit for only about a third of the year, during the darkest winter months.\nBy the end of the 19th century, the demand for gas had greatly increased and as well as street lighting, was beginning to be used for household appliances such as gas cookers. In 1898 the assets of the Peebles Gas Company were acquired by the Town Council. Within a few years demand was outstripping supply and in 1905 it was decided to build a new gas works at Eshiels as the existing site, which also served as the council yard, was too restricted to allow for expansion. By then the existence of railways made it possible to import coal directly to the Eshiels site.\nIn 1948 the Town Council starting converting all street lighting to electricity. The gas works at Eshiels became part of the national system and continued in operation until the advent of North Sea gas in the late 1960s.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"were-so-proud-of-him-parents-of-galashiels-scout-with-adhd-hope-to-inspire-others-to-join-group","story":"THE parents of a Galashiels Scout with ADHD hope others will be inspired after the youngster won a prestigious award.\nAfter weeks of working hard to complete an array of challenges and tasks, Blair Valentine took home the Reiver Award at the Gala Scout Group annual general meeting last month.\nThe 10-year-old, who attends St Peter\u0026rsquos Primary School in Galashiels, received the award in recognition of his hard work after being nominated by numerous members of the Scouts.\nProud parents Dave and Mandy now hope their son\u0026rsquos success story will inspire other parents of children with ADHD.\nThe youngster was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in July 2013 at the age of six.\nBlair\u0026rsquos mum Mandy told the Border : \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore so proud of him, Blair has worked very hard to get where he is, and we want others to know that just because a child has ADHD, it shouldn\u0026rsquot hold them back from going on to do great things.\n\u0026ldquoBlair gets especially inspired when hearing that celebrities have the same condition as him.\n\u0026ldquoUntil we looked into it, we had no idea just how many well-known people were also affected by it.

Six-year-old Maisie, who plays the main character, Libby, in the film, in what was her first ever acting role, was accompanied to the glitzy ceremony in Los Angeles by her mother Elizabeth, co-star and writer Rachel Shenton, and the short film\u0026rsquos director Chris Overton.  And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be returning to her Upper Stratton home as one of the youngest actors to have starred in an Oscar-winning film.      THE.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre. Gilson, who spoke before and after the showing, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great pleasure to be able to finally show this in Swindon.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a film to be appreciated, and to spread a message.

John, 35, from Port Seton, won \u0026pound1 million in the EuroMillions draw on June 26, 2015, but he remained in his job as a roofer, insisting he wanted to keep working.  He took on the challenge to climb more than 4,400 feet and faced treacherous weather conditions to mark the Lottery\u0026rsquos milestone and tick off a lifelong dream from his bucket list.  It comes as new research reveals that more than half of the millionaires are now spending more on experiences rather than possessions.  Looking at their shopping trends across time, out have gone designer watches, ride-on mowers, racehorses and conservatories, and in have come protecting woodlands, paying university fees and bar/games rooms.

Five retail units are planned for a site at Gateside previously earmarked for a Sainsbury\u0026rsquos supermarket and petrol station.  The site, which totals about 60,000 sq ft, could be made up of units ranging from 7,500 sq ft to 20,000 sq ft in size.  Alastair Dickie, development director with Ediston Real Estates, which now owns the site, attended the town\u0026rsquos community council meeting on Tuesday, one week before plans are unveiled to the public.  He told members the proposal was for the site to include three food retailers, with the other two units including \u0026ldquoa household-type retail business and a coffee drive-through facility.  However, he was keeping tight-lipped on the identity of the businesses until legal agreements were in place.  Mr Dickie hoped planning permission for the site, off Oak Tree Roundabout west of Haddington, could be achieved by the end of the year.  He said: \u0026ldquoIf we submit an application in August, we would hope. . . we would hopefully have a consent in December or January next year.  \u0026ldquoWe could be on site quarter one of 2019.  It is then hoped that the retailers could be trading in the lead-up to Christmas that year or early in 2020.  The development, which has been described as \u0026ldquoEast Lothian\u0026rsquos first retail park, will involve in the region of \u0026pound14 million investment, with 150 jobs potentially created, as well as those during the construction process.  It has already been revealed that talks are ongoing with \u0026ldquoa number of major retailers who will be new to East Lothian.  Concerns have been expressed by a number of retailers in the town centre that the creation of a retail park on the outskirts would be detrimental to their business.  But Mr Dickie, who previously lived in the town and continues to stay in the county, was hopeful the additional retailers would encourage people to remain in the area rather than heading further afield to retail parks in Edinburgh.  The proposals are on display to the public from 2pm to 7pm on Tuesday at the John Gray Centre.  The developer is also continuing to make progress at a second Haddington site for retail development \u0026ndashat Harperdean, between the A1 and the A199, east of Aberlady Road.

A pressure group called \u0026lsquoBowls for Gullane\u0026rsquo was established on Facebook in the wake of concerns that the village\u0026rsquos bowling club \u0026ndash with a membership of only about 30 \u0026ndash was to be sold to developers.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay, ward member and former chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoAll three ward councillors are behind the campaign to save the club and we hope that the members understand the feeling in the village.  \u0026ldquoI understand that the committee own the club and it would be the members who benefit from any potential sale.  About 50 residents gathered outside the bowling club on Monday evening to show their displeasure at the possible loss of the club.  The group told the Courier they had had hundreds of offers of support.  Catherine MacKenzie said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had people phone up, email and text us \u0026ndash and face-to-face \u0026ndash to tell us that they\u0026rsquore willing to become a member.  \u0026ldquoSome of them don\u0026rsquot live locally, or won\u0026rsquot be able to bowl, but they are willing to pay the membership fees. People do not want to see the club close.  Gordon McLelland, a local resident and member of the community council, added: \u0026ldquoThe community council want to save the club for the community.  \u0026ldquoWe have tried hard to offer the club our support to work with them but so far they have turned that down.  Billy Mellors, the county\u0026rsquos bowls development officer, said: \u0026ldquoThe overwhelming support from the local community indicates to me the future of Gullane Bowling Club can be sustained if the current members accept it.  Many locals have tried to sign up as members but have been turned away by the club, it has been claimed.  Another member of the group said: \u0026ldquoWhat has shocked us as a group is how many people have been refused membership in recent years \u0026ndash young and old have come forward with their personal experience of being turned away.  Mr Mellors added: \u0026ldquoTime will tell on the way the club want to go but we all hope a common sense approach is taken to preserve this community facility.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray met representatives of the Bowls for Gullane group last week and is keen to find a solution to ensure the club\u0026rsquos survival.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis is an unfortunate situation Gullane has lost too many local assets recently, so every effort should be made to avoid losing another. I did meet with representatives of the campaign and have said that I will support them in trying to find a way the land, and preferably bowling too, can remain part of the village community.  Ian McMillan, CEO of Bowls Scotland, said that he was \u0026ldquodelighted to see local residents lend their support to the campaign to save the 116-year-old club.  He added: \u0026ldquoI would encourage all in the village to support their historic club, get on the green, enjoy the great game of bowls and ensure future generations can benefit from the opportunity to play an accessible, inclusive sport. Bowls Scotland fully supports the work being undertaken to keep bowls an important part of Gullane\u0026rsquos community fabric.  Les Ritchie, secretary of East Lothian Bowling Association, told the group: \u0026ldquoWe are ready to support you and the community in whatever steps might secure a future for bowling in Gullane.  Attempts by the Courier to speak to Michael Baxter, vice-president and secretary at the bowling club, were unsuccessful this week. In April, Mr Baxter told us: \u0026ldquoThere are not enough members to support the running of the club.  He had said then that the club was \u0026ldquotrying to find a solution but that it was not viable to continue with a dwindling membership.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council confirmed the land was earmarked for leisure and recreation use in the Local Development Plan and any deviation from that would require planning permission for a potential change of use."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7297144.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"haddington-hosts-world-record-attempt-for-the-slosh-dance","story":"              HUNDREDS of people are set to lace up their dancing shoes in a bid to break a world record.

Colin Beattie stressed that \u0026ldquoradical thinking needed to be done to create a solution, highlighting a possible extension of a tram or light rail system out to Musselburgh.  During a recent Holyrood debate, he said: \u0026ldquoPeople meet the queues of traffic heading on to the bypass on the main roads around my constituency before they are even near the bypass. This causes more congestion and more air pollution.  Mr Beattie later said: \u0026ldquoYou can go along the road at any time of the day and there are queues of traffic, mainly at Sheriffhall Roundabout.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that when the Government are looking at all the possible changes required to the bypass, all options are considered. The main priority should be that it is cost-efficient and done as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoIt may be that it is more economic to extend a tram or light rail system out to the main population centres such as Musselburgh than to take on the eye-watering cost of enlarging the A720. This would also benefit the environment and be much faster than using road transport.  \u0026ldquoClearly more radical thinking needs to be done on creating a sustainable solution. I am not convinced that simply replicating a system which moves traffic speedily and efficiently into new choke points is the answer.  Miles Briggs, Lothian region MSP who led the Parliamentary debate, said: \u0026ldquoThe transport information company Inrix in late 2016 identified the bypass as the most congested trunk road outside London, with four of the UK\u0026rsquos worst bottlenecks.  \u0026ldquoI continue to be contacted by frustrated constituents and businesspeople who face frequent delays when using the bypass to commute or transport goods, especially but not exclusively at peak times or when there is an accident on the route. Many drivers tell me their experience is that these tailbacks and traffic jams are becoming more and more regular.  He said that while proposed work at Sheriffhall would be an important improvement, he added: \u0026ldquoIt is only one part of what needs to be a far broader, long-term and coordinated programme of improvements to the bypass which will ensure traffic can keep moving in the decades ahead.  \u0026ldquoThis means looking at innovative solutions, assessing whether extra lanes will be needed, looking at the possible use of hard shoulders in some situations and utilising technology so the bypass can become a smart motorway.  Mr Briggs called on the Scottish Government to take forward a feasibility study into widening the city bypass and new options to address the growing congestion.  A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal includes investment of up to \u0026pound120m in the A720 city bypass for the grade separation of Sheriffhall Roundabout and \u0026pound20 million investment in public transport infrastructure in west Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis investment will improve journey reliability and safety for all users and support significant planned investment in Edinburgh and South East Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government remains committed to undertaking the improvements at the Sheriffhall junction at the earliest opportunity. We are continuing to progress the detailed design development and assessment of the preferred option and expect to publish draft orders in 2019."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930076.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"haddington-pub-seeking-new-owners","story":"              A TOWN centre pub which changed its name less than a year ago is on the lookout for new people to run it.

Inspectors found the following strengths in the school\u0027s work:  - Strong relationships exist between staff and children across the school and nursery which are based on shared values  - In the nursery, children are motivated and confident, and are able to make choices about their play, particularly outdoors. Across the primary stages, children are committed to and proud of being part of their school community  - The committed staff team, led by the headteacher, work well together in their goal to secure positive outcomes for children. Wellbeing is central to the whole school community and staff provide a nurturing learning environment where children receive effective support.  Areas for improvement were identified and discussed with the headteacher and a representative from East Lothian Council.  They were:  - Increasing the opportunities for children to be more active and independent in their learning  - Continuing to improve attainment, ensuring that the pace and challenge of learning meets the needs of all children  - Continuing to develop the opportunities for leadership at all levels to support the school improvement.

Brave Ruth Quilietti-Bird \u0026ndash who at one point was the most ill person \u0026ldquoin the whole of the UK, according to her husband \u0026ndash moved hospital several times to receive specialist treatment for multiple organ failure, spending her 40th birthday in intensive care rather than on a planned holiday.  She has had both her feet amputated after they suffered tissue damage due to sepsis \u0026ndash a serious complication of an infection.\u0026nbsp It was also feared that Ruth, who taught art at Knox Academy in Haddington and Preston Lodge High School, Prestonpans, might also lose her hands.  She is recovering at the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh, where she is getting used to her newly-fitted prosthetic legs with the aid of physiotherapists.  The health of her hands improved and she is keeping them busy by resuming her love of creative activities such as drawing, weaving and needlework.  Ruth is now looking forward to getting out of hospital to rejoin her family: husband Mark, 47, and their daughters, seven-year-old Lucia and Isabella, five.    But she can\u0026rsquot return to her New Street home in Musselburgh as it has an outdoor staircase and is no longer suitable, so the search for a new home is under way.  Now her friend Jacqueline Campbell has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u0026pound20,000 to help fund a mobility scooter and adapt a new property.  In March, Ruth suddenly started to have breathing problems along with vomiting and diarrhoea.  Mark, a nurse at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said she was rushed to the accident and emergency unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by paramedics who assessed that she was suffering from sepsis, which can be triggered by an infection and affected her immune system.  He said: \u0026ldquoHer health deteriorated more and more and she was taken to the high dependency unit. They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.  But Ruth, determined to get the best quality of life, made the decision to lose both feet below the knee, which would give her more choices in terms of prosthetics and improve her recovery.    Mark paid tribute to the \u0026ldquowonderful hospital staff who had \u0026ldquogiven everything for Ruth.  He highlighted the help he had received from friends and family over the past few months, including the network of \u0026lsquoSupermums\u0026rsquo who looked after Lucia and Isabella, friends, neighbours and colleagues at the Western General.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe kindness of people has been overwhelming. They want to help so much.  The family have also received support from the charity \u0026lsquoFinding Your Feet\u0026rsquo, which helps families affected by amputation or limb difference.

North Berwick\u0026rsquos Law Primary School P6 pupils were looking forward to the trip to Yellowcraig, by Dirleton, where one class was due to camp out tonight (Wednesday) and another tomorrow (Thursday).  Two of the school\u0026rsquos four P6 classes had already taken part in the one-night camp last month.  In total, 54 youngsters were expected to camp out this week.  However, Jill Wareham, the school\u0026rsquos headteacher, contacted parents on Monday to say that a decision had been taken to cancel the overnight stays after \u0026ldquoa group of people camped near the field they use.  The school is still going ahead with the daytime activities planned as part of the camp but asked parents to pick up their children from Yellowcraig at 7pm.  Mrs Wareham told parents in an email: \u0026ldquoYou may be aware that there is a group of people camped near the field at Yellowcraig where we usually hold our camp out. This has various implications for our risk assessments for the trip and, having taken advice from a number of sources, we have decided not to stay overnight at the site this week.  \u0026ldquoWe realise this will be disappointing news and apologise for any inconvenience, but we will look into the possibility of the pupils having a night in tents at another venue after the summer.  The camping trip is usually held in a field on the left of the road leading into the car parks at Yellowcraig.  An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWhile the pupils will be taking part in all of the planned activities, arrangements are being made for them to be picked up at 7pm instead of camping overnight.  \u0026ldquoThis decision has been taken as the school understands there may be a number of people already using the area.

A study is being launched to examine how the six secondary schools could work together to ensure they all start and end at the same time and follow a common timetable.  A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos cabinet heard that high schools had historically been given considerable autonomy in planning their school days and \u0026ldquocurricular arrangements. But this had resulted in \u0026ldquosix different structures, length of the school day and different levels of access in terms of experience and opportunity. And there was \u0026ldquosignificant variation throughout East Lothian in the range of Advanced Higher and Higher courses offered and the number of qualifications available in S4.  The report, backed by councillors, said the feasibility study would aim to lead to the creation of \u0026ldquoa common secondary school day and a common curricular structure.  The move would also see a change in hours for primary schools to match the new secondary day, with proposals to extend P1 and P2 pupils\u0026rsquo week from 22.5 hours to the same 25 hours that their older school-mates follow. A failure to synchronise primary school start and finish times to match the high school changes would cost the council an estimated \u0026pound190,000 in additional transport costs.  A public consultation will now be launched with the schools to establish the best standard timetable, with options for a 27, 32 or 33-period week. A 33-period week, for instance, could see secondary students\u0026rsquo first period of the day start at 8.30am, with a finish time of 3.40pm Monday to Thursday and 12.55pm on Fridays.  The council said a common school day would lead to joint delivery, mutual support, sharing of best practice and collaborative professional development opportunities, as well as meaning greater equity of resource and opportunity for young people across East Lothian and barriers to travel would be reduced.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokesperson for education, said: \u0026ldquoThese proposals are all about improving inclusion, wellbeing and equality. We\u0026rsquore always keen to look for new ways of raising attainment and improving positive destinations for our children and young people.  \u0026ldquoThere are a number of potential practical benefits associated with such changes. It\u0026rsquos important that we listen to the views of staff, pupils, parents, carers and other stakeholders.

The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.  The mussel shell is one of two works of art funded by Tesco at a cost of \u0026pound76,000 as part of the council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art policy, which was a condition of planning consent for the company\u0026rsquos present store.

This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.  Councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, health and social care spokesperson, said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that the Hollies will continue to provide a wide range of services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis was a really positive meeting and the plans to provide more activities in the Hollies are good news for local people.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership will continue its work to increase the amount of day support in Musselburgh for older people with complex care needs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7959839.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"phonebox-removed-from-centre-of-haddington","story":"              A TRADITIONAL red phonebox has been removed from the centre of Haddington after it was used just once in a year.

A spokesman for BT said: \u0026ldquoBT is committed to providing a public payphone service, but with usage declining by over 90 per cent in the last decade, we\u0026rsquove continued to review and remove payphones which are no longer needed.  \u0026ldquoAny removal of payphones is carried out in strict adherence to the Ofcom guidelines.  \u0026ldquoOnly one call was made from this payphone in past 12 months.  \u0026ldquoNo objections were made about the removal of this payphone following the posting of a notice inside the kiosk in January 2017.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll continue to maintain four payphones within 400 metres of the payphone on Court Street, Haddington.  \u0026ldquoAs an alternative to removal, we will continue to actively promote our Adopt a Kiosk scheme.

Numerous complaints were made on social media regarding cars and, in particular, car windscreens being covered in dust late last month.  Residents such as Seona Mason-Chadburn, who lives in Dunbar town centre, contacted the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) and Tarmac, which operates Dunbar Cement Plant to the south-east of the town, about the discharge.  She told the Courier how she had attempted to use her window wipers to clear her front windscreen, only to discover the dust.  She said her windscreen felt like \u0026ldquosandpaper and compared the dust to the \u0026ldquobloom on a black grape.  A spokesman for SEPA added: \u0026ldquoEvery day SEPA works to protect and enhance Scotland\u0026rsquos environment and we are clear that compliance is non-negotiable.  \u0026ldquoIn response to local complaints, SEPA officers responded to reports of significant dust in the Dunbar area.  \u0026ldquoOfficers identified the source of the dust and are working with Tarmac to prevent a re-occurrence.  \u0026ldquoWe would advise members of the public to contact our 24-hour pollution hotline on 0800 807060 to report pollution events.  Tarmac has confirmed that the dust escaped, with an internal investigation being carried out.  Oliver Curtin, plant manager, said: \u0026ldquoIn the early hours of May 24 we experienced an isolated and brief incident where a small amount of limestone-based dust escaped from the site.  \u0026ldquoWe took action quickly and have been working with SEPA and conducting our own investigations to prevent a recurrence.

Councillor McMillan said it had been a great honour to be joined by veterans from East Lothian at the flag-raising ceremony which took place on Monday morning.  He told those in attendance: \"Today is an opportunity to recognise the enormous contribution made by service personnel - past and present - and pay tribute to those who very sadly paid the ultimate sacrifice.  \"This November marks a century since the end of the First World War. A large number of residents left East Lothian in service of their country \u0026ndash many of whom, tragically, would never return.  \"Sadly, in the 100 years since, the world has seen all too many conflicts \u0026ndash some on a large scale, others more confined.

A chance to give thanks, remember, reflect and look ahead.\"  Mr McMillan also paid tribute to the role of women in the military and in times of conflict, noting that 2018 was also the 100th anniversary of the first women being given the vote.  He said: \"Women played a significant role in the war effort, taking on work such as farming, transport and munition production, and the perseverance of Suffrage activity subsequently led to women being given the right to vote.  \"For a number of years now women have deservedly been playing a full and active role in our Armed Forces \u0026ndash reflective of the increasingly inclusive society in which we all live and are so keen to protect.\"  Veterans who attended the ceremony on Monday were invited to enjoy refreshments after the event."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7979931.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"scotlands-best-black-pudding-made-in-east-lothian","story":"              A NORTH Berwick-based butcher is celebrating after it was judged the makers of Scotland\u0026rsquos finest black pudding.

A business leader, fisherman and border priest have all voiced concern ahead of this week\u0026rsquos EU summit, just nine months before Brexit, that the future for those living on the Irish frontier remains unclear.  Thousands of people live along the border, which stretches more than 300 miles (483km) from Lough Foyle in the north-west to Carlingford Lough to the east.  An estimated 20,000 people cross the border every day, and it is traversed by more than 200 roads which have had no checkpoints since 2005.  EU leaders will meet in Brussels on Thursday and Friday, but the ongoing migrant crisis is set to dominate the agenda, with Brexit likely to be a footnote.  The border has proved to be a sticking point in Brexit negotiations.  The Government has vowed there will not be a hard border, but has not so far not revealed how this will be implemented.  On Monday, Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley said the Government\u0026rsquos plan for the border will be proposed next month.  Darren Cunningham, owner of Killowen Shellfish on the shores of Carlingford Lough in Co Down, said he believes Brexit is going to completely change life in Northern Ireland, and is disappointed that the political negotiations do not seem to be further forward.  The oyster fisherman, who lives in Annalong, just 10 miles (16km) from the border, said at sea there is simply a \u0026ldquogentleman\u0026rsquos agreement over territory.  \u0026ldquoI thought after a year we would have had some sort of clarity over the future post-Brexit, but we have absolutely no clarity, he said.  \u0026ldquoThere seems to be mixed messages coming across \u0026ndash one minute one thing is agreed, then next thing something else is.  \u0026ldquoIt is just a mess, a total train wreck.  Mr Cunningham, who exports all his lobsters to mainland Europe, said the EU has been great for his business.  \u0026ldquoA hard border and delays won\u0026rsquot be good for us, we are exporting a live high-end product. If there are delays, they will start to die, he said.  \u0026ldquoFor me, I think everyone\u0026rsquos whole way of life is going to change and we are not prepared.  Sinead McLaughlin, chief executive of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce, said her organisation\u0026rsquos members are very concerned about potential changes to the border after Brexit.  \u0026ldquoFrom a chamber perspective, we have been very concerned at how the negotiations are progressing because there is very little clarity coming from the politicians and the conundrum which has been thrown up in relation to the customs union and the single market, she said.  \u0026ldquoWe need both, and that seems to be the sticking point.  \u0026ldquoThat is causing real concern on the future for many businesses.  Ms McLaughlin said the chamber has been lobbying the UK Government, the Irish Government and Europe on the matter.  \u0026ldquoIt is very difficult to be confident about a process which is not moving forward, she said.  \u0026ldquoIt is extremely uncomfortable.  People who live along the border share the concerns of the business community.  A parish priest for a border community in Newry said a hard border is \u0026ldquoinconceivable.  Father Richard Naughton, of Cloghogue, said a hard border would be \u0026ldquopolitically toxic.  \u0026ldquoI can\u0026rsquot conceive it becoming a hard border, I can\u0026rsquot see it being done, he said.  \u0026ldquoA hard border would be politically toxic and so dangerous.  \u0026ldquoThere would also be all the numerous other inconveniences.  \u0026ldquoYet no-one seems to know how this is going to end.  His parish includes the Church of the Sacred Heart which withstood numerous bomb blasts over the years during attacks on a major border checkpoint which used to stand nearby.  It dates back to 1916.  \u0026ldquoThe south side of the church faced a large military checkpoint at the border, each explosion sent tremors which in time caused water ingress into the mortar between the blocks, said Fr Naughton.  \u0026ldquoWe just invested \u0026pound600,000 in restoring the church, half of that money was spent on that south wall."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7785087.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"hilarious-moment-katy-perry-gives-shocked-teens-free-gig-tickets-in-glasgow","story":"              THIS is the hilarious moment US singer Katy Perry gave out tickets to her Glasgow gig to shocked young teens along the River Clyde.

The Nuclear Education Trust, a think-tank and charity, says their conclusion is drawn from evidence from defence diversification projects around the world.  The report recommends that workers and communities must take the lead in making decisions for moving away from Trident \"but a broad partnership involving all stakeholders is necessary for success\".    Funding must be available not just for putting a plan into action but for organising, analysis of the situation, planning and then implementation, the charity said.  Peter Burt, Nuclear Education Trust Board trustee said: \u0026ldquoOur independent analysis of international experience of defence diversification tells us that a government needs to be proactive in getting the conditions right for a successful transition from skilled defence jobs to those in the equally skilled, civil sector. Those conditions include complete stakeholder participation including workers and communities, and national, regional and local political support. Proactive planning and comprehensive funding, with continued learning for effective implementation are essential for success.  \"Many defence industry jobs are at risk from automation, global supply chains, changes in strategic thinking as well as the sheer cost of the work in today\u0027s austere financial climate. The Nuclear Education Trust calls on the current and future governments to make use of the findings of this research and integrate them into an effective defence diversification policy, part of a comprehensive industrial strategy.\"  Fabian Hamilton, MP, shadow minister for peace and disarmament said: \"While it is not yet Labour Party policy to scrap Trident, I am committed, not only to transitioning away from nuclear weapons, but to protecting jobs at the same time.  \"High-skilled jobs are good for our economy and, if we decide to transition away from Trident, defence diversification is the only way to ensure that the vital skills used in the development of Britain\u0027s nuclear weapons are not lost.  TUC deputy general secretary Paul Nowak said: \"The UK\u0027s defence capability will always need to change over time to safeguard against new threats in a changing world. When decisions are made, it\u0027s important to protect and prioritise good quality UK jobs and the communities linked to the defence industry. Unions and the workforce should have a say in creating new opportunities for highly skilled workers in defence and other advanced manufacturing and engineering industries.\"  The report is launched in Parliament at 4pm on Tuesday."},{"url":null,"title":"andrew-mckie-yes-immigration-is-a-good-thing","story":"              I SOMETIMES wonder why we call them \u0026ldquoleaders, when the evidence suggests that most politicians are remarkably slow to catch up with popular opinion. Take, for example, the EU\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquoemergency summit on migration, which has been convened just as immigration from illegal crossings of the Mediterranean and asylum claims have reached their lowest level for years.  The impetus for these talks is not the genuine refugee crisis that faced European countries several years ago, when Angela Merkel blithely introduced an open-door policy that has seen about 1.4 million migrants arrive in Germany since 2015. That, incidentally, created a huge upsurge in human trafficking, deaths at sea and an enormous headache for the southern European countries, especially Italy, to which many migrants headed. While that was at its peak, Mrs Merkel carried on as if there were no problem.  Now that she is dependent on her coalition partners, the anti-immigration Christian Social Union, it\u0026rsquos her political prospects that are in danger rather than piffling matters such as the lives of refugees or the cultural stability of Europe. The issue has naturally become much more pressing. It\u0026rsquos par for the course, I suppose, that the political priorities of the leader of a comfortable Western country should trump (I use the word advisedly) the desperation of those who come from places torn apart by war, governed by oppressive regimes, or devoid of opportunities to make a decent living. Yet migration has become a uniquely divisive issue, for reasons which often seem thoroughly irrational.  The EU summit has already been boycotted by four EU countries \u0026ndash the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and Slovakia \u0026ndash where immigration is a significant populist issue, while Italy has produced proposals which aim to end the link between a migrant\u0026rsquos point of arrival and the responsibility for dealing with his or her asylum claim.  Given that Italy has had to deal with the results of Mrs Merkel\u0026rsquos implied \u0026ldquocome one, come all rhetoric, that\u0026rsquos understandable but it will horrify other EU leaders, many of whom face growing electoral discontent over immigration. It could also create further problems for freedom of movement within the EU \u0026ndash one of the \u0026ldquofour fundamental freedoms.  In fact, despite Schengen\u0026rsquos supposed guarantee of free movement, the migrant crisis has already led to internal restrictions despite the EU\u0026rsquos objections border controls were instituted between Denmark and Sweden for several years.  Yet the EU\u0026rsquos talk of freedom of movement, rather like its talk of its single market, disguises the underlying problem, which is that neither its movements nor its markets are in any sense genuinely free. On the contrary they are protectionist measures which create barriers to those outside (which means, of course, most of the rest of the world, and the developing world in particular).  Before the First World War, in a world of many more borders and nation states, there were few obstacles to travel and resettlement, passports and border controls were a rarity and naturalisation for longstanding residents was a mere formality. The United States, where Donald Trump is disgustingly and dishonestly weaponising debate on the subject, owes its existence and success entirely to immigration.  Part of the reason this approach is working with so many Trump voters, and is also gaining support for similarly unsavoury populists such as Marine Le Pen in France and Viktor Orban in Hungary, is, it must be said, the reluctance of Western political elites to countenance discussion of the issue, and their implication that anyone who raises concerns about immigration is a racist. It\u0026rsquos only eight years, remember, since Gordon Brown airily dismissed Gillian Brown, one of his own supporters, as a \u0026ldquobigoted woman for raising the matter.  The reason this attitude was so dangerous was that it concealed the facts about immigration and conflated the issue with a quite separate one, which is to do with multi-culturalism and globalisation. Racism in Britain, though it certainly exists, is fortunately confined to a (dwindling) minority.  Immigration, despite the noise about it, is also a minority concern, even among Leave voters not a single poll found it cited as the major factor in the Brexit referendum.  But it is a very bad thing that it has not been properly discussed, because the evidence in favour of immigration is overwhelmingly positive, while the objections to it are largely about issues such as integration, welfare, schools and the provision of social housing.  Immigrants contribute considerably more to the economy than they cost (one report found European Economic Area migrants put in 34 per cent more in tax than they claimed in welfare payments). One obvious example of their contribution is the NHS, where more than one quarter of the doctors employed are from overseas. One consequence of Theresa May\u0026rsquos misinterpretation of Brexit (which she opposed) as being primarily about immigration (which most Leave voters did not list as a priority) is to endanger not only healthcare but also all manner of other areas of our economy.  Agriculture, education, and the technology sector, for example, are all highly dependent on migrant workers or overseas students. And the decline in the birthrate in Western countries, and their ageing populations, ought to make importing people to contribute to pensions a priority.  What\u0026rsquos more, a welcoming approach towards immigration ought to be the natural position for a party which claims to support economic growth, a free society and open markets. From a truly liberal perspective, immigration policy shouldn\u0026rsquot even be a matter for the Government but for the market. After all, if people choose to come to the UK, it is because they see it as an opportunity for themselves and their families and, if they choose to stay, they become British anyway.  Businesses and immigrants themselves are best placed to determine whether migration is in their mutual interest, which is why the idea of having some number plucked from the air, with no reference to need or desirability, fixed as a cap is absurd. The Home Secretary\u0026rsquos announcement that the default position of the UK would be to grant settled status to EU nationals living here was welcome, if belated, but did not go far enough.  Politicians should be making the case that immigration is not a problem but a boon, while populist rhetoric about crime or welfare should be rebutted vigorously. If the EU leaders have not wanted to discuss the issue until now, the least they can do is point out that the facts disprove the claims of those opposed to immigration."},{"url":null,"title":"economy-secretary-out-in-sturgeon-reshuffle","story":"              NICOLA Sturgeon has\u0026nbspstarted reshuffling\u0026nbspher cabinet, with Economy Secretary Keith Brown leaving to focus on campaigning for independence.  Mr Brown, who earlier this month became deputy leader of the SNP, had been seen as one of the poorer performers in cabinet, with economic growth\u0026nbsppersistently lagging behind UK rates.\u0026nbsp  The party claimed his exit, and the loss of his \u0026pound42,000 salary bump, would bring\u0026nbsphim an \"enhanced depute leader role\".  However Mr Brown previously claimed he could be both depute leader and a cabinet secretary, and the move will be seen as a demotion.  The First Minister, who returned to Scotland from a trade mission in Berlin this morning, will announce her full ministerial team this afternoon.  The normal early Tuesday meeting of the Scottish cabinet has been cancelled.  The beleaguered Health Secretary Shona Robison is seen as the most likely change at the top, however she may be moved sideways rather than sacked.  Social security minister Jeanne Freeman, Brexit minister Michael Russell and Transport minister Humza Yousaf have been tipped for elevation to cabinet level.  Among the new intake of 2016, Kate Forbes, Ivan McKee and Gail Ross are regarded as likely to become ministers for the first time.  The changes are expected to maintain the gender balance of Ms Sturgeon\u0026rsquos last cabinet.  Ms Sturgeon, who became First Minister in November 2014, has made only minor changes to her ministerial team since entering Bute House.  However a series of problems in health, including missed waiting time targets and financial issues at NHS Tayside, have been adding to pressure for a refresh before the 2021 election.

Quality Pork Limited in Brechin, Angus, will carry out its last slaughter at 4pm due to a lack of the gas used to stun animals before they are killed.  There are plans to send around 1,000 pigs to another plant near Manchester this week, but operators say the CO2 shortage could have serious implications if the shortage continues.  Beer, fizzy drinks and meat producers have all warned of possible shortages caused by a lack of the gas as the UK enters peak consumption amid World Cup festivities and high summer temperatures.  In a statement, the soft drinks giant said: \"We are currently responding to an industry-wide issue that is impacting the supply of C02 in the UK. Our focus is on limiting the effect this may have on the availability of our products.  \"We are working closely with our suppliers, partners and customers on a number of solutions as the situation develops.\"  Supermarket Morrisons said some frozen products had been affected by the shortage, and it aimed to resume selling its full online range \"as soon as possible\".  Quality Pork Limited operates in collaboration with UK-wide meat processor Tulip and the Scottish Pig Producers (SPP) co-operative, whose chief executive, Andy McGowan, said the industry was facing an unprecedented situation.  Mr McGowan said he did not know when to expect the next CO2 delivery from supplier BOC.  He said: \"That\u0027s the frustrating thing - they\u0027re not telling us anything. We\u0027re pretty dismayed.  \"The top priority is animal welfare - we will not have ourselves in a situation where the welfare is suffering.\"  British Meat Processors Association (BMPA) chief executive Nick Allen said the situation was getting \"pretty tight\", exacerbated by the hot temperatures.  Mr Allen said: \"The frustration is the lack of information. We understand that several (CO2) producers are reopening plants and restarting production, but getting information is very difficult, which makes it very difficult to plan.  \"Things are getting pretty tight and this hot weather won\u0027t be helping. If things don\u0027t alter this week, we\u0027re going to see people having to make some serious decisions, mainly in the pig production area.\"  Poultry slaughterhouses have already called for priority supplies of dwindling CO2 stocks, saying the current shortage could have a \"potentially huge effect\" on British food production.  The shortages are understood to have been caused by a longer than usual break in production of ammonia, one of the key sources of food grade CO2 in Europe - which is used to carbonate drinks and preserve some packed fresh foods.  Trade journal Gas World said the shortage had been described as the \"worst supply situation to hit the European carbon dioxide (CO2) business in decades\".  The UK has been hit particularly hard as only one major CO2 plant was operating earlier this week and imports from the continent have been affected by shut-downs in Benelux and France.  The British Soft Drinks Association said the shortage was continuing to affect a wide range of businesses across the food and drink sector."},{"url":null,"title":"more-heads-roll-in-sweeping-sturgeon-reshuffle","story":"              THREE cabinet secretaries and three ministers are to leave the Scottish Government\u0026nbspin\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspsweeping reshuffle.  Health Secretary Shona Robison, Communities Secretary Angela Constance, and Economy Secretary Keith Brown are all out, the Scottish Government confirmed.  Ms Robison and Ms Constance - who had been tipped for the chop - wrote to Nicola Sturgeon to confirm their resignations.\u0026nbsp  The First Minister paid tribute to their work. She is due to announce her new Cabinet later.  Also sacked are International Development minister Dr Alasdair Allan, Community Safety minister Annabelle Ewing, and mental health minister Maureen Watt.  The end of Ms Robison\u0026rsquos tenure as health secretary had been widely predicted given grim waiting time statistics and scandals at her local health board, NHS Tayside.  Her departure coincided with the BMA in Scotland claiming the NHS was being \u0026ldquopushed to the brink, \u0026nbspthe worst waiting times for cancer treatment in six years, and an investigation confirming a culture of \u0026ldquobullying and harassment at NHS Lothian - a not untypical day.  In her resignation letter to Ms Sturgeon, Mr Robison said her three and a half years in the post had been an immense privilege \u0026ldquoalbeit at times very challenging and all consuming.  She said her last year had been \u0026ldquoparticularly challenging on a personal level, as she had lost both parents, had a health scare of her own, and seen other \u0026ldquobig changes in her life.  \u0026ldquoI thank you for your support during these difficult times, she wrote.  \u0026ldquoI feel that I have reached a point in my life just now where I would be best to step down from a role in Government. I have entered a new chapter in my life, including a new relationship, where it would be good to take time to focus on those closest to me, who have too often had to come second place to my job, which has hard for us all.  In reply, Ms Sturgeon said Ms Robison had \u0026ldquoserved with distinction over her 11 years in government, and said her time as health secretary had ended with high levels of patient satisfaction and the lowest A\u0026ampE waiting times in the UK for three years.  She also said the integration of health and social care was to her \u0026ldquoimmense credit.  She wrote: \u0026ldquoI know that recent years have brought a number of personal challenges for you, including the loss of both your parents and health worries of your own, among other issues.  \u0026ldquoDespite this, you continued to serve the people of Scotland with dedication, just as you did your loved ones. I am delighted to wish you every happiness in your new relationship.  Ms Sturgeon\u0026rsquos correspondence with Ms Constance lacked any such warmth, and Ms Constance offered no reason for leaving, strongly suggesting she was sacked.  The Almond Valley MSP said it had been an honour to serve in government for eight years, and said she had been particularly proud of her work on affordable homes, social security, gender recognition on public boards, gypsy travellers and child poverty.  \u0026ldquoI have been very lucky throughout my political life to have had the support of my family and there is no doubt that without them I couldn\u0026rsquot have undertaken the many roles I have had the privilege of occupying, she wrote.  \u0026ldquoI look forward to spending more times with them and my growing son.  In rely, Ms Sturgeon said Ms Constance had worked \u0026ldquotirelessly to give a voice at the Cabinet table to those who are not always heard in society.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe fact Scotland has received international recognition for the work we have done to support refugees, on LGBTI+ rights, on women\u0026rsquos right and many other areas is in no small part down to your leadership.  Scottish Tory deputy leader Jackson Carlaw said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos now a year since Nicola Sturgeon promised a refresh of her government, so this reshuffle has been a long time coming.  \u0026ldquoThere may well have been a few ministerial changes.  \u0026ldquoBut this is an SNP government that is tired, completely out of ideas and all over the place on key issues. The people of Scotland are coming to the view that Nicola Sturgeon\u0026rsquos time is up.  Scottish LibDem leader Willie Rennie said he admired the dedication of former ministers.  However he added:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoNevertheless, change was required in the leadership of our NHS.  \u0026ldquoWe have seen long waiting times, a shortage of nurses and doctors and mental health service reform that fails to match up to what is required.

His departure came just days after heated exchanges between the management team and fans during a home defeat to Elgin City.  Mr Chapman has now launched an employment tribunal against the fan-owned team, which operates as a Community Interest Club.  He is seeking a payout of \u0026pound27,390 for breach of contract, as well as more than \u0026pound800 for unpaid holiday pay.  The tribunal initially awarded in favour of the ex-manager as the club failed to lodge a response on time, but that decision has now been overturned at Clyde\u0026rsquos request and a full hearing is scheduled take place at a later date.

A gaggle of journalists and photographers spent the afternoon huddled around the railings of the Georgian townhouse, glued to their phones for the latest updates.  Every time a swanky car drove past, notepads would rustle and microphones hastily assemble. There were a number of false alarms.  But as a string of SNP figures were dropped off and quickly let inside, a picture emerged of dramatic change within the corridors of Bute House.  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon \u0026ndash widely known as a cautious politician \u0026ndash was presiding over one of the biggest reshuffles in the history of devolution.  Standing on the steps of Bute House just after 5.30pm, she spoke of bringing \u0026ldquofresh talent to the table and referenced the looming challenges of Brexit and delivering Scotland\u0026rsquos new social security system.  There were casualties, of course. But around her, five new faces beamed.  Former transport minister Humza Yousaf was promoted to Justice Secretary \u0026ndash a position previously held by Michael Matheson, who will become Cabinet Secretary for Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity.  First given a ministerial role under Alex Salmond, Mr Yousaf is among Holyrood\u0026rsquos most high-profile figures.  As transport minister, he faced down calls to quit over ScotRail\u0026rsquos performance, and survived a blizzard of criticism over winter storms and \u0026ldquosnagging issues with the \u0026pound1.35bn Queensferry Crossing.  Another big name given a boost was former Brexit minister Michael Russell. Previously Education Secretary between 2009 and 2014, Mr Russell has burst back into the political limelight in his role representing Scotland in the Brexit negotiations.  He will become Cabinet Secretary for Government Business and Constitutional Relations \u0026ndash a newly created role focused on protecting Scotland\u0026rsquos interests as the UK leaves the EU.  Another new position reflecting the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos shifting priorities was given to Shirley-Anne Somerville.  The MSP, who has been minister for further education since May 2016, will become the Cabinet Secretary for Social Security and Older People.  This will give her responsibility for overseeing Scotland\u0026rsquos new social security system following the devolution of 11 benefits, worth around \u0026pound3.3bn a year.  Elsewhere, Jeane Freeman will replace embattled Health Secretary Shona Robison.  Elected in 2016, Ms Freeman is a former Labour special adviser who converted to the independence cause and previously co-founded the campaign group Women for Independence.

The Herald has been told that Scottish Water has valid warnings for in and around Stornoway on Lewis and Elgin, Kinloss and Forres in Moray which has been in place for up to nine days - even before the current hot spell.  It emerged as the Met Office issued yellow health warning for heatwave conditions from Tuesday until Thursday evening covering the west and north-east of England.  The warning means there is an 80% chance of temperatures which could be a risk to health, and is intended to help social and healthcare teams prepare.  Rail passengers are being warned of lengthy delays as speed restrictions are enforced to prevent tracks from buckling in a heatwave that has sparked wildfires across parts of Britain - and shows no signs of abating.    Network Rail has deployed \u0026ldquoextreme weather action teams in readiness for even warmer conditions following a peak of 30.1C (86.1F) on Monday.  The water company said called on customers to \"use water wisely\u0026nbspas a result of prolonged dry weather in the area\".  It said that dry conditions and increased demand in the area meant that \"efficiency measures\" are being requested of customers served by the Badentinan Water Treatment Works, Elgin and the Stornoway Water Treatment Works.  Residents are being advised to turn off the taps when brushing teeth or shaving, take shorter showers and only boil the kettle with the volume of water needed. They also advise to use a bucket or a watering can for use\u0026nbspto clean cars and in gardens.        Scotland has received a little over half the average rainfall for May this year and the dry spell of weather continues across June.  Stornoway has experienced an unusual spell of 23 consecutive days with no rainfall, with only 31mm of rain falling in Lewis\u0026rsquos capital in one month.  Scottish Water said the dry conditions have caused \"lower than normal water levels\" in Loch Mor an Stairr, which supplies Stornoway Water Treatment Works (WTW).\u0026nbsp  And despite some\u0026nbsprainfall,\u0026nbspincreased demand in the area\u0026nbspled to the utility encouraging customers served by the Badentinan Water Treatment Works (WTW) to take simple water efficiency measures.  Peter Farrer, Scottish Water\u0026rsquos chief operating officer, said: \u0026ldquoWe are encouraging everyone living and working locally to take simple steps to use water wisely. By doing so, we can significantly reduce water usage which also helps the environment, saves energy and ensures that we continue to provide clear, fresh water to customers in the area.  A Scottish Water spokeswoman said:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoScottish Water has issued advice to customers to use water wisely in two localised areas, parts of Moray and the Stornoway area of Lewis.  \u0026ldquoThe advice was issued because of prolonged dry weather in these areas, despite some recent rainfall, and (in the case of Moray) increased demand.    A past Scottish Water \u0027use water wisely\u0027\u0026nbspadvertisement  \u0026ldquoScottish Water is managing water supplies across Scotland through this extended dry period and will continue to monitor the situation closely.

Your innovation and creativity are vital ingredients in our success as a nation.  \u0026ldquoA Conservative government will always listen to your voice and back you every step of the way as you help grow our economy and create more good jobs.  In the last few days, Airbus and BMW have warned that disruption to customs operations post-Brexit might affect their ability to invest and could lead to job losses in the UK.

John McLellan, director of the Scottish Newspaper Society, spoke out after Ofcom gave their \"very disappointing\" final permission for the BBC to launch its new BBC Scotland service.  The new channel will begin broadcasting on a digital channel in early 2019, and has already begun hiring around 80 staff for the operation.  Newspapers have been concerned the new channel, with expanded digital content, would present increased publicly-funded competition to newspapers and their own news websites.  The BBC also announced it is to set up a new design and engineering hub in Glasgow, investing \u0026pound4m and recruiting an additional 60 people into \"technology and design-led\" roles over the next three years.  In its decision, Ofcom rejects concerns about online competition, and also a concern that newspaper journalists will leave their print employers for the new station.  Mr McLellan said: \"Disappointingly, the ruling is to all intents identical to the indicative decision issued earlier this year.  \"It\u0027s a very disappointing outcome which ignores the legitimate concerns of commercial news providers, and despite months of investigation and consultation amounts to just accepting the BBC\u0027s assurances that its plans do not encroach on private operations.  \"There is not even a commitment to monitor the situation, and surprisingly it seems that Ofcom has even less concern about wider market impact than the old BBC Trust.\"  The Ofcom report says that \"in relation to online news, we found that the BBC\u0026rsquos proposal would be unlikely to lead either to a substantial expansion or to a change in the focus of the BBC\u0026rsquos online news offering.  \"We concluded that, in its current form, the BBC\u0026rsquos proposal would be unlikely to have a significant adverse impact on print and online news provision.\"  It adds that it does not believe that the proposal to create 80 journalism posts, only half of which are news gathering roles, \"poses a significant threat to the ability of Scottish newspapers to attract or retain journalists.\"  The new digital hub will be in Glasgow, and will be similar to existing hubs in London and Salford.  In total it will have more than 100 staff, including existing BBC Design and Engineering staff in Pacific Quay, Glasgow.  The new staff will be working on \"voice platforms\", developing BBC services for Amazon Echo, Google Home and the Apple HomePod.  There will also be jobs in the education wing of the broadcaster, as well as apps, websites and other online material.  Tony Hall, the BBC Director-General said: \"Ofcom giving the green light for the new channel is great news.  \"The new service has huge potential and I\u0026rsquom excited about what it can achieve.\"  Matthew Postgate, the BBC Chief Technology and Product Officer said: \"We know there is a huge amount of technological and creative talent in Scotland.  \"We\u0026rsquore looking forward to creating a digital hub in the heart of this thriving community, which will use that talent and expertise to transform the BBC, not only in Scotland \u0026ndash but throughout the UK.\"  In its final judgement on the new channel, Ofcom says: \"We recognise that there are uncertainties about the take-up of the new channel and the content it will include.  \"However, we are satisfied the BBC has shown its proposal will deliver public value by broadening the options available to viewers in Scotland, providing a greater Scottish -focus in its news coverage and delivering more content designed to reflect the lives of people in Scotland.\"  It says that any adverse impacts on competition are \"likely to be fairly limited.\"  Although it adds: \"We acknowledge that some stakeholders, particularly STV, may experience negative effects as a result of the  BBC\u0026rsquos proposal.  \"However, taking these impacts on rivals into account, we do not believe that the proposed channel is likely to have a negative impact on citizens and consumers.\"  The director of BBC Scotland, Donalda MacKinnon, said: \"Bringing another 60 highly-trained technology roles to Scotland, on top of the 50-plus we already have, is a sign of the BBC\u0026rsquos commitment to spreading our investment across the UK.\""},{"url":null,"title":"iain-mcwhirter-gamble-for-the-snp-in-asking-voters-too-many-complex-questions","story":"              MONEY, as we know, never sleeps. The former editor of the Daily Record, Murray Foote, has revealed that, on the eve of the independence referendum in 2014, he was deluged by requests from financial businesses and hedge funds desperate for advance knowledge of the title\u0026rsquos eve-of-vote opinion poll. With commendable directness he told them to get lost. Others may not have been so punctilious. Analysis of currency movements by financial website Bloomberg suggests that hedge funds made a fortune from insider dealing over the Brexit referendum in by trading on unpublished exit polls. It\u0026rsquos being called the great Brexit short.  Well, the hedgies and short-sellers could be in for another couple of bumper shorts now that the SNP is edging closer to endorsing not just another independence referendum but also one on Brexit. Referendum-fatigued voters may quail at the thought of two repeat referendums but the indications are that the Scottish Government is moving rapidly in the direction of backing the People\u0026rsquos Vote on Brexit. The Brexit minister, Michael Russell, and the Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, have both made \u0026ldquoI-am-not-opposed statements in the past week, which suggests that they support another vote on Europe, even if their leader has yet to make her position clear.  There has been an intense debate in the SNP over a second EU referendum, with influential former advisers like Kevin Pringle and Noel Dolan advising the First Minister that she has a moral and political duty to lead the opposition to Brexit, Labour having lost the plot on Europe. The argument is that Scots voted by 62 per cent to 38% in favour of Remain and they should be represented by the Scottish Government. They have despaired at Nicola Sturgeon\u0026rsquos apparent willingness to accept a special deal on access to the single market as an acceptable \u0026ldquosecond best to EU membership.  It\u0026rsquos understandable that Ms Sturgeon has been somewhat resistant to these representations. She\u0026rsquos already under pressure from the \u0026ldquomandate tendency in her party to call the second independence referendum forthwith, on the grounds that the \u0026ldquotriple-lock mandate she won after last year\u0026rsquos Holyrood vote is time limited. But, having called a referendum and then uncalled it only a year ago, she does not want to risk falling into the trap of calling another one she is likely to lose. She sees no romantic glory in heroic failure.  As for the second Europe referendum, her anxieties have been two fold. First, while Scots may be dedicated Europeans, there has been only a slight movement in the UK opinion polls toward Remain and any People\u0026rsquos Vote would have to be UK-wide. Moreover, Ms Sturgeon is bound to be uneasy at the possible precedent that might be set by holding a referendum on the deal struck by Theresa May next year. As former SNP deputy leader Jim Sillars has argued, there would be similar demands in Scotland for a confirmatory vote on whatever deal the First Minister might strike with the rest of the UK after Scottish independence.  It\u0026rsquos a difficult one, made more so by the suggestion that the second Brexit and independence votes might be held simultaneously. Mr Russell has refused to rule this out in cryptic statements on the relationship between the two ballots. A double-headed referendum might on the surface make some sense. It would be more efficient to hold the two votes on the same day and they are politically closely related. Many Scottish voters only voted No in 2014 because they believed that it was the way to guarantee that Scotland remained in the EU. So why not deal with both issues on the same day?  Well, a moment\u0026rsquos thought on a double-headed referendum reveals some serious problems. For a start, voters might feel they are being railroaded by these referendums and many might refuse to vote, or even vote No, because they\u0026rsquore fed up with being asked the same questions again. There is also the problem of the referendums cancelling each other out. If voters believe that Britain is likely to rejoin the EU in ballot one would that not make them less likely to support independence in number two?  Then there are the Scots eurosceptics. It is not just the remnants of Ukip that dislike the EU. An influential strand of Nationalist opinion, led by the former minister Alex Neil, wants to stay out. Many on the Left of the Nationalist movement are unhappy at the lack of democracy in the Brussels bureaucracy and its attitude to small nations like Greece. Yes-supporting organisations like Common Weal and Radical Independence Campaign would argue that, if there is to be a multi-option referendum on Brexit, it should include an option of Scotland remaining in the European Economic Area and not being subject to the Common Agricultural Policy or the EU Court of Justice.  There is no indication that Theresa May is likely to endorse a second Scottish referendum or a second EU referendum for that matter. She said last year that \u0026ldquonow is not the time for an independence referendum and, given the chaotic state of the Brexit negotiations since then, she\u0026rsquos hardly likely to want another referendum on Europe. Westminster needs to pass a Section 30 order permitting Scotland to hold a constitutional referendum and there is not a cat in hell\u0026rsquos chance of that happening at present.  Nor is there much momentum behind the People\u0026rsquos Vote, despite 100,000 marching in London, because Labour remains opposed.  So this may all seem rather academic. But it is right to look at these questions because politics is in such a fluid state that almost anything is possible in the next couple of years. The UK Government might fall and there might be a \u0026ldquono-deal Brexit, which would generate a UK-wide revulsion at the whole project. There are signs that Scottish No-voting opinion-formers are reconsidering independence. The SNP is right to make contingency plans.  There is a vacuum in UK politics and Ms Sturgeon could perform a valuable leadership role in leading the opposition to Brexit, in time. However, she should be careful about voter tolerance. The money men may love referendums but there\u0026rsquos no sign that Scottish voters have yet regained their enthusiasm for being handed complex, divisive questions that the politicians can\u0026rsquot resolve."},{"url":null,"title":"opposition-demand-policy-changes-as-well-as-new-faces","story":"              JEANE Freeman came under attack within minutes of being confirmed as Health Secretary yesterday, as Labour raised a previous briefing against a nurse.  Mr Freeman was accused last year of contributing to a smear against an audience member who challenged Nicola Sturgeon in a BBC TV general election debate.  Mr Freeman and SNP MP Joanna Cherry QC had appeared on the show to defend the party\u0026rsquos record, describing themselves as the \u0026lsquospin girls\u0026rsquo.  Mr Cherry wrongly claimed nurse Claire Austin, who had attacked Ms Sturgeon over NHS pay and said she had been forced to use a foodbank, was the wife of a Tory councillor.  She later apologised for the remark, which had been circulating on social media.  Tory MSP Murdo Fraser, who had been sitting next to the pair in the BBC\u0026rsquos spin room, said Ms Freeman had encouraged Ms Cherry to make the claim on air.  A Scottish Labour spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoIt is surprising that Nicola Sturgeon has appointed the person behind smearing a nurse who had the guts to challenge the First Minister during the election television debate.  \u0026ldquoThere are huge challenges in the health portfolio, especially in terms of funding and staffing. We need a Health Secretary that is going to support staff and stand-up for patients.  The instant attack was a sign the opposition do not intend to be deflected by the reshuffle.  The other parties said the new faces would mean little if they were not accompanied by new ideas and new priorities from the government.  Scottish Tory deputy leader Jackson Carlaw said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos now a year since Nicola Sturgeon promised a refresh of her government, so this reshuffle has been a long time coming.  \u0026ldquoThere may well have been a few ministerial changes.  \u0026ldquoBut this is an SNP government that is tired, completely out of ideas and all over the place on key issues. The people of Scotland are coming to the view that Nicola Sturgeon\u0026rsquos time is up.  Labour MSP Rhoda Grant said the government was \u0026ldquoout of touch and out of ideas.  She said: \u0026ldquoOn the day Nicola Sturgeon chose to shake up her government, she had to shelve her flagship Bill to reform the education system and oversaw the worst cancer waiting times on record.  \u0026ldquoMeanwhile the economy secretary has been booted from his job to plan a referendum campaign, which says something about Keith Brown\u0026rsquos performance or the SNP\u0026rsquos priorities - or most likely both.  \u0026ldquoThis reshuffle is long overdue but the real change Scotland wants and needs won\u0026rsquot come from changing the odd Cabinet Secretary - it will come from changing the government.  Scottish LibDem leader Willie Rennie said he admired the dedication of former ministers.  However he added: \u0026ldquoNevertheless, change was required in the leadership of our NHS.  \u0026ldquoWe have seen long waiting times, a shortage of nurses and doctors and mental health service reform that fails to match up to what is required. If the change in the ministerial team is not matched by a change of policy then our NHS will continue to decline.  Green MSP Patrick Harvie said: \u0026ldquoTwo years on from the Holyrood election in which the SNP lost their majority, the need for bold action from Scottish Ministers has never been greater.  \u0026ldquoGreen MSPs have been leading the change in this session of parliament, influencing budgets, the income tax system and social security legislation.

Across the UK, the typical house price in June stood at a new record high of \u0026pound215,444, up 0.5% month on month, Nationwide Building Society said.  House prices are 2% higher than a year ago.  Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u0027s chief economist, said: \"Annual house price growth fell to its slowest pace for five years in June. However, at 2%, this was only modestly below the 2.4% recorded the previous month.\"  Regionally, in the second quarter of this year, London was the only area where house prices are lower than a year ago - following a trend also seen in the first quarter of 2018.  In the second quarter, house prices in London stood at \u0026pound468,845 on average - a 1.9% annual fall.  Despite the downward price movement in London, house prices there are still more than 50% above their 2007 peak.  By comparison, house prices in the UK generally are 15% higher, Nationwide said.  The East Midlands had the strongest annual house price growth in the second quarter, with prices up by 4.4%, followed by the West Midlands, which saw a 4.3% increase, and Wales with a 4% uplift.  In Scotland, house prices were 3.1% higher than a year earlier, while in Northern Ireland they have seen a 2.1% increase.  Mr Gardner continued: \"Subdued economic activity and ongoing pressure on household budgets is likely to continue to exert a modest drag on housing market activity and house price growth this year, though borrowing costs are likely to remain low.  \"Overall, we continue to expect house prices to rise by around 1% over the course of 2018.\"  Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \"Tight supply, a healthy labour market and a continued lengthening of mortgage terms - 30-year loans now are common - will help to prevent prices from falling outright.  \"But it is inevitable that house prices will grow at a slower rate than households\u0027 incomes during a period of rising mortgage rates.\"  He continued: \"We expect the official measure of house prices to rise by just 1.5% over the course of 2018 and a mere 2% over 2019.\"  Jeremy Leaf, a north London estate agent and a former residential chairman of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics), said: \"On the one hand, the squeeze on incomes and unrealistic asking prices is reducing activity and confidence to move, particularly in price-sensitive areas such as London.  \"On the other hand, the market continues to be supported by low interest rates and overall supply shortages, although we have found recently that listings and viewings are on the rise. This will translate into more sales if buyers and sellers recognise the new market realities.\"  Mark Dyason, Managing Director, Thistle Finance, said: \"House prices in Scotland have surged over the past quarter compared to the rest of the UK.  \"Over the past three months, Scotland is the only market to have delivered positive price growth.  \"On an annual basis, price growth in Scotland is lagging behind Wales but significantly stronger than England, which is being weighed down by the capital.  \"Despite continued uncertainty around Brexit and the ongoing squeeze on household finances, Scotland\u0027s housing market has a spring in its step.  \u0026lsquoWe\u0026rsquore seeing a lot of development activity north of the border, as capital that would traditionally have stayed in London flows elsewhere.  \u0026ldquoAgainst a backdrop of weak supply and relatively strong demand, prices in Scotland are likely to continue to edge up during the second half of the year.\""},{"url":null,"title":"business success for kintore couple","story":"\t\t\t\tDonna and Jason Orton, who have been helped by Business Gateway Aberdeen City \u0026amp Shire, opened the doors to their unique business in Abercrombie Court, Westhill, just over a year ago.

It will provide on-board workshops, spare parts storage, crane and office facilities but will get supplies from another large vessel. By contrast the BOWL project will use smaller crew transfer vessels on a daily basis to provide crew and supplies.\u0026ldquoIt is just a different strategy being used at MORL and we could not accommodate that size of vessel at Wick as we do not have the shelter and water depth required, he said. \u0026ldquoIf we had our new quay at Shaltigoe we would have been able to accommodate it.But Mr Watt is confident the harbour will still play a part in servicing the MORL project and in other renewable projects in the Moray Firth basin. He pointed out that Wick is 33 kilometres from the wind farm while Fraserburgh is 70km away.\u0026ldquoWe wish Fraserburgh and Moray East well and will continue to develop Wick harbour, Mr Watt said. \u0026ldquoWe will move forward on a strong footing in the renewables market as well as in the fishing and cargo sectors.He added that work on the BOWL base is progressing well and will create upwards of 150 jobs.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay said: \u0026ldquoIt is very disappointing news. Hopes were high this project could come to Wick. There have been a lot of improvements going on at the harbour which has the potential for a positive future.\u0026ldquoI hope other projects can come to Wick and I look forward to seeing improvements on the platform the BOWL project creates for the town and the community in general.

He will be succeeded by Ian Ross, the former East Sutherland and Edderton Highland councillor.Sir Anthony\u0026rsquos decision to step down ends a long association with the area which started in 1993 when he was appointed as chairman of the then UK Atomic Energy Authority. He later chaired AEA Technology and in 2004 took on the role of leading the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) which was responsible for decommissioning Dounreay.In 2008, the then local MP John Thurso asked Sir Anthony to chair Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership. He took on the role and says it has been \u0026ldquoan honour and a privilege to do it.\u0026ldquoI have enjoyed all my time here in my various jobs, he said. \u0026ldquoI do think the partnership has made a major contribution.\u0026ldquoTen years ago the mood was pretty depressed. People were very gloomy. I would say the mood now has changed and is pretty optimistic, although there are challenges. That will always be the case.\u0026ldquoThe big advantage we have here is that it will be a number of years before Dounreay is closed so we had an opportunity to plan for the future. If it had been a car plant it would have been closed in three months.Sir Anthony highlights positive developments such as the improvements at Scrabster and Wick harbours as well as the pioneering MeyGen tidal energy project and the Beatrice offshore wind farm.The North Coast 500 is also making an impact and bringing economic opportunities to the area. The Nucleus archive across from Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport is another plus for Caithness, he adds. Sir Anthony played a part in bringing the facility to the county during his time as chairman of the NDA.Engineering and environmental courses at North Highland College UHI can also help regenerate the Caithness economy. \u0026ldquoThere are real opportunities here, he declared.Improving infrastructure and transport links in the far north are key to helping the area\u0026rsquos economy. Good schools and hospitals are another factor.\u0026ldquoI think the partnership has made a real contribution in the last 10 years, Sir Anthony said. \u0026ldquoWe have worked with other agencies to help create around 1000 jobs over that time but we all had to work together to do it. I am very pleased to see progress being made.Sir Anthony feels it is important to make Caithness as \u0026ldquoattractive as possible for people to come and work in the area.\u0026ldquoThere are still issues to be addressed but, overall, I think significant progress has been made. We played a part but it has always been a contributory role. The partnership is an enabler. The Scottish government has said this area could be an example for other places to follow.Sir Anthony says there is an expertise at Dounreay which \u0026ldquoa lot of places would give their eye teeth to have and it could be used to help the local economy.Caithness strengths are its people, their skills and the natural beauty of the place, but access to the area needs to be improved.Asked about any disappointments during his time as chairman of the partnership, he replied: \u0026ldquoI hoped MeyGen would have got the Contract for Difference \u0026ndash it covers an agreement on the price for the electricity generated \u0026ndash from the UK government, but they did not. That was disappointing. They will now have to find another way forward but are looking at opportunities.Sir Anthony decided to retire as he felt 10 years as chairman was long enough. \u0026ldquoI wanted to leave before people wanted me to, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was time for a change.\u0026ldquoI am delighted with the choice of Ian Ross as my successor. I have had discussions with him and would be willing to help him in any way I can.Sir Anthony, who is 80, will keep a watchful eye on what is happening in Caithness and plans to stay active with his many other interests and hobbies. He enjoys opera, and swims five times a week.He started his career as a systems engineer with IBM in 1962 and went on to become its chief executive and chairman.Sir Anthony and his wife Jennie live in London and have a son, Paul, and a daughter, Caroline.Wednesday 27 Jun 2018 10:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Temporary reprieve for public toilets welcomed","story":"CLOSURE-threatened public toilets in Caithness and other parts of the Highlands have won a temporary reprieve.Highland Council has decided to put its plan on hold until a review of toilet provision in its area is carried out \u0026ndash but it will not be completed until October.In the meantime, the toilets threatened with closure will remain open.The local authority proposed closing 28 of the 96 public toilets in the Highlands while charging 50p for those that stay open. The move would save \u0026pound300,000.Five of the proposed closures were in Caithness and included Thurso harbour, the Camps at Wick, Halkirk, Keiss and Lybster.The council hoped nearby local businesses would adopt the Highland Comfort Scheme and provide public toilets at their premises in exchange for a monthly fee.But there was widespread opposition throughout the north to the closure plan which was seen as damaging to the area and its tourism industry.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay backs the reprieve.\u0026ldquoI absolutely welcome this, he said. \u0026ldquoThis review will give us the opportunity to look at local needs and those of the tourists. It may also give us an incentive to reintroduce the comfort scheme and think about other ways of running the public toilets.\u0026ldquoIf we could get a fixed rate for things like electricity and get development trusts or local communities to look after the toilets that would be a great help. I am pretty confident we could get people throughout the county to help out.\u0026ldquoElectricity companies make huge amounts of money and a little consideration from them would go a long way.Highland Council announced the review after it listened to feedback from communities across the north.Councillor Allan Henderson, the chairman of environment, development and infrastructure, said there is \u0026ldquono quick fix to the problem.But he added: \u0026ldquoThis is about working with communities and potential Highland Comfort Scheme providers to enable a different public toilet delivery model that is sustainable and affordable in local communities.The decision means the toilets under threat of closure will now remain open until the end of October.The controversy over the proposed toilet closure plan has led to local MP Jamie Stone writing to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.In his letter he stresses the contribution tourism makes to the local economyHe describes the plan as \u0026ldquoa backward step which will lead to \u0026ldquogreat inconvenience for locals and visitors alike and said it is being driven by the need to make budget savings.The Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross MP asked the First Minister if additional financial support could be provided to keep the toilets open.\u0026ldquoAny help that can be afforded by the Scottish Government would be very gratefully received by the Highland Council and the people of my constituency, he said.Meanwhile, Highland Council has agreed to review its car-parking policy.The local authority\u0026rsquos redesign board has recommended a new \u0026ldquovision for parking that will addresses traffic management, integrated transport and local economic growth and tourism.

Orkney topped the table in Scotland and was placed tenth in the UK as a whole.While is the responsibility of businesses to make sure they are meeting hygiene standards, local authorities play an important role in ensuring food safety compliance, with enforcement overseen by the Food Standards Agency and Food Standards Scotland.Chairman of Orkney Islands Council’s Development and Infrastructure Committee, Councillor Graham Sinclair, said the results demonstrate constructive working between the Council’s Environmental Health team and the local business community:“We’re delighted yet again to see Orkney feature at the top of this survey.“This consistency speak volumes not only about the quality of the advice and guidance the council team provides, but also the commitment of local businesses to their food safety responsibilities and on providing safe premises and products for their customers.“It reflects very well on Orkney and on the quality eating and dining out experience for locals and visitors alike.

The plans represent an investment of £125 million for investors and would create 385 new jobs.According to the hotel chain, the letter it has sent to OIC sets out how it has supported 12 local authorities in England and Wales, supporting local regeneration, creating jobs and boosting local economies.With similar letters being sent to 19 other councils in Scotland, including Shetland Islands Council, the hotel chain is attempting to show how it could similarly support local communities around the country.These agreements offer a funding structure which the hotel chain says enables local authorities to utilise their existing assets, create jobs, generate income, and help to regenerate land in strategically important locations.Hotels in the programme are built on surplus local authority land, with the funding provided either through the local authority’s internal resource or via low-cost funding from the Public Works Loan Board or third party resources.Upon completion of the hotel development, local authorities would either have the choice of either retaining ownership of the hotel and receive an annual rent into the council’s revenue budget or selling the hotel with Travelodge as its operator.Brian Wallace, Travelodge chairman said: “Many local authorities are in possession of large amounts of property and assets that are not being utilised. Investing in a low-cost hotel like Travelodge is an increasingly attractive choice, as it draws visitors, creates jobs and helps boost the local economy.”“We operate 44 hotels across Scotland. However, the country is growing at pace and attracting visitors from all corners of the globe but there still remains a huge shortage of good quality and great value hotels. To fill this gap, we want to extend our Scottish network with a further 20 hotels and this includes our first hotel in Kirkwall. To help us achieve this, we are writing to Orkney Council, to invite them to consider how Travelodge can act as a catalyst to drive their local development agenda.”A spokesman for Orkney Islands Council has said the local authority is unable to comment at this stage as to date, a proposal has not been received by the council.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Blind from the age of seven as the result of smallpox, the legendary Blind Piper was a pupil of the great MacCrimmon of Skye, going on to compose perhaps the finest piobaireachd ever.The aim of the festival is to encourage pipers under the age of 18 to participate in friendly and relaxing competitions. Chairman Ian Blake of Aultgrishan said it was an exciting setting for competitors and \"will provide visitors to the gardens with a unique opportunity to hear some of the most gifted young inheritors of our much cherished Highland heritage\". Entries are now open in a variety of classes.

It also found that 62 per cent of posts are in professional occupations.Eilean Siar, Glasgow and Highland are the three areas with the highest number of jobs in which Gaelic is considered essential, together accounting for 93 per cent of the Scottish total.The study was welcomed by Deputy First Minister, John Swinney, who commented that the growth in desirable and essential jobs making use of Gaelic language would provide young people with a wealth of exciting career choices.\"I hope that this report will encourage more people to consider learning Gaelic,\" he added.As well as looking at the demand for Gaelic language skills, the report looks at Gaelic education, analyses the opportunities and challenges, and suggests future action.Damien Yeates, chief Executive of SDS, said: \"Developing a detailed evidence base of current and future skills demand is essential for all parts of our economy, and the Gaelic language labour market is no exception.\"Last year SDS published the second edition of its Gaelic language plan, and this study was one of the key commitments contained in that plan.\"The evidence will help inform future investment aimed at promoting the Gaelic language and culture.\"Shona MacLennan, chief executive of B\u0026ograverd na G\u0026agraveidhlig, commented: \"B\u0026ograverd na G\u0026agraveidhlig is clear that growing the number of Gaelic-essential jobs and jobs which use Gaelic is important in ensuring that Gaelic is used more often, by more people and in a wider range of situations.\"The key challenge is to ensure that the flow of people with high quality Gaelic language skills entering the labour market is matched to the demand from employers across the public, private and third sectors, and from across Scotland.\"\u0026nbspFuture actions proposed in the report include forming a national group with responsibility for Gaelic language skills, and increased monitoring and evaluation of the activities supporting the language.Charlotte Wright, Chief Executive of Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE), said: \"Gaelic is fundamental to HIE\u0026rsquos unique remit which integrates economic and community development throughout the Highlands and Islands.\"Our support has helped numerous organisations which enable Gaelic to flourish, and we look forward to continuing to work with businesses, social enterprises and community organisations that can add value through using Gaelic to help realise its full potential.\"Wednesday 27 Jun 2018 10:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

However as soon as he was able, he was back in the saddle.The supermarket worker was delighted with his recent racing success followed by his selection for the GB squad for the world championships at the end of July and beginning of August.\"I really wanted to retain the national title but this year I knew I had my work cut out as I was up against my friend and main competitor Ben Watson who is a full time GB rider,\" he said.\"It was a great race. I felt good going into it and was able to counter any attacks and came down to a sprint where I was able to take the win.\"The news got better when British Cycling announced the world championship squad for this year with my name on it. I\u0026rsquom really looking forward to pulling on the GB kit for the first time.\"The hard work is paying off and I am hoping this is a stepping stone towards becoming a full-time GB rider. I\u0026rsquom really happy at being given this opportunity, being only 18 years old.\"He said the last eight months had only been possible thanks to the generosity of Moray Estates in paying for all his training and racing travel costs.He also thanked Tesco Dingwall which had been flexible with his shifts, allowing him to travel to races.Last year\u0026rsquos Strathpuffer 24-hour endurance event raised \u0026pound1000 to be divided between Fin and the charity Lupus UK.Wednesday 27 Jun 2018 10:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark.

In the battle for the hearts and minds of the Scottish public, the SNP has been losing ground to the Conservatives and Labour as they have launched attack after attack from right and left, in particular over the state of NHS, Scotland’s decidely lacklustre economy, education and the leadership trobules of Police Scotland.            By threatening to overwhelm the Scottish Government, such domestic problems have become a serious risk to the SNP’s reason for being – the cause of Scotish independence.So yesterday there was a distinct air of wiping the slate clean. Out went Health Secretary Shona Robison, who finally succumbed to repeated calls for her resignation, while Justice Secretary Michael Matheson – also the subject of calls to quit – was shunted to transport. This latter move will be seen as a demotion – although it may actually represent an elevation of the sector in the Government’s priorities – but the important point was to remove him from Justice and bring in a fresh face.READ MORE: Scottish Government Cabinet reshuffle: Who’s in and who’s out?While their political opponents have made play of the paucity of talent in the SNP’s ranks, their replacements, Jeane Freeman and Humza Yousaf, are arguably the party’s rising stars. Whether they are actually more capable than Robison and Matheson is open to question. Although John Swinney remains in charge of Scottish education, his flagship Education Bill was shelved, removing another source of tension.             Perception is important in politics. The new appointments will enjoy a honeymoon period and, even if things go badly, any attacks from the opposition are likely to take time to fatally undermine their reputations. So the reshuffle will give Sturgeon some breathing space on the domestic front, which appears to have been the first priority.The promotion of Brexit minister Mike Russell to the Cabinet is the second telling decision. In the newly created post of Cabinet Secretary for Government Business and Constitutional Relations, he will continue to deal with issues around the UK’s departure from the EU but clearly the SNP’s ‘guerrilla war’ against Westminster now requires a higher-ranking general. Thirdly, Keith Brown’s departure from Cabinet will see the SNP’s depute leader concentrate on building the case for independence as the party gears up to take advantage of any Brexit-related turmoil and hold a second referendum.Essentially the reshuffle could be summed up as: dampen down criticism on the home front, ramp up the conflict with Theresa May, and get ready to go to the polls for whatever reason. The challenge for the opposition will be the maintain their attacks and try to make the multiple honeymoons as short as possible. Ousting the SNP from power would scupper hopes for independence for years.            All of this may be good politics, but that doesn’t necessarily make for good goverment. Scots are looking for solutions to real problems with those affecting the NHS chief among them. Its woes may not have been solved by Robison, but she did not create them and Freeman will face the same crisis. Without a stronger economy, there is a limit to how much can be spent so she may need to be imaginative to find solutions.Team Sturgeon has been assembled but, for the sake of the nation, we can only hope this is more than a cosmetic exercise."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4760270.1530035109!/image/image.jpg","title":"scottish government cabinet reshuffle who s in and who s out","story":"\t\tIt is the biggest cabinet reshuffle by an SNP First Minister as Nicola Sturgeon makes seven new appointments in a move that increases here inner circle of senior ministers to 12, so who are the new breed and who are they replacing at Holyrood?\t\t\t\tIN            Humza Yousaf            Moves from Minister for Transport and the Islands to his first cabinet post as Justice Secretary, replacing Michael Matheson.
