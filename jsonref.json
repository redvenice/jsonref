Lee was appealing for action to stop the proposed law.

It didn’t ruin anything though. The crowd were in rapturesI took this shot of Yoko Ono 14 years ago, in 2005 at Patti Smith’s Meltdown, the London festival curated by a different musical icon each year. I’ve always been fascinated by Yoko Ono because of the mythos that surrounds her. She’s often referred to as the woman who split up the Beatles, but there’s so much more to her than that.When I saw her on the lineup I was surprised – she seemed an odd choice. But she is indisputably one of the strongest women in the music industry, she has such a unique sound. When I saw her name, I had to go.That festival was one of the best Meltdowns there has ever been, and Ono’s performance was electrifying. I was perched right in front of centre stage and the anticipation was palpable. The audience was full of different people: lifelong fans, Beatles obsessives, a newer avant garde crowd and a load of celebrities too. As we waited I felt like I was in church – the reverence the crowd had for her was overwhelming.The lights went down and a short film was projected on to a silk screen hanging across the stage. It was transfixing. In one scene, a person walks towards the camera, getting closer and closer, and then at a certain point, the figure in the film became real, on stage, in front of us. Yoko had a slit made in the screen which she came through at the very moment that the figure in the projection was the right size, so it looked like art made life. Everyone was completely taken aback.At the time, she was still interested in bagism – a practice she and Lennon engaged in as a way to deinidualise speakers and emphasise their message by wearing a nondescript bag over their heads. So she came out with this black silk bag obscuring her vision, and walked straight into the mic stand. It didn’t ruin anything though. The crowd were in raptures.In a split second when I managed to take my eyes off her, I realised that Sean Lennon, her and John’s son, was standing in the background bathed in red light. It was utterly spooky. He was the absolute spit of his father, wearing the same glasses with long hair – it was like a vision on stage.I was so transfixed that I almost missed this shot. Only when I took my eyes off Sean did I see Yoko directly above me, leaning over the stage with the power and energy you can see in the photo. I had one chance, and I managed to get the shot.The photo made an impact: it was the photograph that got me working with the Rock Archives, countless people have messaged me about it, and I believe Yoko herself bought a copy. But it’s funny, because I don’t necessarily rate it as one of my best. I think that’s a quirk of photographers: the work they really rate isn’t often the one that resonates with people the most.But I think the image speaks to her power. At the time of this performance, she was around 71, and she’s small. But she should never be underestimated: when she speaks, people listen. When she performs, people watch. You can feel her presence. I think it’s what makes her such an icon.Influences: ‘William Claxton, Linda McCartney, Mick Rock, Annie Leibovitz. The first images that made me want to pick up a camera though were shots of reflections in a glass building that my grandfather took in Newcastle.’ High point: ‘Being one of the first music photographers to give a talk at the O2’s British Music Experience along with Jill Furmanovskyand Phillip “Mr Sixties” Townsend. ’Low point: ‘Meeting an out-of-sorts Sean Connery. However, I did walk away with a wonderful piece of advice: “If you’re gonna be schmaartt, be shmaarrttaa” and he’s still a hero of mine.’Top tip: ‘Even if you’re in a crowd in the pit in front of stage, try and do something different. Do what you’re not supposed to and enjoy every moment.’• Nile Rodgers’ Meltdown festival is at the Southbank Centre, London, until 11 August."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56c3cbfb17fbf182840b65b25b16293282c9b0bd/0_0_5760_3840/master/5760.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a5e0f3c84d47c8bc8ea833f198836879 1400w","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of them Welcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.“It’s Mark Twain these days,” says voicefrombelgrade, “I’m rereading his short story collection”:Every time I read The Experience Of The McWilliamses With Membranous Croup, Extracts from Adam’s Diary, Eve’s Diary, The Stolen White Elephant... I just love them. Also, I pilfered Tom Sawyer from my late father’s library (all right, I’ll take it back, my mom won’t even know that I took it...) – it’s a masterful Serbian translation from the 1949 (the author is Stanislav Vinaver). It’s relatively rare to find a translation that’s as good as the original, but this one really is, and I just have to revisit it every so often.BaddHamster is “finishing up” The House Of Sleep by Jonathan Coe:Warm, funny, breezily paced (as always with him) and a few interesting thoughts on the nature of sleep. Basically, if you like Coe, you’ll probably enjoy it. I do and I am.And CharlieBing “just finished” Judith Schalansky’s Pocket Atlas of Remote Islands:As a cartographer by training and a sometime graphic artist by trade, I just loved almost every bit of this beautifully designed book ... a minor quibble with the occasional use of yellow text on white pages, but the typography is exquisite, the whole conceit just wonderful.Michael, a retired headmaster grieving for his wife, the victim of a terrorist attack, asks himself the question of who is really responsible for what happened, not the bombers themselves, not the bomb makers, but the ‘bomb-triggerers’ – the politician enriching himself from his time in office. There’s much more to this story than vengeance though the narration soon reveals darker aspects of Michael’s character as he recalls his career. Good’s skill is in the narrator considering himself as a realist struggling with difficult pupils, but coming over to the reader as anything but that, and a cruel authoritarian.As an ex-teacher of 31 years, this is an admirably accurate portrayal of some headteacher’s traits I have seen all too frequently.Reading Isabel Allende’s Daughter Of Fortune has been “an exquisite pleasure” for PatLux:Such a rich historical novel in which I, like one of the main protagonists Tao Chi’en, learned lots. I loved the lyrical evocative prose which stimulated all my senses. One of those books that makes you feel you are on a delightful journey with the characters and evokes laughter and sadness. And it stays with you in the intervals between when you put it down and pick it up again. I will definitely be reading more Allende.MachenBach recommends Augustus Carp, Esq., By Himself: Being the Autobiography of a Really Good Man:A satirical mock-autobiography, published anonymously by Sir Henry Howarth Bashford in 1924. Anthony Burgess singled it out as one of the 20th century’s funniest books, but I would say that it’s consistently amusing, rather than LOL funny. Still, that’s rare enough to be noteworthy. Carp is possessed of a Pooterishly inflated sense of his own (and his father’s) importance, and almost total blindness to his own limitations and motivations. He’s a hilariously sanctimonious self-professed Christian (or “Xtian”), who frequently goes out into the streets to lecture smokers, drinkers and music hall artistes on the evils of their ways, but who seems hypocritically blind to his own acts of bullying, blackmail, and greed. Like a monstrous cross between Pooter and Ignatius J Reilly, his voice is impressively realised, and the irony well sustained. I’m not sure how much real satirical bite it had at the time – it seems rather more 1890s than 1920s in many ways, and the joke does wear a little thin long before he gets his comeuppance, but it’s very well-written (in a pretentiously archaic register) and generally good fun.Finally, Dennis89 suggests we give “serious thought” to reading An Armenian Sketchbook by Vasily Grossman:A 200-page account detailing the writer’s reflections, thoughts and wanderings during his visit to Armenia at the twilight of his life. Justification for the journey is provided by the task of editing a Russian translation of a local Armenian novel though the trip allows Grossman to explore and delve far more deeply into this marginalised and often overlooked country.Faith, patriotism, oppression, comradeship and other such topics are beautifully mused upon in this life-affirming gem of a book.Sounds fantastic. (That’s also an excellent excuse to link to Linda Grant’s fine article on reading Grossman: “It took me three weeks to read it and three weeks to recover from the experience.”)If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

Sources close to the situation said the chances of such support being forthcoming had been boosted by the change of government, highlighting the appointment of Simon Clarke as exchequer secretary to the Treasury. The department is likely to be pivotal in talks about government involvement in a rescue.Clarke is MP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, a steel heartland that includes British Steel’s special profiles ision at Skinningrove. He has previously written about the importance of saving British Steel.The Labour MP Anna Turley, whose constituency included the Redcar steelworks which closed in 2015, said she had asked the government for assurances about selling British Steel as a whole entity. “The secretary of state and EY confirmed this is still the priority,” she said. “Everyone is working flat out to progress the sale to the next stage. Optimism that this can be achieved soon remains high.“We also discussed the commitments we would like to see from any buyer, including investment in the assets, enhanced training and protection of the terms and conditions of the workforce. Long-term commitment to the business and the UK steel industry is a priority too.”The pace of talks has accelerated in recent weeks as pressure grows from lenders to the business, whose operations have been funded by the government while talks continue. If the company had collapsed, the government would have had first call on any money that could be retrieved, limiting the extent of creditor refunds.A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: “This government will leave no stone unturned to get a good solution for British Steel at Scunthorpe, Skinningrove and on Teesside.”If discussions with Ataer break down, two other bidders are waiting in the wings although a deal with either could prove complicated.Liberty Global, led by the Indian-born metals tycoon Sanjeev Gupta, would prefer to convert the Scunthorpe works from a blast furnace plant, which makes steel from scratch. It is seeking government loan guarantees to replace the blast furnaces with electric arc furnaces, which would be used to make products by recycling scrap steel.Greybull Capital, the investment group that owned British Steel when it collapsed into insolvency, is understood to remain interested in picking up parts of the business if the government’s preference for selling the whole business does not materialise. In that scenario, the Scunthorpe steelworks would be likely to close for good.Allowing Greybull to cherrypick the best parts of a business that it owned when it collapsed could prove politically unpalatable, observers have said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96fb9ec4cacee1695902efaf23eed8333e6ed816/0_91_5695_3417/master/5695.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0330a60087c3bb04bc75eec453377235","title":"hargreaves lansdown to lose 2m by waiving fees on neil woodford fund","story":"Cost of customer concession revealed in investment group’s annual resultsThe investment group Hargreaves Lansdown will lose more than £2m in revenues after waiving fees for nearly 300,000 customers locked in Neil Woodford’s suspended flagship fund.The costs were revealed in Hargreaves’ annual results, which showed that it was giving up about £360,000 of revenue a month by temporarily scrapping fees for clients who had invested through its platform in the Woodford Equity Income Fund.With Woodford’s fund likely to be gated until at least December, Hargreaves is on track to lose out on £2.1m of client fees over a six-month period.Hargreaves decided to waive fees for 291,520 of its clients – around one in four of its total customer base – who were affected by his decision to halt withdrawals on 3 June from the £3.7bn fund. Woodford suspended trading in the fund after struggling to fulfil a surge in withdrawal requests sparked by a series of bad market bets.The gating of the fund has left £1.6bn of Hargreaves’ client investments trapped for months.Hargreaves has been criticised for promoting Woodford’s flagship fund on its Wealth 50 list of favourite investments, despite concerns about the size of his investments in smaller and unlisted companies, which are harder to sell. Hargreaves said it was also aware of the fund’s underperformance but kept it on the list in the hope it would bounce back.The chief executive, Chris Hill, said: “I have apologised to all clients who have been impacted by the recent problems around the Woodford Equity Income Fund, because we all share their disappointment and frustration.“In these difficult times we recognise the financial and personal impact the gating of the fund has had on them. Our priority is to support them, keep them informed and ensure that the fund reopens as soon as is practicable.”Hill confirmed that he would be giving up his annual bonus over the debacle. He previously said he would not take his payout until the Woodford fund reopened but has now decided to forgo it completely. His bonus last year totalled £1.7m.Hargreaves’ finance chief, Philip Johnson, whose bonus was £997,000 last year, will also scrap his 2019 bonus. It is understood that Mark Dampier, the research director, and Lee Gardhouse, the chief investment officer, whose pay is not disclosed, will also lose their bonuses."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b01e3b6f908551f1ee514b491acdb72f1812d11f/141_0_1003_602/master/1003.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8d4c8f84c39e3edead9e1c6e269dd36","title":"sorry hargreaves landsdown apology neil woodford","story":"CEO’s airy expression of sympathy over Neil Woodford affair is singularly unimpressiveA modern trend with corporate apologies is to get them in early while being gloriously vague about what it is you are apologising for. Hargreaves Lansdown adopted this approach with the Neil Woodford affair, as mentioned here on Wednesday, in the hope that its chief executive, Chris Hill, would offer clarity when unveiling the group’s full-year profits.No chance. Hill wouldn’t budge from his flat script. He says he has apologised to clients trapped in the Woodford Equity Income Fund “because we all share their disappointment and frustration”. OK, but that reads like an airy expression of sympathy rather than an apology for any action by Hargreaves.Does Hill, for example, think Hargreaves overstepped the role of a nominally neutral platform provider in being so bullish about all things Woodford? Does he regret sticking with the fund manager until the end? Does he think that Hargreaves should have yanked the Equity Income fund from its Wealth 50 list as soon it started to worry about liquidity risks, which was as long ago as November 2017, as detailed in Hill’s own letter to the Treasury select committee?He won’t be drawn. He says there will be “learnings and improvements we can make” but, even two months after the Woodford fund suspended dealings, he’s not yet in a position to share them. His only substantive conclusion is that “we are confident in the robustness of how we analyse, research and compile our favourite fund list”.It would, of course, be absurd to expect Hargreaves to pick only winners in its “best buy” list. That task would be impossible. But then we’re back at the beginning. What is the apology supposed to cover?It would be hard, though, to say Hill’s personal stock has risen during this saga. He waited until the 11th hour to forgo his bonus and still can’t say what, if anything, Hargreaves would have done differently. Not impressive.Maurice Tulloch became chief executive of the giant insurer Aviva only in March, so long-suffering shareholders will have to wait until November to see his new strategy, which is fair enough. In the meantime, he’s serving an amuse-bouche – a review of the Asian operation.This may ultimately amount to little, it should be said, since doing nothing is an option. But the outcome could also be the sale of a unit worth $2bn-plus, according to analysts, or a joint venture partnership with a local operator.Even a formal review suggests a willingness to be radical, or so investors will hope. Asia, after all, was a pet project of the former boss Mark Wilson, whose grand claim to have transformed Aviva is not reflected in the share price. At 389p, the shares sit at 2013 levels. At the birth of Aviva, via a three-way merger at the turn of the century, the stock was at £11.That long-term perspective should serve as a prompt to Tulloch. His many predecessors have voiced his same ambition to make Aviva “simpler” but none has achieved it. If the only effective way is to start by making the insurer smaller, go for it.The litigation funder Burford Capital is as angry as ever about the attack from short-selling US hedge Muddy Waters, but let’s give it some credit. Thursday’s nine-page counter-blast was a decent production. It was written in English, rather than legalese, which was a virtue. Some of the tangled legal cases Burford fights almost became intelligible."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b91ca2b9ab9f97517931f90d69bb9b12d8a3fd9d/0_317_4749_2849/master/4749.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c71af98f3ef25f0c0008ad9e22868caf","title":"drop sterling pound no deal brexit","story":"The threat of a no-deal Brexit has sent the pound plummeting. The British people must be given a chance to halt itAs our currency plummeted last week, politicians were remarkably quiet. In normal times, a catastrophic slide in the pound would send a shockwave through Westminster. An emergency cabinet meeting might have been called. The chancellor might have made an announcement, calming markets and reassuring the public.But these aren’t normal times. Over the past three years, politics has been increasingly blind to the concerns of ordinary people. The Brexit debate is stuck on abstract constitutional issues such as the backstop. While they are important matters, the relentless focus of public discourse on them means that we are in danger of forgetting about the lives of real people. Westminster is gripped by a fanatical race towards a cliff-edge Brexit and nobody is stopping to think about the impact it would have on the everyday lives of the people we serve as politicians.We cannot dismiss this as a trivial bump in the road. This matters, because a no-deal Brexit is now the number one threat to the value of our currency, a fundamental factor driving this nation’s prosperity. And as Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, put it, a fall in the pound “makes those of us whose earnings or savings or investment income is in pounds poorer. Period.” We simply cannot ignore the impact this is having on people in our country.August is the most popular month for Brits to go on holiday. This month, some 6 million people will go on a trip to a eurozone destination, during which they will spend an average of £574 per head, according to the Office for National Statistics. Whereas before the referendum, that would have bought a UK holidaymaker €740 on the continent, now the same spend is worth only €620. In other words, our politicians’ dangerous no-deal Brexit musings have cost travellers more than £100 per person already.Supermarket prices are also likely to be affected. Much of what we buy relies on products from the EU – purchases that British importers make in euros. A simple look at UN trade data of what we import from the eurozone reveals that the plummeting pound has already meant an increased import cost each year of £200m on French wines, £50m on fruit from Spain, and £40m on chocolates from Belgium.This is a real and present shock to UK businesses. But most importantly, it is consumers who will likely end up paying the price for this. Increased costs in imports for products will be passed on to customers. That means higher prices in the shops.The sheer drop in sterling since 2016 is only a taste of what’s to come if we continue down the destructive route of a no-deal Brexit. Instead of continuing the ideological race to the cliff edge, we have a duty to consider the interests of ordinary people. Leaving people worse off financially is a Brexit outcome nobody supports, whether they voted leave or remain.That is why it is time to think again. A fresh democratic mandate is key to this big decision, now that the circumstances have changed so much. This is why we must hand the choice back to the British people in a referendum.• Sam Gyimah is the Conservative MP for East Surrey."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b13306af5303e7694445aab79386a53a6fafed6f/0_79_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc6f5e5a4fee8cbf9134cebfa146854f","title":"independence scotland inevitable scot nicola sturgeon","story":"If I were a Scot I’d vote for independence tomorrow. This crisis is Nicola Sturgeon’s opportunityI hope Scotland and Nicola Sturgeon realise how much they may yet owe Boris Johnson. If I were a Scot, I would vote for independence tomorrow. I would want nothing more to do with the shambles of today’s Westminster parliament, which goes on holiday for a month during the worst political crisis in a generation. Labour’s John McDonnell is entirely correct to reassure the Scots of their right to secede from the United Kingdom. The supreme civil right is that to self-government, and the inferior tier of a federation is entitled to claim it, not the superior one to permit.Johnson’s sidekick Dominic Cummings this week warned politicians that they “don’t get to choose which votes they respect”. That is exactly what Cummings and Johnson are doing. They are choosing to ignore the Brexit referendum pledge of frictionless trade, and Johnson is refusing to allow Sturgeon a referendum on independence. Sauce for the Brexit goose is sauce for the tartan gander. No wonder Johnson was about as welcome in Edinburgh last week as Donald Trump in El Paso.This crisis is Sturgeon’s opportunity. Not much is certain at Westminster these days. No-dealers are fighting with no-confidencers. People’s voters are fighting with proroguers. Jeremy Corbyn is fighting with “national unity” rivals for a taxi to the palace. It is chaos.Only one thing seems sure. In the coming months, either before or after another election, the current bloc of 35 SNP MPs will be able to hold Westminster to ransom in a hung parliament, with or without the Liberal Democrats. It was mere prudence for McDonnell to suggest that Labour “would not use parliamentary devices” to block Sturgeon’s independence referendum, which she has demanded within two years, come what may.Johnson is in a long line of Westminster leaders determined to infuriate the Scots – as a century ago they once infuriated the Irish. With the exception of Tony Blair’s partial devolution, London has simply ignored the progressive disintegration of the “first British empire”, the one that has embraced the British Isles since the Norman conquest and was cohered as a supposed United Kingdom in 1801. While France, Germany and Italy (if not Spain) have steadily assimilated their disparate provinces over time, the United Kingdom has done the opposite. Through persistent, bumbling misrule it has alienated the so-called Celtic fringe, and fuelled the fires of separatism.Nonetheless, parliament has been the cockpit of this alienation. Ireland’s many revolts came to a head in the 1880s, in a parliamentary pact between Gladstone and Parnell for home rule in Dublin. It failed to pass the House of Lords.The ensuing bloodshed vitiated what might have been “independence-lite” and led to total independence in 1922. What had been almost a third of the population of the new kingdom vanished, leaving London with the political conundrum of Ulster to the present day.The misgovernment of Ireland was then replicated in Scotland, culminating in Margaret Thatcher’s pilot poll tax in 1989. Scottish separatism, previously unthinkable, surged overnight. By the 2015 election, Scottish nationalists had won 56 out of Scotland’s 59 Westminster seats. Poll tax abolition and devolution had not worked.London now faces precisely the dilemma that faced Gladstone: whether to negotiate “independence-lite”, or face a further breakup of the UK, as in 1922. Central to this is Brexit, and what it does to the Scottish independence cause.Referendum voters asked to decide on their nation’s destiny rarely look to personal gain or commercial advantage. England’s Brexit voters were concentrated in parts of Britain with most to lose from Brexit. Economists may assert that big countries enjoy economies of scale. The Scots may be told time and again by England that they are better off under London and its subsidies. But voters are more concerned with national identity, pride, self-reliance and local accountability.Scotland has the same population as Denmark, with much the same resources, infrastructure and talent. Once it was richer by far. Today its GDP per person is $33,000 against Denmark’s $63,000. I am sure the slide lies in Scotland’s long economic dependency on the UK.Denmark would no more think of re-entering its former union with Norway than of leaving the EU. It enjoys small-state autonomy, and clearly prospers from it. It is a rich, happy country.Sooner or later, London will be forced to grow up and recognise that it has sacrificed the right to rule the British Isles. Ireland has gone and Scotland will clearly go one day. Whitehall should take the initiative and prepare a fiscal and legislative independence package one that withdraws Scots MPs from Westminster and sees Scotland rejoin the EU, but keeps travel, currency and citizenship ties in place.If Johnson really does stick to no deal – or its bastard sibling, hard Brexit – he will drive Scotland to separation. Like it or not, this means borders. To the absurdity of inspection posts in Fermanagh and Tyrone will be added posts in Berwick and Carlisle. Johnson will then have to tell the Queen that she must be just Queen of England – and perhaps Wales."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ceed7195f7d2a41d35de233cdf45db1842a1ce2/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=324326e8d7023a19f2c6a4c6e7b3178a","title":"why are more women than ever applying to be miss england in the age of instagram","story":"Despite widespread derision of beauty pageants – and the potential to become a model or influencer through social media – applications have risen to 20,000, as aspiring contestants attempt to show a more modern side to the faded glamour contestOn a humid July night in Newcastle upon Tyne, the launch party for Miss England 2019 is under way. In an unassuming grey-brick hotel, tucked away behind a multi-storey car park, the 52 finalists have gathered in their evening gowns, artificial silk sashes draped over their shoulders to display which region they represent and identifying numbers strapped to their wrists. The atmosphere is not unlike a high-school prom – nervous boyfriends lurk outside the banqueting hall clutching makeup cases, parents roam the hallways eager to catch a glimpse of their daughters and the finalists are always aware of the judges scattered throughout the room.Established in 1928, Miss England is the UK’s longest-running beauty pageant, although some would argue pageantry has an even longer history in Britain, with its roots in choosing May Queens for traditional May Day celebrations. Today, however, such competitions are often the focus of mockery and criticism – from the allegations of racism and bullying at Tonga’s July pageant to the car-crash reality-show portrayals such as Toddlers and Tiaras or Sandra Bullock’s turn in Miss Congeniality. Despite that, and the fact that the traditional spoils for the contestants – a modelling career and public profile – could arguably be more easily acheived in 2019 via a carefully curated Instagram feed, or reality show, somehow, beauty pageants are flourishing. Applications to compete in Miss England have been rising – reaching more than 20,000 this year.In the age of social-media influencers, what is the enduring appeal for these 16- to 27-year-olds across the country?“Pageants aren’t something I ever thought I’d be a part of,” says finalist Aysha Khan. “I used to think it was all about appearances, but last September, I saw posts online and realised it was more about community.” Motivated by the competition’s charitable focus – contestants must raise as much money as possible for their chosen organisations (this year it is the suicide prevention charity Papyrus) to take part – Khan decided to compete in her local Miss Lancashire – and won.“I live in Blackburn and I’ve worked on projects to help my local Muslim community there since I was 12,” she says. “It might seem strange to use a beauty pageant to raise awareness for community issues, but it’s such a big platform I thought it was worth a try and that I might have some fun while I’m at it.” Khan attracted attention when she entered the optional swimwear round in a wetsuit. “I didn’t want to change myself to compete,” she says. “This isn’t a field that many Asians go into, so I want to spread the right message and change people’s perspectives. I wanted to show people a different side to pageants, that it’s about personality and character.”There has been some backlash from religious groups who inisist Khan’s appearance in the competition is indecent, but she is determined to continue. “Miss England is the chance to become a role model and lead the next generation of young women by example,” she says.It is this that sets beauty queens apart from social media stars, argues the finalist and junior doctor Bhasha Mukherjee. “You’re representing a brand if you’re an influencer, whereas here, you’re representing your country. The pageant is about being a person of the world so much more than just yourself. It really humbles your ego.”Talk to anyone involved in beauty pageants these days and this is the theme: pageants are not about beauty but “character and personality”, “charity” and, crucially of course, “empowerment”. It is a modern defence against the criticism levelled at competitions since 1968, when the burgeoning Women’s Liberation Movement targeted the Miss America final. The women threw anything that represented the physical oppression of women into a “freedom trash can” (famously misrepresented as “bra burning”) to show how beauty standards oppress women. In 1970, there were similar protests against Miss World in London. The journalist and activist Joan Smith was sent to cover local beauty pageants in Lancashire in the early 70s while working as a junior reporter. “I thought it was pure anachronism, even then,” she says. “These pageants directly exploit the idea that appearances are the most important thing for women.” Despite their socially conscious rebranding, she still believes they are a deeply damaging presence. “Pageants feed on the perpetual anxieties of young women and their longevity only proves that there’s always money to be made from exploiting women,” she says. “They promote a very old-fashioned standard of beauty – with most winners being white or blond.”The lack of ersity in pageantry has long been a criticism of the industry with competitions such as Miss Black and Beautiful, which represented the Caribbean diaspora in England in the 1970s, having all but disappeared now. Leah Prescod, a former pageant competitor, set up Miss British Beauty Curve in 2012 for women over a size 14, in which more than 200 contestants have competed. “I wanted to create a space where women who don’t think they fit the mould of a beauty queen could compete,” she says. “It might seem strange to use a competitive environment to build confidence, but sometimes getting on stage and out of your comfort zone is the only way to realise your inner strength.”Unlike Miss England, which made the infamous swimsuit round offstage and optional in 2010, Prescod’s pageant encourages swimsuits. “We have all ages from 18 to people in their 60s competing. We want them to feel good about themselves,” she says. “Lots of the girls have never worn a bikini before, let alone in public, so it’s not easy to get up and do it, but they find it really rewarding and they gain a lot of respect for one another in the process.”Kat Henry, the 35-year-old winner of Miss British Beauty Curve 2015, agrees. “It was the first time I’d been so open and exposed. I wore things which I never would have done normally,” she says. “It made me realise I have the same right as anyone else to be up on that stage. Beauty isn’t all there is to a pageant – it’s about women empowering other women.”Confidence-building may be a recurring theme , but aligning inidual confidence with the idea that being rated in a pageant is somehow empowering for women in general may seem a stretch. Pratishtha Raut, 26, had anxiety issues at university and reached crisis point in her final year when she didn’t leave her house for 29 days. “I didn’t know what was happening to me because I was brought up thinking mental health was for ‘crazy’ people,” she says. “After seeking help and getting better, it has been a passion of mine to advocate for better mental health, especially among my Nepalese community. That’s why I was drawn to compete in Miss England, because their chosen charity this year is Papyrus.”Raut has raised more than £9,000 and says the competition has also unexpectedly brought her closer to her parents. “In Nepal, modelling isn’t classified as a real job and so my parents pushed me to focus on my career,” she says. “But going through this process has showed them that this could also be an option for me, along with the charity advocacy. They’re actually more into it than me because they’re so competitive – all they talk about is Miss England.”Yet the seedier side of pageantry can be a problem. The 1980s kitsch aesthetic is cloyingly persistant – visible in the sequins, sashes and tiaras that bring to mind the televised Miss Universe pageants (at one time, the rights to which were owned by Donald Trump). Here, women would be paraded on stage in only a bikini and heels, their “vital statistics” read out to the mainly white and male audience. And there is also the question of money. While Miss England is free to enter, contestants speak of competitions where entrance fees can be up to £1,000 in a pay-to-win scenario. There is also the cost of buying ball gowns, haircare, makeup and transport, although the majority of finalists have local sponsors.“Anyone can buy the license to put on a pageant from the patent office,” says the director of Miss England, Angie Beasley. “There are a lot of new competitions coming up – people are just buying titles and buying their way into national finals.” For Beasley, the appeal of Miss England isn’t just about history or a formalised judging process. “Miss England is something for the girls to aspire to be – it’s not the perfection of social media accounts, it’s showing your humanity and beliefs within a competitive setting.”Beasley points to the fact there is a Mr England competition to counter to the idea that such pageants objectify women. The men’s pageant runs once every two years and attracts a fraction of the applications of its female counterpart. Mr England 2013, Jordan Williams, is hosting Miss England’s live social-media coverage of the final and says competitors are looking for “a bit of fun, to meet other people and to raise money for charity. And if it’s objectifying to women, it’s objectifying to me, then, because I’ve been a part of it.”Of course, a men’s competition only shows that men can be objectified too – however willingly they submit to it. Finalist Mukherjee, however, has a slightly different argument. “Women get objectified wherever we go,” she says. “So why not use it to our advantage? If people are going to look at us because you’re beautiful, why not use it to push forward a positive, charitable message?” Surely there are easier ways to get your message across? “The glamour world is glamorous at the top and filthy when you get into it. At the same time, medicine is de-glam from the outside but beautiful on the inside. You need both in life,” she says. “You have to look for the positives and use what you’re given.”If beauty pageants are now so anti-beauty and pro-social change, why not change their name and change their format? “You can’t just throw away this history,” says 2015 Miss England winner Natasha Hemmings. “We are changing with the times and, ultimately, it’s such an honour to represent your country at Miss World – it’s no different from the Olympics or any other elite achievement.”Back in the banqueting suite, where floor-to-ceiling metallic curtains are shimmering and fallen sequins are crushed underfoot on the pearl-white catwalk, it is Mukherjee who is crowned Miss England 2019. There follows the inevitable burst of confetti, tears and tiaras. Millie Mae Margetts counts this as her fourth loss, but is undeterred. “I’ve got the bug – I look forward to it every year and it’s become such a passion of mine,” she says.Meanwhile, Mukherjee is starting her new hospital rotation in the morning and looking forward to Miss World next year. “This is where the real work begins,” she says. “Being a doctor is the same as being Miss England, because they’re both about being a role model and an ambassador for good causes. I can’t wait to get started.”For the other contestants, the long ride home awaits until the whole process to begin again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0de8d4cf9e6d50e81f661ab0959b20ec4c691a2/0_0_1062_637/master/1062.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a1723b78c85dde5f10996d077378628","title":"sequins and stardom the fashion legacy of the supremes","story":"From homemade dresses to glittering gowns, Motown’s most successful act became well known for their iconic stage attire.

But which film spin-offs delivered, and which were cynical cash-ins?For the uninitiated, a Bratz doll is a Barbie doll without any of the intellectual heft. Accordingly, Bratz: The Movie is what Mean Girls would have been if everyone gave the impression of being there against their will. A terrible, miserable, cynical film that would have exploded if it had contained a single original idea.Not to be confused with the 2017 movie of the same name or the myriad straight-to-video sequels, My Little Pony: The Movie rode the mid-80s wave of animated toy films that also brought us The Care Bears Movie and Pound Puppies and the Legend of Big Paw (more of which later). In this film, the ponies are forced to band together to save their land from a sentient purple gunk with a song called Nothing Can Stop the Smooze, which sounds exactly like what dying must feel like.Again, not to be confused with the animated TV series, this reimagining starred the likes of Thora Birch, Jeremy Irons and one of the guys who played Jimmy Olsen in The New Adventures of Superman. The 39th worst film of all time, according to a reader poll in Empire magazine a decade ago, it hasn’t improved with age.I’m including this in the list partly because it is loosely based on a Tamagotchi competitor, and partly because it’s terrible. Flung together with little attention paid to tone, plot or continuity, it was released to cash in on a fad while there was money to be made. To make matters worse, the soundtrack contains a song by the Barenaked Ladies.Once a concussed-looking, moss-haired dullard with no genitals and shifty eyes, the classic action figure was reimagined in GI Joe: The Rise of Cobra as a film you already forgot existed. Channing Tatum was in it, Joseph Gordon-Levitt was in it, Sienna Miller was in it, but even they couldn’t scrape together anything worth remembering.The world’s dullest board game becomes the world’s most pointless film. The game didn’t feature aliens. It didn’t feature Rihanna. It didn’t feature a ship insulting the laws of physics by doing a handbrake turn in the middle of the ocean. But the film did. Oh boy, the film did.Rainbow Brite is a yellow-haired doll who wears colourful clothes. However, for some reason, she is also the owner of one of the most convoluted mythologies in toy history. She is originally a girl called Wisp tasked with bringing colour to a grey world by locating a magical sphere. There’s a magic belt and some Colour Children, and they’re all in charge of a different colour or something. And there’s a horse and a robot horse. And this film is absolutely not worth watching.Pound Puppies were toys that looked like dogs, but in the toy-film boom of the 1980s, that was apparently enough to warrant a movie. Pound Puppies and the Legend of Big Paw operates on the berserk assumption that the children of 1988 wanted nothing more than to watch a bunch of cartoon dogs perform pastiches of 30-year-old rock’n’roll standards. It is the lowest-grossing toy-based film ever theatrically released.Are Trolls even toys? Aren’t they just pencil toppers, or ornaments designed for murderers to collect? Whatever, they made a Trolls film, and it doubled as a jukebox musical for songs that deserved much better than to end up in a forgettable-to-annoying animated Justin Timberlake vehicle. Even my four-year-old hates this, and he’s four, for the love of God.I know what you’re thinking: “But Transformers is terrible. Every Transformers film has been an incomprehensible, overlong mishmash of damp mythology, impenetrable battle sequences and scene after scene where the camera uncomfortably leers over the bodies of young women. The Transformers series is utterly and unforgivably without any merit whatsoever. Why the hell is it all the way up at No 10?” My answer is this: I agree, but cut me a break. I’m dying here.You thought GI Joe: The Rise of Cobra was forgettable? Guess what – they made a sequel, and it was even more forgettable. Do you remember GI Joe: Retaliation? Do you remember that London got completely levelled in it? Do you remember that Bruce Willis plays General Colton, who was actually the first ever GI Joe figure back in the 60s? Do you remember that the lead actor was the goddamn Rock? No, me neither.Jem is the singer in a band. Her best friend is a “holographic computer” called Synergy. This is the most 1980s premise for a toy ever, so of course it makes perfect sense that it wasn’t turned into a film until 2015. The resulting movie had the worst opening of the year and the worst opening ever for a film released by a major studio. Universal pulled it from screens after a fortnight, and the director claimed to have received death threats. So why is it all the way up at No 8? Like I said, all these films are terrible. I really can’t reiterate that enough.You probably have the Care Bears to blame for this whole films-based-on-toys nightmare. The Care Bears Movie – about a group of bears who live on a cloud and hypnotise the depressed into being happy or something – contained original plot-specific songs by Carole King and made its money back 16 times over. And you know what? It’s quite good. Sue me.Lego Batman was the breakout star of The Lego Movie, thanks to the hilarious way he communicated that he was a depressed orphan. He was given a spin-off as a result and, while it never quite hit the heights of The Lego Movie, it was still the best Batman film in about a decade.Board games tend not to translate very well to the big screen (see Battleship), but Clue just about managed to buck the trend. Clue took Cluedo and turned it into a work of high farce, with the likes of Tim Curry, Madeline Kahn and Lesley Ann Warren yucking it up for all they were worth. Three endings were shot for this film, each declaring a different murderer if you saw it in a cinema, the ending was chosen at random. If you watch it now, you get to watch all three in a row, which is very confusing if it’s on TV in 1992, and you’re a helpless child.Oh sure, it’s flawed. Oh sure, it grabs all the fun intergalactic action of the cartoon and transplants it to dreary old mid-80s US. Oh sure, it invented the abomination that was Gwildor because Orko was too difficult to get right on-screen. And the plot revolves too heavily around synthesisers. And it contains the single most generic James Tolkan role ever committed to screen. But you know what? Frank Langella was one hell of a Skeletor. I will die on this hill.When it was first announced, The Lego Movie seemed like an act of pure craven greed. So what an amazing surprise to discover that The Lego Movie was an incredible vehicle for the toy – show me a more tactile-looking animation and I’ll eat my hat – and a sly critique of the toy’s biggest fans. For what is Will Ferrell’s Lord Business if not an uptight, overwrought, order-obsessed Lego fanatic? This film could have been No 1, had all the sequels and spin-offs not diluted its punchy appeal.I know what you’re thinking: “But didn’t you already do Transformers?” And, yes, I did, but only the Michael Bay live-action horror-shows. The animated Transformers movie, by comparison, is a masterpiece. This is the film, remember, that had an incredibly child-unfriendly soundtrack. This is the film in which Orson Welles played a robot who could turn into a planet. This is the film where – spoiler alert – Optimus Prime was murdered in the first act. Did nobody think of the toy sales?Based on a 1962 trading card series, Mars Attacks! is Tim Burton at his absolute giddiest. Gone was the creeping melancholy of Edward Scissorhands. Still to come was his descent into Disney yes-man. And here, right in the middle, is a silly, goofy, star-filled pastiche of whatever Burton felt like pastiching on any given day. At the time, it was his worst-reviewed film to that point, but to watch it now is to see a sense of aggressive playfulness you just don’t often get to witness. Tom Jones shouts: “JESUS CHRIST!” at a Martian. Honestly, what more do you people want?Actors playing nightmarish versions of themselves in cinema - ranked!Michael Caine\u0027s best films - ranked!The 10 best Glenn Close movies - ranked!Tom Cruise - top 20 movies - ranked!Judi Dench - every film - ranked!Ryan Gosling movies - ranked!10 best Hugh Grant films - ranked!Nicole Kidman’s top 10 films - ranked!The best and the worst Jennifer Lopez films - ranked!All Helen Mirren\u0027s 61 movies - ranked!Robert Redford\u0027s greatest screen roles - ranked!Winona Ryder\u0027s 20 best films - ranked!Movie Santa Clauses - ranked!Jason Statham - every film - ranked!Emma Thompson\u0027s best films - ranked!Biopics trashed by families, friends and fans - ranked!Purr evil: cats in movies with hidden agendas - ranked!Dog weepie movies - ranked!Top 20 J-horror films - ranked!Movies that have grossed more than $1bn - ranked!Palme d\u0027Or winners - ranked!The scariest horror films ever - ranked!The best Shakespeare films - ranked!The 10 best movie shark performances - ranked!From Trolls to Transformers: toy films – ranked!Worst holidays in cinema - ranked!James Bond on film – 007\u0027s best and worst movies - ranked!The 20 best Marvel films - ranked!Top 10 Merchant Ivory films - ranked!Pixar - every film ever made - ranked!Planet of the Apes - the best and worst of the movies - ranked!Star Wars - every film - ranked!The 20 best music documentaries - ranked!The weirdest Brits performances - ranked!Game of Thrones - every episode - ranked!Oscar nominees - the weirdest ever - ranked!Oscar snubs - the 20 greatest ever - ranked!The biggest Rock \u0026amp Roll Hall of Fame snubs ever - ranked!Super Bowl half-time shows - the 10 greatest - ranked!The best X Factor finalists - ranked!From Niall Horan\u0027s toast to Russell Crowe’s jockstrap: celebrity auction items - ranked!All Abba\u0027s UK singles - ranked!Every one of Madonna\u0027s 78 singles - ranked!Kate Bush – every UK single - ranked!Queen\u0027s 50 UK singles - ranked!Taylor Swift\u0027s singles - ranked!The Who: their UK singles - ranked!Black Sabbath - every album - ranked!David Byrne – (almost) all of his albums - ranked!Miles Davis\u0027s 20 greatest albums – ranked!Lil Wayne\u0027s albums - ranked!Every Mercury prize-winning album - ranked!The Rolling Stones – every album - ranked!10 best Paul Simon albums - ranked!Bruce Springsteen\u0027s albums - ranked!Kanye West – every album - ranked!Stevie Wonder\u0027s albums - ranked!20 greatest breakup songs ever - ranked!Aphex Twin\u0027s best songs - ranked!Barry Manilow – all his greatest songs - ranked!Cher\u0027s 30 greatest songs - ranked!The 30 greatest Disney songs –\u0026nbspranked!Elton John\u0027s 50 greatest songs - ranked!From Drake to Wet Wet Wet: songs with 10 weeks at No 1 - ranked!From MC5 to Jeff Mills: the greatest Detroit tracks ever - ranked!Giorgio Moroder\u0027s 20 greatest songs - ranked!Nirvana\u0027s 20 greatest songs - ranked!The best songs from teen movies - ranked!The best UK garage tracks - ranked!The greatest banned songs of all time - ranked!The greatest ever female rap tracks - ranked!The greatest pop music dance crazes - ranked!All 43 Spice Girls songs - ranked!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/224401072d5369030d1295e52bed375f4f354184/161_295_2195_1317/master/2195.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c2e9e489f4ab4434ecf460ca2c4efcf6","title":"the matrix rebooted new film","story":"The influential cyberpunk trilogy conjured a terrifying future where humans were enslaved to technology. How might a new film’s creative revamp top that?It was surely inevitable that Hollywood would eventually return to the world of The Matrix. After all, the Wachowskis’ turn-of-the-century cyberpunk trilogy makes clear that the titular virtual-reality universe is regularly rebooted when it all gets a little too crazy in cyberspace. There’s even provision for Keanu Reeves’s Neo to be brought back with a new face, Doctor Who style, as 2003’s Matrix Reloaded revealed the existence of umpteen previous digital messiahs, all going by the same name, before the latest iteration arrived on the scene to bullet-time the machines into submission.Rumours have been swirling around a new film since at least 2017, when Ready Player One’s Zach Penn was reported to be writing an episode for studio Warner Bros that would cast Michael B Jordan as the lead. Now, as the original 1999 film returns to US cinemas, writer-director Lilly Wachowski, who oversaw the original trilogy alongside her sister Lana, has given the concept her blessing (while suggesting she is too busy to get involved herself).“I like it when stories go out into the world and then come back to you in different ways,” Wachowski told Film. “I mean, that’s what storytelling is all about. I’m part of a bigger thing. I don’t have any ownership over stuff like that, so whatever story anybody wants to tell, I can’t wait to hear. I hope it’s better than the original.”The Matrix introduced the concept of life as a simulation designed to keep humanity from rebelling, a sort of virtual opium of the masses for the 21st century. Tear through the humdrum carapace of everyday existence, it suggested, and you too might be able to redefine yourself as a kung fu-kicking babe magnet in shades and leather. Dive down the rabbit hole and available upgrades might include enhanced charisma, new vocabularies, and even the ability to see without one’s eyes. Almost anything was possible within the Matrix – damn, give Boris Johnson the Red Pill and send him blustering after the White Rabbit, and he might even be able to solve Brexit.The problem here is that even the Wachowskis were not able to repeat the success of The Matrix with sequels Reloaded and Revolutions, which means it’s difficult to imagine how anyone else can. With its heady philosophical ideas increasingly torpedoed by big-budget action motifs as the series stumbled towards its disappointing conclusion, the trilogy was eventually fully absorbed into Hollywood’s own matrix of blandness, like one of the many annoying clones created by Hugo Weaving’s nefarious Agent Smith.A truly visionary writer-director – Denis Villeneuve, Christopher Nolan or Alex Garland spring to mind – might be able to wring new life from the concept, but of these only Villeneuve, the Canadian director of Blade Runner 2049, has shown any sign in recent times of being keen on uploading himself to the Hollywood sequel mainframe. I Am Mother’s Grant Sputore, District 9’s Neill Blomkamp and Moon’s Duncan Jones would be other names to get fans excited, though only the first of those has an unblemished CV. Whoever takes it on should be told to focus first and foremost on the ideas that made The Matrix so intriguing, rather than blowing audiences away with giant FX cannons.Imagine, for a moment, if the Wachowskis’ first movie had been left as a standalone episode. It might well have developed even greater cult status by now – just as 1982’s Blade Runner did after being allowed to percolate through the discerning sci-fi fan’s senses for the best part of three decades. The fact this did not happen stands as testament to the dangers of studios greenlighting sequels before they are really ready to emerge fully formed into the light. There is a reason James Cameron has spent more than a decade working on sequels to (the far less iconic) Avatar, and that Ready Player One writer Ernest Cline is planning a new novel before even considering venturing back into the brand-heavy virtual world brought to the big screen by Steven Spielberg last year. Get these followups wrong, and there is a serious danger of tarnishing the original episode.The Matrix’s enigma, like the Carrollian underworld that partly inspired it, is intrinsic to its value as a cultural totem. That first movie was so inspiring because it introduced us to a superbly stylised, incredibly cool inner world that it seemed we would never be able to fully understand.Once we know the functions of Smith, the Oracle and Neo himself within the fabric of this digital labyrinth, they become far less intriguing. Once we see what the machines actually look like they become far less horrifying – the relentless Sentinels introduced in Reloaded, tunnelling their way towards Zion, are boring machines in more than one sense. A mere glimpse of this secret digital Shangri-La, a peek through the looking glass at what lies beyond, it turns out, was all we should ever have been given."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0edf509236bf7d37ae98c104d4693dd9f8a000a3/1_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e390a31de38128dee139d9ebdfbf5d69","title":"graham potter dean smith chris wilder premier league managers","story":"If there is one quality that links Graham Potter, Dean Smith and Chris Wilder, it is a willingness to accept a tough challenge. They have made it to the top after coming from humble beginnings – Potter with Östersund in the fourth tier of Swedish football, Wilder at non-league Alfreton, Smith by falling into the Walsall job by accident – and this season they have a chance to alter perceptions about the worth of English managers.It will not be easy for this trio of home-grown coaches, none of whom has managed in the Premier League. Potter faces a tough task to remodel Brighton’s style after replacing Chris Hughton, Smith’s Aston Villa must focus on survival after winning the Championship play-off final and Wilder needs to perform his latest miracle after taking Sheffield United from League One to the top flight.Yet it is lazy to assume all three will fail because of an apparent lack of glamour. When Smith arrived at Villa Park last October some saw stints at Brentford and Walsall on his CV and doubted if he was the man to get Villa promoted. Yet Dan Mole, Walsall’s club secretary, knew better. “They’re going on the name, not the man,” he says. “He’s lived his life in football. He’s organised, disciplined and has a plan.”Similarly Bobo Sollander, who played for Potter at Östersund and saw how he lifted an obscure club from the backwaters of Swedish football to the Europa League in the space of seven years, believes his old manager will be managing in the Champions League soon. “I don’t think his journey will be done with Brighton,” Sollander says. “He is going to be a top-four coach in a couple of years. He is that good.”English managers have often been written off as long-ball dinosaurs in recent years and tearing off that label can be hard. Yet every aspiring coach needs a break and for Wilder an opportunity arrived when he was in the twilight of his playing career at Alfreton in 2001. “Chris’s enthusiasm was boundless,” Wayne Bradley, Alfreton’s chairman, says. “He had no experience but as much energy that you’d ever want to come across. He wanted to get involved in everything – from what kit we played in to how we prepared for games.”Wilder, 51, has taken a winding path since winning the quadruple inside 27 weeks with Alfreton. He moved to Halifax in 2002, had a brief stint as No 2 to his current assistant Alan Knill at Bury, took Oxford into the Football League in 2010, won League Two with Northampton in 2016 and has had a stunning impact since moving to Bramall Lane.There have also been hard times. He faced financial difficulties at Halifax and Northampton. Yet Joel Byrom, who played for Wilder at Northampton, remembers that spirits were always high. “If you produced for him at the weekend, he’d give you a day off,” he says. “We still have a group chat from that team. I still go away with some of the lads in the summer. You don’t have that normally.”Astute man-management is crucial: it helped Potter settle when the 44-year-old joined Östersund in 2010. “It was the way he said his door would always be open for you,” Sollander says. “It always felt like if you needed to talk with him you could. He was easier to access than coaches I had before. When training was over they went home. Graham stayed and worked. There was always something new to think about.”In Smith’s case he is remembered at Walsall as a studious coach and a man who commanded respect. The 48-year-old started as the club’s head of academy and has previously said he had no ambitions to become a manager. He fell into the job only when Walsall, battling against relegation from League One, sacked Chris Hutchings in January 2011.It turned out to be an inspired appointment. Smith kept Walsall up and had developed a reputation as one of the Football League’s most progressive coaches by the time he joined Brentford in 2015.“When Dean came in at the academy it did feel like that was where he’d see his short-term career,” Mole says. “But when we moved the manager on, Dean was probably the only one qualified to take the team. If it wasn’t Dean, it was either me or the chief executive. Somehow he managed the great escape. From there he helped build a structure which saw us pushing for promotion in the season he left.“He has human qualities that sometimes get lost in football. Did I think he’d end up in the Premier League? It’s impossible to say. All I know is he is the best manager I have worked with. He’s true to his philosophy and gets a buy-in from every element of a club.”There are hard sides to these coaches, though. Byrom says there is a ruthless edge to Wilder, recalling that he would refuse to speak to anyone in the days after a defeat, while Sollander makes it clear that Potter was never overly pally with his players.Yet Sollander also points out that Potter, who has joined Brighton after a year stabilising Swansea, would never shout for no reason. “There was a meaning to it,” he says. “He makes you a smarter footballer. He challenged the way you thought about football. He gave you the belief that this is how we wanted to play – and we were going to think about it.“He wanted to dominate the ball. We had a coach who talked a lot about playing positive football. But in games it was the opposite. He would shout: ‘Kick the ball, kick the ball.’ Graham never did that. Sometimes it is good to play long ball but you have to know when to do it. He showed when you should do it.”Potter, Smith and Wilder want their teams to attack. Last season Wilder and Knill helped Sheffield United gain automatic promotion with a 3-5-2 system featuring overlapping centre-backs and Byrom tells a story from his Northampton days that deep tactical thinking is possible away from the Premier League.“When we had the ball across the back four, Chris would tell the full-back to run up the pitch and as a midfielder I’d drop in to get the ball in so much space,” he says. “In League Two you don’t get a lot of time on the ball in midfield. But when you dropped into that area you never got marked.“The first time he told me to do it we were doing a shape session in training and when the centre-back had the ball he told me to drop into left-back. The left-back just ran on. I didn’t know what was going on. But when I did it in a game I wasn’t getting marked. I’d never seen it before at that level. A lot of midfielders weren’t following me. People would be confused. They didn’t know what to do.”Premier League sides should prepare themselves for more surprises this season."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4049dc57269bb559dc4a1d24043b04fa97e881e4/194_125_3664_2199/master/3664.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78bb275c17bea4b78027ee43d10fbb0c","title":"jurgen klopp liverpool lack of signings premier league","story":"• Adrián is the club’s only senior arrival this summer• Klopp thinks 98 points may not be needed to win titleJürgen Klopp believes Liverpool will improve this season without new signings and 98 points may not be required to win the Premier League given increased competition among the leading pack.Norwich City’s visit to Anfield on Friday represents Liverpool’s deadline day, according to their manager, who signed only one senior player on the back of winning the Champions League and that was a second-choice goalkeeper in Adrián. Klopp admitted Liverpool tried to strengthen but could not land targets who would enhance his European champions for a reasonable price. However, he remains confident the squad at his disposal has the capacity to continue improving and challenge Manchester City for the title once again.“We have to make our decisions based on our expectations of what we think we can do this year. By the way, the history of Liverpool does not end this season. We will judge the season and see what we have to do. Maybe then it will be easier to find improvement.”Klopp’s confidence is fuelled by having a stable core of young talent at Liverpool, the impact of winning the club’s sixth European crown and the second-half performance against City in last weekend’s Community Shield.“We are a good team together in a very difficult league with a lot of competitors desperate to get the position we are in. Nobody knows how it will look exactly but Sunday showed we will be fine and the rest is what we make of it.”The Liverpool manager believes it is “important you don’t compare seasons” and is wary of claiming his team can emulate or improve on last season’s 97 points, a club-record haul that still was not enough to secure a first league title since 1990. But given the spending at Tottenham, Arsenal and Manchester United, and Frank Lampard’s arrival at Chelsea, he expects a more condensed title race this season.Klopp said: “For me, it looks like this season will be different because there was a big gap between the other teams and us and City. It looks like we will all be closer to each other than last season. If that is the case then you cannot get 97 or 98 points. We don’t know in this moment. The only thing we know is that nothing will happen for us in a positive direction if we don’t win our games. We have to start with that on Friday. Friday for us is deadline day because pre-season is over and now we have to perform as good as possible.“A season has a story, and there are different chapters, but without a first word you cannot start. We start our story on Friday and there is no reason why it should not be a wonderful story.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d47183faf22e83f5b9f1d20677aa659f01c63b7/0_168_4956_2975/master/4956.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26d4a71db8831803586bd678dce779c1","title":"premier league preview iwobi at everton and image rights football weekly extra","story":"Max Rushden, Barry Glendenning, Jonathan Wilson and Lars Sivertsen discuss the Premier League season ahead, Alex Iwobi’s shock move to Everton, Wayne Rooney’s suspicious squad number, image rights and water balloon partnersJoin the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

Bale looks restrained because he has not said anything, while Zidane looks the villain because he won’t shut up. But if you were a sporting director at a club considering a move for Bale, the fact that his manager is so desperate to get rid of him would inevitably make you doubt whether he was the kind of character you want in your dressing room.It was strange to see a club treat a major asset so contemptuously, as if they do not care they are devaluing him, and then pull out of a deal with the one club who has made a genuine attempt to buy him because he was undervalued. Meanwhile, Zidane’s behaviour, while clearly motivated by a desire for Bale to leave, is at the same time making it less likely anyone will take him.Elsewhere, there have been several players who have refused to join pre-season tours or turn up to training as they attempt to force clubs to let them leave. This has always happened, but perhaps less often and less publicly. It is only two years since Paris Saint-Germain bought Neymar for a world record €222m this summer he has been desperately trying to engineer a way out again. Where has all the love and decorum gone? I spent a month in Paris during the Women’s World Cup and when I talked to Parisians about Neymar they couldn’t stand him. When he says that being part of a team that beat PSG 6-1 is his favourite football memory he’s making himself seem calculated and spiteful. It doesn’t help either party if there’s that level of public contempt.I wonder if this will have an impact on the fees being paid for players in their mid-20s. It is clear a large investment will not buy the player’s loyalty even in the short term, and if the player does later decide to agitate for a move his club will find itself in a bad negotiating position and will struggle to recoup their initial outlay. A player such as Moise Kean from Juventus to Everton is a great signing: he’s young, hungry, wasn’t crazily overpriced and has scored goals at a top club. He’ll be ambitious to prove himself at Everton and move on for a bigger fee, which is in everyone’s interest. But if that looks like money well spent, plenty has also been wasted.Perhaps it’s best to keep out of the transfer market altogether if you can avoid it. Manchester City have had a restrained summer by their standards, and Liverpool have spent very little. After Harry Maguire moved to Manchester United Pep Guardiola said City “could not afford it”, while Jürgen Klopp said Liverpool “are not in this fantasy land where you just get whatever you want”. It is as if they are fighting about who is the poorest. The truth is City could surely have bought Maguire had they considered it really necessary, and having won the Champions League Liverpool would have been able to put together a decent transfer budget.But with already excellent squads, why take a risk? Why spend money on a big-money player who is probably going to throw his toys out of the pram in a couple of years if things aren’t going his way, when they can play players such as Phil Foden or Rhian Brewster, who are young, ambitious and already part of the club?It is dangerous to sit on your laurels, but a lot of the time you only have to add one or two people to the fringes of a winning team to improve it. A big player coming in can change the dynamics of the dressing room, upset the rhythm of the team and end up doing more harm than good. Perhaps Klopp and Guardiola have noted the problems other teams are having in the market. Or maybe Tottenham’s success last season, despite not signing anyone the previous summer, has sent the message that you don’t have to spend loads of money every window to be successful. Sometimes keeping a squad together can improve spirit and with it performances.I think Chelsea’s transfer ban could be a blessing in disguise. It should mean that Frank Lampard is given a bit more time than most recent managers, young players will be given a chance in the team and fans will once again feel an affinity with squad members and coaching staff who have a history at the club and wear the badge with pride.The case of Laurent Koscielny was another curious one, with the player announcing his arrival at Bordeaux with a Twitter video of him stripping off his Arsenal shirt and throwing it aside, revealing his new kit underneath. Perhaps it was motivated by a desire for likes and retweets rather than contempt for his former club, but I thought it came across as crass and disrespectful. Clubs like to find different ways of revealing signings, and the traditional picture of a player, pen in hand, hovering over a contract or of him shaking the chairman’s hand doesn’t exactly get the pulse racing, but this was not a good idea.It’s important for a player to leave on the right note. Even if you’re not happy to be going, or your relationships at your old club have turned sour, it is always best to be respectful. Thank the club and its fans for their support and the opportunity they gave you and leave with head held high. If you’re moving move well, let the dust settle and then talk about it later, if you need to. All the anger and disrespect flying between managers, players and clubs over the last couple of months has not been great to see. As windows go, this one has looked pretty murky."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d8d8f5e17a98c7d1b5bf28ff932d10144c4fbb1/1_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20f5f6a184ec5a45ff5301a729f1ba0f","title":"premier league 10 things to look out for this weekend","story":"West Ham have the talent to cause Manchester City problems on opening weekend while David de Gea has a point to proveWhile there is plenty of excitement to be drawn from Liverpool’s much-lauded front three, a good argument could be made that the two most thrilling players in Jürgen Klopp’s side are defenders. Technically, anyway. In reality, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson spent last season making a mockery of their job descriptions, zooming forward with exuberant abandon and each laying on more goals than any of the side’s so-called attackers. Meanwhile, down in the Championship, a similar operation was in progress. Norwich’s full-back duo, Jamal Lewis and Max Aarons, are under strict instructions from Daniel Farke to play with the handbrake permanently off and duly raised pulses at Carrow Road, clocking up 10 assists between them with Lewis being named the EFL young player of the season. In theory, that could spell good news for Sadio Mané and Mo Salah on Friday night: Liverpool’s chief goal threats should not be short of vacant space to exploit on their respective flanks. But either way, with so many tireless shuttlers on show, proceedings at Anfield may look less like a football match than an Olympic swimming contest. AHManuel Pellegrini: a quietly dignified purveyor of easy-on-the-eye football and unheralded soother of post-relocation turbulence, or a crusty charisma vacuum happy to sit back and collect a late-career paycheck? West Ham: a youthfully promising attacking outfit that could trouble the top six, or a pick-and-mix squad stocked with and managed by journeymen, fated for a late-season dogfight they don’t have the mettle for? A year into Pellegrini’s reign in east London, both questions remain strangely unanswered, though Saturday’s lunchtime kick-off may give us a better idea of what lies ahead. Because while the visit of the champions may be read as a “free hit” for West Ham in terms of the result, the manner of their performance will speak volumes: a meek surrender will confirm the worst fears of an angsty home crowd and remind the world that Pellegrini’s biggest job in England was as a placeholder for Pep Guardiola. A bolshy, in-your-face display, however – maybe even a goal or two – would send a much-needed message that last season’s top-half finish is there to be built on. With a small army of silky playmakers, one of the country’s best young players in Declan Rice and a shiny new £45m goalscorer in Sébastien Haller, Pellegrini has a squad of undoubted talent. He also has plenty of naysayers. Making good use of the former would make fools of the latter. AHWith Arsenal, Chelsea, and Manchester United looking vulnerable, the teams below them will feel that they have a chance to penetrate the fabled battle for the top fourTM. Wolves and Leicester both look decently equipped for the task, with settled sides, exciting iniduals and canny managers. Last season, both sides acquitted themselves well against the teams who finished above them, and there is no reason to think that should change but what does need to change is their performances when they’re expected to win. Leicester lost home games to Cardiff, Crystal Palace and Newcastle, while Wolves were beaten by Palace, Cardiff, and Huddersfield twice.Also important is the momentum of a good start, and the fixtures computer has ensured that this will be difficult for both Leicester play Chelsea second, while Wolves meet Manchester United. But first of all they must struggle with one another in what promises to be a fascinating match-up: Leicester look to move the ball quickly, attacking at pace and in numbers, while Wolves play a slower, possession-based style, probing for holes before exploding. Each is well equipped to punish the weaknesses of the other, which is to say that Saturday’s match makes for one of the best of the weekend. DHThere are certain players who look to have pretty much every attribute required to be a top player … except for the one intangible thing that makes top players top players, and Danny Welbeck is one. He has a lovely touch, an engaging imagination, work ethic, pace and physical presence, but struggles to put it all together often enough to wring the most from his talent. At 28 years old, he still has time – just – and at Watford should get the chance to play through the middle regularly. Though his reputation is as a bad finisher, unreliable is a more accurate description – he can make difficult chances look easy, just as he can make easy chances look difficult. If he can only compose in front of goal, and if injuries can only leave him in peace, he could be an excellent addition to an already useful Watford side. DHSlapping in a transfer request the day before the window closes is a high stakes game to play, and Wilfried Zaha must now pay the consequences of losing his fight to leave Selhurst Park. That Saturday’s opponent is the very club he pushed tojoin only compounds the discomfort. It seems likely that Roy Hodgson will take his star player out of the firing line having sent Zaha home from training on Thursday as the winger’s hope of an exit turned to dust. “When you sign long-term contracts you are expected to honour them and we expect him to do that,” Hodgson said as the deal collapsed, and pointedly. Should Zaha be at Selhurst in the capacity of player or spectator, he can see what he might have been part of. Everton have been busy in the market, with Alex Iwobi the final signing of a raft of additions of whom Moise Kean most captures the imagination. JBJay Rodriguez is back at his hometown club and poised to make his first Premier League appearance for Burnley on Saturday. The 30-year-old had a productive spell for West Brom and merits another shot at the big time, and he rejoins a club in a reasonably buoyant mood after a strong finish to a hitherto underwhelming 2018-19 season. Rodriguez’s two-goal display in a friendly win over Parma last weekend bodes well for the Clarets. How Rodriguez fits into an attacking unit that has been spearheaded by the settled pairing of Chris Wood and Ashley Barnes will be one point of tactical intrigue. The loan signing of 2016’s Danny Drinkwater is another interesting addition. Southampton should arrive at Turf Moor in good spirits too. Ralph Hasenhüttl has generally coaxed brighter, sparkier performances from Saints since his arrival last December, and has recruited well over the summer. Arrivals such as Che Adams and Moussa Djenepo promise much and they, like their opponents on Saturday, can go into their season-opener with legitimate aspirations of a top-half finish. TDIn the first Saturday evening serving of the Premier League, transfer deadline day’s headline makers in Tottenham welcome the entire window’s most active operators in Aston Villa. Minds may still fixate on those who did not arrive or did not get their wish to leave. Paulo Dybala will not, after all, be unveiled on the pitch and get to test out the Tottenham Stadium’s unrivalled executive facilities. Instead, Spurs fans can satisfy themselves with first glimpses of Giovani Lo Celso, Ryan Sessegnon, and Tanguy Ndombele. Meanwhile, the likes of Danny Rose, Christian Eriksen and Toby Alderweireld remain Tottenham players, barring continental escapes with the European window open until the end of the month Eriksen had his heart especially set on leaving. Mauricio Pochettino has the new blood he was agitating for but still appears well short of the resources to challenge Manchester City or Liverpool. For Villa, though, who signed 13 players this summer, Spurs still represent a supreme test for a freshly promoted club. JBIs this the real beginning of Arsenal’s new era? Their summer activity would suggest it and, at the least, the feeling around Unai Emery’s squad is significantly fresher than the drab bunch he inherited 12 months ago. St James’ Park does not seem similarly awash with the joys of late summer so this should be a good opportunity to put those good vibes to the test. If Andy Carroll is paraded in front of the Newcastle fans then local spirits might be raised a touch and the £40m signing Joelinton will fancy a crack at Arsenal’s defence on his competitive debut. Steve Bruce could do with a good start and if the Magpies are grasping for omens then they could cast their minds back to the last time these clubs faced off on the opening day, in 2011. Back then Gervinho was sent off on his Arsenal debut by coincidence another Ivorian winger, Nicolas Pépé, should make his bow at the same venue and at the very least Bruce will need to keep the prolific attacker quiet. NAManchester United’s draw at home to Chelsea in April was the nadir of a difficult season for David de Gea, whose mistake gave Marcos Alonso the equaliser. It was the culmination of the toughest spell of de Gea’s career, and at the end of the season he lost his place in the Spain team to Chelsea’s Kepa. If Ole Gunnar Solskjær is to improve Manchester United this season, he needs De Gea in the kind of form that makes pundits swoon. It was almost certainly a blip, the kind all keepers experience, but Sunday’s match against Chelsea at Old Trafford will give us an insight into De Gea’s confidence levels – and the first clue as to whether DDG is still Dead Dead Good, or whether, given the memories of April’s meeting, and the presence of Kepa in the opposition goal, he will not struggle for motivation. RSSaturday will be a strange day for Lys Mousset. He will go to the Vitality Stadium as usual but this time he will walk into the away dressing room with his new club Sheffield United. It will be an equally odd sensation if, at 3pm, he walks on to the field rather than towards the dugout. Mousset was a regular substitute at Bournemouth, and the last time he started a Premier League game at the Vitality Stadium was March 2018. It never quite worked out on the South Coast, in part because of the excellence of Callum Wilson and Josh King. But Mousset has oodles of potential, and most of the raw materials any striker would want. And, like his new club, he has the opportunity to prove people wrong this season. If Sheffield United are to confound snooty assumptions and avoid relegation, Mousset could play a big part.

Teachers are asked to encourage uncooperative pupils to accept overtime work on top of regular shifts.Some of the pupils making Amazon’s Alexa-enabled Echo and Echo Dot devices along with Kindles have been required to work for more than two months to supplement staffing levels at the factory during peak production periods, researchers found. More than 1,000 pupils are employed, aged from 16 to 18.Chinese factories are allowed to employ students aged 16 and older, but these schoolchildren are not allowed to work nights or overtime.Foxconn, which also makes iPhones for Apple, admitted that students had been employed illegally and said it was taking immediate action to fix the situation.“There have been instances in the past where lax oversight on the part of the local management team has allowed this to happen and, while the impacted interns were paid the additional wages associated with these shifts, this is not acceptable and we have taken immediate steps to ensure it will not be repeated.”The company defended its use of schoolchildren, however, claiming that “it provides students, who are all of a legal working age, with the opportunity to gain practical work experience and on-the-job training in a number of areas that will support their efforts to find employment following their graduation.”Foxconn said it would increase the number of regular workers and review salaries immediately.A spokesperson for Amazon, which is headed by Jeff Bezos, the richest person in the world with a furtune estimated at more than $100bn, said the company would not tolerate violations of its supplier code of conduct and regularly assessed suppliers, often using independent auditors, to monitor compliance and improvement.“If we find violations, we take appropriate steps, including requesting immediate corrective action,” said the spokesperson.“We are urgently investigating these allegations and addressing this with Foxconn at the most senior level. Additional teams of specialists arrived on-site yesterday to investigate, and we’ve initiated weekly audits of this issue.”Teenagers who spoke to researchers said the factory work has no relevance to their courses and they have been pressed into working overtime.Xiao Fang*, 17, started work at the factory on the Amazon Echo production line last month.Fang, who is studying computing, was given the task of applying a protective film to about 3,000 Echo Dots each day. Speaking to a researcher, she said she was initially told by her teacher that she would be working eight hours a day, five days a week, but that had since changed to 10 hours a day (including two hours’ overtime) for six days a week.“The lights in the workshop are very bright, so it gets really hot,” she said.“In the beginning, I wasn’t very used to working at the factory, and now, after working for a month, I have reluctantly adapted to the work. But working 10 hours a day, every day, is very tiring.“I tried telling the manager of my line that I didn’t want to work overtime. But the manager notified my teacher and the teacher said if I didn’t work overtime, I could not intern at Foxconn and that would affect my graduation and scholarship applications at the school.“I had no choice, I could only endure this.”According to the documents, Foxconn managers need students, who mostly stay in the factory’s dormitories, to work overtime to meet production targets those who refuse are let go by the factory, researchers found.A document states: “Student interns who don’t work overtime will not only affect the production goal but also affect their willingness to work. Student interns need to work overtime.”The documents were leaked to labour rights group China Labor Watch and shared with the .“To fulfil the shortage of the labour force and lower the cost of labour recruitment, we would like to cooperate with local schools to recruit student interns,” read one document before listing the advantages of recruiting schoolchildren.“Low labour cost, can hire a large amount of labour at once, easier to reassign additional workers to other positions, strong ability to learn new things.”Company documents show that Foxconn pays interns a total of 16.54 yuan an hour (£1.93) inclusive of overtime and other add-ons, with a basic salary of £1.18 an hour. Experienced agency workers, known as dispatch workers, cost the company 20.18 yuan an hour. The documents also show that Foxconn has cut the rate paid to interns since last year.Amazon said in January that it had sold more than 100m Alexa devices which rival Google Home in the market for virtual voice assistants used to control domestic appliances and functions. They cost from around $50 in the US, £50 in the UK and A$79 in Australia, but can be three times more expensive for more sophisticated models.The factory pays schools 500 yuan a month for each pupil they provide. One company document shows agreements with four schools to provide a total of 900 pupils to work in the factory, though other documents outline plans to recruit up to 1,800 interns this year.Foxconn’s documents show that the company has wrestled with the issue of hiring schoolchildren as workers but decided that the benefits outweigh the risks.Notes from a meeting to review the intern-hiring policy on 25 July this year reveal that without students the factory may not be able to hit production targets. The meeting was told that students are cheaper to hire than agency workers, which the factory also uses to cover peak production periods as an alternative to hiring regular staff.The meeting was told that some children were refusing to work nightshifts and overtime, and there was a need for teachers to intervene.“Nightshift line leaders should check in with student interns and teachers more often, and report back any abnormal situation so that teachers can persuade students to work nightshifts and overtime.”If children continued to refuse to work the additional hours, the meeting was told that teachers should file a resignation letter on their behalf.The student intern recruitment review meeting, which involved staff from the Echo production line, the production control department and the human resources department, reached an agreement to recruit student workers in large numbers. “They advised to recruit student workers to resolve the labour shortage problem during peak season,” a record of the meeting notes.Amazon agreed a deal with Foxconn in 2017 to add 15 new production lines to the factory and hire thousands of new workers to ramp up production of its Echo and Echo Dot devices and Kindle tablets.But last year the Observer revealed how the factory was using more agency workers than permitted by Chinese law to avoid having to recruit permanent staff to cover busy months. Many were working overtime hours far in excess of the usual legal limit of 36 hours a month.In response, Amazon admitted that independent auditors had identified areas of concern at the factory. Foxconn promised to reduce its reliance on agency staff and said agency workers were to be offered the chance to become regular employees.Commenting on the latest revelations, Li Qiang, executive director of China Labor Watch, called on Amazon and Foxconn to allow independent monitoring of working conditions to prevent breaches of labour law.“It is only when the company allows independent parties to monitor the working conditions that rights violations at the factory can be effectively addressed,” he said.“Recruiting a large number of dispatch workers and forcing student workers to work overtime and nightshifts is illegal, and Foxconn is well aware of this. However, because it increases their profits, they will continue to recruit dispatch and student workers.”The leaked documents also reveal that Foxconn has faced problems as a result of the trade war between the US and China, with the cost of raw materials increasing and some orders lost."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a898e109c06e2d1a2a2a7277b81466a5713e1100/0_0_4093_2840/master/4093.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d67f6d749ba6ee300abd55ea1ffdd5f 880w","title":"david berman silver jews charted the jagged landscape of america and himself","story":"The Silver Jews songwriter refracted Americana to illuminate knotty problems of self and state with simple, brilliant poetryThe United States is so geographically vast, so culturally unaligned, that it’s rare that one sound, one voice, has ever articulated the sum of the nation’s consciousness.David Berman was not one such voice. He wasn’t Elvis, Jay-Z or Dylan. The late singer of New York’s Silver Jews and Purple Mountains – the band with which he emerged from self-appointed exile, and who released their eponymous debut only last month – wrote songs that were awkward and askew, that either by design but more likely execution were not made for mass appeal. Berman made outsider music: songs to be enjoyed and championed beneath the glass ceiling for voices like his.And yet there’s a period of the 1990s when a collection of American musicians – disparate, often unknown to each other – were as crucial in understanding the States’ complexity as names who sold records a hundred times over. This is music, often home recorded – as much of Berman’s was – that showcased a refracted vision of Americana, articulated by the likes of Will Oldham, Bill Callahan of Smog, the Handsome Family, John Darnielle of the Mountain Goats, Daniel Johnston, Vic Chesnutt and more.Like those artists, Berman’s work suggests he had a deep and complicated love for his country. Purple Mountains even took their name from a mondegreen of the lyrics to America the Beautiful. His best songs articulate a nation that is beguiling, but covered in human grime. When he sings of a “jagged skyline of car keys”, on Black and Brown Blues, a standout of Silver Jews’ 1996 album The Natural Bridge, his dewy voice sounds as if it’s being poured from a throat in which all tendons have been unwound, creating a cinematic American cityscape.Two years later, on the song Blue Arrangements, taken from Silver Jews’ – the Joos, to their fans – third album American Water, he describes in a languid vocal, duelling with that of then bandmate Stephen Malkmus, “the kids in the corner all covered in dirt, caught trespassing under the moon”. It’s hard not to imagine Berman as Huckleberry Finn, wide-eyed, muddy kneed, dressed in plaid. Then he sings: “My father came in from wherever he’d been, and kicked my shit all over the room,” Berman had a fractured relationship with his lobbyist father, Richard, once describing him as a demon – the two were estranged at the time of the singer’s death.Although the Joos were created in New York with his friend Malkmus and fellow future Pavement member Bob Nastanovich (Berman putting together the band while working as a security guard at the city’s Whitney Museum of American Art), the Virginia-born bandleader moved back to the south, to Nashville. He understood the significance of bedding down in a place that proudly proclaims itself Music City. “We’re gonna live in Nashville and I’ll make a career,” he sings on the song Tennessee, “out of writing sad songs and getting paid by the tear.”The song We Are Real, another from American Water, sees each couplet compete with each other to be the song’s defining take. Not only does he rhyme “Virginia” with “with ya”, which not only works but zings, but he shares the thought, “won’t soul music change, now that our souls have turned strange?” It’s a line that’s very funny, linguistically smart and insufferably sad, as suited to the therapist’s office as it is a lyric book. It’s almost like he’d written his own epitaph: a line that says more about why Berman struggled with the world than anything he ever said in an interview.Berman’s songs always seemed to be trying to make sense of the landscape changing before him, and within him. His songs suggest that their creator had so many qualities we cherish – empathy, emotional literacy, bravery – and yet what he lacked was the understanding of self that keeps a person shackled and safe: he struggled with substance misuse and had mental health problems.There’s another line from We Are Real that is perhaps the one that will come to define David Berman: “All my favourite singers couldn’t sing.” Isn’t that so often the case? And yet Berman’s voice is as important to understanding the American – and indeed human – experience as almost anyone’s."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d60c149ff0656c5c0f3474e1c62ad49589310361/361_102_1829_1097/master/1829.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08d4bd554d2caa60917a9b95407f09bd","title":"taylor swift reveals why she took a stand for lgbtq rights","story":"Singer says facing her previous lack of advocacy had been ‘kind of devastating’Taylor Swift says she felt compelled to publicly champion LGBTQ causes in recent months because rights are being “stripped from basically everyone who isn’t a straight white cisgender male” in the US today.The singer, who has been criticised in the past for not speaking up on political issues, particularly during the 2016 US presidential election campaign, discussed her recent shift to advocacy in a rare interview with Vogue magazine.“Rights are being stripped from basically everyone who isn’t a straight white cisgender male,” she says in the September issue.“I didn’t realise until recently that I could advocate for a community that I’m not a part of.”Swift’s latest music video, You Need to Calm Down, featured some of the US’s most prominent queer celebrities and ended with a direct plea for fans to sign a petition in support of the Equality Act, to protect LGBTQ people from discrimination in their places of work, homes, schools and other public accommodations.It followed a social media post in the lead-up to the 2018 midterms condemning the Republican senator for Tennessee, Marsha Blackburn, over her record on gay rights, which drew a rebuke from president Donald Trump.The music video, and her recent conversion to prominent LGBTQ ally, has drawn praise as well as criticised – with some accusing Swift of “queerbaiting” and performative allyship.In the magazine, she describes a conversation with friend and fellow singer Todrick Hall which she says left her feeling “devastated” she had not been vocal enough in her support for the LGBTQ community.“Maybe a year or two ago, Todrick and I are in the car, and he asked me, ‘What would you do if your son was gay?’” she says.“The fact that he had to ask me … shocked me and made me realise that I had not made my position clear enough or loud enough,” she says.“If he was thinking that, I can’t imagine what my fans in the LGBTQ community might be thinking,” she goes on. “It was kind of devastating to realise that I hadn’t been publicly clear about that.”Swift also discusses the toll a public feud with Kim Kardashian West in 2016 took on her wellbeing.“A mass public shaming, with millions of people saying you are quote-unquote canceled, is a very isolating experience,” she says. “I don’t think there are that many people who can actually understand what it’s like to have millions of people hate you very loudly.”“When you say someone is canceled, it’s not a TV show. It’s a human being. You’re sending mass amounts of messaging to this person to either shut up, disappear, or it could also be perceived as, ‘kill yourself’.”She goes on to say that making music was the only way she could preserve her mental health at the time.The singer’s latest album, Lover, is due to be released on 23 August. In Vogue, she teased two forthcoming songs from the album – the title track Lover, and The Man, which she describes as a “thought experiment” of what her life would have been like if she were male."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc235d4cd0e3f9a7d2a0224a09fabb30c0557c9d/0_0_3961_2376/master/3961.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2498038dd615aa03cf8812e9facb116f","title":"hong kong delegation invited by uk to attend arms fair in london","story":"Invite comes despite vow by former foreign secretary to halt exports of teargas to territoryA delegation from Hong Kong has been invited by the British government to attend a flagship arms fair in London despite a promise made by the former foreign secretary in June to halt exports of teargas to the crisis-hit territory.The surprise invitation to the DSEI show, which showcases security and military products, was confirmed by the Department for International Trade now run by Liz Truss.Officials tried to downplay the significance of the invite, arguing that it did not imply there would be any future arms sales to Hong Kong, but campaigners questioned whether the territory should be allowed to attend given the crisis on the streets in the former British colony.Andrew Smith, a spokesman for the Campaign Against the Arms Trade, said: “The Hong Kong police are using UK-made arms against campaigners right now. It is a disgrace that they have been invited to buy even more.”Hong Kong is in the midst of its worst political crisis since the British handover of the territory to China in 1997. During the protests, which began in opposition to a now suspended extradition law, almost 2,000 rounds of teargas have been fired.Canisters recovered by protesters show that some of the CS gas used had been manufactured by a British company, Chemring, at a factory in Derby, which partly prompted Jeremy Hunt to announce the export ban. Britain had licensed £9.4m of arms sales and security equipment to Hong Kong since 2014.The then foreign secretary, who was sacked last month by the prime minister, Boris Johnson, had declared that no export licences to Hong Kong would be approved until concerns about human rights abuses were “thoroughly addressed”.But the list published by the DIT of delegations invited on 23 July – Hunt’s last full day as foreign secretary – names Hong Kong, as well as eight countries identified by the Foreign Office as a “priority country” in its latest annual review of human rights and democracy.They include Saudi Arabia, where a failure by British ministers to consider the impact of civilian casualties in Yemen from bombing by the country’s air force has led to the court of appeal declaring that UK exports had been conducted unlawfully until a proper assessment is carried out.Another is Bahrain. This week two staff from the Gulf state’s embassy in London were accused of assaulting an activist who climbed to the roof of the five-storey building in Belgravia, in protest against the pending execution of two men. The embassy has denied the claim.The remaining six human rights priority countries invited by the DIT to the DSEI are Bangladesh, Colombia, Egypt, Israel, Pakistan and Uzbekistan.Lloyd Russell-Moyle, a Labour MP, said: “The government’s approved attendees are eerily similar to its official list of human rights abusers ... I presume this is what Johnson means by global Britain.”The size and importance of the national delegations vary, but some are substantial and include senior figures able to make purchasing decisions. Over 1,600 exhibitors are expected to be present at the event at London’s Excel centre, which will also feature 40 “international pavilions”.The Department for International Trade said: “The invitation does not imply that any future export licences would be granted to Hong Kong.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/faaccb937d074266dd418853a12c6c9015c0ece5/42_0_5287_3173/master/5287.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c889d50e139f5be7414c1e8411fad763","title":"extreme gains how the sports supplement industry bulked up","story":"The Shayna Jack saga has thrown the spotlight on supplements in elite sport. But young male gym junkies are their most avid consumers Not so long ago, shopfronts filled with rows of gaudy coloured plastic barrels boasting the potential of “extreme gains” and “shredded” or “ripped” physiques were a high street rarity. In 2019, they are as common as the corner store, replete with a dizzying array of products promising to dissolve body fat, build muscle and help you work out harder, for longer.But the industry came under a cloud last month when the Australian swimmer Shayna Jack suggested her recent positive drug test may have been the result of contaminated sports supplements.So what is in those barrels? Who uses such products? And how dangerous are they?Sports supplements include an array of substances from run-of-the-mill multivitamins to complex concoctions that purport to build muscle and increase speed. The simplest and most common of these is protein powder – usually whey protein from cow’s milk, but varieties have expanded in recent years to include soy, pea, hemp, rice, and even sweet potato proteins – which assist in muscle repair after a strenuous workout. Other common sports supplements include creatine and amino acids for muscle energy, performance-enhancing “pre-workouts” and fat burners, also known as thermogenics, which supposedly increase the body’s metabolism to burn fat.Sports supplements are not just taken by Olympic athletes and AFL players. The primary market for sports nutrition products is males aged between 19 and 30. The Australian gym and fitness industry is now worth about $2.5bn, and the market share of vitamin and supplements stores has grown alongside it, with bricks and mortar stores worth about $533.5m and online sales worth $159.2m, according to IbisWorld. Together they represent a corporate juggernaut fuelled by the idolisation of sports stars on one hand and the cultural obsession with fitness and a particular Instagrammable aesthetic on the other.The giant tubs of protein powder and little sachets of formula have their cultural roots in the world of bodybuilding. With their cartoonishly large muscles, fake tan and oiled up flex-poses, bodybuilders may seem a long way from Olympic swimming, but the small group of (mostly) men who pioneered the modern incarnation of the sport on Muscle Beach, California, in the 1960s and 1970s sparked a massive shift in physical ideals perceived by people across the western world. The aesthetic of a particular kind of physique and body-fat-to-muscle ratio – representing a kind of exaggerated masculine and feminine – have permeated all aspects of contemporary physical culture, primarily through Hollywood. And fitness practices have followed suit.In bodybuilding, supplementation is king. Mike Debenham, a personal trainer and retired professional bodybuilder (he was three times crowned Mr New Zealand) told  Australia supplements played a critical role during the 23 years he competed.“When I was competing I rattled when I walked because there were so many supplements going through me,” he says. “It was just dependent on what time of day it was as to what I would take. The list would be as long as my arm.”As he rose through the ranks of the sport, he was sponsored by various supplement companies who would provide products free or at very little cost. He eventually opened his own supplement store franchise on the Sunshine Coast in 2012.He says the average consumer was interested in “the next best, greatest pre-workout”, often ignoring basics like nutrition. He says the practice of trying to find a quick fix made people more likely to take risks.“Protein powder’s protein powder. It’s been around for 40 years and it will be around for another 40 years,” he says. “But it’s those pre-workouts and fat burners that seem to be the real crux of the industry in the supplements era. People come in and they go, ‘what’s the strongest, best, hottest pre-workout you have?’”Clint Hill, 40, who has worked for 23 years as a specialist strength and conditioning coach for professional and semi-professional sportspeople as well as the general population, also names pre-workouts as the area in which muscle-hungry gym junkies were most enthusiastic.“I’ve seen incredibly diligent people get amazing effects by the use of supplements, even caffeine, to get a result in the gym. It can be done very well. The other side of it is that people can take everything that their mate told them to take rather than getting proper advice,” he says.Much like vitamins, the effectiveness of supplements is often disputed, and depends on many things including the supplement, the inidual and the context in which it’s taken. While most people who use them will probably have no major adverse effects, sports supplements have occasionally been deadly.In Australia, sports supplements generally fall within the purview of the Therapeutic Goods Administration, though classification is complex. It takes into consideration things like each product’s ingredients, the claims being made about it, the way it’s labelled, and the form in which it comes (eg. pills, powder, bars, etc). The products must be either “listed” or “registered” with the TGA depending on their risk level. Manufacturers must comply with particular principles, and those products classified as “low-risk” can only contain active ingredients from a TGA pre-approved list. Evaluation and oversight of the manufacturers, however, is the job of the product’s “sponsor” – that is, the person legally responsible for it being in Australia. The TGA does randomly audit manufacturers and products for compliance, as well as in response to complaints or reports of adverse events. But there have been multiple incidents of contaminated products or products with unlisted ingredients making their way to market. Many products bought over the internet from overseas-based sites are not TGA regulated, and the TGA has repeatedly issued warnings about quality control and safety of these products.The New South Wales health authority issued warnings in 2018 about workout supplements that contained the chemical 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), saying it had contributed to deaths locally and overseas. Other contaminants that have been found in supplements include methylhexaneamine (DMAA), which the TGA made illegal in 2012 due to concerns that it could be lethal, and the structurally similar compound 1,3-dimethylbutylamine (DMBA). Asada warned athletes in 2014 that DMBA may have been replacing DMAA in off-the-shelf supplements after the TGA ban. DMBA itself was banned in 2017.Even apparently innocuous substances can be dangerous. West Australian Meegan Hefford, 25, an aspiring bodybuilder, died earlier this year after a rare genetic condition left her body unable to cope with her extremely high-protein diet, which included protein supplements, resulting in a toxic build-up of nitrogen in her system. On New Year’s Day in 2018, Lachlan Foote, 21, died at his home in Blackheath, NSW, from caffeine toxicity after including pure caffeine powder in a protein shake he consumed after a night out. The US Food and Drug Administration last year issued a warning about pure caffeine powder after it had been linked to two deaths, saying a teaspoon could contain the equivalent of 28 cups of coffee.The particular subset of drug that Shayna Jack tested positive for was a selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM), developed to treat muscle wasting diseases. All SARMs are classified as Schedule 4 controlled substances by the TGA in Australia, which means they require a prescription. Nevertheless, bodybuilders and other athletes have been known to procure them. Asada issued a warning to athletes in November last year about Ligandrol. It has also repeatedly warned athletes over the past decade about the potential for supplements to contain unlisted and banned ingredients.Hill, who has been involved with Asada and Wada’s clean sport program and drug testing at both a professional and semi-professional level, says the information and communication from the anti-doping bodies has been very clear, particularly for professional sportspeople.“It’s very difficult to believe anyone would put themselves in a situation where they didn’t ask everything they could about a supplement they were taking,” he says.Debenham sold his supplements store after only a few years, partly because he believed that most players in the industry did not take consumer safety and product integrity seriously enough.In comments echoed by Hill, Debenham says there are a few supplement companies using only local ingredients, and some that batch-tested routinely to prevent contamination and to be able to market themselves to professional sporting bodies as a trusted product. But these companies are the exception.“People are always trying to push the limits and some supplement companies will try and ride that knife’s edge.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70badd9afee59f505e695cbf3f1cbabb87616b7f/4_112_3312_1987/master/3312.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=48a038966dc335cb76dd24559a7655fa","title":"tackle law rugby union","story":"A ban on tackling above the waist is to be trialled in a radical attempt to make rugby union a safer sport. World Rugby is looking at ways to reduce the risk of head injuries to both the tackler and the tackled player and has approved a closed trial at domestic level to monitor the effects of drastically reducing the height of a legal tackle.If the trial proves successful and is extended throughout the game it would transform the shape of the sport at all levels. It could be approved for global trials within the next World Cup cycle and be made permanent law in time for the 2023 Rugby World Cup. “World Rugby is unwavering in its commitment to ensure rugby is as simple and safe to play as possible for all,” the World Rugby chairman, Sir Bill Beaumont, said. “While injury incidence in the sport is not increasing and concussion incidence is decreasing, we can and must do more to reduce injuries at all levels. This is an important milestone on that journey.”The move is one of several initiatives announced by World Rugby, which will also be examining a range of other potentially significant areas, including a reduction in the permitted number of eight replacements. A specialist working group is also to be formed to assess “all issues” regarding the ruck and breakdown, the subject of increasing concern.Australia’s National Rugby Championship is also due to experiment with a goal-line drop-out in the event of the attacking team being held up over the line, which would significantly reduce the appeal of the close-range “pick-and go”. Permission has also been given to trial the experimental 50:22 kicking law which gives an attacking throw‑in to a side able to bounce a ball into touch in the opposition 22 from inside their own half. The idea is to force more defenders to cover back rather than join the crowded defensive line, potentially creating more space for attackers. John Jeffrey, chairman of the laws’ review group, confirmed that, in addition to player welfare, there were “also clear benefits to improving the spectacle for player, match officials and fans”.For current England tight forwards such as Dan Cole, however, the more immediate priority is the new scrummaging law which, for safety reasons, now forbids front-row players from placing their heads on the shoulders of opponents between the calls of “bind” and “set”. England and Wales will meet at Twickenham on Sunday with both teams slightly unsure how things will pan out. “It will be our first hit at it and Wales’s first so we will see,” said England’s prop. “You want the scrum to be seen in the best light possible. You don’t want it to became a negative point where it is just a mess and everyone goes: ‘Get rid of the scrum.’”Both teams are due to announce their starting lineups on Friday for the opening warm-up Test of the Quilter summer series, with England preparing to confirm their final 31-man World Cup squad on Monday. “It’s the pinnacle of our careers and will potentially be some of the best weeks of our lives,” the lock Joe Launchbury said. “You want to do all you can to be a part of it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84ae844a2a2140dc0f8b9a2c27bc44159ced0c54/0_788_3117_1870/master/3117.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4794a0e0e48e0b991a9acbc452355c5","title":"life is no laughing matter review summerhall edinburgh festival 2019","story":"Summerhall, EdinburghInspirational hashtags, cute dogs and marriage don’t cure depression, says Demi Nandhra in her gleefully silly yet deeply important take on mental healthEvery year now, it seems, mental health is named as a theme of the Edinburgh festival. Public campaigns encourage us to talk about it, as if that alone is a cure. But we’re no longer short of conversations about mental illness. Instead, as Demi Nandhra’s solo show pinpoints, it is treatment that’s wanting.Life Is No Laughing Matter focuses on Nandhra’s experience of depression and the inadequate care she was offered when she sought help. One doctor prescribes exercise and bananas another suggests that Nandhra might feel better if she got married. The internet, meanwhile, tells her that getting a dog could be the answer. Nandhra sends up each of these suggestions in turn, starjumping while stuffing bananas into her mouth or chasing her gleefully disobedient pup around the stage.Humour becomes Nandhra’s arsenal as she confronts her depression and shoots down the laughable advice she receives. While at times this approach can feel bitty, the best sequences marry silly images with bitter realities. Watching Nandhra slump in a yellow beanbag outfit, visibly deflating, is funny until suddenly it’s not.For all its deceptive lightness, Life Is No Laughing Matter is making a serious and necessary intervention. Like Caroline Horton’s All of Me, Nandhra’s show diagnoses depression as a structural as well as a personal issue. Mental illness and its treatment – or lack of treatment – is political. As Nandhra stresses in a rage-fuelled closing monologue, it won’t be solved through stories of recovery, expensive “wellness” products or inspirational hashtags.Crucially, Nandhra challenges the discourse around depression, which is dominated by statistics about the suicide rate among young white men. As she makes unequivocally clear, access to help is desperately unequal and systemic oppression is one of the greatest strains on mental health. When we talk about depression, we also need to be talking about capitalism and colonialism and racism and sexism and … the list goes on. And we need to be doing more than just talking."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fab04a4e69d4723d9ae0194a3b65bf2a85a60aa2/0_29_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=feb73a5aa722765580601191ddcfd7c5","title":"uber quarterly earnings loss stocks shares","story":"Second earnings report shows worse-than-predicted losses and revenue growthThe company was reporting earnings for only the second time following its share sale in May.

It’s also reopening for visitors, and offers them great walking, cycling and fine fish-and-chipsIt has been a tough week for the businesses of Whaley Bridge, which was evacuated last Thursday amid fears that the Toddbrook reservoir, above the town, could burst its dam following torrential rainfall.Residents and business owners were allowed back home on Wednesday, and shops, cafes and pubs are set to reopen by the weekend. They actively want people to come and visit, according to Martin Thomas, chair of the town council.“The community of Whaley Bridge is looking forward to the return to normality over the next few days. The dam has now been made safe and an alternative pumping system installed to bypass the reservoir. Thanks to the work of the emergency services, there has been only relatively minor flooding, and the town is open to welcome visitors,” he said.My husband lived in Whaley when we were first courting so I know it well, having swum in Toddbrook reservoir, drunk in most of the pubs and eaten far too many cakes at the Bakehouse. Here, then, is my very subjective guide to Whaley Bridge.Off-road, there are great trails by Erwood and Fernliee reservoirs, which lead towards Buxton or over to Kinder Scout. If you are a cycling masochist, check out the cobbled climb up Start Lane from the Kettleshulme direction. Whaley is also blessed with an excellent independent bike shop: the Bike Factory, opposite the Co-op on Buxton Road.Opened by two sisters in 2013, the Bakehouse has become a Whaley institution. Its cherry bakewells are, in my opinion, better than any on sale in actual Bakewell the grilled cheese sarnies make the perfect salty gooey lunchtime treat and its sausage rolls are the stuff of legend. It is mainly a takeaway place but there is seating outside, with heaters and blankets for the colder months.• 42a Market Street, thebridgebakehouseMuch more than just an off-licence, Goyt wines has a wine bar upstairs that’s open Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Book ahead for Chippie Tea Night every Friday each summer: it’s possible to bring in fish and chips from the Fryery, a few doors down, and wash it down with a glass of champagne, a bottle of local craft beer or pretty much anything else you fancy.• 1 Canal Street, goytwinesLondoners will not believe the prices at this bric-a-brac shop on the main Buxton Road. Think armchairs for £30, perfect for that upholstery project G Plan sideboards for a fraction of the cost in other antique shops mahogany dinner tables and much more. The charity shop next door, which raises money for the Blythe House Hospice, is distinctly better than average, too.• 3 Market Street, finderskeepersuk.org.ukWhaley is blessed with two chip shops but I like the Fryery best. It stays open later and its curry sauce is stupendous – and offered hot or not (get the spicy one). It’s a proper chippy, with cans of shandy, and dandelion \u0026amp burdock, and pickled eggs in jars on the counter. • 5 Canal Street, on FacebookThis is a great little shop selling prints and originals from local artists, all framed in-house. It also has a fine selection of jewellery and gifts. • 4 Market Street, jarvagalleryI’ve spent many happy afternoons with my 10-year-old stepdaughter at this superlative playground, which is right underneath Toddbrook reservoir. Don’t let that put you off now the dam is safe you’ll miss out on the zipwire otherwise!• Reservoir RoadWhaley is known locally as a drinkers’ town, and you are spoilt for choice for a pint. The Goyt Inn (8 Bridge Street) is the most traditional local pub, particularly cosy in winter. The tiny Whaley Nook Tap Rooms sells craft beer from a number of local brewers, and the Cock is best for a family pub lunch.There are lots of lovely walks right from Whaley Bridge for even the littlest legs. Head towards Taxal, by the River Goyt, where there are plenty of paddling spots. The graveyard at Taxal church is often visited by a friendly donkey, who always appreciates a carrot or an apple. Head through the woods towards the derelict Taxal Lodge on the magnificently named Linglongs Road and see if you can spot the fairy tree, where superstitious locals have left gifts for the elves.• A women-only solidarity bike ride to Whaley Bridge – to eat at the Bridge Bakehouse – starts from Deli No 29 in Romiley at 9am on Saturday 10 AugustLooking for a holiday with a difference?

The writer and star of Channel 4’s This Way Up, Aisling Bea, is Irish (obviously, if she were English, we would be going down the Fleabag route as part of the Commissioning-Criticism Axis Act 2019, which dictates that “female” is a genre). She is also friends with Horgan, and her new six-part series – Bea’s first foray into scriptwriting outside of her successful stand-up career – is produced by Horgan’s company Merman and has Horgan cast as Bea’s older sister Shona. It also shares the scabrous subversion of Horgan’s best work and makes you laugh and flinch in the same perfect proportions.A more apt comparison, however, would be with Daisy Haggard and Laura Solon’s magnificent BBC series Back to Life from earlier this year, a hilarious, heart-breaking tale of a thirtysomething woman trying to rebuild her life after a long prison sentence. This Way Up is painted in slightly broader strokes but has the same truthfulness, the same fearlessness, the same ability to embrace laughter and despair and know that they can be pretty much one and the same thing.Bea plays Aine, whom we first meet being signed out of the rehab facility where she has been staying after “a teeny little nervous breakdown”. She takes a job teaching English to foreign language students (“Get those worksheets in by Monday or I *will* Brexit the lot of you”), who, apart from sister Shona, form her one point of meaningful contact with the world as she tries to rediscover her place in it.Every relationship – or lack thereof – is beautifully drawn, from the abortive stab at sex with recently discharged fellow patient Tom (EastEnders’ Ricky Grover, effortlessly lobbing in another superb performance and further deepening the mystery as to why he is not in everything, always) to the touching bond that grows, nurtured by sarcasm, between Aine and her new 12-year-old student Etienne and his emotionally repressed father Richard (Tobias Menzies, not yet at full stretch but, God willing, there will be a second series and we will get to see where he and Bea can take their not-quite thing). It is a drama (it is only a comedy-drama if you are one of those lucky people who has never experienced the eternal truth and saving grace of real life – that the worse things get, the better the jokes become you can’t separate them by so much as a hyphen) about loneliness and the lack of connection in the world. The heroine of Back to Life had this imposed upon her by external forces as people shunned her for her past – in This Way Up, although Aine experiences her share of people’s unkind reactions to her rehab stay, it is a more internal conflict that isolates her. Whatever the reasons, the demons that drove her to break down are not yet banished – something that we are aware of even before her quiet bathroom collapse in panic and grief towards the end of the first episode makes it brutally, wrenchingly apparent.The first episode, by the way, is – in relative terms only – the weakest. If by the end of it you are undecided as to whether to continue, please do (the series is available in its entirety on All4, while being shown once a week on the main channel). In the second episode, it truly begins to take off and by the end, it is soaring. Bea’s uncompromising character and performance become something to love as well as admire. The gradual fleshing out of Shona, her boyfriend Vish (who wants Shona to move in with him, which she would if it were not for the fact that the idea fills her with horror AND she has just bought a new coffee table for her place) and her new business partner Charlotte (Indira Varma) become ever more rewarding and greater, sadder, funnier pasts and truths are gradually excavated.The ripple effects of the state of Aine’s mental health are shown, primarily on Shona. The sisters’ relationship is one of the show’s most consistent joys, featuring conversations that switch between huge, bleak subjects and the mundane, before dissolving into considerations of dogs on the internet who look like Nicolas Cage, and bitter rows that can be ended by waffles popping out of the toaster and breaking the mood.It is part and parcel of a series as fiercely realistic as it is funny as it is … well, everything, really. If a second series isn’t commissioned, I’ll Brexit the lot of you."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4bc0e871963368eb4f754c34080b155fad1574c/0_192_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=708b87a5ad617cb6cc80f94370c00894","title":"8chan shutdown users social media","story":"Site’s shutdown in wake of El Paso shooting likely to drive users to other, similar sites – as well as mainstream social mediaFormer members of 8chan have scattered across the internet after the far-right site was shut down over the weekend, finding new homes in other rightwing sites, on encrypted messaging services, and on major social media platforms.8chan went dark this week after the security service provider Cloudflare terminated the extremist messaging board as one of its clients following the El Paso shooting.The anonymous nature of 8chan can make it difficult to track where its followers are going, said Joan Donovan, the director and lead researcher of the Technology and Social Change Research Project at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard Kennedy School. But 8chan’s user base overlaps with several websites and platforms, making it likely that community members will move on to other sites and message platforms, she noted.“Most likely, these groups are moving to alternative social media platforms where there is a pre-existing community to join,” agreed Benjamin Decker, CEO of the digital investigations consultancy Memetic. “The removal of 8chan is just crossing one more platform off the list they won’t be using for the time being, but it won’t necessarily disrupt the community structure.”As users seek new platforms, the “gamification” of content – receiving votes for comments and posts – is key, said Decker. But what’s most important is anonymity.“At the end of the day these user communities will shift into anonymized space. They’d rather shy away from being outed for having such opinions,” Decker said.Among the sites 8chan users appear to be relocating to is Gab, the forum frequented by the alleged shooter in the November 2018 Pittsburgh synagogue attack. In a statement released on Wednesday, Gab said it was adding more than 1,000 new users a day as “big tech bans people”.“The more journalists demonize companies like Gab and 8chan, the more you accelerate us towards the inevitable decentralized and open source future,” Gab said.Decker noted there had also been discussion in the 8chan community about moving to lesser-known services.Some users may also just be returning to 4chan, the message board that predated 8chan and enforces more rules on hate speech. An analysis from the web analytics service SimilarWeb found traffic to both sites peaked on 4 August, the day after the El Paso shooting.“These increases in traffic to 8ch.net and 4chan.org could suggest that people that are unfamiliar with what 8chan is are going to the site because of the media frenzy surrounding it, and recurring visitors to 8ch.net are now switching to 4chan.org, following the shutdown of 8ch.net,” Ilana Marks of SimilarWeb said.8chan has also found a second life on harder-to-reach parts of the internet. In recent days, a replica of the site has emerged on the deep web, said Decker, referring to unindexed internet pages that require a special browser to access.He added that a separate mirror version of the forum went up on Zeronet, an alternative to the dark web that requires you to host content on your own computer.It’s not clear who’s behind the Zeronet version. An 8chan administrator said the Zeronet site was not built by the original 8chan team, and added he had “no idea who set that up”. Former 8chan members have warned users that by downloading Zeronet they may be inadvertently hosting child abuse images on their computers.Encrypted messaging platforms, too, may be providing the 8chan community ways to communicate. Telegram has seen an uptick in far-right speech as users migrate to the anonymous service, Decker said. Donovan, too, said her research was showing that discussions once prevalent on 8chan were increasingly popping up on Telegram chats. And other 8chan users have spoken on Twitter about moving to Discord, a voice and text app. Telegram and Discord did not immediately respond to a request for comment.That 8chan has been pushed further underground has both positive and negative effects, experts say. The site’s banishment to the dark web makes it less accessible to the average person, and far harder to find. But it could also make it more difficult to monitor dangerous speech, and help allow hate movements to proliferate.While underground and encrypted platforms are seeing an increase in traffic, more mainstream platforms may also see an influx of 8chan users, Decker said. And those platforms have been slow to block the 8chan spillover.Some 8chan users appear to be gathering in the comment sections of YouTube videos and others in private Facebook groups dedicated to conspiracy theory QAnon.Tracking the spread of these communities is difficult, and so far, tech companies have focused on removing violent images, rather than addressing the language that slowly radicalizes users.“One way to prevent 8chan users from migrating to alternative social media spaces like YouTube and Facebook would be to build a moat around the platforms to prevent inbound links from these sites,” Decker said. “As a researcher it is frustrating to see mainstream social sites not employ this defense strategy.”Facebook automatically blocks links from the Daily Stormer, a white supremacist message board that was widely deplatformed after it was linked to violence in Charlottesville in 2017, but links from Gab, 8chan, and 4chan are still categorically allowed.A Facebook spokeswoman told the  the company blocked links to other sites when the content violates community standards on a case by case basis. In the aftermath of El Paso, Facebook blocked links to sites that contained the manifesto posted by the shooter.YouTube told the  it was removing comments that violated its community guidelines, but the videos themselves remain. The company declined to say whether it plans to address 8chan users moving to the platform and YouTube still allows links from 8chan and 4chan to be posted in comment sections for videos. Though 8chan members likely prefer anonymous platforms to Facebook and YouTube, it’s important these companies crack down on content from the site, Decker said.“There is an inherent value in deplatforming the site as a whole and making it harder to be accessed because the nature of these communities makes it difficult to inoculate the spread of this toxicity.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31656bce5e4ae63d0c456c79855a11770706a036/0_253_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a17d2b4082ef294f6282a4bdbce15403","title":"chinas child modelling industry a photo essay","story":"Manicured children strut down the catwalks of Beijing fashion shows as thousands of events drive the huge demand for child models. Insiders warn that modelling can leave minors vulnerable to physical abuse, 12-hour-days and unrelenting pressureby Greg BakerAFPGetty Images. Co-written by Xin Liu and Pak YiuThe children’s apparel market is growing faster than any other clothing sector in China and was worth more than $40.5bn (£33bn) in 2018, according to Euromonitor. This, combined with the rise of “kidfluencers” sponsored by brands to promote products on social media, is spurring greater demand for young models across the country – but experts warn of the heavy cost of pursuing such deals.“If children don’t listen to the parents, then I think hitting them is quite standard,” Lee Ku, the founder of Le Show Stars modelling school, told AFP. A video of a mother kicking her three-year-old daughter in fury at her failure to comply during a modelling job went viral earlier this year, causing outrage online. And footage emerged in early August online of a young boy modelling thick winter clothes outside as temperatures soared to 37C, also drawing heavy online criticism.But in an industry where minors can earn 10,000 yuan (£1,200) a session, Lee says the clip is the tip of the iceberg and, from his experience, such violent behaviour from parents is not unusual on shoots. Child models sometimes go through more than 100 outfit changes in a session, often working from morning till night. But mental health experts warn it is not just physical exhaustion they have to contend with – there may be long-term emotional implications.“Children from the age of zero to six are mentally developing, they need a lot of exploration and freedom,” explained child psychologist Gong Xueping. “At work, the child model will deliberately show a lot of different expressions ... but this is contrary to the child’s own feelings of the moment. This limits the development of both emotional abilities and more complex psychological abilities for children, so I think it’s a very bad choice,” Gong added.But there remains no shortage of parents interested in pushing their children into the profession. Founded three years ago, Le Show Stars was one of the first modelling schools in Beijing, where customers pay up to £95 for a private one-on-one lesson.Four-year-old twins Yumi and Yuki Xiao are not yet professional models, but for nearly two years they have been taking classes teaching them how to pose and pace the catwalk, in the hopes that they can break into the industry.“For some catwalking competitions, they have to be in the makeup room by 6am,” their father, Xiao Liang, said. “The real competition starts at 2pm, and they finish around 3pm or 4.

But one company has come up with a radical solutionOut the top of St Agnes, a steep village on Cornwall’s north coast, sits a small utopia. The disused mine stack at Wheal Kitty overlooks a group of warehouses reinventing local industry: there is the HQ of the pioneering marine conservation charity Surfers Against Sewage, its big green eye logo staring at zero-waste shop Incredible Bulk. Next door to that is Canteen, a community-minded cafe uniting local people over £5 meals and long trestle tables. Often they are ravenous from a surf or beach clean at Trevaunance Cove down the cliff, a hypersaturated blue on this scorcher of a summer’s day.Then there are the offices and flagship store of Finisterre, an outdoor apparel company focused on sustainability and functionality. Tom Kay, who founded the business 15 years ago, meets me in the office breakout area. The place has the sweet, salty tang of surfboard wax, and Kay’s dog, Otis, roams around under employees’ desks. Finisterre’s aim, says Kay, part hippy, part focused businessman, is to connect people with the sea. “We believe that they experience better wellbeing, better health, better spirituality, mental space,” he says. Once a week at Finisterre, staff start an hour late so they can participate in Sea Tuesday – getting wet in whatever way floats their boat, board or body. “Hopefully, there comes with that a ship, realising the importance of looking after the sea.”After all, what the sea gives us, we seldom give back. David Attenborough’s Blue Planet II kickstarted a nationwide battle against the single-use plastics clogging the oceans. Surfers have an intimate relationship with the water, but the damage they do goes under-reported. Wetsuits are made of neoprene, a synthetic rubber originally invented to line landfill sites: good for staying warm while surfing in December, less so for the environment. Finisterre estimates 380 tonnes of wetsuit waste ends up dumped every year. Eighteen months ago, Kay decided to do something about it. Wetsuits from Wetsuits is Finisterre’s mission to create the world’s first fully recyclable wetsuit, and to pioneer the means of recycling any old suit.Finisterre already uses a biodegradable rubber in its suits. It makes clothes from Econyl, a recycled nylon made from discarded fishing nets and carpet tiles. Fully recyclable wetsuits are the next step. “We have an outlook to do something about these problems if we can,” says Kay. “We’re very much involved in solving these problems in innovation.”Finisterre hired what Kay believes is the world’s only full-time wetsuit recycler to help the company look for sustainability solutions. Jenny Banks is a graduate of the material futures MA at Central Saint Martins in London. Normally, at the start of such a project, she says, you would spend a year reviewing existing research. “But it’s been so hard to find information,” she says. “We’ve got one or two papers on testing wetsuit properties and construction, and a lot of those testing standards are military standards from the 50s when they started making ing suits.”It is possible that the knowledge is “kept within the walls” of the main suppliers, she says. Or that there has not actually been much wetsuit innovation since the San Diego physicist Hugh Bradner invented them in 1952. “There’s a reason why we still use the materials that we use in nonrecyclable wetsuits today,” says Banks. “They are pretty brilliant.”Conventional wetsuits can contain as many as 15 different materials that are nearly impossible to separate at the end of a suit’s life. Finisterre’s plan was to design a suit made of a limited number of materials to maximise the quality of rubber and other material that could be recovered in the recycling process. So Banks started chopping up standard suits and testing the constituent parts for stress and durability. “Fabrics are great for meaning the foam doesn’t overstretch, but the fabrics make recycling really hard. That was the starting point of the redesign – asking: how do we still make the foam strong, but make it recyclable?”One solution was using a “skin finish” – a texturised biodegradable rubber that prevents water from getting trapped in the fabric and chilling the wearer. But it is controversial, and not for its environmental impact. “Skin finishes were used in the 70s and it’s seen as a very retro thing,” says Banks. “There are a few small brands that still use it as a style point – some people love it and some people hate it. You’re balancing style and sustainability …”But the prototype that Kay shows me at Finisterre’s office looks sharp: the skin finish appears technical in an on-trend way. It is a men’s suit because women’s are harder to cut. He has tested it out in the water and, even designed as a 3mm-thick summer suit, it is a bit warm, and not that easy to get on and off. He has me stick an arm down a sleeve, which is sticky – removing a wetsuit at the best of times can be a pretty undignified battle. Still: “This is the most recyclable suit out there in the world, pretty much,” Kay says proudly. “It’s got no laminate on it, you can take the stitching out and then the theory is that it can be totally recycled.”There is still a lot more testing to go – next, Kay and other testers will wear the suit with temperature sensors for a more precise assessment of the heat situation.This is the “upstream” element of Wetsuits from Wetsuits: the creation of a product that can be recycled. “Downstream is when the product has gone through the hands of the customer and is about to go to landfill,” says Kay. Here is where another, chemical recycling process comes in. Kay discovered ReNew ELP, a hydrothermal plant in Australia that uses catalytic thermo-hydrolysis to break down any old wetsuits and marine waste from Sydney’s beaches into a bio-crude. When Finisterre put out a call for old suits to send to Australia, it got 100 in two days.Banks admits that this discovery may make Finisterre’s recyclable wetsuit seem redundant. But the more materials go into the bio-crude, the more that need distilling afterwards, which is expensive. “By simplifying the materials within our suit,” she says, “we maximise the amount of good quality, pure material we can recover and reintroduce into our wetsuit manufacturing.”Obviously, these processes also have an environmental impact. “We’re trying to find a partner to do a life-cycle assessment to find out what the balance is between the environmental impact of the recycling and the environmental impact of making them from virgin,” says Banks.By talking about this, Finisterre is giving away the company secrets. But that is the point. Other surf brands “won’t do it because it’s a nice thing to do, or the right thing to do,” says Kay. “But they will do it when you can prove an economic case. The innovation around the future of business growth has to be waste as a resource. If you can prove that you can get the bio-crude out of the plant in Australia, and that’s saving half of the raw material cost at the start, suddenly there’s an economic argument for it. If we as a brand could prove that change is possible, that’s something I’m really excited about, and really gunning for.”Wetsuits from Wetsuits was initially conceived and funded as a two-year programme, which would theoretically end in November, but Banks says it is realistically a five-year plan that needs support from the big guns. “At the end of these two years, it’ll be about presenting the prototype, the information from our wetsuit testers and the lab, and saying, this is totally feasible, let’s do this together. We’re a tiny brand in the whole scheme of the wetsuit industry. The next phase would be about partnership and collaboration, and building up enough momentum from the wetsuit industry to put pressure on the supplier to make that change.”Finisterre is not yet profiting from the programme, and once it hits the market it will have to persuade customers to spend more. Kay notes the growing awareness around the climate emergency, but says he does not think most people will splash out on sustainability. “So that’s the challenge: getting proof of concept, testing this first recycled wetsuit out, and then starting to think about the economic viability.”It has taken longer than Kay and Banks thought it would to get here, but both sound irrepressibly enthused about what is still to come.“We could have waited for one of the bigger wetsuit brands to figure this all out, but we didn’t, which I think is testament to how dedicated we are to our ethos of looking after our environment and bringing about positive change,” says Banks. At any rate: the joy of surfing lies in never tiring of the pursuit of perfection, so their temperaments are well suited to their mission."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e450f4ad20c05b76a7a60c7f6b9241332889ff4d/0_122_3664_2199/master/3664.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98d7833b1672af5af5bd9a9e626d71c3","title":"italys matteo salvini calls for fresh elections as coalition fractures","story":"Far-right leader says it is pointless continuing government with Five Star Movement Italy’s far-right leader, Matteo Salvini, has called for new elections as he urged the prime minister to reconvene parliament to confirm that the coalition government is no longer viable.The dramatic move on Thursday came after months of fighting between his League party and the the anti-establishement Five Star Movement (M5S).The cavernous differences between the parties were clearly exposed on Wednesday when parliament rejected a motion by M5S to block a high-speed rail project linking Italy and France. M5S has built most of its popularity on vehemently opposing the long-stalled project but was outvoted by the League and opposition parties.In a statement, Salvini, deputy prime minister and interior minister, said it was pointless continuing the government with all the quarrelling.“Italians need certainty and a government that does things, not a ‘Mr No’,” he said.“We do not want extra seats or ministers, nor do we want reshuffles or technical governments. After this government (which has done so many good things), the only thing is elections.”Conte, who had held separate talks with Salvini and the country’s President Sergio Mattarella as the crisis deepened, said in a statement later that the interior minister doesn’t summon parliament and “it’s not up to him to dictate the steps of the political crisis.”Conte called on Salvini “to explain to the country and justify to the electorate, who believed in the possibility of change, the reasons that brought him to abruptly interrupt” the activities of government.Luigi Di Maio, the M5S leader and co-deputy prime minister, said he was ready to return to the polls as “the League has mocked Italians”.The uneasy partnership between the far-right League and the anti-establishment M5S has been rocked by ongoing spats. The coalition came to power in June 2018 but the government has been on shaky ground for much of the time, with constant speculation that Salvini would orchestrate a collapse amid his flourishing popularity.The Italian parliament is now on its summer break but it could reconvene next week. The government won’t move towards a collapse unless there’s a no-confidence motion or Conte resigns. It then rests with President Sergio Mattarella to dissolve the government and decide if the next step would be snap elections or the installation of a technical government in order to pass the 2020 budget in the autumn."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3981158.1565297254!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"reliance on beef and dairying makes ireland vulnerable climate expert","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWorld Meteorological Organization before a news conference on the Special Report on Climate Change and Land after IPCC’s 50th session in Geneva, August 8th, 2019. Photograph: EpaMartial TrezziniThe world cannot avoid the worst impacts of climate change without radically changing how it produces food, the UN has warned in its latest assessment on the accelerating impact of global heating on the planet.The findings of leading scientists who make up the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), places additional pressures on the Government to re-direct agricultural policy, to ersify the sector and to reduce reliance on beef and dairying. Ending peat extraction from boglands is also endorsed in the report issued in Geneva on Thursday. The IPCC concluded that eating less meat, especially in developed countries, and reducing food waste was an effective method to help reduce global warming. It predicts that taking this course would save millions of square kilometres of land from being degraded by farming.The findings led to calls on the Government from climate campaigners and the Green Party to draw up a national land-use plan to help redirect agriculture and to set out how afforestation could help reduce carbon emissions.Climatologist Prof Peter Thorne of Maynooth University, who is a leading IPCC author, said the report underlines the huge vulnerability facing the country due to reliance on beef and dairying.The IPCC had demonstrated climate and land degradation were entwined risks, he added. “If we want to reduce risk to land we need to get serious about addressing climate change,” he warned.DietsEverybody needs to think carefully about their diets, he said. The evidence was overwhelming that meat-rich diets placed greater stress on land and had a higher carbon footprint. “We need to actively promote less intensive agricultural production.”About 25 per cent of food globally was wasted, he noted, “yet hundreds of millions are malnourished . . . We do need a serious assessment of how we can do better”. He was not calling for getting rid of all cattle. “But we need to take a number of actions which makes sense irrespective of climate change. We are one disease outbreak or shift in consumer habits from decimating rural Ireland economy.” There was a need to reduce the national herd and to ersify production “so we produce locally more of the food we nationally need to consume”. A national land-use plan was key to effectively managing land in a changing climate, he said.Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed said the report was a timely scientific assessment of the current state of knowledge on climate change and land.

Photograph: Martial TrezziniEPAThe latest report from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was broadly welcomed by scientists across the globe as a framework to transform land use and increase food security.Although the report stopped short of explicitly advocating going meat-free, it calls for big changes to farming and eating habits to limit the impact of population growth and changing consumption patterns on already over-exploited land and water resources.“This is a perfect storm,” said Prof Dave Reay of the University of Edinburgh, who was an expert reviewer for the report. “Limited land, an expanding human population, and all wrapped in a suffocating blanket of climate emergency. Earth has never felt smaller, its natural ecosystems never under such direct threat.”Dr Oyinlola Oyebode, associate professor in public health at the University of Warwick, said the IPCC verdict fits with growing evidence of the multiple benefits that could accrue if people shift their diet towards plant-based alternatives to meat.These benefits included reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and releasing land which could then be reclaimed as habitat for animal and plant species.“In addition, though, there are benefits to human health.”Wake-up callJonathan Baillie, chief scientist for the National Geographic Society, said the IPCC report was another important wake-up call to find a more sustainable path.“This is a global problem, which requires action by all sectors of society – countries, companies and communities – to solve.”Oxfam’s senior climate policy advisor Aditi Sen said land management was central to the fight against the climate crisis and hunger. Industrial agriculture, deforestation and increasing weather shocks were destroying the land needed for food, while the world’s poorest were hit hardest.“Politicians must aim for zero hunger as well as zero emissions. They must reject false solutions that ert land away from growing food and into producing crops and trees for energy and carbon capture.”IPCC representative Prof Jim Skea of Imperial College London said land was already struggling and climate change was adding to its burden. Almost three-quarters of ice-free land was now directly affected by human activity, the report says.‘Less pressure’“There are certain kinds of diets that have a lower carbon footprint and put less pressure on land,” he said.Large-scale tree-planting and bioenergy production are important tools to limit global warming, but could threaten food security, according to the IPCC. In late-running negotiations on how to summarise the latest science for policymakers, representatives of forest nations stressed that with sustainable management, these conflicts could be minimised.“Land already in use could feed the world in a changing climate and provide biomass for renewable energy, but early, far-reaching action across several areas is required,” said Hans-Otto Pörtner, one of the other scientists coordinating the report. “Also for the conservation and restoration of ecosystems and bioersity.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3981097.1565292152!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"st luke s consultant put on leave while hse deals with case","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLast June, Prof Ray O’Sullivan told The  he did not feel he needed to obtain consent before carrying out tests on the vaginas of five women patients. Photograph: ThinkstockA consultant at St Luke’s Hospital, Kilkenny, who carried out research on five women patients without their consent, has been placed on administrative leave.Obstetrician and gynaecologist Prof Ray O’Sullivan has told colleagues he plans to vigorously challenge the decision by the Health Service Executive (HSE) to place him on leave, effective from last Wednesday.Prof O’Sullivan will remain on leave, on full pay, while his case is dealt with under the HSE’s disciplinary procedures. The decision to place him on leave was made by HSE director general Paul Reid. Last June, Prof O’Sullivan told The  he did not feel he needed to obtain consent before carrying out tests on the vaginas of five women patients last September. The tests were stopped after nursing staff raised concerns over whether the required consents had been obtained from the hospital and from the patients.The hospital sought his suspension, prompting Ireland East Hospital Group to commission a report into the issue, which found no evidence of informed consent having been sought from the women.Two reportsThe hospital group then commissioned a second report, but after The  revealed what had happened, Mr Reid assumed responsibility for dealing with the issue. As a consultant with a pre-2008 contract, Prof O’Sullivan is legally employed and responsible to the chief executive of the (now defunct) health board.Mr Reid wrote to Prof O’Sullivan last month enclosing the two reports and a summary of the incident, and seeking a response by July 31st. Prof O’Sullivan replied by letter, after which Mr Reid sent a second letter earlier this week placing him on administrative leave with immediate effect.Contacted on Thursday, Prof O’Sullivan declined to comment, saying the matter was with his legal advisers and would be “sorted out” by them. A spokeswoman for the hospital group said: “The Ireland East Hospital Group and HSE are precluded from discussing issues between employers and employees. Therefore we have no comment at this time.”‘Pressure study’The procedure performed on the five women involved flushing their vaginas with water and testing the resultant changes in pressure. Prof O’Sullivan is trying to develop a technique that could reduce or replace the need for a speculum, the traditional tool used by gynaecologists to open the vagina for examination.The patients, who were in hospital for a hysteroscopy (examination of the vagina with a miniature camera), were unaware of the research work being carried out by Prof O’Sullivan. This involved a rectal probe, sourced from outside the hospital, being inserted into the vagina. This was connected to a monitoring kit which was used to measure vaginal pressures.Prof O’Sullivan, in correspondence with the hospital group, has described the research as a “pressure study” using sterile water and has said the transducers on the equipment were changed between patients on the insistence of nursing staff.“I felt I didn’t need consent. I didn’t because we weren’t actually doing the research. We were just seeing if a particular procedure that we were planning on doing as part of the research could be done,” he told The  in June."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Ex-soldier, film-maker who hired cadaver dogs to find body alerted Garda to locationRay O\u0026rsquoSullivan to challenge move linked to research consent issues in Kilkenny hospitalCampaigners and Greens endorse UN call for land-use plan for changing climateCourt hears she and their two children were \u0026lsquoterrified of him\u0026rsquo in their family homeFF TD John Lahart says Government wants people to change \u0026lsquoyet their own house is not remotely in order\u0026rsquoIPCC report on climate change argues major shift to vegetarian diets is neededFormer employee complaint led to investigation of Co Monaghan companyClinical need will determine access to clinics as smear test backlog to be cleared in weeksChildren\u0026rsquos Health Ireland among those concerned about health implications of changeThree officers injured and 13-year-old arrested during standoff over anti-internment eventIrish Farmers\u0026rsquo Association says attack on national herd \u0026lsquolacks climate credibility\u0026rsquoGarda\u0026iacute believe mastermind behind cross-border \u0026lsquocarousel\u0026rsquo scam is based in North\u0026lsquoEarth has never felt smaller, its natural ecosystems never under such direct threat\u0026rsquoMerchants Quay Ireland says society has a duty to protect most vulnerable citizens\u0026lsquoLeaky blood vessels\u0026rsquo pre-dispose eye to age related macular degeneration, study findsConditions ideal as thousands turn out for Ladies Day in the RDSCurrently investors are set to appoint majority of board of National Broadband IrelandCar and van involved in road traffic incident around 3pm on Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3980957.1565283947!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ignorance of irish history fuels britain s brexit debate says victoria writer","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDaisy Goodwin: ‘The Irish don’t need anyone to tell them about the Famine, but the English do’ Daisy Goodwin’s ancestor, the Church of Ireland clergyman in Schull, Robert Traill spent most of his savings on Famine relief in 1846, before dying of typhus a year later.Last year, his great-great-great granddaughter, Daisy Goodwin brought the story of the Famine to more than seven million viewers in an episode of the ITV drama, Victoria.“He wasn’t at all perfect, but when it came to it he sacrificed everything for something that he believed in,” says Goodwin, who speaks this weekend at the West Cork History Festival in Skibbereen.“Robert Traill had been a fervent evangelical Protestant in the 1830s, but when the Famine started he felt he had to do something about it. He wrote very impassioned letters which have incredible biblical language.”As the rector in Schull, Traill set up soup kitchens that helped many of west Cork’s starving population, while writing ever-more urgent letters to London appealing for aid.In one letter to Westminster, he wrote: “I would not wish, were it possible, that one starving creature would leave my door without something to allay the cravings of hunger”.Traill’s story, played out by Line of Duty star, Martin Compston, shocked British viewers with the raw, uncompromising portrayal of the Famine in an episode, titled Faith, Hope and Charity.The episode prompted debate in Britain about the lack of knowledge now held about the Famine, “a piece of history un-taught in schools”, in the words of one commentator.DehumanisingPortraying the British government led by Charles Russell as morally bankrupt and neglectful, Goodwin argued that leading official Charles Trevelyan – “an arch-villain” – had propagated a dehumanising picture of the Irish.“What is really scary is the cold-blooded Malthusian logic that this was basically natural wastage. That it was part of the natural cycle of life and there was nothing you could do about it. You realise how easy it is to dismiss real people as ‘the other’.”Such gaps in historical knowledge are affecting relations between Ireland and the UK today, Goodwin believes, saying that a lack of “respect” for Ireland is undermining progress in the Brexit negotiations.“I don’t think you can really understand even what’s going on in Ireland now without understanding the Famine,” she says. “The Irish have become a thorn in the Brexiteers side. I wonder if enough respect is shown to Ireland, there are Tory politicians who have somehow picked up some of those 19th-century attitudes.”This ignorance, she believes, is down to a lack of education at school level about Britain’s colonial past in Ireland. Indeed, Irish history as a whole is very rarely taught in English schools.“Most people only learn about the second World War,” Daisy says. “We never really go further back than that. The Irish don’t need anyone to tell them about the Famine, but the English do. There needs to be a rethinking in our attitudes towards Ireland.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

their outfits to steal dozens of items from a supermarket.The women were stopped by security guards at an Asda branch in Dagenham, East London, after being suspected of trying to leave with an estimated £200 worth of tins of baby formula hidden in their clothing.Video footage taken by a local shopper appeared to show one of the women taking items from what appeared to be a bag or pouch hidden under the long, black robe she was wearing after being confronted by security staff at the store last Saturday evening.Both women were wearing hijabs and black abayas, the headscarf and loose robe-like garment worn by some Muslim women.At one stage one of the woman pulls up the dress, revealing her tummy and underwear, in what appears to be an attempt to show she is not hiding any more items.Some of the items the women are alleged to have attempted to stealThe Asda employees can be seen covering their eyes and turning away as the woman walks towards the exit whilst holding up her black dress, leaving behind her a pile of around 20 discarded items. Her actions prompted several onlookers to question whether they were Muslim at all, with some saying no observant woman would either shoplift or expose herself in a similar manner. One Muslim mother of two shopping in the store on Wednesday told The :  “It’s not the first time it’s happened, where they dress up in abayas. It’s wrong and I\u0027ve seen it done before all around the world. It\u0027s wrong.Another shopper, who herself wears a hijab and abaya, wrote on Twitter: “If she’s Muslim or not she’s giving us Muslim women a bad light and if she is Muslim then may Allah guide her.”Another Twitter user, named only as Abdul, wrote: These people aren’t Muslim they’re those people who live in and around east London and have exploited the fact that it’s predominantly Muslims around here and to be honest Muslims are very generous people in giving towards charity and these frauds know this. Be aware everyone.”Security staff surround the two women at the Dagenham AsdaA senior Muslim community leader, who asked not to be named, told The : “It’s highly unlikely religious Muslim women would do this, but different Muslims do different things. If these women were Muslim and were attempting to shoplift they certainly should not be doing so. Both these acts, shoplifting and lifting up their dresses, go against what Muslims should be doing in the first place.”Asda staff did not immediately report the incident to the police, waiting until yesterday to do so, and the whereabouts of the two women are currently unknown.A spokesperson for Asda said: “We do not tolerate any form of shoplifting and work hard to deter shoplifters from our stores. “All cases of attempted theft are taken seriously and we always work closely with the local police force in the communities we serve. “We are in contact with Dagenham Police about this incident and would like to thank colleagues at our Dagenham store for their quick intervention and response in this case.”The politan Police said its officers were investigating the incident but had made no arrests at this stage.A Scotland Yard spokesman said: “We are aware of footage circulating on social media of two females having been stopped by staff members at a commercial premises at Merrilands Crescent, Dagenham on suspicion of theft. “The incident occurred on Sunday, 4 August between 19:30hrs and 19:45hrs. The two suspects are suspected of having attempted to steal infant formula. The incident was reported to police at 13:22hrs on Wednesday, 7 August. At this early stage there have been no arrests.” Delaying Brexit again is more damaging than a no-deal on October 31, says Tory party deputy chairman Comment: A world-class education system is well within Britain’s graspTrump names counterterrorism chief as acting director of national intelligenceMcConnell rejects US mayors\u0026#39 demand for Senate action on gun bills, after shootingsLabour MSPs vow to ignore John McDonnell U-turn over allowing second independence referendumMillions suffering mobile phone signal blackouts because most areas lack 4G coverageAsthma deaths have increased by a third in a decade as hot summers, air pollution and lack of care blamed Teenage girl, 14, found dead and relative in critical condition after Clacton sea rescueDavid Mundell: \u0026#39Hard to push back\u0026#39 against second Scottish referendum if \u0026#39explicit\u0026#39 nationalist majority in 2021Chancellor announces spending round amid election speculation, as  Boris Johnson gets ready to turn on the tapsChemistry undergraduate becomes twelfth student in Bristol to take their own lifeAssistant chief constable smashed into oncoming car because she was trying to make hands free call to MP husband, court hearsBritish astrophysicist died \u0026#39instantly from fall\u0026#39 on Greek islandComment: Why a no-deal Brexit would weaken the case for Scottish independence\tCelebrities urge boycott of SoulCycle and Equinox over owner\u0026#39s fundraising for Donald TrumpTeenage killers found dead after massive manhunt in CanadaBoris Johnson to announce end to visa restrictions on top scientists, to attract top talentJacob Rees-Mogg reveals that ‘going forward’ and the Oxford comma will be added to his list of banned words People should adopt a plant-based diet to prevent climate change but British beef farmers call report \u0026#39misleading\u0026#39 Comment: Don\u0026#39t believe the doomsters: A US-UK trade deal is on the cards for 2020\tSpear fisherman attacked by shark is rescued by boat full of nursesWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/08/08/TELEMMGLPICT000078921508_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqrpfQw2hJyG_yckwxPAr0go9KzD8cVu9iguqnaKUswZA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"celebrities urge boycott soulcycle equinox owners fundraising","story":"The fitness company SoulCycle is facing a potential boycott from some customers after it emerged a leading investor was hosting a fundraising event for Donald Trump.Stephen Ross, a billionaire, is the chairman of the company which owns SoulCycle and Equinox gyms.He is hosting a fundraiser for the US president at his New York home, with tickets costing up to $250,000.Mr Trump is expected to attend the event, and donors will be able to have a photograph taken with him for $100,000.Celebrities including the model Chrissy Teigen, and comedian Billy Eichner, called for a boycott of SoulCycle and Equinox.They have both previously expressed vocal opposition to Mr Trump\u0027s policies, including on immigration.Ms Teigen said the issue boiled down to fundamental differences in compassion, empathy and humanity.Mr Eichner said he had canceled his membership because money talks.The hashtag BoycottEquinox began trending on Twitter.In a statement Equinox described Mr Ross, who also owns the Miami Dolphins American football team, as a passive investor.It said: We believe in tolerance and equality, and will always stay true to those values.Melanie Whelan, chief executive of SoulCycle, which provides indoor cycling workout classes, said the company in no way endorses the political fundraising event.Mr Ross said: I have always been an active participant in the democratic process.

The death of Maria Stancliffe-Cook, 20, an undergraduate at Bristol University, follows a spate of student fatalities in the city in recent years. This includes nine from Bristol University and a further two from the neighbouring University of the West of England.In a statement her family described her as a beautiful and intelligent girl.They said: Maria was a beautiful, intelligent girl who was much loved and will be deeply missed by her family and friends. She was a hard working and diligent student. Words cannot express how saddened we are by her unexpected absence from our lives.Earlier this month it emerged that Bristol University used new powers to alert the parents of 36 students that there were serious concerns about their mental health in the first year of its new suicide prevention scheme.The reasons for Miss Stancliffe-Cook\u0027s death are not yet known. A University of Bristol spokesperson said: “We have received the very sad news that Maria Stancliffe-Cook, an undergraduate student studying Chemistry at the University of Bristol, has died.  “There is nothing harder for our community than the death of one of our students. We have offered our support to Maria’s family and friends, and our thoughts and sympathies are with them all.   “We encourage any members of our community who are affected by this news to make sure they contact University wellbeing services for help, even if they are away from Bristol for the summer holidays, as well as seeking support from their own friends or family.”Bristol University is currently spending £1 million on well-being advisers as part of a package to counter growing concerns over students\u0027 mental health.   The university has hired a team of 28 full-time mental health

mitigate food shortages.The Food and Drink Federation (FDF), representing food and drink manufacturers,\u0026nbsphas asked for “cast-iron” reassurance that firms would\u0026nbspbe allowed to work together “to tackle likely shortages – to decide where to prioritise shipments”, FDF chief operating officer Tim Rycroft said in a statement. Competition law prohibits such cooperation.\u0026nbsp“We asked for these reassurances at the end of last year and, despite support from Defra, we’re still waiting,” Mr Rycroft said.Speaking to BBC Radio 4 on Wednesday, he said shortages would affect “random” products, depending on “which trucks get through”, and that supplies would be disrupted for weeks or months after the Brexit date.\u0026nbspLord Haskins, former chair\u0026nbspof Northern Foods, agreed\u0026nbspfood shortages are likely if Britain crashes out of the EU, and warned of potential panic-buying which would exacerbate them.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 51Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Beer enthusiasts taste beer and ale during The Great British Beer Festival at Kensington Olympia in west London.

I have my doubts,” he told BBC Radio 4.\u0026nbspHe added that in such a scenario supplies shouldn’t be directed just to supermarkets as a priority but to schools and hospitals as well.\u0026nbsp“We could be in a sort of wartime situation of a limited amount of food rationing… I don’t think we’ll get to that but I’m very concerned about the groups who aren’t in the supermarket chain, how they will deal with things. We have to prioritise – who can prioritise except the government itself?”If the waiver is granted allowing food producers to manage supply disruptions as a group, it will not do anything to stem rises in food prices. According to the FDF, prices will “inevitably” increase because trading under WTO rules will be more expensive and firms will also pass on to consumers the costs of preparing\u0026nbspfor a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe comments add to earlier warnings that a chaotic departure from the EU would lead to food shortages and higher prices.\u0026nbspMark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, said last week food imports would be disrupted if Britain’s ports are not ready in time to handle a sudden surge in customs checks. He added that a no-deal Brexit would slash the value of the pound, immediately raising food prices.\u0026nbspAnd on Monday Tim Lang, professor of food policy at City University, warned that the UK’s food supply faces levels of disruption “unprecedented” in peacetime. The public has so far been kept “largely in the dark” about the government’s view on the gravity of the situation that could unfold, he wrote in The Lancet.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Competition law prohibits such cooperation.\u0026nbsp“We asked for these reassurances at the end of last year and, despite support from Defra, we’re still waiting,” Mr Rycroft said.Speaking to BBC Radio 4 on Wednesday, he said shortages would affect “random” products, depending on “which trucks get through”, and that supplies would be disrupted for weeks or months after the Brexit date.\u0026nbspLord Haskins, former chair\u0026nbspof Northern Foods, agreed\u0026nbspfood shortages are likely if Britain crashes out of the EU, and warned of potential panic-buying which would exacerbate them.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 51Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Beer enthusiasts taste beer and ale during The Great British Beer Festival at Kensington Olympia in west London.

I have my doubts,” he told BBC Radio 4.\u0026nbspHe added that in such a scenario supplies shouldn’t be directed just to supermarkets as a priority but to schools and hospitals as well.\u0026nbsp“We could be in a sort of wartime situation of a limited amount of food rationing… I don’t think we’ll get to that but I’m very concerned about the groups who aren’t in the supermarket chain, how they will deal with things. We have to prioritise – who can prioritise except the government itself?”If the waiver is granted allowing food producers to manage supply disruptions as a group, it will not do anything to stem rises in food prices. According to the FDF, prices will “inevitably” increase because trading under WTO rules will be more expensive and firms will also pass on to consumers the costs of preparing\u0026nbspfor a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe comments add to earlier warnings that a chaotic departure from the EU would lead to food shortages and higher prices.\u0026nbspMark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, said last week food imports would be disrupted if Britain’s ports are not ready in time to handle a sudden surge in customs checks. He added that a no-deal Brexit would slash the value of the pound, immediately raising food prices.\u0026nbspAnd on Monday Tim Lang, professor of food policy at City University, warned that the UK’s food supply faces levels of disruption “unprecedented” in peacetime. The public has so far been kept “largely in the dark” about the government’s view on the gravity of the situation that could unfold, he wrote in The Lancet.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

to decide where to prioritise shipments - they will have to provide cast-iron written reassurances that competition law will not be strictly applied to those discussions,” FDF\u0027s chief operating officer Tim Rycroft told the BBC.\u0026nbspIn the markets, Asian stocks were down on Wednesday while European bourses gained in morning trading.\u0026nbspDominic Raab, the foreign secretary, has\u0026nbsppraised Donald Trump and his deputy Mike Pence for their warmth and enthusiasm for the UK-US relationship.\u0026nbspRaab says he was delighted to meet the pair on his three-day trip to the US in hope of paving the way for a post-Brexit trade deal.The UK looks forward to working with our American friends to reach a free trade deal that is good for both countries, and co-operating on the common security challenges we face.\u0026nbspE.On is the latest “Big Six” energy supplier to blame the government’s price cap for plummeting profits.The cap, which will be reduced this winter, is supposed to stop firms ripping off loyal customers.The German utility’s earnings from UK retail customers crashed 78 per cent in the latest quarter.Customer numbers fell by around 200,000 to 6.4 million in the three months to March.Bad news for E.On today but good news for about 15 million households who will see their energy bills fall this winter.\u0026nbspAnnual energy bills will go down by £75 on average for 11 million households on standard tariffs and by £25 for customers who pay for their gas and electricity upfront.\u0026nbspOfgem, the energy regulator for England, Wales and Scotland, is lowering the price caps for the October to March period due to lower wholesale energy prices.Full story here from Olesya Dmitracova:Energy bills to fall for 15 million households this winter as Ofgem lowers price capsExecutives at Hargreaves Lansdown will give up their bonuses after the Woodford fund fiasco, Reuters\u0026nbspis reporting.\u0026nbspAccording to the nes agency\u0027s source, Hargreaves\u0027 chief executive Chris Hill, Chief financial officer Philip Johnson, chief investment officer Lee Gardhouse and research director Mark Dampier, will take no bonus for 2019.\u0026nbspHargreaves plugged Woodford\u0027s fund through its best buy list and received fees for referring customers.\u0026nbspHundreds of thousands of Hargreaves Lansdown customers who ploughed their savings into Woodford\u0027s flagship fund have had their money frozen since June and it will likely stay there until at least December as the once highly regarded stock picker tries to sort out the mess he is in.\u0026nbspWoodford invested in riskier unlisted stocks which he couldn\u0027t get rid of fast enough when a long run of poor performance prompted people to demands their cash back.House prices have fallen for the second successive month, Halifax says.The average UK house price was down 2 per cent in July to\u0026nbsp£236,120 following a 0.4 per cent monthly decline in June.However, the lender said prices were still up 4.1 per cent in the year to July.Brexit uncertainty will weigh on the UK housing market over the next few months according to analysts at the EY ITEM Club.\u0026nbspConsumers may well be particularly cautious about committing to buying a house, especially as house prices are relatively expensive relative to incomes, says Howard Archer.\u0026nbspHouse prices are still far higher compared to earnings than the average over the last 35 years.\u0026nbspAccording to the Halifax, the house price to earnings ratio was still as high as 5.59 in July after spiking to 5.72 in February (the highest level since November 2017) from 5.39 in January this is well above the long-term (1983-2019) average of 4.29.\u0026nbspAnd it is questionable whether recent growth in jobs numbers and earnings can be sustained months as companies tailor their behaviour to a lacklustre domestic economy, prolonged Brexit uncertainties and a challenging global environment.\u0026nbspTherefore Archer forecats\u0026nbspthat house prices will rise by no more than 1.5 per cent in 2019.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspTesla is in a spot of bother in the US.\u0026nbspBloomberg\u0026nbspreports that Elon Musk\u0027s firm has been scrutinised over safety claims on its Model 3 the car intended to take electric vehicles truly into the mainstream.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspUS\u0026nbspNational Highway Traffic Administration reportedly sent a cease and desist letter last year, taking issue with Tesla\u0027s\u0026nbspclaim that the Model 3 had achieved the lowest probability of injury of any vehicle the agency ever tested.So, what exactly is Britain\u0027s food industry saying it needs the government to do to prevent food shortages after Brexit?\u0026nbspIt\u0027s trade body wants firms\u0026nbspto be allowed\u0026nbspco-ordinate and direct supplies with each other if Britain crashes out of the EU on 31 October.\u0026nbspThey cant do that under current rules which prevent them colluding. Those\u0026nbspmeasures are designed to ensure adequate competition and result in the best outcome for consumers.The Food and Drink Federation (FDF) said: “We asked for these reassurances at the end of last year, but we\u0027re still waiting.”\u0026nbspThe industry says that an October Brexit would be disastrous for food supplies because warehouses are already full in the run-up to Christmas.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOne retailer told the BBC that 31 October\u0026nbsp“is about the worst day you can pick”, as warehouse capacity is at 105 per cent\u0026nbspin November, versus 75 per cent - 80 per cent\u0026nbspin March.The government isn\u0027t being entirely up-front about the potentially dire consequences of no-deal Brexit for fresh food and drink supplies, according to a leading academic on the topic.\u0026nbspTim Lang, professor of food policy at City University, warned earlier this week that the UK’s food supply faces levels of disruption “unprecedented” in peacetime.\u0026nbspWhat does that mean?\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\tThe government estimates that half of lorries entering the country will be unable to cross the border smoothly\tThe flow of trucks could drop by a third within a day of a no-deal Brexit\tFood prices predicted to rise by more than 10 per cent as costs rise and supplies fall.Professor Lang warns\u0026nbspthat Britons, particularly those on lower incomes, already under-consume fresh fruit and vegetables, and food banks are not fully prepared for shortages, which could have a negative impact on diets and public health.\u0026nbspFull story here:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBrexit food shortages: Government being secretive over public health risks of no dealThousands of holidaymakers have had their flights cancelled due to more technology failures at British Airways.\u0026nbspSimon Calder has counted\u0026nbsp86 cancellations to and from Heathrow so far today, including one round-trip to New York and dozens of flights to Mediterranean resorts.

Unfortunately, even the food industry, which has tested a range of options to mitigate the effect of massive disruption at Dover, doesn\u0027t really know.\u0026nbspFood and Drink Federation boss Tim Rycroft tells the BBC:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThere will be selective shortages and they will to some extent be random because it depends on which trucks get through and which don\u0027t. We think there will be some serious disruption and it will go on for weeks or months after our exit.The government is unlikely to grant the food industry\u0027s wish for\u0026nbsprelaxed rules to alleviate food supply problems, says Mark Jones, partner at law firm Gordons. Big supermarkets\u0026nbspprobably won\u0027t\u0026nbspbe on board either.Jones says: “The ‘big four’ control almost 70 per cent\u0026nbspof the market and if any of them have a supply chain advantage post-Brexit, it offers them an opportunity to gain market share, says Jones.\u0026nbspI cannot see them wanting to help their competitors. They will want to help their own customers.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“As to suppliers, if they can sell the stock they have, they will, and they may well be able to make a better profit if supply is tight. \u0026nbspIf they cannot sell or use their raw materials, there is nothing stopping them picking up the phone to their competitors and selling raw materials now. \u0026nbspRelaxing rules on anti-competitive behaviour is, in my view, unlikely to help shortages and I cannot see the Government going for it.”\u0026nbspThe pound is a quarter of a per cent lower against the dollar so far today at $1.2137, not far off the 31-month low of $1.2080 it hit last week.\u0026nbspAgainst the euro, sterling is down 0.1 of a cent, leaving it slightly above the 23-month low reached yesterday.\u0026nbspWith little to look out for on the economic calendar, Connor Cambell, financial analyst at Spreadex, predicts markets will remain incredibly susceptible to the minutiae of the trade war and comments from Donald Trump.Twitter has revealed it may have used some people\u0027s personal data to target them with advertising without their permission because of issues within the platform\u0027s settings, the\u0026nbspPress Association\u0026nbspreports.The social media giant said it had recently discovered issues in its website where settings choices may not have worked as intended, resulting in some gathered data being used to personalise advertising.Twitter said it fixed the issues on 5 August.In a blog post discussing the problems, Twitter detailed how, in one case, data may have been shared with advertisers despite not receiving user permission to do so.Donald Trump\u0027s trade war with China has pushed oil prices to a new seven-month low as the outlook for the global economy looks increasingly bleak.\u0026nbspBrent crude is down 0.6\u0026nbspper cent to $58.31.\u0026nbspThe US president attacked Beijing this week for allegedly manipulating its currency to make Chinese exports more competitive.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe UK government is yet to respond to a request by the food industry to waive parts of competition law so that companies can cooperate after a no-deal\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspto mitigate\u0026nbspfood shortages.\u0026nbspFull story from business and economics editor Olesya Dmitracova here:\u0026nbspBrexit: UK food industry asks for rule waiver to tackle food shortages after no-dealOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This can be damaging, not only to the share price, but also to investor confidence.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Savings would fail to provide an ample buffer as consumers have already dissaved significantly since the EU referendum. In fact, the saving rate is running close to its record low levels.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBusiness investment may also slow further as a falling pound with potential for further depreciation could spook investors. Furthermore, the benefit of rising exports usually associated with a weaker currency has not yet been felt by UK businesses, which suggests we may see little boost to exports from a weak pound.\u0026nbspSome better news today in stock markets that have suffered recently from fears surrounding an escalating trade war between the US\u0026nbspand China.\u0026nbspThe major indices edged up on the back of\u0026nbspsurprise news that Chinese exports rose 3.3 per cent in July, despite rising tariffs imposed by Donald Trump\u0027s administration.\u0026nbspImports were also up suggesting China is showing signs of resilience.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp- Japan\u0027s Nikkei 225 up 0.37 per cent to 20,593.35.\u0026nbsp- Hong Kong\u0027s Hang Seng up 0.5 per cent to 26,120.77\u0026nbsp- Germany\u0027s Dax up 0.5 per cent to 11,712.12\u0026nbsp- France\u0027s CAC 40 up 1 per cent to 5,317.74\u0026nbsp- FTSE 100 up 0.14 per cent to 7,208.62While interest rates and economic data would normally drive the value of the pound, right now the primary factor by a long distance is the perceived probability that the UK will leave the EU with no deal on 31 October.\u0026nbspThe more likely it appears to be, the lower the pound goes.\u0026nbspThis morning brings news of another plan MPs have hatched to prevent that outcome, which a majority of them - and the public - want to avoid.\u0026nbspMPs are considering a bid to cancel the annual autumn recess set aside for party conferences in a fresh attempt to prevent Boris Johnson ploughing ahead with a no-deal Brexit, our political correspondent Ashley Cowburn reports.\u0026nbspBrexit: MPs considering bid to ‘cancel autumn recess’ to stop Halloween no-dealBrexit has put some people off buying or selling a home, says upmarket estate agent Savills, which reported results today.\u0026nbspSales of UK property are at the lowest level since the financial crisis while protests in Hong Kong also dented the market there, Savills says.\u0026nbspChief executive\u0026nbspMark Ridley: “In many markets, particularly the UK and Hong Kong, political and economic uncertainty has considerably reduced the volume of real estate trading activity in recent months, although occupier demand remains robust.\u0026nbspHalf-year pre-tax profits fell 12 per cent to £38.4m in the six months to 30 June.\u0026nbspA plummeting pound of course means reduced spending power\u0026nbspfor British holidaymakers heading away this month.\u0026nbspAs always, even the best rates for consumers are some way below the market rate.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAt the best of the large foreign exchange providers, £750 will now buy you:\u0026nbspeuros:\u0026nbspDebenhams -

Morgan hit 17 sixes and set a new record in one-day international cricket, which saw his side win by 150 runsEconomists agree that the housing market will suffer if Britain leaves the EU without a deal.\u0026nbspThe government’s spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), forecast last month that house prices would tumble by almost 6 per cent in 2020 and another 3 per cent in 2021. The slide could be even steeper as the OBR’s prediction was based on the assumption of a particular type of no-deal Brexit – the less disruptive of the two laid out by the IMF earlier this year.Howard Archer, economic adviser to the EY Item\u0026nbspClub, forecasts a similar decline, saying house prices would quickly fall by about 5 per cent as the economy weakened and the market was mired in acute uncertainty over Britain’s future trading relationship with the EU.For now, house prices look on track for hardly any growth over this year.\u0026nbspAccording to RICS, a net balance of 9 per cent of respondents reported a fall in average prices over the past three months in England and Wales. Samuel Tombs, economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the result is consistent with the official measure of prices showing a rise of only 0.5 per cent in 2019.\u0026nbspHalifax data also showed that UK house prices dropped slightly in July for the second consecutive month and now stand at £236,120 on average.“The market continues to tread water,” said Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax.\u0026nbsp“In the longer term, we believe there is unlikely to be a step change in market activity until buyers and sellers see some form of resolution to the current economic uncertainty.”RICS echoed this prediction, noting that its survey now points to zero growth in sales – as well as a steeper fall in prices – in the next three months.On Thursday Boris Johnson reiterated his trademark message that Britain will leave the EU on 31 October, even though no progress has been made on securing a withdrawal agreement acceptable to both sides.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

to decide where to prioritise shipments - they will have to provide cast-iron written reassurances that competition law will not be strictly applied to those discussions,” FDF\u0027s chief operating officer Tim Rycroft told the BBC.\u0026nbspIn the markets, Asian stocks were down on Wednesday while European bourses gained in morning trading.\u0026nbspDominic Raab, the foreign secretary, has\u0026nbsppraised Donald Trump and his deputy Mike Pence for their warmth and enthusiasm for the UK-US relationship.\u0026nbspRaab says he was delighted to meet the pair on his three-day trip to the US in hope of paving the way for a post-Brexit trade deal.The UK looks forward to working with our American friends to reach a free trade deal that is good for both countries, and co-operating on the common security challenges we face.\u0026nbspE.On is the latest “Big Six” energy supplier to blame the government’s price cap for plummeting profits.The cap, which will be reduced this winter, is supposed to stop firms ripping off loyal customers.The German utility’s earnings from UK retail customers crashed 78 per cent in the latest quarter.Customer numbers fell by around 200,000 to 6.4 million in the three months to March.Bad news for E.On today but good news for about 15 million households who will see their energy bills fall this winter.\u0026nbspAnnual energy bills will go down by £75 on average for 11 million households on standard tariffs and by £25 for customers who pay for their gas and electricity upfront.\u0026nbspOfgem, the energy regulator for England, Wales and Scotland, is lowering the price caps for the October to March period due to lower wholesale energy prices.Full story here from Olesya Dmitracova:Energy bills to fall for 15 million households this winter as Ofgem lowers price capsExecutives at Hargreaves Lansdown will give up their bonuses after the Woodford fund fiasco, Reuters\u0026nbspis reporting.\u0026nbspAccording to the nes agency\u0027s source, Hargreaves\u0027 chief executive Chris Hill, Chief financial officer Philip Johnson, chief investment officer Lee Gardhouse and research director Mark Dampier, will take no bonus for 2019.\u0026nbspHargreaves plugged Woodford\u0027s fund through its best buy list and received fees for referring customers.\u0026nbspHundreds of thousands of Hargreaves Lansdown customers who ploughed their savings into Woodford\u0027s flagship fund have had their money frozen since June and it will likely stay there until at least December as the once highly regarded stock picker tries to sort out the mess he is in.\u0026nbspWoodford invested in riskier unlisted stocks which he couldn\u0027t get rid of fast enough when a long run of poor performance prompted people to demands their cash back.House prices have fallen for the second successive month, Halifax says.The average UK house price was down 2 per cent in July to\u0026nbsp£236,120 following a 0.4 per cent monthly decline in June.However, the lender said prices were still up 4.1 per cent in the year to July.Brexit uncertainty will weigh on the UK housing market over the next few months according to analysts at the EY ITEM Club.\u0026nbspConsumers may well be particularly cautious about committing to buying a house, especially as house prices are relatively expensive relative to incomes, says Howard Archer.\u0026nbspHouse prices are still far higher compared to earnings than the average over the last 35 years.\u0026nbspAccording to the Halifax, the house price to earnings ratio was still as high as 5.59 in July after spiking to 5.72 in February (the highest level since November 2017) from 5.39 in January this is well above the long-term (1983-2019) average of 4.29.\u0026nbspAnd it is questionable whether recent growth in jobs numbers and earnings can be sustained months as companies tailor their behaviour to a lacklustre domestic economy, prolonged Brexit uncertainties and a challenging global environment.\u0026nbspTherefore Archer forecats\u0026nbspthat house prices will rise by no more than 1.5 per cent in 2019.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspTesla is in a spot of bother in the US.\u0026nbspBloomberg\u0026nbspreports that Elon Musk\u0027s firm has been scrutinised over safety claims on its Model 3 the car intended to take electric vehicles truly into the mainstream.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspUS\u0026nbspNational Highway Traffic Administration reportedly sent a cease and desist letter last year, taking issue with Tesla\u0027s\u0026nbspclaim that the Model 3 had achieved the lowest probability of injury of any vehicle the agency ever tested.So, what exactly is Britain\u0027s food industry saying it needs the government to do to prevent food shortages after Brexit?\u0026nbspIt\u0027s trade body wants firms\u0026nbspto be allowed\u0026nbspco-ordinate and direct supplies with each other if Britain crashes out of the EU on 31 October.\u0026nbspThey cant do that under current rules which prevent them colluding. Those\u0026nbspmeasures are designed to ensure adequate competition and result in the best outcome for consumers.The Food and Drink Federation (FDF) said: “We asked for these reassurances at the end of last year, but we\u0027re still waiting.”\u0026nbspThe industry says that an October Brexit would be disastrous for food supplies because warehouses are already full in the run-up to Christmas.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOne retailer told the BBC that 31 October\u0026nbsp“is about the worst day you can pick”, as warehouse capacity is at 105 per cent\u0026nbspin November, versus 75 per cent - 80 per cent\u0026nbspin March.The government isn\u0027t being entirely up-front about the potentially dire consequences of no-deal Brexit for fresh food and drink supplies, according to a leading academic on the topic.\u0026nbspTim Lang, professor of food policy at City University, warned earlier this week that the UK’s food supply faces levels of disruption “unprecedented” in peacetime.\u0026nbspWhat does that mean?\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\tThe government estimates that half of lorries entering the country will be unable to cross the border smoothly\tThe flow of trucks could drop by a third within a day of a no-deal Brexit\tFood prices predicted to rise by more than 10 per cent as costs rise and supplies fall.Professor Lang warns\u0026nbspthat Britons, particularly those on lower incomes, already under-consume fresh fruit and vegetables, and food banks are not fully prepared for shortages, which could have a negative impact on diets and public health.\u0026nbspFull story here:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBrexit food shortages: Government being secretive over public health risks of no dealThousands of holidaymakers have had their flights cancelled due to more technology failures at British Airways.\u0026nbspSimon Calder has counted\u0026nbsp86 cancellations to and from Heathrow so far today, including one round-trip to New York and dozens of flights to Mediterranean resorts.

Unfortunately, even the food industry, which has tested a range of options to mitigate the effect of massive disruption at Dover, doesn\u0027t really know.\u0026nbspFood and Drink Federation boss Tim Rycroft tells the BBC:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThere will be selective shortages and they will to some extent be random because it depends on which trucks get through and which don\u0027t. We think there will be some serious disruption and it will go on for weeks or months after our exit.The government is unlikely to grant the food industry\u0027s wish for\u0026nbsprelaxed rules to alleviate food supply problems, says Mark Jones, partner at law firm Gordons. Big supermarkets\u0026nbspprobably won\u0027t\u0026nbspbe on board either.Jones says: “The ‘big four’ control almost 70 per cent\u0026nbspof the market and if any of them have a supply chain advantage post-Brexit, it offers them an opportunity to gain market share, says Jones.\u0026nbspI cannot see them wanting to help their competitors.

But there were two technologies that were notably absent from the Unpacked event.Neither Samsung\u0027s virtual assistant Bixby nor VR compatibility for the Note 10\u0026nbspreceived a single mention during the nearly two-hour tech\u0026nbspshowcase. Both have been heavily hyped in recent years, but their quiet omission\u0026nbspsuggests they may no longer be central to Samsung\u0027s grander ambitions.Bixby has not been forgotten entirely, with both the Note 10 and Note 10+ supporting the virtual assistant. But Samsung\u0027s answer to Apple\u0027s Siri and Amazon\u0027s Alexa was not called upon or showed off during any of the product demos.At the same venue in 2018, Samsung unveiled the Bixby-supported Galaxy Home, which was designed to offer an alternative to other smart speakers like the Amazon Echo, Apple HomePod and Google Home. Not only has the device failed to launch in the 12 months that have since elapsed, Samsung also failed to provide any update on the beleaguered speaker.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Chief engineer of LIFT aircraft Balazs Kerulo demonstrates the company\u0027s Hexa personal drone craft in Lago Vista, Texas on June 3 2019225 Project Scarlett to succeed Xbox OneMicrosoft announced Project Scarlett, the successor to the Xbox One, at E3 2019.

Savings would fail to provide an ample buffer as consumers have already dissaved significantly since the EU referendum. In fact, the saving rate is running close to its record low levels.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBusiness investment may also slow further as a falling pound with potential for further depreciation could spook investors. Furthermore, the benefit of rising exports usually associated with a weaker currency has not yet been felt by UK businesses, which suggests we may see little boost to exports from a weak pound.\u0026nbspSome better news today in stock markets that have suffered recently from fears surrounding an escalating trade war between the US\u0026nbspand China.\u0026nbspThe major indices edged up on the back of\u0026nbspsurprise news that Chinese exports rose 3.3 per cent in July, despite rising tariffs imposed by Donald Trump\u0027s administration.\u0026nbspImports were also up suggesting China is showing signs of resilience.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp- Japan\u0027s Nikkei 225 up 0.37 per cent to 20,593.35.\u0026nbsp- Hong Kong\u0027s Hang Seng up 0.5 per cent to 26,120.77\u0026nbsp- Germany\u0027s Dax up 0.5 per cent to 11,712.12\u0026nbsp- France\u0027s CAC 40 up 1 per cent to 5,317.74\u0026nbsp- FTSE 100 up 0.14 per cent to 7,208.62While interest rates and economic data would normally drive the value of the pound, right now the primary factor by a long distance is the perceived probability that the UK will leave the EU with no deal on 31 October.\u0026nbspThe more likely it appears to be, the lower the pound goes.\u0026nbspThis morning brings news of another plan MPs have hatched to prevent that outcome, which a majority of them - and the public - want to avoid.\u0026nbspMPs are considering a bid to cancel the annual autumn recess set aside for party conferences in a fresh attempt to prevent Boris Johnson ploughing ahead with a no-deal Brexit, our political correspondent Ashley Cowburn reports.\u0026nbspBrexit: MPs considering bid to ‘cancel autumn recess’ to stop Halloween no-dealBrexit has put some people off buying or selling a home, says upmarket estate agent Savills, which reported results today.\u0026nbspSales of UK property are at the lowest level since the financial crisis while protests in Hong Kong also dented the market there, Savills says.\u0026nbspChief executive\u0026nbspMark Ridley: “In many markets, particularly the UK and Hong Kong, political and economic uncertainty has considerably reduced the volume of real estate trading activity in recent months, although occupier demand remains robust.\u0026nbspHalf-year pre-tax profits fell 12 per cent to £38.4m in the six months to 30 June.\u0026nbspA plummeting pound of course means reduced spending power\u0026nbspfor British holidaymakers heading away this month.\u0026nbspAs always, even the best rates for consumers are some way below the market rate.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAt the best of the large foreign exchange providers, £750 will now buy you:\u0026nbspeuros:\u0026nbspDebenhams -

It’s a human being. You’re sending mass amounts of messaging to this person to either shut up, disappear, or it could also be perceived as, Kill yourself. I realised I needed to restructure my life because it felt completely out of control. I knew immediately I needed to make music about it because I knew it was the only way I could survive it.

If my son was gay, he’d be gay. I don’t understand the question.”She added, “Rights are being stripped from basically everyone who isn’t a straight white cisgender male. I didn’t realise until recently that I could advocate for a community that I’m not a part of. It’s hard to know how to do that without being so fearful of making a mistake that you just freeze. Because my mistakes are very loud. When I make a mistake, it echoes through the canyons of the world.

It occurs so that MPs can decamp the Commons chamber and travel to gatherings of party members across the country.\u0026nbspLeaders of all the main parties use the major event in the political calendar to set out their policy agenda and vision for the future, while thousands of activists gather in the conference halls.If MPs do decide to cancel the autumn recess, however, it is almost certain the conferences themselves will go ahead – not least due to them being a major source of income for the political parties.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A mosque is seen amongst residential housing from the air during a mass take off at the annual Bristol hot air balloon festival in BristolAn Asiatic lioness eats meat during feeding time ahead of World Lion Day at London ZooBeer enthusiasts taste beer and ale during The Great British Beer Festival at Kensington Olympia in west London.

For significant issues, such as Brexit, this is where any change in direction will be finalised, and voted on by party members and affiliates.It will also be Boris Johnson’s first chance to address the Conservative Party membership since succeeding Theresa May as prime minister.\u0026nbspDominic Cummings, the PM’s senior adviser in Downing Street, has already told aides the event this year will be treated as a Brexit rally – as the party remains steadfast in its commitment to deliver the UK’s exit from the EU by the 31 October deadline.Rather than set pieces on the policy agenda and the traditional departmental priorities from senior cabinet ministers, all eyes will be on the Halloween Brexit date.Theoretically, the conferences could be a scaled back affair this year as the constitutional battles rage on at Westminster, with just senior ministers and frontbenchers attending the gatherings while MPs stay put in SW1.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We\u0027ll demonstrate what we can do and then I think the Scottish people won\u0027t be interested in another referendum.But if they ever do come back, my view is you can\u0027t be in a situation where you block it.It comes as a recent poll by Lord Ashcroft\u0026nbspgave a lead for Scottish independence for the first time since 2017, with 52 cent of Scottish people in favour and 48 per cent against.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Morgan hit 17 sixes and set a new record in one-day international cricket, which saw his side win by 150 runsEconomists agree that the housing market will suffer if Britain leaves the EU without a deal.\u0026nbspThe government’s spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), forecast last month that house prices would tumble by almost 6 per cent in 2020 and another 3 per cent in 2021. The slide could be even steeper as the OBR’s prediction was based on the assumption of a particular type of no-deal Brexit – the less disruptive of the two laid out by the IMF earlier this year.Howard Archer, economic adviser to the EY Item\u0026nbspClub, forecasts a similar decline, saying house prices would quickly fall by about 5 per cent as the economy weakened and the market was mired in acute uncertainty over Britain’s future trading relationship with the EU.For now, house prices look on track for hardly any growth over this year.\u0026nbspAccording to RICS, a net balance of 9 per cent of respondents reported a fall in average prices over the past three months in England and Wales. Samuel Tombs, economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the result is consistent with the official measure of prices showing a rise of only 0.5 per cent in 2019.\u0026nbspHalifax data also showed that UK house prices dropped slightly in July for the second consecutive month and now stand at £236,120 on average.“The market continues to tread water,” said Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax.\u0026nbsp“In the longer term, we believe there is unlikely to be a step change in market activity until buyers and sellers see some form of resolution to the current economic uncertainty.”RICS echoed this prediction, noting that its survey now points to zero growth in sales – as well as a steeper fall in prices – in the next three months.On Thursday Boris Johnson reiterated his trademark message that Britain will leave the EU on 31 October, even though no progress has been made on securing a withdrawal agreement acceptable to both sides.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I had to sleep at the bottom of their bed. I didn’t eat properly because I felt sick at the thought of everything that went on and was scared of him contacting me again.She adds: I dont feel safe when Deals out of prison... he could come out, go off the radar and try to hurt me - or worse, kill me. It’s happened before in other stalking cases so Im scared.Deals  past offences relate to other harassment and stalking incidents dating back to  - and Samantha fears more women could be targeted by the rapper when hes released.On one hand Im so happy hes away [again], but on the other hand Im like  weeks - really  He should get years after everything hes put me and the other girls through, she tells us.When he came out of prison the first time my anxiety went through the roof and I was in and out of the doctors and not sleeping.The beauty queens hellish ordeal started innocently enough.Wannabe star Deal - who goes by the stage name JAYD - added her on Facebook like hundreds of her other fans.I had a friend request on Facebook around June , but thought nothing of it, says Samantha, who was crowned Miss Poole  and Miss Dorset . I have lots of supporters, so I accepted it.Yet it soon became clear Deal wasnt an ordinary fan.He began besieging her with unwanted messages, shared pictures of her in a wedding dress with an engagement ring emoji, and bizarrely vowed to dedicate his BGT audition song to her.He also started turning up to events she was at - including SandFest music festival in Poole, Dorset, last July, where he asked the model for a photo together.He just appeared and tapped me on the shoulder, Samantha recalls.He said Hi Sam, its Jonathan Deal. I was like Oh hello, thinking in my head it was weird. Id never met him and for him to just turn up was really, really weird.She adds: I then got this message on Facebook: really nice to meet you.Obviously I replied, really nice to meet you too. I was being polite.The moment Samantha shared anything on Facebook, Deal would like or comment on it.Then last September, the rapper tried to gatecrash a VIP tent Samantha was in at the Bournemouth Air Festival - and posted a live blog on Facebook claiming he was in love with her.The same month, he turned up at the Miss England finals at Nottinghams prestigious Kelham Hall, where Samantha made the top  and was crowned Miss South Coast Charity Queen after attending more than  charity events in  months.It was here he disturbingly told people he was her boyfriend, before lunging in to kiss her backstage.I felt like a real-le princess that night, says Samantha, now a teaching assistant.I had a real diamond tiara on my head, worth £,, and I had a dress on that was stunning.She adds: Out the back, theres a little arch we walk through - Deal literally grabbed me and went to hug me and kiss my lips. I felt physically sick - his breath near mine made me shiver.It was a huge moment and he ruined it.Samantha managed to push her stalker off before fleeing to find her parents.But when she told them what had just happened, she was sickened to discover that Deal had been wandering around looking for her and had even tried to sit at her familys table to get close to her.They hadnt seen him [lunge at me] but I said, hes just tried to kiss me, she says.They said, the moment its finished, were leaving. We had to sneak out the back.Deal later told Samantha she only did well because the judges thought you were my girlfriend.And it wouldnt be the last time he confronted her.While Samantha blocked the stalker on Facebook straight after the Miss England final, she claims he later turned up at her work, pinned her against a wall and yelled: Unblock me! Unblock me!He also posted about her all over social media.Someone like myself who is always smiling and positive, [the harassment] caused me a lot of anxiety and stress, resulting in me having to go to the doctors a lot, Samantha says.I’ve been single over a year as I just haven’t been in the right headspace.It’s massively put me off going on and dating sites because I just don’t know who they and for all I know they could be him or people like him.Finally, after a three-month nightmare, the beauty queen reported Deal to police and he was arrested for his harassment campaign.But during the rappers court case, the model - who is also an ambassador for UK non-profit Help  Homeless Veterans - was distraught to learn that she was far from his only victim.I remember it so well, he was talking about his previous [ offences], she tells us.My dad grabbed my hand and I just cried in his arms in the courtroom.At this point I was adamant this guy is a sick freak.While Deal was out on bail, under strict conditions, Samantha says she rang police at all hours of the day in a state of terror, using a special panic phone shed been given.Dorset Police were absolutely incredible, they were at my beck and call, says Samantha, who became so stressed that she ended up on medication. I called them twice a day sometimes, panicking.She was relieved when, in February, Deal was finally caged for  weeks and handed an indefinite restraining order banning him from any form of contact with her, after he admitted harassment.But Samanthas stress ed only three months later when she discovered the con had been freed early, on May .Id felt so good knowing he was behind bars - there was no way he could stalk me or anyone near me - [but] after he was released I struggled, she says.I had a special doorbell fitted in my familys house. The doorbell rings and we can see whos at the door - andsomeone walks past the door we can see them.She adds: I was going round the house locking all the doors.Incredibly, on May , just four days after his release, Deal broke the terms of his restraining order by re-posting messages on Facebook relating to the Miss Dorset and Miss England contests Samantha had participated in.The rapper was hauled before Poole Magistrates Court last month, where he was convicted of two counts of breaching the order and sent back to prison for  weeks.But Samantha fears his short sentence means he could soon terrorise someone  - and has backed calls for a national stalking register to protect women from predators like Deal.The moment you come across Jonathan Deal, block him, she warns.Dont give him the time of day or a chance. Im that person who gave him a chance. I thought, Oh hes lovely, this will be OK. I should have blocked him a lot earlier.She adds: If there was a register, Deal would have been known and dealt with a lot quicker.Later this year, Stalking Protection Orders- backed by The Sun - will come into effect to help protect victims.More than one in five women and almost one in  men aged  to  have been victims of stalking since the age of , according to the Crime Survey for England and Wales.SPOs will prevent stalkers from contacting victims or approaching them through those around them - and will force them to register their name, address and any aliases they use.Offenders may also be banned from ­loitering near victims’ homes.A breach of the order will be punishable by up to five years behind bars.Today, while Deal languishes in jail, Samantha is looking ahead to the Miss Sovereign GB pageant - a contest that aims to empower girls and women while raising funds for charity.She decided to enter the pageant to help others and raise awareness of stalking - but is understandably taking a very dferent approach towards social media and her fans.I havent added anyone that I dont know recently and that is big for me, Samantha says. If I havent met you, you cant be on my Facebook. I need to know who you are.As for Deal, she adds that shell always worry about him.Someone like him doesnt give up - its sickening, she says.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

look for evidence of extraterrestrials in the UK, where should they go The Facebook plan to storm the American base to see them aliens began as a joke which is now being taken seriously — deadly seriously.Not only did Facebook pull down the page, the Air Force issued a chilling warning to potential raiders that: The US Air Force always stands ready to protect America and its assets.Its not known exactly what secrets the shadowy base has that authorities are desperate to defend.Ufologists — who study unidentied flying objects — believe the site holds alien spacecraft being studied for their technology, a claim famously repeated by a former engineer at the site, Bob Lazar.But conspiracy theorists in the UK dont need to look as far afield as the States for mysterious government facilities linked with UFOs.Nick Pope ran the Ministry of Defences UFO project in the s, looking into reports of flying saucers, crop circles, and even abductions. Here he reveals the secret spots that might be Britains Area . RAF Rudloe Manor, WiltshireTheory: Alien technology being kept in secret underground labFor years, conspiracy theorists believed the government was hiding something at RAF Rudloe Manor in Corsham, Wiltshire.And to some extent, they were right — documents made public in  admitted that the base WAS used in UFO investigations.Thats because Rudloe Manor was home to the Flying Complaints Flight, a unit of the RAF Police which gathered reports of UFO sightings from RAF bases and passed them to the MoD HQ.And the secret site came under even more scrutiny when it was revealed there was a vast network of underground tunnels beneath the base.Ufologists had suspected this for years but instead of the tunnels being used to hide alien technology they were nuclear bomb shelters.The vast subterranean bunkers would be where government ministers and royals wouldve been evacuated tothere was a nuclear strike on Britain.Even though Rudloe Manor was closed in , it still attracts conspiracy theorists — some have been arrested by MoD Police for breaking in.Nick himself had a brush with the authorities when he was filming a documentary there with presenter Giorgio Tsoukalos a few years ago.He said: As a former MoD employee I didn’t feel it was appropriate for me to approach the site, so Giorgio went alone.Within moments, military police turned up and halted filming, further fuelling the conspiracy theories.Ministry of Defence Main Building, LondonTheory: UFO investigations team officially shutdown but still running in secretInside Room  in the MoD Main Building in Whitehall, the governments main UFO project looked into the strange reports of flying saucers around the UK.In the  years the project ran until , around , cases were looked into by the team.Although most were debunked, around five per cent of the cases couldnt be explained.And although the project was officially closed down a decade ago, Nick believes it still operating but now in secret.He claims a source in the MoD told him Americans were now running the project.And another told him investigations have just moved to a new part of the building where the investigators are jokingly referred to as Mulder and Scully.Nick even says protesters have already turned up at the site to demand answers in October .He said: It wasn’t quite on the scale of what’s threatened for Area .Around  people assembled outside Parliament and then marched over to Main Building, waving signs that said ‘UFOs are real’, before handing in a letter demanding an end to UFO secrecy.I’d left the UFO project by then, but they somehow got hold of my new phone number and I had to meet them and formally take possession of their letter.The National Archives, KewTheory: Sensitive documents about aliens kept secret after sham public releaseThe UK’s National Archives in Kew are the final repository of the MoD’s real-le X-Files.Last year, declassied files there showed the government had spent  years looking into UFOs in the hope we could steal alien technology to develop super weapons during the Cold War.The once-secret files showed UFOs were real and being taken seriously.They also detailed near misses between RAF aircraft and UFOs which posed a dangerous threat to the crews safety.The first load of these files was made public in the National Archives in  — and Nick was enlisted to help with their publicity.And over the next  years, more and more information came out, but some files were still redacted.This made some people think the government was holding information back.But Nick says: The blacked-out material is often just names and addresses of UFO witnesses, withheld to protect people’s privacy.If people could see the uncensored files, all people will find out is that Mr Smith of  Acacia Avenue saw a UFO while out walking his dog sometime back in !RAE Farnborough, HampshireTheory: Site of alien abductions is primary location where alien tech would be keptThe Royal Aerospace Establishment at Farnborough, Hampshire has previously been called Britain’s Area .RAE Farnborough was originally set up as an aircraft and weapons research facility at the turn of the twentieth century and closed in the late s.In , a y report by conspiracy theorists claimed the site was well-connected to UFO sightings — and even alien abductions.Rumours persist, and Farnborough is currently home to QinetiQ, a defence technology company that researches and develops cutting-edge equipment including weapons, robotics and space-related tech.And Nick saysthe UK ever did get hold of extraterrestrial tech, it probably wouldve been sent to Farnborough for study.But he also wants to pour cold water on the claims that the site ever did have alien tech — as he had a close relationship with someone who knew for a fact there were no UFO weapons there.Nick said: I’m sceptical about this, for a very good reason — one that’s generated a few conspiracy theories.My late father, Dr. Geoffrey Pope, was the Director of RAE Farnborough, before ending his MoD career as the Deputy Chief Scientic Adviser.As he once joked: If there was spaceship in a hangar somewhere in the UK, it would have been my hangar!BAE Warton, LancashireTheory: Next-generation aircraft developed from UFOsBAE Systems is one of the worlds biggest defence companies and Warton is its manufacturing and testing

Then he had a fling with fellow TV chef Marcela Valladolid and all hell broke loose.Sex sells. It always has. So does scandal, and cheating on your we with a younger woman fits firmly into both categories.When the fling ended, the admirably forgiving Alex took Paul back, but the marriage faltered again and he took up with a -year-old barmaid with a fondness for miniskirts and crop tops.What’s not to love for the hundreds of “paparazzo”who make a living from how many times their photo gets viewed online It’s not rocket science, is it  Earlier this year I spotted Judi Dench out supermarket shopping.Yes, that Judi Dench. Dame of the British Empire. Oscar winner. Recipient of more awards than Mr Hollywood’s had hot buns.And favoured guest of chatshow host Graham Norton. But there she was, browsing the aisles and totally unbothered by anyone.Why  Well, firstly, she wasn’t wilfully drawing attention to herself by radiating self-importance. And secondly, while she’s paid to be dramatic on screen, her le outside of it is anything but.Meaning that, in everyday le, her showbiz currency — the aforementioned “clickbait” — is, depending on how you view such things, blissfully low.But , say, she decided to dump her conservationist partner David Mills for a young barman from her local pub, a photo of her low-key shopping trip would be front-page news. Simple really.Aside from the marvellous Ms Dench, there are oodles of A- listers who live non-famous lives, popping to the supermarket or going for a low-key dinner — for example, not The Ivy et al — with loved ones.Occasionally, they might be spotted and photographed, but they just keep their head down and ignore it, accepting that it’s a small price to pay for the myriad other benefits fame brings.NDAsare now commonly used by celebrities to ensure the silence of, say, a nanny who will be privy to what happens behind closed doors — and that’s perhaps understandable.But asking a lover to sign on the dotted line when you’ve already been together two years is saying, in so many words: “I don’t trust you, but I want to carry on sleeping with you.”Who can blame Summer for telling him to stick it where the sun don’t shine Famous US basketball coach and mentor, John Wooden , once said: “Talent is God given Be humble. Fame is man-given Be grateful. Conceit is self-given Be careful.”Wise words that Mr Hollywoodwould do well to heed.WHATEVER you think of Boris Johnson’s politics, it can’t be denied that he’s working his King Ashurbanipal socks offas our new PM.Hospitals, factories, flood-hit towns – you name it, he’s popping up there to put a smile on everyone’s face and reassure them that everything is under control.He’s the frontman while the rest of the bandare putting in the hours at the studio, hopefully producing the hits. Time will tell.But suffice to say, he’s already shaping up to be the UK’s cheerleader – a feat the more reserved and aloof Theresa May never quite managed.WHEN asked about children, Prince Harry replied that he and we Meghan might have “two, maximum”.Fair enough, I thought. After all, she’s  now and,she’s lucky, Mother Nature might let her conceive one more before her womb shuts shop.But no, it seems the royal couple’s decision is to do with population growth, despite experts saying that, globally, the birthrate is shrinking and the real issue is how long we’re all living.So unless he’s planning to pack Granny off to Dignitas, there’s not much he can do about it. But I digress.Regarding royal babies and, in particular, Harry and Meghan’s sensitivity around their firstborn’s privacy, perhaps they should copy his cousin Zara.She and husband Mike Tindall have two daughters, Mia, five, and Lena, one. There’s no showboating or churlishness, they just give their daughters as normal a le as possible via picnics, getting muddy, painting faces and rough and tumble – as seen in thisdelightful photo of mischievous Mia hitching a ride on Dad’s back.They occasionally get photographed, but clearly accept that it’s just one of those things and don’t let it bother them. A parenting template to be admired, whoever you are.THE author Alex Elle once said: “I am very cautious of people whose actions don’t match their words.”In which case, let’s hope she wasn’t invited to the recent Google Camp party in Sicily which,you’re one of the self-regarding A-listers in attendance, was a high-minded gathering to discuss the issue of climate change.Or to the rest of us – a boondoggle for entitled fools.

But things aren’t quite working out that way.While the UK economy is far from booming, it is holding up much better than those in the Eurozone. Figures released yesterday show Germany’s manufacturing sector contracted by . per cent in July and is now a shocking . per cent smaller than it was a year ago.Given the importance of manufacturing to the German economy, it is likely the whole economy is now heading for recession — a fate the country only narrowly avoided at the end of last year.In Italy, too, economic growth has ground to a halt again — after the country only just hauled itself out of last year’s recession. In France, growth in the past three months fell to . per cent.By contrast, our economy looks relatively perky, with growth of . per cent in the three months to May. Figures released on Monday showed a rebound in confidence in the dominant services sector.Of the large Eurozone countries, only Spain is currently outgrowing us — but Spain is still recovering after a very deep recession from which it emerged in . In common with Italy, the Spanish economy is still smaller than it was before the - banking crisis.Not that you will hear any of this from Remainers. Every time a car factory is earmarked for closure or a steelworks runs into problems, we hear no end of people saying, “We told you so”.All bad news in the UK economy is automatically attributed to Brexit — on the BBC, especially. What we don’t hear is that manufacturing industries, especially cars and steel, are suffering the same problems across Europe.Germany’s car industry is still reeling from the scandal of Volkswagen cheating in emissions tests by installing software to detect when a car was in test mode.On top of that comes the proposed switch from petrol and diesel to electric cars. Many motorists — myself included — have put off buying new vehicles because we don’t know what to get.We have been told new petrol and diesel cars will be banned from  and worry they might be taxed out of existence well before then. Yet electric cars are still prohibitively expensive and can’t travel nearly far enough between charges.As for the steel industry, all across Europe it is struggling to compete with cheap competition from China — especially since the trade war with the US forced Chinese exporters to search for new markets away from America.Of course,we end up with a No-Deal Brexit and tarfs are imposed on imports and exports between Britain and the EU, it will cause some disruption to trade. But it is wrong to assume Britain will come off worse. In truth, EU exporters have more to lose. Britain runs a huge trade deficit with the EU.In  we exported £billion worth of goods and services to other EU countries and imported £billion from them — a trade gap of £billion. Moreover, EU exports to Britain are concentrated in products that attract relatively high tarfs.Cars, for example, attract an EU import tarf of ten per cent. If Britain chooses to impose that levy in reverse after Brexit, it will cause further mayhem in the German car industry.We also have a high deficit in food — which under EU rules attracts average tarfs of  per cent. For dairy products, the average EU import tarf is  per cent. If our Government decides to impose this on imports from the EU, it will mean the end of quite a few French cheese producers.Of course, the EU can avoid damaging these export industries by agreeing to a trade deal with the UK — one that doesn’t include the hated Irish backstop.Nearly half of Irish food exports go to the UK. Irish exports to other EU countries would be deeply affected as so many rely on UK roads. If there are delays at ports, traffic between Ireland and the Continent will suffer twice over — once crossing the Irish Sea then crossing the English Channel.EU leaders want to punish Britain for voting to leave their sacred project. They fear thatBritain is seen to do well, other countries will want to leave. But playing hardball with Britain will do deep harm to their own export industries.Does German chancellor Angela Merkel want to suffer the wrath of her country’s car makers  Does French president Emmanuel Macron wish to anger winemakers already struggling with an economic downturn at home A hard Brexit could cost Denmark as much as one per cent in lost gross domestic product. Their former economy minister Simon Emil Ammitzboll calls Brexit “the most visible threat to the Danish economy”.Holland and Belgium calculate similar falls will hit their economies, with the Dutch losing ten billion euros by . In Spain, wages for unskilled youths are lower than they were in the late s. Youth unemployment is a huge problem. Even qualied youths face a lower annual salary than their counterparts a decade ago.The alternative to all this is for the EU to swallow a bit of pride and agree to keep free trade flowing, perhaps via a temporary deal while long-term arrangements are negotiated.It won’t take much. Just remove the backstop — really just an underhand way of trying to keep Britain in the straitjacket of EU regulations and trade barriers — and some kind of withdrawal agreement would almost certainly make it through the Commons.If not, then yes, British industry will suffer in some ways from No Deal. But the Eurozone economies already lagging behind will take the bigger hit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

With Theresa May, it never was. Brussels knew she didn’t even want to leave, never mind with No Deal.Not any more. Second, he’s shaking up the civil service a bit.  It was civil servants who did most of the negotiating — and they are all wildly pro Remain.But with Boris’s adviser Dominic Cummings wielding the stick they might just be a little more amenable than before.Third — he’s realised that the bloody Northern Ireland backstop was never anywhere near so serious an impediment as the Remainersclaimed.And fourth, and maybe most importantly, he’s leading the country with a sense of optimism and chutzpah.Of course it’s Boris, so he may well do something totally bonkers and wreck the process. But so far he’s got everything right.He hasn’t got long to sort out a deal, the days are counting down. But my guess is that he WILL get one.The EU likes to talk a hard game but it usually budges in the end. It is desperate to avoid No Deal.Andit doesn’t budge — fine. A bumpy road for a few weeks and we’ll be OK, better off than ever. And free. The big threat to Brexit is not the EU — it’s our Parliament, once again.The Labour Party has ditched all semblance of principle and is now for a second referendum.Worse, Boris has a majority of only one. That’s not his fault — blame Theresa May for calling an election two years ago.It looks to me thatMagic Grandpa Jeremy Corbyn calls a vote of no confidence, he will probably win.Labour is already cosying up to the Scottish Nationalists and saying they wouldn’t mind a second referendum on independence.There is now nothing Labour wouldn’t do to gain power. Destroy the union and scupper Brexit — Magic Grandpa doesn’t care.Butthis whole thing ends with Labour des- troying Brexit, the party will never be trusted again.Oh sure, it will still get the votes from the metropolitan, middle-class lefties. But its working-class base will desert it, for good.So the message for Magic Grandpa is very clear. Win your vote of confidence, lose your voters. He’s not the brightest of men, but I do hope he grasps this.And Boris  Keep straight ahead. Play as hardball as possible with Brussels, knowing they want a deal. Strike as many deals with the likes of the USA and Canada as possible.And remind Brussels thatwe walk away without a deal, they don’t get a single penny from us. That should help to concentrate their minds for a while.This has been revealed in a new report by researchers with too much time on their hands. What these men want, I think, is the best of both worlds.I used to have a girlfriend who spent all day long sitting on the roof of the shed. Then she’d dart out into the road after a thrush. She was great.Had a little bell around her neck. And did her business in a small tray by the back door.A WOMAN in East London said nasty things to someone taking part in a gay Pride march. She was wearing a niqab, so the lefties didn’t get too cross.Still, it is at last beginning to dawn on the woke liberals that the more fervently Muslim a person may be, the less likely it is that he or she will take kindly to people who have a knack for interior design and enjoy watching Mamma Mia!.This has put them in a bit of a quandary. Much as have those largely Muslim protests outside schools in the Midlands which insist on teaching kids how wonderful gay relationships might be.The same sort of quandary that affects feminists, who are not entirely convinced that a ft chap with a todger and a beard who wishes to be called “Loretta” in the name of gender freedom actually is a woman.This is the thing with identity politics, protected characteristics and so on. Tug gently on one of its threads and the whole thing begins to unravel like a pink mohair jumper knitted by an imbecile. HERE’S some consol­ation for you cricket fans, in despair at our Ashes defeat. Steve Smith, the man who did most of the damage, is at least HALF English.He’s got an English mum and has dual nationality.He used to play cricket for a team in Sevenoaks, in Kent.So what we should do is ide his run total down the middle – we get half, the Aussies get half.

I thought I was big and tough before I went out there but now I realise Im not.There was a smashed up bed all over the floor, rubbish everywhere, the floor was stinking. I took my shoes off for two seconds and my feet were black.When they lted the bed up, this girl didnt want me to see it but she was picking used condoms up with her hands.The toilet had poo all down the back of it and stunk the bathroom out.The showers - you wouldnt even have those in prison. It was a little sink thing that you stand in and wash yourself.”After complaining to the staff, Portia claims she was initially told to clean the apartment herself but when she refused, another seasonal worker was paid £ to do it.One evening after a night out, she reportedly woke to find an unknown man sat on the edge of her bed.When she asked who he was, he said shag me, before she chased him out in fear.Portia said: The first night my door was open because there was no air-con. This man walked into my room, sat on to my bed and said shag me. This was a stranger.I was screaming at him to get out and I didnt see him after that. For all they know something could have happened to me.They get your money, send you over there then thats it.It was only after she posted her experience online that director Tony Furnival and manager Mitch Hodson responded - with the latter saying he would have got [off his] lazy fat ass and cleaned the f***ing apartment.Portia said: Two of the bosses replied to me online going nuts - its so unprofessional. They looked so childish.Ive never seen anything like it to be honest. Im gobsmacked.”Workers Family claimed that Portia paid only £ for her accommodation, not £. Tony Furnival, a director at Workers Family, said: The broken wardrobe, thats pretty bad. That should have been fixed.As regards bunk-beds, its hostel-style accommodation. You might as well take a picture of any hostel across the world.If it is dirty, thats the people that are living there. Its hostel-style accommodation that theyre responsible for.There is cleaning to a degree [by cleaners]. Because its the end of the season there are so many places she could have been moved.I dont want you thinking for one second that Im saying nothing shes said is true, but these young people get the lowest standard of accommodation.Its not good enough for year round people, its not good enough for tourists.These claims that people are going out there is so far from what I know to be true, that Im a bit offended.There were faults on our part, but the way its been painted, its really over the top.Some of the things shes said could have been dealt with better, but the general premises of what shes said is just not true - having no pillows, used condoms. Its just not true.”Antony Ross also pointed out that there were many positive reviews on their page, including one that reads: Workers Family have looked after me and hundreds of my friends for summer after summer.Agreed that room looks a state but thats one in a hundred and its probably down to some p***heads ruining the room.Dont blame the company, blame the muppet wannabe workers who probably ruined that room."},{"url":null,"title":"former x factor finalist shoplifting","story":"In her tirade, the -year-old also grabbed the mans neck, poked another female worker in the face and threw a shopping basket.Hylton, from Croydon, who finished in sixth place in s X Factor, pleaded guilty to stealing £ worth of food.She pleaded guilty to assaulting Peter Njoku using racially aggravated threatening behaviour towards him and assaulting Abigail Kelly in the local Surrey Street store on February .Prosecutor Rahab Njoroge told Croydon Magistrates Court it was .pm when Mr. Njoku spotted Hylton putting items into her shopping bag and leave without making any attempt to pay.“With the help of a colleague they brought the defendant back into the shop and the defendant was very aggressive.“She grabbed the bag she was carrying and there was a struggle and the defendant was shouting: He’s a f***ing African.

I didnt swing my door, but opened it carefully around halfway.As I did this I saw a cyclist level with my door and pulled it back. She was very close.I heard the sound of a bump and saw the cyclist hit by a taxi and being dragged along underneath it.Ive never been involved in an accident and Im devastated by what I saw. My sympathies got out to the cyclists family.The cabbie Alan Nicholas, who had  years experience, said he believed he had hit a pothole and didnt see the Professor swerve away from the van or before the collision.The -year-old became tearful as he told the inquest he was aware of her, but was looking in his right mirror for motorcyclists as he pulled out to overtake her and didnt see her hit his vehicle.He said he was doing around  to mph, adding: As I pulled out I was overtaking the cyclist, Im still looking at my mirror which Im assuming is about two or three seconds.I didnt see the door open or the cyclist come down.Then I felt a big bump which I had thought I had gone down a pothole.Mr Nicholas claimed he overtook the badly parked van giving her a . metre berth.The inquest was attended by Prof Bitner-Glindziczs husband David Miles, a professor of oncology, and their daughter, Helena Miles.He told the hearing: Maria was my we and the mother of our two children.My we was an internationally recognised scientist. She was developing therapies based on her unique understanding of the genetics.She was quite simply brilliant. You would probably expect me to say that and describe her as irreplaceable but, as one of her colleagues told me recently, nobody  has her knowledge base.Speaking of the inquest, he added: We sincerely hope that it generates urgent improvements in road safety that we believe are vital in preventing such devastating loss in the future.Delivering a narrative determination, Senior Coroner Mary Hassell recorded that Prof Bitner-Glindzicz died as a result of a collision at around .am on September  last year in St John Street,  metres south of the junction with Clerkenwell Road.She said the Professor was wearing a helmet and fluorescent strap, and her bike was in good condition.The Coroner said that the van driver didnt look before opening his door.She said the opening of the door caused the Professor to fall under the wheels of a black cab overtaking.Prof Bitner-Glindzicz was one of  cyclists to die on Londons roads last year. Four more have died in the capital this year."},{"url":null,"title":"nora quoirin cops open window malaysia","story":"They now believe the -year-old Brit schoolgirl could ONLY have left her familys plush vacation cottage through the window, say reports.Cops now believe the -year-old Brit schoolgirl could only have left through the window.Speaking on behalf of the family, Matthew Searle of the Lucie Blackman Trust , told The Sun Online: She would not have been able to open the window on her own and it was found propped open.They also know Nora would not walked off anywhere on her own.After Madeleine McCanns disappearance her family were forced to combat a ridiculous theory heavy shutters found open in the bedroom where their kids were sleeping had been opened by the three year old.A top British cop has now likened Noras disappearance to the baffling Madeleine case.Child protection expert Jim Gamble compared Nora Quoirins disappearance to that of Madeleine and Ben Needham - who both disappeared on family holidays.Ultimately, the cases of children go missing abroad are so rare that we tend to know the names of all of them, said Mr Gamble, who investigated Madeleines disappearance.This is now one of three cases that are similar...Ben Needham who went missing many years ago, Madeleine McCann who is still on everybodys minds and now Nora.Mr Gamble now believes Brit experts should be primed to help solve the disappearance of Nora.He says the National Crime Agency has the experience and expertise needed to help investigate what has happened to the teen.The -year-old, from London, disappeared from a holiday resort near the Berembun Forest Reserve on Sunday and hundreds of cops are now involved in a full-scale search to track down Nora who has special needs.But Mr Gamble - former chief exec of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre - believes the cops on the ground could benefit from specialist help from overseas.Mr Gamble said he hoped the Irish consulate in Kuala Lumpur is now in touch with their counterparts in the UK to ensure direct access is given to Britains elite crime experts.He told the Sun Online from day one he asked the Consulate to ensure there was the chance of access to the National Crime Agency.This is not because the Malaysian police do not have the necessary expertise...it is because the NCA is in a unique position to offer the worlds very best help, he said.The NCA is the UKs lead agency targeting organised crime human, weapon and drug trafficking cyber crime and economic crime.It operates across regional and international borders and can be tasked to investigate any crime using its team of top experts.However, it wasnt formed until  which is long after the disappearance of Madeleine in  and Ben in .Mr Gamble also believes those involved in the search should put politics to one side to help the family who are going through everybodys worst nightmare.Mr Gamble added he hoped cops used a belt and braces approach during the golden hours after Nora was first reported missing on Sunday.I am reassured talking to family that there are lots of resources from police doing structured work with regards to missing side of the search, he said.These cases are so rare that very few police forces have signicant levels of experience in this.I hope the authorities,they feel it would be helpful, are able to get access to the best technical and operational resources available to them.He became widely acclaimed for his brazen attitude and fearless response to such crimes.The Child and Exploitation and Online Protection Centrewhich launched under his lead in , became internationally recognised.But in a dramatic move, he resigned two years later, after Mrs May decided to join the group with the National Crime Agency.He is now known for being an expert in online and child crime, but his career started as an ordinary policeman.Although he was born in Bangor, Northern Ireland, he spent a lot of time in Singapore or moving around the UK as a child.After he rose through the ranks, Mr Gamble fast became the head of the Northern Ireland anti-terrorist intelligence unit in Belfast.He then became the Deputy Director General of the National Crime Squad, which soon joined with the Serious Organised Crime Agency.At this time, he led the UKs biggest ever police investigation into who viewed child internet abuse images.In , Mr Gamble was awarded the Queens Police Medal in the New Year Honours list.We all hope they used a belt and braces approach during the precious golden hours after Nora was first reported missing.They should have been checking whether there were any disgruntled staff members at the hotel or whether there has been any recent burglaries at the resort or in the surrounding areas.The former police chief, who carried outside a full-scale review into the disappearance of Madeleine, said there are three possibilities as to what has happened Nora.They include her walking off and getting lost, being harmed by someone she knows or falling victim to an opportunistic abduction.He earlier told the BBC: I know that family are seriously considering the abduction theory, the police still seem to be pushing ahead with the missing .However, he said the key thing is that the police, while they pursue their favoured missing theory, do not lose sight of the other possible scenarios.Mr Gamble described the Quoirin family as feeling devastated and anxious beyond belief as searches for Nora continues.Children go missing all the time and they generally and thankfullyhome but thats kids going missing in proximity of their homes, said Mr Gamble, now the chief executive of the Ineqe Safeguarding Group.Ultimately, the cases of children go missing abroad are so rare that we tend to know the names of all of them.This is now one of three cases that are similar...Ben Needham who went missing many years ago, Madeleine McCann who is still on everybodys minds and now Nora.Mr Gamble went on to describe Noras mum and dad - who are from Belfast and France - as being in that place that is every parents worst nightmare.I have spoken with the family. The family are at the heart of this, he said.They reached out and contacted me because I’m in Ireland and Ive got experience of these types of cases.I will give them any advice I can while they are going through this time. I will do whatever I can for the family.A fundraising appeal has now been launched in Belfast by Noras relatives and by this afternoon more than £, had been raised.Mr Gamble: If people want to offer some practical help to the family I suggest they take a look at the GoFundMe page.Earlier we revealed how cops in Malaysia are to play a voice recording of missing Noras mother over loudspeakers as they step up their jungle search for the teen.Superintendent Mohd Nor Marzukee Bin Besar revealed a helicopter, drones and dogs are also being used to trace the -year-old, who has not been seen since Sunday.He said: We have had a long discussion with the family to determine who Nora has the closest relationship to and whose voice she would respond strongly to.We have decided to make a recording and use a loudspeaker. We have to respect the sensitivities of this case. We need to make the recording and will start using the loudspeaker this morning.The message is Nora darling, I love you... mum is here. Mum is here, Nora darling, my love.Police initially insisted there was no evidence of foul play, but yesterday admitted Nora couldve been abducted after the discovery of the unidentied fingerprints.Che Zakaria Othman, deputy police chief in the state of Negeri Sembilan, said that a forensic team had examined the prints.He declined to give further details, but did say the investigation includes a possible criminal element.In an emotional video statement released on Wednesday, Noras family said they remained hopeful the schoolgirl can be found.Speaking on behalf of Noras parents, Noras aunt said: We are completely overwhelmed by the support we have received from all over the world. This is extremely traumatic for the whole family. [Noras parents] Meabh and Sebastien are devastated and too upset to speak themselves at this time.But we must remain hopeful. And we ask everyone to keep Nora in their thoughts, and to continue to support the ongoing search for her.Nora is still missing, and she is very vulnerable, and we need to do everything we can to bring her home."},{"url":null,"title":"can you name these british landmarks","story":"Put your knowledge to the test with these top British attractions - and check the answers below to see how you did.A poll of , adults found almost half didnt recognise Edinburgh Castle - with one in five confusing it with Dover Castle.And one in six were unable to identy Hadrian’s Wall on sight.A third of Brits were also unable to tell the striking architecture of Glastonbury Tor from locations like Tintern Abbey and Ludlow Castle.But two thirds of adults recognised Bristol’s iconic Clton Suspension Bridge designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel.And the austere, modern look of Albert Dock in Liverpool was also more recognisable with  per cent of Brits able to name the landmark.Chris Hardy, managing director of National Express UK Coach, which commissioned the survey, said: “The United Kingdom has so much to offer with regard to natural splendour and man-made sights and our research indicates that thousands may be unaware of what is right on their doorstep.Brits were also tested on their knowledge of key locations, asking them to identy the county where specic cities and sites could be found.The iconic silhouette of The Angel of the North left a lasting impression on Brits, with  per cent able to correctly name Tyne and Wear as the home of the landmark.But only  per cent were able to correctly place Milton Keynes in the county of Buckinghamshire, with one in five admitting they couldnt even hazard a guess at where it is in the UK.One in seven Brits would be incorrectly heading to Devon for their trip to Portsmouth, rather than its true home in Hampshire.And only three in five would be able to find their way to the Eden Project, in Cornwall.Amazingly, one in six were unable to name Cardf as the capital of Wales, and  per cent came unstuck when trying to identy Edinburgh as the capital of Scotland.Despite this, three in five Brits, polled via OnePoll, consider themselves well-travelled, while three in  believe their knowledge of UK geography and locations is very good or better.It also emerged  per cent of participants were correctly able to name the River Trent as a body of water in the UK.And  per cent recognised the River Spey as belonging to the British Isles.Chris Hardy added: “Brits tend to think they have to travel further afield for adventure, when it can often be found just a short distance from their homes.“We are lucky to have such a wealth of places to visit on our small island, with coach offering a convenient and great value way to get there.“With over , coach services running every day to more than  locations, we’re encouraging more travellers to get out this summer and discover something new in the UK.”To highlight the striking locations Brits can experience just a short distance away, National Express have created a quiz which asks players to guess whether the vista they are seeing in from the British Isles or somewhere further afield – Blighty or Abroad Take the quiz at: www.nationalexpress en blog blighty-or-abroad.

They voted to leave the EU. The only problem, as we have since discovered, is that many MPs don’t share the Queen’s trust in the judgment of the British people. Rather than respect the decision, they have sought to overturn it.Given their lack of respect for the British people, it is perhaps not surprising to see their total lack of respect for our Monarch and our long political traditions. It is not the job of hard-Left politicians or Remainer MPs to decide what the Queen should or should not do.The only person from whom the Queen can take constitutionally binding advice is the Prime Minister. Should Boris Johnson lose a vote of no confidence then the Queen will be advised by her outgoing Prime Minister about who can or cannot command the confidence of the House of Commons.Further, as Prime Minister, it would be up to Mr Johnson to advise the Queen on whether to give Royal Assent to a Bill passed by the Commons and Lords blocking a No-Deal Brexit. It would be well within his rights to advise the Queen not to sign such a bill into law.Were Johnson to seek to remain after  days without calling an election, he would be breaking the law, and it would then be for the courts, not the Queen, to intervene.It is certainly possible in theory that the sovereign could be called upon to choose between two rival claims to form a government. However, this would be regarded as highly political and has not been done since .In reality, it is far more likely that the numbers in Parliament will tell us who does or does not have a majority, and that a general election will be called before getting the Queen involved.We all know what this is really about, though. The vote for Brexit was always destined to bring us to a constitutional crisis. It was the first moment in our country’s long and proud history when a majority of people outside of Parliament asked for something that a majority of people inside Parliament did not want to give.The right way through this mess is not to drag the Queen into politics but to deliver on the decision that was made by the British people more than three years ago.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

For the sake of their Parliamentary careers, most of them keep quiet.But there are also deeper factors at work.One is mainstream Labour’s horror at any supposed betrayal of the socialist cause.This is partly because Labour is such a tribal movement, as shown in the ferocious anger generated in  by Ramsay MacDonald’s decision to break with the party by forming a National Government with the despised Tories.Since then treachery is regarded as the greatest sin, far worse than incompetence or unpopularity.This trait particularly insulates Corbyn, who, for all his spectacular failings, is still regarded by the majority of the membership as an authentic socialist.There is also a deep streak of sentimentality in Labour, which stems from the party’s origins in the trade union movement.In this mindset of supposed compassion, sacking people is what the bosses do, not the workers.When the nondescript Clement Attlee was surprisingly elected Labour leader in , supporters of his rival Herbert Morrison tried to comfort him by saying Attlee’s spell at the top would be short-lived.Morrison was having none of it.The party, he said, was sentimental and having once made a man leader, would stick to him.He was right. Attlee was still in post  years later.Sentimentality explains why so many anti-leadership plots are botched.I saw this for myself working as a Labour researcher at Westminster in the late s and early s, when there were hidden manoeuvres against Kinnock.But they all came to nothing because the plotters lacked the determination to finish the job.The same was true during Gordon Brown’s woeful premiership, when conspirators abandoned the battle when the moment came to strike.More interested in dogma than office, the Labour party lacks the unsparing instinct for power that infuses the Tories, which helps to explain why the Conservatives have been in Government for twice as long. Since  , the Tories have been in office for  years and Labour for just .The absence of hard ambition means that socialists are willing to put up with a dud like Corbyn, while they mouth their slogans and wave the red flag.The wilderness is their ideological comfort zone – and Corbyn will ensure they remain there."},{"url":null,"title":"is no deal brexit possible latest","story":"Boris is prepared to leave without a dealits the only way we can exit on time, but what would this mean for the UK and will we even leave the EU  Heres what we know.A No Deal departure from the European Union means leaving without formal arrangements for the future relationship or any transition period.Currently Britains trade, customs and immigration rules are tied up with the single market and a host of EU regulatory bodies.The UK will automatically head towards a No Dealno agreement is made with the EU on a withdrawal deal by October , .Boris Johnson said he will drop the Irish backstop and turbo-boost plans for a No Deal Brexit.He said Britain would leave the EU come what may by Halloween.Johnson has said he considers the threat of a No Deal Brexit an important bargaining tool.Mr Johnson has no plans to meet EU leaders for a charm offensive this summer - unless they say they will be willing to re-open Brexit talks.During a visit to Scotland on July , , Mr Johnson told Sky News: The backstop is no good.

That’s the critical issue.” On March , MPs dramatically rejected crashing out of the European Union without a deal at any time and under any circumstances.Politicians voted  to  to reject leaving the EU without a withdrawal agreement.But, its not a legally-binding decision, and doesnt rule out the UK leaving the bloc - especially now Boris Johnson is in charge.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Portia Nancarrow, , says she forked out £, for the last-minute trip with working holiday organisers Workers Family, which promised her memories that will last a letime. But she says she was put in a filthy apartment above a takeaway which had a smashed bed and rubbish strewn over the floor. She even alleges she awoke on the first night last week to discover a stranger sitting on the end of her bed thanks to having no lock on her door. She says she chased the man out when he suggested she s*** him. Have you been on a horror holiday  Contact webnews@trinitymirror    Portia, from Ebbw Vale, south Wales, said: It was actually disgusting. I thought I was big and tough before I went out there but now I realise Iaposm not. When I first got there they put me in this accommodation [above a takeaway]. But Workers Family says it offers safe and clean accommodation for young people wanting to escape the UK and have an amazing summer. Portia flew back to the UK two nights after arriving and has since complained to the firm. She wants to warn other young people to be careful when planning to work in holiday destinations.    The teenager continued: There were four beds that were already taken up. I had to ring one of the reps and he moved me upstairs. This new room they put me in was stinking. It was unreal. When you went in, all the doors had holes in them from where people had been fighting. There was a smashed up bed all over the floor, rubbish everywhere, the floor was stinking. I took my shoes off for two seconds and my feet were black. Nothing had been cleaned. All the bed was broken and that had to be chucked outside. They left that on the balcony. But Workers Family denied Portia did not have access to pillows. Tony Furnival, one of its directors, did concede it was the lowest standard of accommodation that was not fit for tourists - but said the workers should expect that.  And while Portia says she paid £ for the accommodation, Workers Family claims it charged £. In my room there were three of us but just two beds. In the room above me there were five boys and three beds, Portia continued. The mattresses were all dirty - it looked like mud. We didnapost have pillows either. It was only by chance that I took my own love heart pillow on the plane. I said to the rep that none of us had pillows and he said aposthereaposs nothing we can do about that - thereaposs another  people waiting for themapos. Weaposd spent all this money and they didnapost give me a pillow. After complaining to the staff, Portia claims she was initially told to clean the apartment herself but when she refused, another season worker was paid £ to do it. Portia added: The first night my door was open because there was no air-con. This man walked into my room, sat on to my bed and said aposs*** meapos. This was a stranger. I was screaming at him to get out and I didnapost see him after that. For all they know something could have happened to me. They get your money, send you over there then thataposs it. She alleges one of the bosses there told her to get [off her] lazy fat a** and cleaned the f***ing apartment.  Iaposve never seen anything like it to be honest. Iaposm gobsmacked, Portia said. I went out on my own and I think thataposs why they took advantage. The whole experience was awful. Theyaposve massively done me over. Theyaposve taken all of that money that I could have spent on something . My nan and dad paid for it - thataposs whataposs even worse. They were really worried. In a y statement, Mr Furnival said: The broken wardrobe, thataposs pretty bad. That should have been fixed. As regards bunk-beds, itaposs hostel-style accommodation. You might as well take a picture of any hostel across the world. If it is dirty, thataposs the people that are living there. Itaposs hostel-style accommodation that theyaposre responsible for.   There is cleaning to a degree [by cleaners]. Because itaposs the end of the season there are so many places she could have been moved. I donapost want you thinking for one second that Iaposm saying nothing sheaposs said is true, but these young people get the lowest standard of accommodation. Itaposs not good enough for year round people, itaposs not good enough for tourists. These claims that people are going out there is so far from what I know to be true, that Iaposm a bit offended. I wasnapost there on that day so these things about a lad going in the room, I canapost lie and say I was there. But itaposs shared accommodation. Weaposve been doing this a lot of years and while thereaposs ious complaints come about, the way sheaposs described itthis was as such aas she said, do you not think it would be a national scandal  There were faults on our part, but the way itaposs been painted, itaposs really over the top. When these people are told that itaposs basic accommodation, they know to expect that.

Onyeka Onyekwulu, , stalked the streets of South London as a teen and climbed the ranks to be one of the bosses of his fearsome gang. He carried a blade, once stabbed a rival during a brawl and witnessed one of his friends kned to death. But now his old foes approach him with praise for turning his le around, and he offers them prayers rather than violence. He insists government cuts to youth services have played a part in the rise of kne crime.    Pastor Onyeka attended a Kids Company centre in Camberwell - which closed in  amid a cash crisis and abuse allegations. But he saw first hand the impact youth facilities had on youngsters, and what happened when it shut its doors. He said: “The government has a part to play. A lot of youngsters are bored and have nobody to look up to at home. “If your time is well managed by a studio, youth club, you don’t have time to feel like picking up a kne to cause damage to your community. “What helped me was a youth centre, Kids Company, and when it closed down it made it worse. “You can’t close things down and then be surprised when things get worse. Me and my friends were calmer, happier, when we were at a youth centre.    “Then we had nothing to do and we were back on the street fighting again. The Government needs to reopen youth centres. “We would be funded to go paintballing and other activities during the summer. “They need to reopen the youth clubs that they’ve closed and need to give people who have lived that lestyle more of a voice.” The average cash-strapped council under the Tories has reduced spending on services such as social clubs and youth workers by  per cent, and some places have seen funding plummet by  per cent in three years, it was found in May. Analysis by the All-Party Parliamentary Groupon Kne Crime found that areas suffering the largest cuts to youth spending have seen bigger increases in kne crime. As part of the Mirror’s kne crime campaign, we are calling on the government to reverse the cuts to youth services.  Onyeka’s turnaround is remarkable - having entered the gang world aged  in the Camberwell and Brixton areas of South London. He left it all behind him after being guided by a friend towards the church aged , and on the back of watching a pal murdered. He was ordained as an evangelist in  and has been preaching, both on the streets and in church, since last year. The Pastor heads up a youth ministry named Youngsters on Fire in Tottenham, North London, under the umbrella of Kingdom Le Ministries. He mentors hundreds of people, many of who have become involved in violent gangs as he once was. “It was just my environment and nothing to do with my upbringing,” he said. “Sometimes you can be not a bad person butyou’re surrounding yourself with bad people, it’s a matter of time before you become like them.” He said the root causes, including neglect at home, need to be tackled socially for true change to be made.  “There are ious reasons why kne crime is happening. Some of the people involved didn’t have any father care or a mentor,” he said. “A lot of people who started in kne crime didn’t first start it - they just went somewhere where they felt love. “Older people involved recruit them to take up the baton and carry it on.” In his own gang-land journey, he recalled: “As time went on I became one of the leaders of the gang, taking part in criminal activity. “I had a lot of post code beef. A lot of fights and confrontations.” It came to a head one night when a brawl broke out and he stabbed a rival. “It was a confrontation where I was protecting myself because he was going at me,” he said. “I try not to think about it. He had a weapon. It was a war at that time and I was heavily involved. So it was normal, at that time. “It was you get me, or I get you, and I got him at that time. It could have been me just as easily. “At that time, I didn’t feel the best after I’d done it but that’s the le I chose to live. “That’s why I always try to advise people that whatever you do, you’ll pay for it.  “I don’t like to dwell on it but people might be going through the same thing and the fact I can relate to them helps them open up to me. “Evenyou’ve had a bad past, don’t let that deny you from becoming great. “My story is to encourage people that you don’t have to live that le to feel respected or empowered or feel you’re the man. “When you go down that path you’re on your own, and all your family and loved ones will have to bear the consequences of the damage you’ve caused by your actions. “If I didn’t live that lestyle then a lot of the youngsters that come to me - who have come out of jail, are selling drugs, or doing things I used to do - would not feel comfortable in confiding in me. “But they know I’ve done what they’ve done and worse. How can you advise someoneyou’ve not lived that le  “I lived that lestyle and it got me nowhere but look at me now, I’m -years-old leading a powerful youth ministry. “Lives are being changed, we help people get employment, accommodation, and travelthey are struggling financially. “Now I feel more relaxed, more at peace, and more happy than ever.” “When I speak to the youth, I know that I almost went down the route that could have ended with me dead or in prison. And I say to them ‘don’t you dare even go there’. “I’m trying to lead them to the right path.”  Onyeka was  when his -year-old friend was stabbed in front of him in Brixton, and died hours later. He said it made him realise as the years went on that le was “not a joke”. “At  I realised being in gangs would not bring me any joy or fulfilment and I decided to make a U-turn, and started going to church. “This is where everything changed. I surrendered my le to God and began to build my spiritual le up. “The people I had problems with, no longer had problems with me after a while. “Some of them approached me in a way to fight but when they realised, they said ‘I respect your change’. “Some would test to seeI would react because they know what I was liked before but I was chilled and so they know the change was genuine.

The couple went head to head in the Kingaposs Cup of the coast of the Isle of Wight, cheered on by Prince George and Princess Charlotte .Kate certainly looked the part in all the sailing gear, including a smart pair of shorts and a baseball cap. Many fans were quick to point out how toned her legs looked in the outfit, and theyaposre the result of a lot of hard work from the Duchess. We know the mum-of-three is really into her exercise and she follows a healthy and balanced diet.    Sheaposs previously spoken about how she stays in shape, and said it was all down to her kids.During a trip to India in , Kate was asked how she shed her baby weight so quickly after the birth of  Princess Charlotte .She replied: I am running after my kids. Even though they have a nanny, Kate is believed to be a very hands on mum and does a lot of the work around the house herself. But she does do a lot of dedicated exercise, and particularly enjoys running and cycling.    Sheaposs also reportedly a big fan of CrossFit and yoya.

Sheaposs also regularly seen walking in the parks around Kensington Palace, pushing one of the children in a pram. When it comes to her stomach, Kate is a fan of one particularly gruelling exercise to maintain her defined abdomen.   She swears by the Plank - which is similar to a push-up except a personaposs forearms rest on the ground instead of their hands - and is dreaded by most gym-goers. Plank practitioners have to maintain this position for a period of time, with the stance becoming more painful the longer it is held. A source told Mail Online: There are three elements, the basic plank, the side plank and the prone sky e, all of which are positions Kate can hold for  seconds or longer and repeat at least ten times each. The side plank requires you to balance on your side, holding your body straight with feet together and one arm flexed directly under your shoulder. Meanwhile, the prone sky e plank is slightly less excruciating, as you have to lie on your tummy and gently raise your chest off the floor until your tummy muscles beg for mercy.    She also uses an inflated gym ball to work her abs, an insider said. After welcoming her two older children, Kate is said to have followed a simple postnatal fitness guide devised by a mum-of-two suffering from depression.

Jim Gamble, described as one of the UK’s most high profile experts on child protection, has reportedly been helping Noraaposs family after being contacted this week. The former detective said -year-oldaposs Nora’s mum and dad are living every parent’s worst nightmare but maintained there is still hope. He also reportedly compared Noraaposs case to Madeleine McCannaposs, saying they were similar. London schoolgirl Nora vanished from a Malaysian jungle resort on Saturday, where she was staying in a holiday house with her parents and two siblings.  Speaking of Noraaposs parents, Mr Gamble told the Belfast : They’re in a foreign country, anxiety will be high, there will be cultural issues and some language issues. They’re maintaining a quiet dignity while they deal with the horror that they’re going through. The former RUC and PSNI officer gave three possibilities as to what could have happened to Nora. He reportedly said she could have wandered off and gone missing, been harmed by someone, or been abducted. Mr Gamble told USA Today Post: This is now one of three cases that are similar. Ben Needham who went missing many years ago, Madeleine McCann who is still on everybody’s minds and now Nora. Madeleine McCann vanished from her familyaposs holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, Portugal, in May  aged three. Ben Needham was  months when he disappeared on  July  on the Greek island of Kos.  Mr Gamble called for the National Crime Agency to assist in the hunt for Nora, believing they can bring additional resources and experience. He said it was in no way to undermine Malaysian Police, but rather to support them. Mr Gamble said it was such a rare kind of investigation that few organisations have the ability to deal with them - but says the NCA does. Noraaposs parents Meabh and Sebastien believe she was abducted, but police say there is no evidence the teen, who has special needs, was snatched from her room at the Dusun resort . Her disappearance has apparently left search and rescue team members puzzled, with one claiming: Not even a footprint was left behind. Police have questioned  people and they believe she is still close to the resort about an hour south of Kuala Lumpur and they have not ruled out the possibility she was kidnapped.

He said in a victim impact statement that he will aposnever be that person he used to beapos as the incident devastated him and his family. But Konini, a test consultant at Royal London Group – the UK’s largest mutual le and pensions company, avoided prison yesterday. Konini, from Broxburn, West Lothian, was originally charged with assaulting Mr Joya to his severe injury and permanent disfigurement during the incident on  August last year.However, his guilty plea to a lesser charge of culpable and reckless conduct and a plea of not guilty to assaulting his we Nonzaliseko by striking her on the head were accepted by the Crown.Erin Illand, prosecuting, said the dinner party at Konini’s home in Broxburn had ended with an argument between the two former friends at around .am. She told Livingston Sherf Court the two men had spent the evening drinking alcohol and socialising.    She said: “The witness Joya had been discussing an upcoming birthday celebration but the discussion became heated and turned into an argument. “The argument escalated, at which point the accused threw a glass at the witness Joya striking him to the right side of his face to his injury. “After this a struggle ensued and the accused and Mr Joya were split up. The witness Joya was bleeding from his ear. “There was an extensive cut to his right ear and two further cuts behind his ear.” She said Mr Joya was taken to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary for treatment and thereafter had further appointments to see a plastic surgeon. She submitted a victim impact statement, which Sherf Peter Hammond read before hearing from defence solicitor Andy Aitken. Mr Aitken admitted thatthe attack causing serious injury had been deliberate the court would obviously have been considering a custodial sentence. However he pointed out: “Mr Konini has pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of culpable and reckless conduct and, whilst he is responsible for his actions and for the outcome – particularly the injury caused to Mr Joya – it is of course accepted by the Crown that this was not a deliberate attack but a reckless one. “Mr Konini lost his temper in the argument. He picked up the glass and genuinely just threw it at the wall behind him. Regrettably the glass slipped and struck the complainer on the side of the face.”    He stressed the incident was entirely out of character for his client who was a first offender. He added: “He relocated to Scotland with his we some  years ago from South Africa. He has an excellent job and a good income and over the last  years has brought up his family and contributed to society. “This is clearly an entirely isolated incident. Mr Joya was a very close family friend. He was a guest for the evening at the house of Mr and Mrs Konini. And the men had continued to drink after what had been a pleasant evening and dinner. “The conversation, after a considerable amount of whisky had been consumed, turned to Mr Konini’s son, and the conversation, which resulted in my client losing his temper so badly, centred on Mr Joya questioning my client’s son’s sexuality. “He asked him to stop talking about it. He told him it was none of his business. But Mr Joya continued talking about it, resulting in this momentary loss of temper. “He expressed remorse immediately, indicating when instructing me he’d thrown the glass but denied doing so with the intention of striking the complainer.” He said Konini had since told social workers he felt “so sorry” for what he’d done and emphasised he had no ongoing animosity towards his victim. Sherf Peter Hammond ordered Konini to carry out  hours of unpaid work in the community and made him subject to social work supervision for a year. He also ordered the accused to pay his victim £ compensation.

It was a nightmare when I was younger as no one took me seriously but now Iaposm reaping the rewards as I look  years younger. Everyone is shocked when I tell them my age and they want to know my secret. Itaposs simple - Iaposm single. It keeps me young. I donapost have the stress of dealing with a man. I come and go as I please and that means I donapost have any wrinkles or worry lines.    I find people staring at me before askingIaposve had botox or fillers, but I havenapost had anything done. You can tellwomen have had surgery and I donapost like that look. Iaposm completely natural and am lucky to have great skin and a happy le now. Shany, who regularly appears in Emmerdale, has always looked younger. Blokes used to say I would be pretty when I grew up - but that was when I was , she says. When I married and was pregnant strangers gave me bad looks assuming I was a teenage mum when in fact I was worried Iaposd left it almost too late because I was . No one spoke to me at the school gate when Tom was older because they thought I wasnapost old enough to look after him and even now when I have foreign students over to stay they ask where my mother is as they assume Iaposm the teenager.  Itaposs funny now but it was upsetting when I was younger. I didnapost have a lot of friends and was isolated as the other mums thought I was some kind of Lolita who would steal their husbands. After splitting up with her husband - because he didnapost like the attention her looks attracted - Shany decided to date and instantly regretted it. I would never want to be a cougar and go out with anyone younger as I want to feel secure and protected by an older man, she says, aposbut itaposs hardly romantic when other people askthe man youaposre with is your dad. One time I was in a pub on a third date with a man I quite liked and a rugby team came in and some of the lads started pointing before one asked why I was out with my father and my date went berserk. They ended up fighting while I sneaked out of the back door. I never saw him again.

Most of them are  but they accepted me because they thought I was in my s, she says.  When I said I was  they looked shocked and said I was older than their mothers. I love it!

Mollie, who works as a part-time emergency planning worker for a charity, added: People have been messaging me from the other side of the world. The doctors told me when she was younger that they didnapost think she would ever walk. They still said to me when she got her diagnosis that they couldnapost predict it. Mia had been through a lot since she was born in March , she had two holes in her heart and stayed in intensive care at Salisbury Hospital as a baby.   She also contracted meningitis at six-month-old and had to go in and out of hospital while fighting with ious complications for seven months.But itaposs not until May when an MRI scan result came through and showed that Mia had Joubert Syndrome.Mollie told Daily Star : In the past  months the NHS have been fantastic but before that I had to pay for Miaaposs physiotherapy and her specialist shoes."},{"url":null,"title":"online vs high street really","story":"NewsOnline vs High Street - which is really the best way to book a holidayMirror writers Rhian Lubin and Paul Routledge are at dferent ends of the age spectrum but they both have one aim - book a holidayShareCommentsByPaul RoutledgeRhian Lubin:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video explained-what-your-holiday-firm-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHoliday giant TUI has rowed back on its decision to scrap brochures because customers still love flicking through glossies to pick their jolly.

It got us thinking – which is better for the customer  Is it brochures and a high street bricks-and-mortar travel agent, or click-and-connect online booking  Two writers – both very stuck in their ways – tried a dferent method when booking a family package holiday for four to Spain... My fat head is spinning but Iaposve been told to BOOK NOW       By Paul Routledge, , never booked a holiday online What a palaver! We used to choose a package holiday from a brochure and then ask a travel agent to book it. They did all the work of sorting flights, hotels, transfers, special requests and even foreign currency. Magic. But now it’s all online. “Cutting out the middle man”, they call it. What they mean is “do it yourself”. And beat your brains out on a laptop in the process. Here we go. I googled TUI, which came up immediately. The site had ious options, including family holidays, so I clicked on that. More choice came up, including “adult holidays”, which sounded a bit X-rated, so swtly on to family deals. More or less at random, I picked on the Hotel Condesa in Alcudia, Majorca. Do I want to shortlist this entry  OK. Do I want to create an account  No, not really. Ignore that. The price is £, per person, all-inclusive, totalling £,. Jings, that’s three months’ average wages for a wannabe holidaymaker working in Wakefield. This includes a £pp discount. Mighty generous. Now try the details box... The Condesa is a -room, four-star hotel, right on a sandy beach, with a huge, winding pool at its centre and there’s an animal-themed splash park. On to “summary and book”, where I find the cost of the holiday has already gone up by p. I can put down a zero deposit and join TUI’s direct debit scheme, presumably so the tour firm can get all the money before we leave for the airport. The flights look good, daytime out and . Good job I’m a short-a***d war baby because a seat with extra legroom costs another £ . Do I want to know what other travellers think  There are , reviews on TripAdvisor. How about Feedback  Two choices here: specic or generic. Or how about Live Chat with one of TUI’s advisers. Is this the same as ringing someone up, only online  By this stage, my fat head is spinning but the screen has a little yellow box instructing BOOK NOW. This takes me to a very big window asking for personal details of all the passengers. Fair enough, this is standard international law. I must promise we will have “adequate insurance arrangements”. This is obligatory but it’s not clear to me how this is to be paid. Now, CONTINUE. When I click, it tut-tuts that I’ve failed to fill in  boxes with personal info and, in red letters, chides me for failing to tick the important information box. That’s enough. This process has cost me almost an hour and it’s only a dry run. The kids will have to do with a fortnight in Scarborough. It has one of the best water parks in Europe.

The two worlds of the neglected Love Lane estate and the £billion ­Tottenham Hotspur stadium could scarcely be further apart. And, while local people were delighted the club decided to stay here, the tension between the football club as a global brand and a community hub has rarely felt so taut. Inside the giant glass bowl of the stadium everything is measured in big numbers – , seats, a -metre bar that can pull , pints per minute, a -metre high South Stand. A projected annual turnover of £million a year. The prawn sandwich brigade even get their own Michelin-starred chef. And hiding under the hallowed turf is an articial pitch ready for NFL to arrive from the US later this year.    In a future Sky Walk attraction, visitors will one day be able to abseil from the roof. Outside, you are standing on streets that are among the % most deprived in Britain. The stadium redevelopment was an opportunity to lt the prospects of the people who live here. But, instead, as the regeneration surrounding the stadium continues with a development known as High Road West, many families now fear they will simply be swept away. A new walkway proposed to bring fans from a new station entrance at White Hart Lane station brings its own statistics.  social housing homes threatened with demolition in a borough with a severe housing shortage.    Where , households are on the council’s waiting list and , families are stuck in temporary accommodation. Meanwhile,  small manufacturing businesses on the Peacock estate, providing hundreds of decent local jobs, are facing eviction via a ­compulsory purchase order. The proposals will also mean the loss of a library. And, perhaps worse for fans who will never afford the Michelin-served boxes, the demolition of match day institution ‘Chick King’. Even the football club itself – which is not responsible for High Road West – says it doesn’t agree with the extended plans “as we do not believe it is aspirational enough for residents”. A club spokesman said: “We have a proud track record delivering new homes and community facilities in Tottenham and everyone can now clearly see the new stadium as a primary example of our commitment to the area.  “To date we have created over , jobs in the area and delivered over  affordable homes. We are a key part of the local community with a long-term stake in the success of the area.” Now, days after the th anniversary of the Addison Act which paved the way for large-scale council housing, campaigners are calling for Haringey Council and its development partner Lendlease PLC to reconsider their plans for High Road West. This week, at London’s Tate Modern gallery, as part of an exhibition ­celebrating ­football, visitors were confronted by a wooden horse built on the Peacock industrial estate, ­symbolising residents’ fears the stadium hides the borough’s real plans to socially cleanse them. An accompanying picture book, Tottenham’s Trojan Horse, by Dr Mark Panton and Amanda Lillywhite, tells the story from the point of view of local residents. Latest plans include , new homes, but only  will be council houses and none are likely to eventually house current Love Lane residents. The one glimmer of light is that Sadiq Khan ’s City Hall has told developers they could forfeit mayoral fundsthey do not consult residents properly.At the Tate, veteran anti-poverty campaigner Rev Paul Nicolson, , called the regeneration “an abuse of power by land-grabbers”. Over the years, residents of the Love Lane estate, earmarked for the walkway demolition, have been replaced by temporary social tenants who have fewer rights and can be easily evicted when the time comes.  “I have been on this estate for almost four years and it is getting to a point where it is becoming uncomfortable to live here,” says Tash Bonner, who lives with his mum and sister, and is chairman of the campaign group, TagLove Lane. “The council has stopped maintenance of the flats, because in the long run they know it is going to be knocked down. We keep getting told that we are part of this regeneration, but we have had no certainty about where we will be rehoused. We are just living day to day.” Joanna Morrison, , who lives on the estate with her partner and their two children, said: “We are living on a demolition site yet no one from the council tells you what is happening. Three years it’s been like this.” "},{"url":null,"title":"schoolboy 7 who fell rollercoaster","story":"NewsSchoolboy, , who fell from rollercoaster undergoes emergency brain surgeryThe youngster was airlted to hospital with critical head injuries after he fell from the Twister rollercoaster at Lightwater Valley theme park in MayShareByAndy Rudd:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG NewsThe boy is thought to have fallen between  to ft \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe schoolboy who fell from a theme park rollercoaster has undergone emergency brain surgery.

As a family we have been through something that is, in some ways, similar and it helped give some small understanding of what they might be going through.

He said: “I would like someone for a long-term, permanent relationship, who I’ll be able to get on with and is a bit younger than me. “I’m in my early s and it’s hard to find someone my age who would be able to have children. “My father was  years older than my mother so the age gap shouldnapost be a problem. “I’d like them to be understanding, nice and quite attractive. But they could be average-looking. Looks aren’t too important.  Every year I always go to the theatre to watch a musical and this year Iaposve bought an extra ticket because Iaposd really love for someone to sit next to me and share in the experience. George struggles with social interaction and has had bad experiences in the past. He said: “Due to my Aspergers I have a social phobia of meeting people. “It’s hard going to places like pubs and I’m not really a drinker. I have a glass of sherry at Christmas. “I had problems in my last year of school that put me off socialising with people of my own age.  I was bullied and one day someone attacked me coming back from school. It put me off friends and relationships. “Itaposs hard to talk about and still painful  years on. Despite his past social struggles, George says he would be a good catch for any woman. “I have a sense of humour, he added. And I can make people laugh. I’d offer a stable relationship and I wouldn’t let my partner down. I would be a lot happier and more confidentI had a girlfriend.  “Sometimes I’d like to go on holiday but it is dficult going places on your own. “I have been depressed. I feel lonely and awkward doing things like the theatre on my own. “I’d go a lot moreI had someone to go with.

And they are in no doubt Tory cuts to youth services, soaring inequality, drugs and a lack of neighbourhood police are to blame, leaving many bored teenagers vulnerable to the clutches of gangs.After feeling ignored by politicians, the group has now demanded Boris Johnson tackle the kne crime epidemic sweeping Britain before more lives are lost.They delivered a letter and -point manesto to the PM today, which includes calls for more cash for youth services and tackling the causes of crime such as a lack of housing and jobs.    It came as figures showed kne crime hit a record high in  , up  per cent on the previous year. But research found real-terms spending on youth services by  per cent over the past three years. One of the group, Eden Lunghy, has friends who lost people to stabbings. The -year-old, from Camden, North London, said: “I definitely think budget cuts to youth club services and after school provision has had a big impact. “Before, people felt they could go ­somewhere and do activities and distract themselves from what’s going on.    “But when your youth club is being shut all you can do is hang around your estate with friends. That can lead to young people feeling bored and ­disconnected from society and become a group that causes trouble that ­escalates to rivalry with other groups and leads to fatal stabbings.” Eden also warned Mr Johnson’s pledge to reverse cuts to police forces would not on its own tackle the problem.  Ensuring young people feel safe on the streets is importantthey are to stop carrying knives.  Work needs to be done to challenge the idea that carrying a kne is the norm.  Schools need to provide better support to young people who are at risk of involvement in crime, those excluded from school need a safe place to go.  Investment in youth services and mentors is key to helping young people escape violent lestyles.  We need to tackle the underlying causes of violent crime in communities such as lack of housing and unemployment.  Gangs need to be prevented from using social media as a means of recruiting vulnerable young people.  All media have a responsibility not to perpetuate myths that young people need to carry a kne or contribute towards young people becoming desensitised to violence.  Introduce more community police officers who can build relationship and help prevent crime before it starts.  Tackling the drugs market is a key part of tackling kne crime.  The Government need to provide support to young people who are either already involved or a risk of becoming involved in county lines activity. There needs to be a clear strategy on how to help these victims of exploitation escape involvement with gangs.  Custody should be used as a last resort – often it only serves to help young people become ‘better criminals’.  Rehabilitation, particularly helping young people gain skills and access employment should be central to the youth justice system.   She said: “Just adding more police isn’t going to solve the issue. “The Prime Minister and other organisations need to find the root causes in order to dismantle it and ensure young people aren’t getting stabbed and killed on the street. “It’s heartbreaking to see how one fatal stabbing can cause a broken ­community.  Group member, Zak Hall, told how youngsters were kning people just to get “likes” on social media The -year-old, of Redbridge, East London, revealed his brother was stabbed in January. He said: “He’s okay. He survived. I live in a good part of London, yet my brother was sliced with a kne. My older brother was in an attempted car-jacking by two guys with rusty knives. Somebody I know was murdered on his birthday last August. Social media is partly to blame. Social media, drill music and teenage angst all mixed together causes violence.  When you can track ­popularity by likes, it is going to cause people to do things for likes. People can attack others for likes.” Hamza Taouzzale, , was elected as a Westminster Labour councillor at  in a bid to combat kne crime. And he wants more youngsters to be involved in the battle. Hamza said: “We’re trying to engage more young people and get them to the table. Especially when a lot of ­policies are made for young people, without the input from young people.” "},{"url":null,"title":"traffic shown mysteriously vanishing thin","story":"NewsTraffic shown mysteriously vanishing into thin air - and no one can figure out howAt first glance it looks like vehicles are disappearing as they turn left on a bridgeShareCommentsByZahra MulroySocial Audience Editor:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news weird-news video can-you-figure-out-traffic-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Itaposs a clip which has drawn eerie comparisons to the Bermuda Triangle - because it seemingly shows traffic vanishing into thin air.Yet while the majority of people are spooked out by the fate of the vehicles, a few clever clogs automatically saw the clip for what it actually is.

I don’t think any of the boys in the changing room are surprised there’s been attention on him, he’s been fantastic for the last couple of seasons. But it’s something that’s going on in the background that we can’t deal with.“Scotty has come in, trained hard and I don’t think anyone expected anything less. I’m sure he’ll be ready tonight.“I’ve come through the whole youth academy with Scotty and it’s been great to see his rise he’s captained his club and captained his country.“It’s good for the boys that have grown up with him. He’s taken it all in his stride and is an experienced centre-half now.”McKenna has featured in all five games so far this season, despite handing a transfer request in before the opening Premiership game against Hearts. Given the shortage of defenders available, having him on the plane and ready to play is pivotal for the Dons.They face a Rijeka team coming into the competition at the third qualying round, having won the Croatian Cup last year.The Dons have come through ties against RoPS Rovaniemi and Georgian side Chikhura Sachkhere to get to this stage, which has been a sticking point in Europe under Derek McInnes.However, the draw on Monday for the play-off round handed them the winners of the AEK Larnaca-Gent tie, arguably presenting the club with its best chance of making the Europa League group stages for the first time under the gaffer.Wright said: “The manager strives for it. It’s important we qualy for the Europa League every year and because we’re in it this year people might think it’s dficult to juggle the two, but he makes sure we’re ready for the Premiership and the Europa League.“He really wants us to get into the group stages, as do the whole squad. Although it’s been very good in years before, it’s been frustrating because we’ve come close yet so far.“We class ourselves as an experienced team now – we’ll take it tie by tie and try not look too far ahead. We know we’re close, but there’s still work to do.”It is the first time Aberdeen have ed to Rijeka since they beat them - in , on a night where Kenny McLean, Peter Pawlett and Andy Considine found the net. The teams drew - at Pittodrie to send Aberdeen through to the third qualying round. Wright added: “I was on the bench that night and it was probably one of our most memorable nights in Europe.“Tonight they are a dferent team and so are we. I do recognise a couple of places – I’ve been here with Scotland as well.“I think we struggled a wee bit – we played Czech Republic then and they were a good side. But all our focus is on tonight.“It’s important you don’t get carried away with what’s in the papers and on the news. We’re fine classing ourselves as the underdogs in every round. We’re an experienced team now in the Europa League and the majority of times in years before, we were classed as underdogs and managed to get some big results.”Balmedie-born Wright, who had a loan spell at Dundee last season, scored his first goal at Pittodrie in the - win over Chikhura last week, but is not dwelling too much on his landmark strike.He added: “I was delighted to get my first goal at Pittodrie – it was a special moment for myself and my friends.“I can’t reflect too much on it now. It’s done.“We’ve got an important game tonight and then Sunday . Important games come thick and fast.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.44567122-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.44567122-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.44567122-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.44567122-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"vyner joins dons on loan ahead of rijeka tie","story":"Aberdeen have completed a loan move for Bristol City#s Zak Vyner.The -year-old defender was registered before last night#s pm UEFA transfer deadline which means he is eligible to face HNK Rijeka in the Europa League this evening.The Reds play the Croatian outfit at the Stadion Rujevica in the first leg of the Europa League third qualying round with kick-off pm."},{"url":null,"title":"even tunnel vision has its drawbacks","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOur regular artistic contributor Ann Thomas this week muses on a subject she has mulled over before # the Rest and be Thankful.Transport Scotland is undertaking a review of the country#s strategic transport strategy, with an undertaking that Argyll will be at the front of the queue this time around.We#ll see, but in the meantime a tunnel through the hills is considered by some to be the answer to solving the problem of keeping Argyll connected via the A by avoiding the landslide risk altogether.But there may be some drawbacks to a super underground highway#PIC:no_acartoon"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 14 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsBike scrambling fans out there of a certain age will be feeling nostalgic at the prospect of ato a track described as #one of the best in the world# later this month.Kilmartin is famous in the motocross world and mouths are watering at the prospect.Not that long ago,you had walked into a shop and asked for a bottle of water you would be offered fizzy French stuff or perhaps tonic or soda water.Plain drinking water  We had taps for that.A multi-million pound industry has #sprung# up, selling water to us in plastic bottles.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

He turned Duncan MacKinnon inside-out before flicking an inch-perfect ball to Fraser Watt on the left of the D and he slammed the ball high into the middle of the goal from  yards to make it -.Lochaber had their first shot on goal on six minutes when Ben Delaney found space on the left but his strike went wide of the left-hand post.Inveraray were showing good movement up front and they increased their advantage on nine minutes. The goal came from a corner and Garry MacPherson caught the Lochaber defence napping as he played the ball low from a wide area towards the front post where full centre Lewis MacNicol waltzed into the box and his first-time shot beat the helpless Callum MacDonald to make it -.Lochaber keeper MacDonald pulled off a great save on  minutes as he blocked Garry MacPherson’s fine drive from the left with his chest before clearing the ball to safety.Lochaber’s Ben Delaney and Stuart Callison tested Inveraray keeper Scott MacLachlan but it was the Winterton side who would add a third goal on  minutes. Again the goal came from Lewis MacNicol winning possession, this time deep in Lochaber territory, and he found the ever-alert Garry MacPherson whose defence-splitting pass picked out Fraser Watt running in unmarked through the heart of the Lochaber defence and he slotted the ball low past the keeper from close range.Lochaber were now up against it but, on  minutes, Conor Sweeney took a corner from the right, sending the ball into the danger-area. Stuart Callison found space to slam the ball goalwards and although Scott MacLachlan saved with his feet, he was unable to get the ball away and Ben Delaney was quick to react as he poked the ball over the line to make it - at the interval and give Lochaber hope.Lochaber started the second period with intent and Scott MacLachlan pulled off a great save to thwart Stuart Callison on  minutes.However, Lochaber’s never-say-die attitude got them right back into the match with just  minutes remaining. Lachlan Campbell played the ball across from the right and it came perfectly to the on-running Findlay MacDonald and his  yard shot from the left flew past the keeper to make it -, setting up a tense finishLochaber had a great chance to snatch a point on  minutes when referee John Angus Gillies awarded them a spot-hit, penalising keeper MacLachlan for a “kick” inside the D. Ben Delaney’s well-struck effort went straight down the middle and MacLachlan redeemed himself, saving superbly with his stick before clearing the ball for a corner.Inveraray saw out the rest of the game to claim two valuable points in what was a cleanly fought contest with no cards shown.The win sets Inveraray up for another crucial relegation battle this time at Kilmallie this coming Saturday.Caberfeidh  Kyles Athletic Kyles Athletic came from behind to beat Caberfeidh - in their pm throw up at Castle Leod.Caberfeidh have been on a bit of a scoring spree of late and they took the lead in the opening minute through Craig Morrison.It didn’t take Kyles long to level with Ross MacRae netting on  minutes and Colin MacDonald’s effort on  minutes meant they went into the break - ahead.Ross MacRae got his second on  minutes with Colin MacDonald doing like-wise with just  minutes remaining.Mowi South Division Inveraray  Kyles Athletic The Inveraray seconds and the Kyles Athletic seconds met in a match originally rearranged Thursday  July which was then put back  hours.Kane Kirkhope was playing in a more advanced role for Inveraray and he scored a well-taken goal in eight minutes after some impressive forward play.John MacKenzie was working hard in the middle of the park and he set up Inveraray’s second goal on  minutes.

We challenged the soccer centre to increase the number of children participating and ask how far and often they could let the young players experience events and festivals where and I am delighted they were able to match our ambitions. For that reason and for the second year running we are providing £, of funding. We know our funding last season allowed well over  young players to receive new strips in the Red Star design and attend events across the UK and we look forward to watching their developments over the next season.#Ben Tustin of the Lochgilphead Soccer Centre was equally delighted and said that the Ardrishaig Community Trust #is an excellent partner for us without which we would not have been able to deliver many of our strategic objectives. We are wholly dependent on external funding and volunteers and we do receive generous funding from other organisations as well as the Trust.

Day one saw us head out from Carloway aboard the SYSAC II under the watchful eye of skippper Robbie Bell who knows these waters like the back of his hand.The day kicked off with a bait hunt in the East Loch but the mackerel were pretty scarce, it took an hour or so to fill the baskets before steaming out to the two-mile mark in search of spurdogs. By then there was a fair wee wind picking up and it was a tad rough to say the least, with the heavy swell claiming a few breakfasts along the way.All that was soon forgotten as the battle commenced with the mighty spurs. The action started on the first drop with some thumpers coming aboard, single and double shots causing mayhem thrashing about the deck and we lost count of the number of rigs sliced through on the way up. But that’s what we came for, not everyone’s choice but great sport all the same.In between the madness we picked away at the haddock, whiting, grey and red gurnard, ling and pollack, until we had our quota and decided to seek the smoother waters of East Loch Roag for some flattie bashing on the soft ground. It was good to get into the calm and fish the light gear, picking away for dabs and plaice. There was plenty around, nothing huge but a steady flow coming aboard taking us to the end of the day with a good mixed bag of species.Day two set off in brilliant sunshine and not a breath of wind, it was almost tropical conditions. We quickly got our supply of fresh bait in West Loch Roag and set off for the rough ground in search of a few more species, but there was little or no drt so we took a turn into Clf Bay and settled in for a day on the rays. It was brilliant fun, everyone got their fair share with loads of thornback rays and a few spotted rays coming aboard, plenty of dabs, plaice, dogfish and a bonus lb oz turbot to add to the tally. It was a great opportunity to brush up on some of fishing techniques that don’t get practised much at home.We decided to hit the hard ground on the way back to the harbour. It was quite slow, maybe a wee bit early yet, but it produced more haddock, a lovely lb cuckoo wrasse and pollack bringing our two day adventure to an end. All in all another excellent club trip.This year we picked up  species,  counting fish and a few personal bests. Add to that, great company, loads of banter, a good skipper who makes a mean cup o’ tea and you have the ideal ingredients for another memorable few days away on Lewis. We’ll be back next year for sure.Results: Nikki Thompson  points, Robert MacBrayne , Nick Friel , Jim Smith , Gary Sinclair , Steven MacBrayne ."},{"url":null,"title":"mach1 scottish tarmack rally championship report","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWith  starters and  Cobble shop STRC registered the championship tables were always going to change on this mid-season two day event.Sunshine was forecast for the Machrihanish Airbase Community Companycourse and that’s what was delivered. Some crews were hoping for rain but this year it wasn’t to be. Last year’s winner Bruce Edwards in the Darrian T GTR was favourite and since Bruce had not driven the car competitively since Mach   we all thought he would be a bit rusty.Bruce led from the start and set some impressive times throughout the two days but on the last stage he threw it all away and rolled the car as he clipped a large lorry tyre a mile from the finish line, unable to right the car and with the stage blocked the clerk of the course decided on the grounds of safety to cancel the final stage. This allowed Alistair Inglis in the lotus Exige and a previous Mach  winner to clinch the top spot.Class  had  STRC registered this year and new to class  was Tom Blackwood in the gorgeous yellow and Black Fiesta R+. Tom#s first event driving in anger and showed that with some tweaks here and there with suspension settings it’s a great car to drive. How well the car drives notwithstanding, there was a slight moment coming out of one of the tight sections onto the main runway when Tom ran wide and clipped a boundary fence damaging the front bumper of the car but kept the fence intact. Tom finished third Overall and second in class .John Rintoul in another Fiesta R on the back of the recent win at Crail was on it all weekend but just couldn’t clinch the win this year, John finished second overall and took the class win.Alan Wallace in the distinctive green and white Mitsubishi Evo finished a very well deserved th overall and third in class. Harry Chalmers was a Mach  virgin and loved every mile of the venue. Harry commented at the end of the event they we had no problems at all on day one and the car ran faultlessly all day to give him a real confidence boost to push on harder and let him get used to some new parts on the car. Harry kept it neat all day and came away with rd overall after day one.Day two was very fast. Fastest he’s probably been in the car to date with these faster stages suiting faster cars Harry just had to push on brake late and keep it tidy and with that being said the team dropped to th overall due to some of the quicker cars retiring out.Harry said: #I couldn’t be happier for how this event turned out for the team and are all delighted with the result and how far they have come.#Harry also managed the full two days on the same Hankook Tyres Finishing th overall.Alan Stark in the stunning Red Mitsubishi Evo had decided he was playing the long game and would drive accordingly. The plan went well and they played about with tyres trying to make them last for the two days. On the second last stage on the Saturday the manold gasket started to blow and he lost a fair bit of power mid stage. The service crew managed to bolt it up again but the long stages were killing it and it usually faded about  rds in each time.On Sunday he decided to push on a bit and of course it bit him. The interior mirror fell off and he became aware there was a car coming up behind after a merge but wasn’t sure how close. He decided to do the next lollipop and then see where he was on the straight but in his enthusiasm got to him and he understeered into the bales bouncing off them, hitting his bonnet. He also noticed the brake pads were rattling more than usual and it turned out they had lost a pin. The team had to improvise with spare tyre borrowed from Allan Wallace which didn’t quite fit but they wired it in and it lasted.Class  had  STRC registered crews this year and top spot and current championship leader in class went to Colin Gemmell in the Mark  Escort. Colin had a trouble-free run on both days and managed to finish the event th overall just  seconds behind Tom Blackwood and second in class.Alistair Inglis winner of the  Mach  stages kept just ahead all weekend. Nothing could touch his car which stuck to the road like glue.Inglis said: #Overall victory and a class win  Can’t get any better.#Robert Marshall in the Mark  Escort was looking forward to some decent results but an issue on day one with the car losing all its water put an end to any real chances and on day two an engine mount broke putting an end to what Robert described as a perfect weekend.Ross Auld was a welcomethe Mark  Escort and also managed a couple of days assistance in setting up the venue. Ross had managed to set some decent times on Saturday but late in the day the alternator belt snapped and took with it the dry sump belt causing the engine to cease. Ross loaded up the car and headed home and by the Sunday evening he had the engine out the car ahead of its rebuild.Class  saw four STRC registered crews compete in Kintyre this year and top of the list was Greg Inglis in the Lotus Exige. Greg exited the last stage on the Saturday and noticed the rear brake calliper hanging off. A call was made to Montrose where a spare part was removed from a car and the handover was done half way between Montrose and Machrihanish. Greg finished a respectful fth overall and took the class win.Second in class and th overall was Michael Harbour in the Mark  Escort, on the back of electrical problems that saw the team fail to finish the last round at Crail the team have now got the car singing on the stages. Michael didn’t report any issues during the weekend and brought the car home in one piece.Michael Robertson isn’t having the best of luck this season as the Honda Civic Type R driver reported issues with the CV joint that led to driveshaft and df failure but as usual the team loved the event and will be back for sure.Class , with eight registered STRC in class  the battles were all tensely close. Taking top honours in the class was Kyle Adam a full two minutes ahead of nearest class  car of Des Campbell. Kyle also managed a top  overall clinching th spot and despite some overheating at one point the car ran faultlessly doing his championship hopes no harm.Lochgilphead local, Jamie Miller in the C R Max loves the track and had the luxury of booking indoor servicing. With navigator Ian McCulloch, his biggest problems were brake related but with some fluid changes and adjustments it was just all back to normal for the team finishing a well-deserved th overall and fourth in class.Kayleigh Strachan in the Citroen Saxo finished th in class on the event and th overall but managed to pick up  points and th in class in the STRC.Gary Coutts in the Fiesta commented after the final stage on the Sunday that on the second to last stage of day one he developed a few ‘minor’ issues. A change of driveshaft, ball joint, wheels and tyres seemed to cure the problem. With an early start on the Sunday morning the car was back on form. Loss of intercom on way to stage  and a half spin on stage  cost them a bit of time and after a few tweaks at service they were away again. The last stage of the day was cancelled resulting in a th overall and th in class.Alan Watt was again out in the green Saxo and finished th in class and st overall. A great result for the team with no damage or mechanical issues to report.Class  had four teams registered in the STRC this year at Mach  but only one managed to finish.

Goddards were granted permission to turn the house into a wedding venue with marquees in July , but Scottish Borders Council imposed strict conditions on the use after receiving strong objections from

It is bounded to the west by Montgomerie Terrace.ldquoThe proposed new development will be accessed via a new access created off Montgomerie Terrace, with the two new houses towards the front of the site, which replace the existing ldquodoran pre-fab and former canoe shed, accessed off the B.ldquoThese proposed homes reflect high standards of design to ensure successful integration with the character of the local area, without damaging the design characteristics of the conservation area.ldquoThe materials, scale and height of the surrounding area have all been assessed to ensure the proposed development is in keeping with the existing housing.The plans attracted five objections relating to the height of the buildings in relation to nearby properties, and raised issues surrounding privacy and sunlight.However, at a meeting of Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning and building standards committee on Monday August , planning officers urged councillors to approve the plans.In a written submission to the committee, planning officer Julie Hayward writes: ldquoThe main issue with the development is the potential impact of the dwellinghouses proposed on plots five and seven on the light, privacy and outlook of Orchard House to the east due to the position of the proposed houses and dfering ground levels.ldquoThe agent has submitted a drawing to show the relationship between the three houses and section drawings showing ground levels.ldquoIn terms of the impact of the proposed house on plot seven, the proposed house would have two bedroom windows in the east elevation at ground floor level and would be on slightly lower ground. Applying the guidelines in the approved supplementary planning guidance, there would be no signicant loss of light or privacy to Orchard House from this property.ldquoIn terms of the impact of the house on plot five on Orchard house, the garage would be positioned on the eastern side of the proposed house and the decking is shown on the western side beyond the rear wing.ldquoThere would be a window and door to the garage and a window to a WC in the rear elevation, which are not considered to be habitable rooms. There would be a large glazed area in the rear wing serving the living room.ldquoThe house is on signicantly higher ground than Orchard House.ldquoAgain, when applying the approved guidance there would be no direct overlooking and no loss of privacy to the habitable rooms of Orchard House.Kelso councillor Simon Mountford said he did not object to the proposals, but wanted to see a design change: ldquoWhat we have here those very boring roof shapes, although I appreciate modern roofs do not have chimneys or anything to break them up a little bit.ldquoIrsquom wonderingwe could ask the developer to break up the roof lines with some new designs.Tweeddale West councillor Eric Small told the committee: ldquoIrsquom quite happy with the way itrsquos sited in this location, so Irsquom going to go with the officers on this one.

We knew it would last forever, but forever had its day.The Twin Peaks-inspired Love Dilation is as dark as it is atmospheric.But it is perhaps the utterly engrossing simplicity of Imprints that makes it so special. While McAndrew has the harmonic range, Smalls almost monotoned meanderings, accompanied by the backing vocals of Grant Pringle and Cameron Jack, creates the rawest of emotions.Concluding the new EP is the orchestral art-song, A Theory of Everything. Built around a single, beautully menacing chord, which apparently symbolises the background radiation in our universe, the finale discusses the search for discovering a unying theory of everything.To quote Small from Imprints, As you travel through space, you are displaced, imagining time. You exist like a plant, you bloom and you grow, then wither and die. But the one card you play, genetically, is always an ace. For the imprints you leave, have changed the fabric of time and space.If there is any justice in the supersonic space-age future, Electron Masss four EPs will hopefully have changed the fabric of music down here on Earth."},{"url":null,"title":"letter creating dementia friendly communities in kintyre","story":"We are organising some information events to let people know what we are planning in their area for older people in general and to gather the thoughts of the local communities.They will take place on the following dates: Tuesday August , Tarbert Templers Hall, -pm Monday August , Clachan Village Hall, am to pm Tuesday September , Tayinloan Village Hall, am to noon Friday September , Carradale Village Hall, noon to pm.Dementia touches so many in Kintyre and we are keen to talk to as many people as possible about real lived experiences locally.

are fortunate in Scotland to have a way out of such dficulties in the form of a Debt Arrangement Scheme , which is one of Scotland’s best-kept secrets.  It’s available from charitable organisations such as StepChange and from commercial debt advisers such as TC Debt Solutions, too.  It is a Scottish Government scheme that is legally binding and prevents creditors from taking further action against people who owe money.Set up back in  by the Scottish Government, the scheme allows people to freeze interest and charges on their debts and pay their debts off interest-free over a longer period of time.  This brings payments down to levels that people can afford and gives people the chance to get their lives back on track.  Interest and charges are simply written off.Apart from reducing debt, one of the best things about the DAS scheme is that it protects people from their creditors but is not a form of insolvency: people get to pay back their debt in an affordable way.  Lenders like the scheme because they know they will eventually get their money back – and borrowers like it because they don’t have to pay interest charges and they get longer to pay their debts off.  It’s a case of everyone wins.There’s plenty of information about the Debt Arrangement Scheme online at  www.aib.gov.uk debt-arrangement-scheme.  Thousands of people have used the scheme, but so many

the one-off match was played in a good spirit, but it was the Pupils who found their ruthless streak to snatch a win in the closing minutes.Rhu, fielding a team with plenty of height and energy, featuring several former youth players from Dumbarton FC # and former teammates of Pupils’ playmaker Donald McCallum # threatened early on.At the other end, though, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils had first-half chances, with Scott Souden and youngster Calum McKillop both having one-on-one opportunities, but their efforts were stopped by the Rhu keeper.The second half exploded into le on the hour mark as former Sons youth Callum Scott made his mark for Rhu, turning inside his marker to curl a classy left-footed finish beyond stand-in goalkeeper Ellis Robertson.Undeterred, the Pupils searched for an equaliser, and were given the opportunity minutes later when a Rhu handball in the box was penalised by referee Thomas d’Alessandro.John McCallum, playing as sweeper in a back three with Fraser Wylie and Ross Souden, stepped up to send the keeper the wrong way and make it -.However, after a lapse in concentration, the Pupils conceded a second goal, a cleverly guided header from a near-post corner evading Robertson in goal.Then, with the -degree heat and high humidity making the game hard work for both teams, the Feathers-sponsored Pupils rallied to equalise.A sweeping move involving midfield trio Keith Mitchell, Stuart Crossan and Donald McCallum found Scott Souden, who made no mistake when bearing down on goal, lashing a right-foot shot past the Rhu keeper, to the delight of his teammates and the clutch of Campbeltonians making the long journey to spectate.Then, in the dying seconds, after seeing shots blocked at their own end, thanks to some vital interventions from Robertson, the Pupils stole a winner when midfield substitute Finn Scott was teed up by Scott Souden to slot the ball home low beyond the Rhu keeper, ensuring the visitors completed pre-season unbeaten.Pupils manager Campbell Robertson said: ‘The conditions were tough, but the boys played really well, and our shape was good too. We would like to thank Rhu Amateurs for their excellent post-match hospitality.’Meanwhile, the Pupils’ centenary season officially starts tomorrowwhen they host Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star at Kintyre Park, in the SAFL’s aptly named Centenary Cup, with a pm kick-off.And with two more Saturday group matches to follow in August, firstly away to Dunoon and then at home to Tarbert, the Pupils will look to continue their dazzling pre-season form once the competitive action begins.Photograph:"},{"url":null,"title":"letter trying to keep everyone happy","story":"We, as the private landowners, have endeavoured throughout the years to make this historical area  as fully accessible to the general public as possible.Our use of introducing a few sheep to graze down the grass over certain months of the year is our preferred method but often, when summer visitors appear, we find the animals get frequently disturbed and distressed with human contact , and very often remove them in busy months to avoid any upset.The larger access gate is frequently left wide open, leading to constant rounding up of the livestock and  posing a danger to the passing road users, with even the odd complaint about our animals ‘deposits’  around the Footprints area coming into the equation too.Changing climate conditions have ensured that bracken and other plant species have increased in volume as every year passes and with worry about the decreasing insect population and visiting dogs perhaps being harmed by ingesting sprayed grass, we have never used any chemical solutions to help keep the undergrowth at bay.Strimming has been used on occasions  but this, too, has produced complaints from the public about the unnecessary removal of wild flowers and plants that provide food for the visiting bird and butterfly population.Sign posts are often needlessly torn down and often used to fuel beach fires and barbecues, with even the old, fragile, stone dyke surrounding the area being constantly clambered over,  rather than using the access gate, causing stones to be dislodged and even the wall being  deliberately dismantled, in order to use the stones to construct fire pits for outdoor cooking.In short, we’ve found there are never any easy answers when it comes to trying to keep everyone happy.Yours,Catherine Barbour,"},{"url":null,"title":"top artist jolomo finds inspiration on his doorstep","story":"The latest exhibition by John Lowrie Morrison, which opens on Saturdayat the Archway Gallery in Lochgilphead, concentrates on paintings of Crinan and Knapdale, landscapes found within a few miles of his Tayvallich home.Although John’s work is now sought out by collectors all over the world, he continues to exhibit every August at his #local# gallery # this will be his th solo exhibition at the Archway.

But it also offers a great opportunity for Scottish nationalists,Nicola Sturgeon has the determination to exploit it.Dominic Grieve yesterday told SkyNews that a signicant number of Tory rebels are preparing to join Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the SNP this autumn in a vote of no confidence in Boris Johnsons government,the PM tries to force a no-deal departure from the EU. They will almost certainly win this vote since Mr Johnson has a majority of only one.:Iain Macwhirter: Brexit will spur decade of change for HolyroodThe PMs controversial consiglieri, Dominic Cummings, has of course seen this coming. Hes told colleagues that the governments response to the vote of no confidence will be to force a general election ndash ldquothe people versus politicians ndash but delay the election date until after the UK has left the EU on st October. That would make a hard Brexit a fait accompli. The health minister, Matt Hancock, says it is now impossible to stop no deal.Oh no it isnt, says Dominic Grieve, a former Attorney General. In that situation, parliament will simply have to ldquoreplace the government. He is proposing a legislative coup, using parliamentary votes to wrest control from Number Ten and request another extension from Brussels. In effect, Britain could have not one, but two governments wrestling for power as the country crashes out of the European Union on Halloween.Remainers are resolute, but the Johnson administration has the power of possession. Parliament is sovereign in our system, but it is hard to see how MPs could prise Boris Johnson out of Number Ten. The idea of parliamentary officers, led by the Sergeant at Arms, ordering the Prime Minister out of his new home at sword-point is a compelling image, but it isnt going to happen.Boris Johnson controls the cabinet: a band of ultra-Brexit ministers who are under oath to carry through Brexit, ldquodo or die, on the st. They will not back down. These Branch Borisians are prepared to go the full Waco and be immolated in the flames of no dealnecessary.So, is Scotland to be consumed also  When Nicola Sturgeon talked about ldquomaterial changes in circumstances justying a second independence referendum she could scarcely have dreamed of this. A Prime Minister, defying the will of the UK parliament, dragging Scotland to disaster.The idea of waiting around for a Section  order, which will certainly be refused, now seems laughable. Nor is it going to be enough for Nicola Sturgeon to repeat vague promises of a new road map to independence sometime in the future.The demand from her party, and the independence movement, will be for resolute action by the Scottish Government to defend Scotland from what will be called a Brexit dictatorship.Increasingly, SNP supporters are asking: what would Alex Salmond do  Well, he wouldnt have started from here, thats for sure. The former SNP leader was a charismatic insurgent, a revolutionary even. He would likely have been leading those rolling independence demonstrations weve been seeing in Scotland over the past  months ndash the largest in Scottish history ndash which Nicola Sturgeon inexplicably disowned.Alex Salmond would have used them as a , Catalan-style, to launch rhetorical missiles at the Brexit government. You can almost hear him:ldquoTheresa May said now is not the time. Well, Scotland says now IS the time to stand against the Johnson Junta in Westminster. Show this Feckless Franco that Scotland will not be driven off the Brexit clf by this demeaning diktat.:Ruth Davidson warns Johnson of threat to Union after swing to YesAs Brexit day approaches he would call for Scots to take to the streets in an unprecedented show of popular resistance. The Scottish parliament would be convened in emergency session to demand a repeat referendum on independence. He would likely argue that, since parliamentary democracy has been suppressed in Westminster, it must be honoured in Scotland. Holyrood is the only parliament left with the democratic authority to hold a referendum, the mandate for which has been in place since .Of course, this could all end in tears. The latest Ashcroft poll indicates that support for independence is now over  per cent, but theres no guarantee that an unauthorised second referendum would be won. Unionists would boycott it and Number Ten would call it meaningless. However, Salmond might be content to see the result rejected peremptorily by this unpopular Tory government. If nothing , it could help win the SNP a landslide in the  elections.But this is to ride the tiger of rebellion, and Nicola Sturgeon does not favour the politics of the street. The First Ministers preference might rather be to lend SNP support to a national coalition government in Westminster, of the kind being proposed by thecolumnist, Polly Toynbee.It is of course theoretically possible for Labour, the Liberal Democrats, Tory rebels and the SNP to put together a crisis administration for the sole purpose of avoiding no deal, or revoking Article . However, it seems unlikely that this unelected national government would fly, eventhe fractious opposition parties could be persuaded to come together long enough to form one.MPs may win votes in parliament, but they do not control the civil administration, cannot table legislation and can only briefly seize the parliamentary timetable. Parliament gives authority to a government, but it cannot rule in its place. That requires a general election. Nor is it clear that Brussels is going to ride to the rescue. Ring us when you see sense, was their response to the UKs latest call to drop the Irish backstop.So, as the Brexit deadline looms, Britain is likely to be in the kind of constitutional turmoil normally associated with unstable African states. Both the Scottish and UK parliaments will be in open revolt against a Prime Minister whose authority rests solely on the strength of his own ego.Nicola Sturgeon is a cautious lawyer who does not like to live dangerously. But this promises to be the pivotal moment of her political le.

Both chats took turns for the personal, dwelling on children, having or not having them, in ways that they probably would notthe interviewee had been a man. One step forward for the caring, sharing society, two steps back for feminism: discuss.John McDonnell, the Shadow Chancellor, had his own show-stopping routine.

Other views were available, he added.Too right they are. In its manesto for the  General Election the party said it would not support indyref. The Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard, on the rare occasions he surfaces to give an interview, has repeated the assertion. The UK leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has done a Brexit on the matter, saying he will make up his mindand when a request was made. Opposing another referendum is not a whim, it is a central pillar of Scottish Labourrsquos pitch to the people, one that Mr McDonnell smashed with a wrecking ball.Whether he acted initially from ignorance, carelessness, or both, he doubled down on his position yesterday, leaving the party in Scotland looking even weaker and more irrelevant. This is worse than being treated like a branch office. Scottish Labour now looks like the unpaid intern to Labour in London, hanging around waiting for a chance to make the tea.: McDonnell ignores LeonardThere is another explanation for his less than soft shoe shuffle into Scottish political territory. He is not the only one trying to make new friends ahead of the great September showdown in the Commons. While Mr McDonnell was speaking in Edinburgh, the First Minister was in Glasgow telling an audience that ldquosome kind of progressive alliance between the SNP and Labour to lock the Tories out of Government would not be the worst idea that she had ever heard.The Scottish Tories have been gleeful, seeing this as a chance to haul out those old posters of Ed Miliband in the pocket of Alex Salmond and get busy Photoshopping. That any deal would be received badly in south of the border was clear from the headline in the English edition of the Daily Mail, which went for ldquoLabour gets into bed with the SNP, while the Scottish edition plumped for ldquoIrsquod help Corbyn get keys to No , admits Sturgeon.: Bank chief warns of Brexit painFrom Ms Sturgeonrsquos side, a deal with Labour would be a certain path to another independence referendum, particularly tempting in the wake of the Ashcroft poll showing : in favour of Yes,not to her then to many in the partyrsquos increasingly impatient ranks.Any SNP-Labour alliance would destroy the Labour Party in Scotland. While that might seem to opponents to be merely hastening a process already underway, or even just punishment for past misdemeanours and arrogance, they should be careful what they wish for. As many a non-Brexit related issue shows, whether it be in the building of a childrenrsquos hospital or exam results, the last thing this Scottish Government, any Scottish Government, needs is less scrutiny.Having a Scottish party propping up a UK government also takes us into choppy constitutional waters. It is clear after the votes on abortion and same sex marriage in Northern Ireland that the SNP takes a more casual approach to voting on devolved matters than previously stated. Even so, how soon would it be before a Labour Government asked for help above and beyond supply and confidence, say  Having bent its own principles once, would the SNP be tempted to be flexible again  Looking at it from another direction, would the SNP really vote down a Labour Government Not for the first time, politicians, in Scotland and further afield, need to acquire a sense of perspective, fast, as the Brexit deadline looms. The sense of disillusionment among the electorate with politics and its practitioners is palpable. To watch Mr McDonnell and Ms Sturgeon engage in megaphone diplomacy with each other is hardly dignied and may ultimately prove to be premature and unwise.: Labour accused of betrayalWith no hope of cool heads in Downing Street as a no deal Brexit looms, it is up to others to make the best of a possibly calamitous situation. Labour and the SNP have parts to play in that, but so do other iniduals and parties.

This is according to new academic research from Penn State University in the United States, but I have scientically checked the results with my male friends and colleagues and found that some of them do indeed feel this way about reusable bags.:Mark Smith: I know there are gay footballers in Scotland because I tried to convince one to go publicThey also feel the same way about other things too ndash in fact, it turns out there are quite a few apparently un-masculine activities that some men would avoid doing unless they could be  per cent sure that no other human, male or female, could see them. This includes, but is not limited to, spiralising vegetables, wearing lycra shorts, watching a film that has Bette Midler in it, watching a film that does not have Mark Wahlberg in it, and ironing with the curtains open. Invisibly, some men ndash and presumably some women looking at men ndash are applying this test to everything: is what Irsquom doing man or non-man, girly or non-girly This obviously applies to the subject of crying as well. A few days ago, I was speaking to the historian and writer Alistair Moffat about his new book, To The Island of Tides, and he told me about a little incident in his le that has stuck in my headAlistair was walking on his farm in the Borders with his young granddaughter Grace when they spotted a plane overhead, its undercarriage lit by the low sun. Little Grace looked up at the plane and waved at it and there was something about her action that moved her grandfather to tears.I asked Alistair was it was about that moment that got to him and he wasnrsquot sure. Perhaps, he said, it was something about his granddaughterrsquos innocence or the dference in scale between the tiny toddler and the huge machine in the sky, but what was particularly interesting was what Alistair said about crying more generally. It had taken him a long time to learn how to do it, he said. He grew up on a council estate. He played rugby for Kelso. He was a boy. If you cried, you were told to stop.ldquoJessie was the word that was used, he said. ldquoStop bubbling, yoursquore being a jessie. But you have to unlearn it. You shouldnrsquot choke things down or stle them.I agree with Alistair and have always worried about the influence words like jessiehave had, and continue to have, over Scottish men. Children are taught by the people who stand by their cribs and at the front of their classrooms, consciously or unconsciously, that crying is feminine and that remaining dry-eyed is masculine and, later in le, boys and men apply that test to every other activity. If something is judged masculine, itrsquos ok judged feminine, it is to be avoided. Itrsquos the unwritten legislation of masculinity with words like ldquojessie used as punishments to keep the men in line.:Mark Smith: The problem with Scotlandrsquos private schools, by someone who went to oneYou can even see this attitude in areas of le that, at first, look more positive. You may, for example, have seen a TV advert recently that features make-up for men. This is surely a good sign isnrsquot it  If some men are using concealer on their spots, then surely wersquore becoming more relaxed about gender stereotypes But no. The makers of the advert over-compensated by featuring a muscular, heavily tattooed man who is definitely not gay okay  The only thing missing from the advert was a girlfriend, a woman, definitely a woman, that he could turn round and kiss after applying powder to his face. The name of the brand is also proof that the old stereotypes are alive ndash this isnrsquot make-up, man, itrsquos War Paint.Sadly, all of this super-masculine nonsense ndash and more ndash applies in Scotland, in pubs, offices, stadiums, and particularly in politics. For years, Scotlandrsquos first minister was Alex Salmond, that alpha among alphas, but take a look too at some of the hyper-masculine language thatrsquos used in the arguments for independence. Take back our freedom! Smash the union! Be brave Scotland! Donrsquot be a jessie Scotland! The results of the  referendum also seem to show, unsurprisingly, that a campaign led by an alpha male and expressed in masculine language is more likely to attract men than women ndash  per cent of men voted yes in , but  per cent of women voted no.Nicola Sturgeon is probably aware she needs to change all of this and readjust the messageshe is to attract more women to her cause, but so far shersquos been unable, or unwilling, to do so. The other problem is that the ways many Scottish men have learned to behaveare hard to change. Those old male traits, the fear of looking feminine, the fear of carrying a reusable shopping bag, are deep down in the subcutaneous layers of their personalities. Good luck with trying to sht them.Perhaps there are a few men who are immune to it all, but not me. Like Alistair Moffat, I was often told as a child to stop crying like a girl, and Irsquove struggled to ignore the advice ever since.But I cry. I cried at the death of my cat Harry, and his brother Samuel. I cried when I read a poem to my friend Elaine at her wedding, and when a Spitfire pilot in his s told me about his experiences in the Battle of Britain. I also cry when Christopher Plummer sings Edelweiss in The Sound of Music and when Tom Baker regenerates in his last episode of Doctor Who.You can call all of that, or some of it, sillyyou like. You can even call me a jessie. But my response would be: I will do my best to resist. I will try to unlearn what Scotland taught me. I will spiralise vegetables. I will use my bag-for-le."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-labour-no-longer-stands-scotland","story":"I am a Scot and a European and I am an internationalist. One of the things internationalism needs is nations.No member of the SNP requires lessons on internationalism from the Labour Party in Scotland, which was founded on the back of a claim for Scottish independence and which has betrayed its claim to internationalism by Tony Blairs wars and its insular protectionism over Europe and now its failure to unequivocally seek to claw down Boris Johnsons dangerous Government with his obvious desire to enrich tax haven friendsat the expense of the British economy.There was a time when I would have been proud to be British but that has long gone, buried in the current English xenophobia and the failure of too many English politicians to realise that \"English\" and \"British\" are not synonyms.There was a time when Labour politicians stood up for the people of Scotland. Now they support Tory Unionism. I can understand the Tory Party in Scotland. Wallace, Bruce and our Thrie Estaitis found out that guile and gold can always buy its portion of the vote. There is, however, no excuse for the Scottish Labour Party, except to assume that its leaders have succumbed to the same venal ambitions as their Tory pals.KM Campbell, Doune.I HAVE just watched a TV clip of the wretched Richard Leonard, leader of the Labour Party in Scotland, relating how he explained to John McDonnell that the people of Scotland do not want a second independence referendum and how the SNP had promised that the first independence referendum would be a \"once in a generation\" event. This is two days after Lord Ashworths poll had indicated that a majority of Scottish voters now favoured independence and this is the same Richard Leonard who, when asked how he would vote in the event of a second EU referendum, replied that he would vote Remain but that he would not campaign for a second EU referendum as he had no right to seek to overturn \"the will of the people\". That from a member of the Scottish Parliament, elected to represent the people of Scotland who had voted overwhelmingly to remain.Nobody should be pigeon-holed on account of their accent or birthplace but his reference to \"the will of the people\" suggests that Mr Leonard, unlike myself and countless others, feels no sense of Scottish nationality. As for the \"once in a generation\" quote ndash that was one remark plucked from thousands of discussions during the referendum campaign by opponents of independence and was never presented as a policy statement by anyone on behalf of the SNP or any other organisation. I dont remember seeing any reference on the ballot paper to a \"once in a generation\" referendum.Willie Maclean, Milngavie.WE live in a political age of deliberate ambiguity or more bluntly politicians lying, obfuscating or changing their principles on a Groucho Marx basis ndash \"If my principles dont support my arguments I have others\".We have Scottish Labour working for a second Brexit referendum but opposing a second independence referendum. In a quiet news period John McDonnell stating the obvious about a democratic majority leading to a second referendum makes headlines . The squirming of Ian Murray MPtrying to justy this Janus approach in interviews would make it to comedy on the Fringe.Ruth Davidson has already conceded this mandate for a second independence referendum when she said in June: \"If she [Nicola Sturgeon] puts it in a manesto that shes going to hold another referendum and she wins a majority outright, then she can negotiate with the UK Government in the same way as happened last time.\" Ms Davidsons response to Wednesdays news about Labour supporting her position was that she \"will always stand up for the United Kingdom\". That may play well with ultra-Unionists but less so with the majority of Scottish Conservatives who put Scotlands best interests first but also conclude Scotland benefits most by progressive devolution within the UK.What is apparent is that Scottish branches of both Labour and Conservatives are on a dferent page to their federal organisations and on a path to their own independence. That can only be good for Scotland.James Robb, Helensburgh.IS there room, one must wonder, for another spineless politician or two in Nicola Sturgeonrsquos back pocket  She has already the hapless and obedient Patrick Harvie resident there, but I am sure John McDonnell and Jeremy Corbyn could be squeezed inshe tried.I am thankful my staunchly Labour and long-dead father did not live to see this day.Alexander McKay, Edinburgh EH.COUNCILLOR Alasdair Rankinrsquos letterhelps to highlight the plight of the less well-off in society, who as Cllr Rankin highlighted, pay taxes in ious ways including  per cent VAT. For low earners this VAT represents a much greater burden on their lower incomes than those with much more disposable wealth. The Scottish Government in introducing \"progressive taxation\" is clearly aiming to tackle the disproportionate burden on the lowest earners by asking higher earners to pay a little more. Progressive taxation is the only way forward for any society aiming to become a socially just society.Catriona C Clark, Falkirk.SCANNING the anti-independence correspondence in these Brexit days and months Irsquom a wee bitty confused.Now my late, very late, history teacher made us consider then categorise the reigns of past kings and queens as ldquoGood or Bad Things. So, when in  we were told thatwe voted Yes to independence then we would be thrown out of Europe that would be a ldquoBad Thing. Now that we are being dragged out of Europe despite having voted  per cent Remain we are told independence and being a member of the EU is a ldquoBad Thing.So herersquos my problem: Scotland out of the EU, \"Bad Thing, Scotland in Europe ldquoBad Thing.

Internal features such as stone benches have also been found along either side.The hall is oriented towards the sea and finds include steatite , pottery, a bone spindle whorl and a fragment of a Norse bone comb.The find provides tantalising evidence of the earliest phases of inhabitation on this farm and settlement mound which may well have been inhabitated for over , years.It provides another piece to the ,-year jigsaw along this archaelogy rich stretch of coast as Westness in Rousay — described as the #Egypt of the North#.A team of archaeologists from the University of the Highlands and Islands Archaeology Institute, Rousay residents and students have been digging at the site for a number of years, investigating the later stages of the farm complex and its waste heaps with a particular focus on past diet, farming and fishing practices.Although only partly uncovered at this stage, the Skaill hall has parallels with other Norse halls excavated in Orkney, such as Snusgar, and where in Scotland.The excavation is part of the Landscapes of Change — Archaeologies of the Rousay Clearances and Westness Estate project which is exploring the Skaill farmstead.The present farm at Skaill dates to the th and th centuries and was part of the Rousay clearances during the mid-th century.The name Skaill suggests the site was home to a Norse hall or drinking hall, and was a high status site.Westness is mentioned in Orkneyinga saga as the home of Sigurd, a powerful chieftain, so it was always likely that a Norse settlement was located somewhere at Skaill.Earlier structures have been found below the present farm during previous seasons, and this season explored more of the Norse phases of the site.Three dimensional models of the farmstead can be found here.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Striking the balance between conservation, farming and hunting can be dficult. Our goal is to give farmers and crofters the tools they need to safeguard their crops, enabling them to control goose numbers sustainably, and sell goose meat for profit.”Until now, meat generated by the Orkney resident greylag goose project could only be sold locally by retailers based on Orkney.SNH is working to secure longer-term arrangements for the sale of resident greylag goose meat in Scotland.

Understandably, she declared there was “growing urgency” for Scotland to become independent because it faced being “dragged down a political path we don’t want to go”.Cue much licking of SNP lips at thoughts of a No Deal disaster, sweeping gains at a General Election as Scottish Labour’s tailspin turns into a screaming e, victory in a second independence vote next year and,the last prospectus was anything to go by, the  Scottish parliament elections to be for the first independent Scottish legislature. But some pro-independence commentators have begun to question the assumption that Boris Johnson is a gt and a No Deal departure will be the best precursor to separation. It is unquestionably true that the SNP does not want a No Deal exit, but then neither does the UK government, but is a soft Brexit like that agreed by ex-Prime Minister Theresa May really a path Ms Sturgeon doesn’t want to do down For the SNP, it could be the best of both worlds: it would still be Brexit, so Scotland will have been “dragged out the EU against its will” but with customs and regulations aligned the UK would have to play by EU rules over which it had no control. Under those circumstances the SNP would argue an independent Scotland back in the EU would give Scotland a say and with no adverse effect on rUK trade.No Deal is the reverse, where an independent Scotland going back into the EU would mean trade barriers, virtual or otherwise, where none currently exist because automatic harmonisation will have ended and the Irish question becomes the Scottish question. With four times as much Scottish trade going to the rest of the UK than to Europe, whatever the economic impact of the UK leaving the EU it would be four times as greatScotland left the UK.These febrile times are leading to a loss of grip and perspective, like Labour’s John McDonnell who promised yesterday that Labour would let the Scottish parliament decide whether there should be a second independence referendum, which it already has, even referring to Westminster as the “English parliament”. In one-garrulous Fringe chat show, Scottish Labour’s election pledge is now for Indyref , much to the dismay of Edinburgh South MP Ian Murray.Even in the parliamentary recess, the momentum towards an autumn election is accelerating because with no sign of European willingness to renegotiate the alternatives are a new parliament and a change of government or a No Deal departure on October .With his working majority down to one, the chances of a No Confidence vote when Westminster reconvenes in September are high, but Mr Johnson is not compelled to call an election and instead has  days to demonstrate he can form a new government which commands a majority. Onlythat fails must an election be called, so it is not unfeasible for an election to be after October  by which time the UK will have left the EU without a deal.The Conservative position of honouring the results of the  and  referenda and opposing re-runs of both has the benefit of consistency and for the sake of the Union Scottish Conservatives have no alternative but to get right behind the UK government and be ready for November .

Oryou are a bloke who is beginning to see that paunch appear or get even bigger, then the next  words will help. No diet tips, no get a six-pack in four weeks, mind you. One simple change in drinking habits and how rehydration can help manage that tummy. Here goes.Two weeks ago, I needed help with my garden. So, a neighbour offered to come help. It was a hot day with the sun burning down from the sky. We started to weed and weed and weed. You get the kind of gardening it was. No simple pruning of a few roses. No, manual and back bending throughout. After about an hour, my neighbour – let’s call him Bob, to protect his anonymity – declared he needed a break. He had brought a small bag and had asked me to put it in the fridge upon his arrival. I’ll have a beer, he stated.Beer  At am  I was questioning this in my head, when I retrieved his liquid lunch from the fridge. Opening up the bag, I was surprised to see three cans of non-alcoholic beer. I gave “Bob” a can and he downed it in jig time. I had a can of diet cola. As we continued the garden clean up, I asked him about the non alcoholic beer gig. It seems Bob liked a beer, but his doctor was now of the opinion that too many were killing him. So, he had switched to non-alcoholic. And the best bit – they actually had decent health benefits.: Fewer than a fth of Scots aware of ‘safe’ alcohol limitsFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereThe first one is obvious from its name. No alcohol. As we know alcohol has dferent effects on people. Some are happy, some are angry, some are depressed. But, the main effect is impairment. Guzzling a couple of cans of beer by lunchtime starts the body on a slippery slope. So, non-alcoholic beer cuts out the “electric soup” effect of the beer. That makes sense.But, what other benefits could drinking this potion bring to my body and yours In short, calories, calories, calories. This is possibly the primary effect of drinking full strength, alcoholic beer. It is packed with belly-busting, muffin-top-moulding calories that pile on quickly and take an age to sht. Yes, one of the major benefits of alcohol-free beer versus standard ale and lager is that it contains fewer calories than its alcoholic equivalent, which makes it less fattening. This is because pure alcohol contains  calories per unit . A pint of % ABV beer contains  calories from the alcohol alone. However, while alcohol-free beer is lower in calories than alcoholic beer, it’s not completely calorie-free. A typical ml can of alcohol-free beer will give you about - calories. A big dference to your waistband potential.Then, there are other benefits of drinking non-alcoholic beer that I had no idea about. The primary purpose of drinking anything is to stay alive and keep hydrated. And guess what, the non-alcoholic stuff is pretty good for that.Good news as Bob had three or four hours of work in the sun to do. Many non-alcoholic beers are also isotonic. An isotonic drink is one that contains similar sugar levels to the human body – that’s -g per ml. This similar ‘osmotic pressure’ to the bodily fluids means the hydration happens more quickly and the energy is turned into fuel for the body – and some non-alcoholic beers contain just the right balance.Next up, are benefits that I had no idea could come from drinking ‘booze’ with, well, no actual booze in it. It seems that non-alcoholic beer can reduce the risk of heart disease. Studies have shown that this fluid can improve the circulation of blood around the body. This in turn puts less pressure on your heart reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease like heart attacks. Good news. And there’s more. One study found that phenols in beer, organic compounds, help reduce the risk of atherosclerosis, where the arteries become clogged with plaque. And while I’m not suggesting that drinking non-alcoholic beer cures this, every little bit helps right So far so good, but many cynics will question what is the point of drinking this when a diet soda may do the same  Well you can now tell them that diet soda will not pump up your dopamine levels. Regular beer contains alcohol which does increase dopamine levels. However, a study has shown that non-alcoholic beers can also boost your dopamine levels as you associate it with the real true brew. So, a feeling of reward, but without the negative side effects of full strength beer. I could now see the logic in what Bob’s doctor was trying to achieve.Since my day spent in the garden with Bob, I have cut out diet sodas and now have a non-alcoholic beer instead. And the range and tastes are awesome. I feel I am getting all the benefits from it and, of course, now feel a little smug. That will probably be the dopamine.There you have it in black and white folks. Why not introduce some non-alcoholic beers into the fridge and see how they go down. One thing is for sure. Replacing the strong stuff for these will help reduce that waistline and you won’t wake up with a hangover.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"citizen campaign reveals artist s new short film there s no edinburgh in the festival","story":"An Edinburgh-based artist and filmmaker was commissioned to create the film, which claims the Fringe has nothing to do with its residents and describes the prospect of a day at the event as ldquoeconomically absurd to many of them.Backed by author Irvine Welsh, Bonnie Prince Bobrsquos film - entitled Theres no Edinburgh in the Festival - claims the Fringe has gone from being ldquoa genuine anarchic bohemian bonanza to a ldquobattleground for big business dominated by corporate slogans and sponsorship.The six-and-a-half-minute-long film, which was entirely funded by the new Citizen campaign, was made during the first week of the ldquoannual occupation of the Fringe.It bemoans giving over public space to ldquoliquid lounges staffed by ldquoexploited musical theatre cadets and pop-up food stalls he says are more suited to Wimbledon.It describes how the city centre has been ldquotransformed into a citadel of wealth and brands the Old Town as ldquoa gaudy theme park where tourists taking a break from Harry Potter tours will happily pay £ for a coffee and a flapjack.The filmmaker turns his fire on the city council, accusing it of being ldquocomplicit in the wholescale destruction of Edinburgh and embarking on ldquoacute class cleansing and rampant gentrication.Introducing the film from Bristo Square, he says: ldquoTherersquos nothing funny about the Festival. Here we are again at the worldrsquos biggest annual PR exercise.

The goodwill for such agreements was there, she added.It is easy to see the appeal of such agreements for those voters who believe that Brexit – especially the no-deal iety now envisaged by the Prime Minister – represents a catastrophic act of self-harm. If Swinson and the leaders of other avowedly anti-Brexit parties could reach agreements in key constituencies across the UK to stand only the candidate with the greatest chance of winning then, surely, the chances of the Johnson project being stopped in its tracks would be greatly enhanced.There are just one or two small hurdles in the way…The first of these is the fact that, although speculation runs feverishly, Johnson has not yet called a general election.It’s certainly true that many Conservative Party MPs would like the new PM to capitalise on a boost in the polls to try to increase their numbers at Westminster, but others believe this might be a risky strategy. If Nigel Farage’s Brexit Partysplits the right-wing Eurosceptic vote, then a snap election could bring the Johnson premiership to a sudden end.But let us imagine that Johnson goes down the general election route before the current Brexit deadline of  October and that Swinson sets about trying to build an anti-Brexit coalition. She might have been able to persuade Plaid and the Greens to step aside in a single by-election, but would these parties really be so keen to lay down their electoral chances across the country  Would they risk, by seeing their overall votes in a general election diminish severely, becoming less politically relevant And what about the SNP, every bit as opposed to Brexit as the Lib Dems  There are fewer seats in Scotland where anti-Brexit parties risk splitting the vote than there are in England, but one of them – East Dunbartonshire – is Swinson’s own.Swinson served as MP for that constituency between - and was then defeated by the SNP’s John Nicolson. She took the seat back in , largely, I suspect because of Nicolson’s unpopularity. But with a more impressive candidate, the SNP would surely have a fighting chance of snatching it back. The removal of the leader of the Liberal Democrats from the House of Commons would represent quite a scalp for the nationalists. Can you imagine Nicola Sturgeon passing up the opportunity to see off Swinson  I can’t. And nor would I blame the SNP leader for committing signicant resources to bringing down Swinson. Politics is a contact sport and Swinson is a major target. The suggestion from her that the SNP should give her a clear run at the seat would, rightly, be met with derision.Jo Swinson is not the only party leader now talking about pacts. Brexit Party leader Farage has raised the prospect of deals with the Conservatives, particularly in the north of England, to ensure the election of Eurosceptic MPs.Given the result of the  referendum, any such agreements would surely guarantee the evisceration of any anti-Brexit candidates in those areas.Yes, electoral pacts might be made to work for pro-EU parties but they could just as easily be the secret of Brexiteer success.Those now clamouring for agreements to be struck between the Lib Dems and other parties which take the same position on EU membership should, I think, be careful that they are not wishing for the creation of two-horse races in key constituencies across the country. That scenario would risk strengthening rather than weakening the Brexiteers’ squad at Westminster.Johnson is supported by a team in government that is fully committed to Brexit by  October at any cost. The PM will gladly sacrice the best interests of the UK economy to protect himself.This being so, and with Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour still embarrassingly weak on the matter of Brexit, the idea that the Johnson project might be stopped is an appealing one to those of us who would dearly like to see Brexit cancelled at this late stage.But I fear that any plan to run a single anti-Brexit candidate in a constituency would be met with a plan to run a single pro-Brexit candidate. Jiggery-pokery would be fought with jiggery-pokery.It is abundantly clear that Brexiteers won the  referendum with a campaign strewn with lies. Their promises of an effortless, painless departure from the EU have long since been exposed.But rather than turning against campaign leaders, pro-Brexit voters appear to be hardening their positions and cheering on a damaging no-deal departure.It may now be obvious that Brexit is going to be dficult to deliver. But stopping it will be harder still.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish labour slam john mcdonnell s referendum claim party won t block indyref2","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...It also calls for \"urgent engagement\" between the UK party leadership and the party in Scotland.Read more: Labour-backed referendum would contain \"third\" federal optionThe Scottish Government needs permission from Westminster to stage a second vote on leaving the UK.

But the HebCelt remains, steadfast and loyal in the face of changing fashions and changing economic demands.Without the Celtic element, it#s doubtful it would have been able to survive, but as it is it offers something unique in the Scottish music events calendar # both in the kind of acts on show and the setting, with a floodlit Lews Castle over-looking the main site, giving it an ambience all of its own.With up to  acts on show, performing from early afternoon to late at night, it once again provided a veritable feast of Celtic and traditional music. Now some may quibble that the music of KT Tunstall, the headline act, is not Celtic in nature # more pop-rock maybe # but the LA-based singer-songwriter is most certainly Scottish. And she got married in Skye, so that#s enough.Maybe the biggest testament to this year#s festival is that the internationally-renown performer, with a string of hits and albums to her name, did not steal the show as you might expect.Instead the talk of the tent was on the performances from the likes of Elephant Sessions the country and western outfit of The Shires # always likely to prove a hit at an island event # and west coast favourites Manran and Tide Lines.And, of course, there#s the strange phenomenon that is Peat n Diesel, three unassuming local characters whose tongue-in-cheek lyrics # like #Calum Dan and his Transit van# # have captured a mass following, particularly among the youth. They were first scheduled to play in the small acoustics before the hordes of disappointed followers, who were simply unable to get near, persuaded the festival organisers to give them a last-minute billing on the main stage. It was again a hoot, and maybe it#s true after all that #that#s the way we do it in the Western Isles#.But perhaps the real beauty of the HebCelt is that it is about far more than what happens at the main site. From Wednesday to Saturday the town was alive every night into the small hours of the morning. No doubt bar and hotel staff were exhausted in the aftermath, but rather delighted in the sharp spike in takings.The truth is that, while tourist numbers coming to the island are on the rise, the local economy is not performing great. Jobs are scarce, depopulation of the more rural communities re. So the estimated £ million that the HebCelt generates is more than welcome, as well as providing a brief respite from reality and a sense of something major happening on the doorstep. But just like the visit of old friends tends to be too brief, so there is already a longing for next July."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/kyle-trust.jpg","title":"building local legacies for future","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineWhile many people are content to lobby politicians or just wait for the Government to loosen its purse strings, there are communities throughout Skye and Lochalsh who are just getting on with things and achieving remarkable results with very little acknowledgement outside of their local area.These heroic and unsung organisations are the community trusts which galvanise local ideas, ambition and volunteer spirit to take big capital projects from concept through planning and fund-raising to construction and realisation of local dreams. The results are projects which genuinely improve the lives of today#s residents # as well as visitors # and leave a legacy for future generations. What is even more remarkable is the fact these projects are achieved with very little access to loans. The good work of the community trusts is achieved through dogged determination to raise funds within the community combined with seriously clever navigation of the minefield of grant applications. By steadily securing the funds from a myriad public pots and local activities the trusts ensure each project is not only affordable now, but sustainable for generations to come.In Staffin # home to the iconic Old Man of Storr # the local community trust has raised over £, to upgrade existing footpaths and create new ones. There will be new parking, #welcome# structures and interpretation boards at all sites. The whole project will result in what the trust is calling #Skye Ecomuseum# which will encourage visitors to spend more time and therefore more money in Staffin.In the north west of Skye, the Glendale Trust covers a huge area that attracts , visitors a year # many travelling the long and winding single track road to the top five hotspot of Neist Point.The trust, under the leadership of Tim Hunter-Davies and three new directors, is working hard to develop sustainable facilities for the community and tourists. They have taken ownership of Meanish Pier and the foreshore, creating opportunities for local residents and regional businesses alike. It will be run commercially and provide income to enable the Trust to invest in further sustainable community projects.Glendale # which was the subject of Scotland#s first community buyout back in  # is rich in history and the trust is also looking to develop projects that preserve and share the story of the area, as Tim Hunter-Davies explains: #As well as being instrumental in land reform in the last century, Glendale has a rich heritage stretching back through the centuries. A steamer used to sail daily from Loch Dunvegan and was used as a point to transport many people away from Scotland during the Highland clearances. We want to preserve and share our history with the community and visitors.#In south Skye is the Sleat Community Trust. It has been working hard to provide and improve leline services for the community that also benefit visitors arriving and leaving Skye on the Armadale Mallaig ferry.The SCT currently provides shop, post office and fuel services in two buildings no longer fit for purpose. Over £, has been raised from public and private sources to build a new shop with a community #social# space and offices for the employees of the Trust. They hope to open the new shop in early summer .In addition, the purchase by the Trust of the -hectare Tormore Forest in  continues to create additional sources of income, including selling housing plots as well as an attraction for the community and visitors alike. As trust business development manager Mike Shucksmith explains, the success is based on a combination of commercial and voluntary activity.He said: #To maintain the forest, we have to generate income so we sell split logs to the community, create woodchip for biomass boilers and are developing a micro-hydro scheme. At the same time, we have a vibrant volunteer culture in Sleat who have created a network of paths, social areas and a polytunnel where local school children can help grow saplings to regenerate the forest. The trust also operates #Skyenet # a community broadband network # a community transport scheme, Tormore Explore Forest School and the Visit Sleat tourism group, which promotes the area as a destination of choice for visitors.#From the Sleat Peninsula to the gateway to Skye in the south where a new access route to the island is being created by the members of the Broadford and Strath Community Company. They are developing a cycle path all the way from Kyle of Lochalsh to Broadford. One of the project pioneers is keen local cyclist, Andy Neison.#I used to commute from Teangue on Sleat to Kyle by bike,# he said. #I was really unnerved by the road from Breakish to Kyle with a high volume of fast-moving traffic. When friends told me about the old road from Broadford to Kyle I started exploring sections of it. It#s a good starting point and will become a pioneer project for the highlands.#After receiving a grant of £, from Sustrans, a sustainable transport charity, to fund engineering and traffic surveys, the Trust is now working to secure funding for a project officer to take the Skye Cycleway to the next phase. The community is heavily invested in the project with volunteers coming out in all weathers to clear sections of the old road, but this is a long-term project with hundreds of thousands of pounds ultimately needed to complete the full route from Kyle to Broadford.Over the Skye bridge, the Kyle and Lochalsh Community Trust is creating a vast community and visitor experience on a piece of land known as the Plock.Securing funding from the Scottish Land Fund enabled the Trust to take ownership of the Plock and the old Skye Bridge toll office and develop a masterplan for these two community assets. On the Plock itself, there will be a hub building with cafe, carpark and toilets, a network of accessible paths, a #pitch and putt# course, a Viking living village, accommodation pods, a watersports centre, wildle hide and a for thrill-seekers a huge zipline across the bay.Jo Wawrzyczek of the trust expects the Plock to attract , visitors a year. #This is an ambitious project that will cost almost £million,# she said. #However, it is very important for local people and businesses as it will help to create a great community space as well as keep visitors in our community for longer.#The trust also owns and manages the public toilets and pontoons in Kyle which will be a source of income for the project. With the aim of making the project self-sustaining, the Trust plans to lease the café and watersports centre on the Plock as well as generating income through the accommodation pods. Inspired by the success of other community-driven harbour developments such as Tobermory on Mull, Portree and Braes Community Trust want to maximise opportunities for local people and visitors through taking ownership of the harbour and improving facilities.The trust is currently in talks about relocating the oil tanks at the pier head which would be a breakthrough for the project and open up commercial opportunities. They are also considering a new road from the south to improve access and ert traffic away from the town centre. But according to development officer Fiona Thompson a new breakwater and pontoons will be the real game-changer for Portree.She said: #There have been aspirations for improvements to facilities at the harbour for over  years with little major investment.The harbour group are now closer than ever to realizing the community#s vision for a new, vibrant, welcoming port. A breakwater will allow us to provide overnight berths and efficient, comfortable transfer for cruise ship passengers, while a visitor centre will provide a warm highland welcome to visitors from across the globe. This project will be transformational for Portree and surrounding areas.#The community trusts of Skye and Lochalsh all have several features in common. They have vision, ambition, energy and drive and they are full of volunteers who are committed to bringing long-term projects to fruition for the benefit of their community # and their visitors # for decades to come."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Skye-Bridge-2018-winners.jpg","title":"skye bridge 10k race to kick start kyleakin gala","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe first bridge k was held  years ago, and since  hundreds have taken on the challenge in an event which has helped raise thousands of pounds for good causes based in Kyleakin and surrounding areas.back again.Online entry — which is discounted — will be open until Friday th August, or runners can register on the morning of the race for £.

annual Féile an Phobail, the visual arts programme continues to attract record numbers through its doors at its base in St Mary’s University College.This year’s programme is packed full of exhibiting artists and groups represented throughout Ireland and worldwide through a range of mediums and topics including paintwork, sculpture and installations.Artists on display range from Aidan Monaghan, Andrew Whitson, Micheál Gallagher, acclaimed music photographer Conor Kerr and David Bell.Féile Operations and Events Co-ordinator Áine McCabe described the week-long event as “one that people don’t want to miss”.“I recently joined Féile, just after Christmas, and it’s been a baptism of fire,” she laughed. “Having been involved with Féile for many years, whether as a participant or volunteer, it’s a completely dferent ball game seeing behind the scenes and what goes in year on year to put the festival on in all its guises.“We have Deirdre Mackel and Micheál Gallagher working for months to bring together the exhibition, to bring together the dferent genres of art and it’s great to see so many repeat artists coming back. It’s really invaluable having Deirdre and Micheál onboard and it was incredible to see so much of an eclectic mix of people at the launch. Art and creativity is very much part of the foundation of Féile.”Aisling Award winner Deirdre Mackel has spent six years at the helm of the visual arts exhibition having previously become involved as an exhibitor. “I have seen the exhibition grow over the years, it’s brilliant to be a part of, to see the amount of people coming in and just taking their time to see the art works,” she said. “It just really warms my heart to see all the art up in St Mary’s.”Deirdre spoke of the amount of preparation that goes into the artistic showcase each year. “There is a lot of background work, the call that goes out for artists to display in the first instance. When you see people coming in and installing their art works it’s just magical. You really get a sense of what it means on launch night which we had last Wednesday, seeing what it means to people, to the artist it lts my spirits. Debuting artists would say ‘I’m so nervous’ and they come back year after year, the exhibition really encourages new artist development and another thing that comes out of it is a real sense of volunteering.”Deirdre continued: “Local artist Micheál Gallagher has also come on board and the team have been very much hands on deck. We have some really stand-out pieces from the West Belfast Arts Society, Richard Kelly and a focal point is always the Relatives for Justice Remembrance Quilt. We have a series of Civil Rights posters which were exhibited in the Tate Modern and now they have been brought to Féile.“We are seeing a lot of the artists coming here with their families and staying for the duration of the festival. The visual arts exhibit gains more and more momentum year on year.” The Féile Visual Arts Exhibition will be on display until Thursday, August . All are welcome to attend."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"shock at sudden passing of reds legend breslin","story":"THE local football community was plunged into mourning last night at the sudden passing of Cltonville legend Tommy Breslin at the age of .The former Reds player and manager died while on a family holiday in Spain.Breslin famously guided Cltonville to back-to-back Irish League titles in  and  and won eight trophies in a hugely successful four-year spell at Solitude.In the summer of , he was at the helm when Cltonville took on Celtic over two legs in an historic Champions League Qualier.He ed to the club on an interim basis following the departure of his successor Gerard Lyttle at the end of the  campaign while he was also a revered midfielder in his playing days at the club.Social media was awash with tributes last night as fans and rival supporters alike paid tribute to one of the game’s most affable and popular figures.Having updated their social media feeds to include a picture of their iconic former boss, Cltonville posted a statement which read: “Cltonville Football Club are devastated to this evening learn of the sudden and untimely death of Tommy Breslin.“While the club will naturally pay a fuller tribute to Tommy very soon, at the moment in time our thoughts are very much with the Breslin family circle and all of his many friends, to whom we extend our deepest sympathy.”Lyttle, who was also part of Breslin’s backroom team before taking over the Cltonville hotseat, tweeted: “Shocked and saddened to hear – one of the nicest men I’ve ever known.

The unusual detail of the thatched house with its steep roof, eaves gutter and tall chimney is unique in Northern Ireland, according to the Department for Communities.This means the house appears to the passer-by as two dwellings, each with a front door, but it is in fact a single dwelling which for most of the past century has been home to the Maccombe family.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetMurray Maccombeis the third generation of his family to live in the magnicent dwelling, which sits on a three-acre site.Speaking to the Belfast , Mr Maccombe said he has fond memories of the house going back to his early years.He said: \"My grandfather Robert Henry Maccombe bought this house around  and it has been in our family since, but the original owner was a man called Hugh McCullagh.\"At the time my grandfather bought it, it was a farmhouse but also a grocers shop hardware store and it stayed like that until  when he opened a shop separate from the house.\"I have very clear memories of visiting my grandparents and obviously living there when my father Alan took it over.\"My father passed away in  but my mother stayed on, on her own.\"I moved in with my own family in  and I will be sad to leave the house, but really it has outgrown my we and I. \"Our two daughters are away at university and the reality it the house is too large for us to upkeep, especially the gardens, but it will be a great buy for someone.\"The house is being sold for Mr Maccombe by Donnybrook Estate Agents in Derry for offers over £,.Stephen McCarron said he expects that the house will attract a lot of interest.He said: \"We are delighted to have this magnicent property on our books for sale and there has been interest shown already from people in the UK and further afield. \"It is a property steeped in history but also comes with so much potential for development and I am optimistic it will have a new owner before long.\"Further details and an appointment to view can be arranged through Donnybrook Estate Agents on   "},{"url":null,"title":"revealed five schools share the top spot in gcse league table results","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is perched above the Co Donegal village of Burt and attracts thousands of visitors every year.The fort is a powerful manestation of what remains of ancient Ireland and on a clear day, from its pinnacle, it is possible to get a glimpse of three counties-Donegal, Derry and Tyrone. The commanding and spectacular waterways of Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle lie to its west and east respectively.But, in the th Century the fort, once home to kings of old Gaelic order, was rapidly disintegrating towards extinction. It was however saved by the vision of one man who spearheaded its restoration just over  years ago.Dr Walter Bernard was born on May ,  at Newmarket, Co Cork. His father was a captain in the th Rles, a regiment of the British Army and was amongst the reinforcements that arrived in Brussels on the eve of the Battle of Waterloo in June of  but was apparently too late to take part in the famed history changing conflict.Walter became a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland in , a Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland in  and Fellow of that college in .Between - Dr Bernard served as a surgeon throughout the Crimean War attending the wounded British soldiers at Inkerman and witnessed the ravages caused by small pox and cholera. He later recalled that for every man that was shot, fty more were killed by those diseases, particularly in the notoriously harsh winters of  and .On the journey home from the Ukranian battlefields, he saved a man from drowning and was awarded with a certicate from the Royal Humane Society. Then, with his experiences of military conflict at an end, Dr Bernard landed back in Ireland and settled in Buncrana before building up a very large medical practice in Derry. He ran this surgery for over sixty years and was a prominent member of the city’s branch of the British Medical Association as well as holding many public offices throughout his career.One such appointment was to examine the quality of water in the city for Londonderry Corporation at public facilities such as the Creggan reservoirs built in stages between -, and which supplied much of the city’s domestic and industrial water needs.His experience of the waterborne disease cholera in the Crimea made him an ideal candidate for this job.Dr Bernard also addressed the Medical Society of King and Queens College of Physicians on the issuer of diphtheria in April . He cautioned the assembled medics that there was a reason why the disease was largely absent from statistics sheets.He said: “There are few diseases about which so many mistakes in diagnosis are made.”He feared the misdiagnosis rate was so high that it was almost impossible to ensure that ‘true diphtheria’ was as common in a town as reported.Dr Bernard added: “Diphtheria occurs in Londonderry, I have no doubt whatever…in my practice it has been my lot to treat many cases of this disease.”At some point in , Dr Bernard paid a visit to Grianan of Aileach and many years later in , he said of the experience: “Seventeen years ago, when this traditional and historical place was first visited by me, I found it in a very ruinous condition, and from that time I commenced to take an interest in its associations.“Year after year I witnessed further advance of its ruin, and I clearly saw thatsomething were not soon done to arrest the progress of its destruction, it would be in a few years a thing of the past.”Grianan of Aileach is a hilltop fort that sits on top of Greenan Mountain in Inishowen just over  feet above ground level.The ringfort was thought to have been built in the sixth or seventh century, although there is some evidence to suggest that the site had been in use before that.Greek astronomer and cartographer Ptolemy penned a remarkably accurate map of Ireland in  A.D. from which maps were later created in the th and th centuries. He called the land ‘Iouernia’, thought to mean ‘abundant land’ from which the Irish names Eriu and Eire are derived. Amongst two sites identied as ‘regia’ or royal places in Ireland by the Greek map maker, one of them is believed by some historians to be the Grianan of Aileach.Whether Ptolemy pinpointed it or not, the Kingdom of Aileach was indeed one of Ireland’s royal sites of the Gaelic order. The fort was thought to have been constructed originally by the northern section of the Ui Neill clan, but between  A.D. and the thirteen centuries, over  kings from ious clans, some also High Kings of Ireland, held the throne of Aileach. The last man to be known as the King of Aileach was Aed Buide Ua Neill who died in .Despite ious interpretations, it is generally agreed that Aileach means ‘stony place’ and the word Grianan means ‘sunny place’ so that Grianan of Aileach broadly translates as ‘The Stone Palace of the Sunny View’.Whatever the actual meaning of its name, it is evident that it was an extremely important place. Aileach’s political and strategic importance was such that the annals of Irish history record that it was attacked at least three times. In , Finsnechta Fledach, King of Ireland, destroyed the fort.Again, in , when Muirchertach MacNeill was king, Viking raiders sacked the site when they settled at Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle. It’s also thought that King Brian Boru came to Aileach in , but it was destroyed once more in , when another King of Munster, Muirchertach Ua Briaincame to Inishowen and plundered the region and razed the fort. The fort was laid to waste by O’Brien in revenge for O’Neill’s destruction of his royal seat at Kincora and he reportedly told his soldiers to each take a stone from the Donegal hillside so the place would be reduced to rubble.The fort itself could have served two main s both as a defensive and a ceremonial one and moreover as a settlement that was surrounded by ringforts of lesser importance. Whatever its actual , it is known that buildings of this nature were very rare in North West Ulster and its presence signies that its inhabitants were regarded as being very important.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThe linking of St Patrick to the site is seen as attempt by Christian converts to place it firmly in that tradition whilst acknowledging its pagan history and the naming of a holy well right outside the ringfort in honour of Ireland’s patron saint seems to confirm that.There is also a mythological and folklore version of the founding of Grianan of Aileach which says the ringfort was built by Dagda , a god and the king of the Tuatha De Danann-the supposed ‘Tribe of the Gods’-a supernatural race in Irish mythology. The Tuatha De Danann are said to have invaded Ireland before the Celts and built strategic stone forts on the tops of hills.Dagda was said to have fought the Second Battle of Moytirra against the Fomorians and the fort at Aileach was built over the grave of his son Aedh who had been murdered.In , a Derry based group called the Irish Irelanders, enthusiastic Gaelic revivalists travelled to the site on Sunday afternoons and carried out some repairs. But, the splendour and historical intrigue of Grianan of Aileach had largely been ignored for many years until in , Dr Walter Bernard decided to begin its restoration in earnest.In the s, painter, musician, antiquarian and archaeologist George Petrie examined Grianan of Aileach when he was head of the Royal Irish Academy’s antiquities committee which was linked to the Irish Ordnance Survey.Petrie’s findings suggested that the hill many have been enclosed by many other ramparts and a line of stones leading up to the entrance which were all gone by then.But, despite his efforts, the expert’s findings remained confined to the records of the Royal Irish Academy, there were no efforts by the organisation to attempt any restoration of the ancient site.It was Dr Bernard who took practical action beyond the analysis of the site. He paid for the entire project that took place between - and recruited his crew of labourers from the farms surrounding Burt. They ferried the materials needed for the restoration on the back up small carts up supplied by the local landowners up the incredibly steep hill.What the doctor found at the site was a disorganised mess of which he said it was: “An immense circular heap of stones, with its grey fallen masonry scattered over the interior-no vestige of a wall, entrance passage, or central building.”Remembering that Walter Bernard was a medical doctor with no detailed description of what an ancient ringfort truly looked like and that there weren’t enough stones on site to complete the job, makes this story even more remarkable.Dr Bernard discovered many animal bones on the site including sheep, cows and goats and items like sling stones and warrior’s clubs. The most interesting stone object discovered was a ‘slab of sandstone, chequered into thirty-six squares’, believed to be a games board of some type.The doctor and his crew of labourers used the measurements of other Irish forts such as Staigue Fort in Co Kerry as the comparative basis for the restoration project at Grianan of Aileach. The finished product is a fort that stands . metres in diameter and more than five metres tall with walls that are almost four metres thick.Dr Bernard later described a part of the building project by saying: “To bind our work into a complete unity we had to gather around the hill about  or  loose stones-certainly not more,so many-and to split from the adjoining rocks, cropping up through the heather,  coping stones. These are supposed to serve instead of those removed by King Murdock O’Brien in .”Only speculation can be used to assessthe interior of today’s fort accurately resembles its ancient predecessor, but when the alternative was the complete disappearance of the Iron Age construction, then surely Bernard’s efforts become even more admirable.The fort has stood for centuries as a silent witness to major events of Irish history. From the top of Grianan fort you can just make out the location of the Co Donegal village of Rathmullen on the western bank of Lough Swilly.It was from Rathmullen in  that the chieftains Hugh O’Neill and Rory O’Donnell sailed with their families after the final defeat by the English taking with them the last symbols of the old Gaelic order once enshrined in its pomp by places such as Grianan of Aileach. Behind them in the distance the old fort sat on its hilltop as a fading reminder of a society and its traditions that would never .A legend says that in a secret cave on a hill beneath Grianan O’Neill’s warriors rest in a bewitched sleep in full armour and sitting on their horses ready for the next fight. The spell, says the legend, will only be broken when the next destined leader of Ulster arrives to lead them to victory.It is a myth that would have no visible attachmentit had not been for the passion of Dr Walter Bernard in the late th century in restoring Grianan of Aileach to something approaching its former glory.A tourist road to the fort was opened on September ,  by President of Ireland Eamon De Valera who was accompanied by Fine Gael TD for Donegal West, Pat O’Donnell, then Minister for Local Government. In the early s the Office of Public Works in the Republic of Ireland carried out further repairs to Grianan of Aileacgh after a wall collapsed. But as late as October  the Irish Government was being severely criticised by political representatives in Donegal for still failing to establish tour guides and other facilities at the ancient site.In his obituary contained in the Universities and Colleges magazine of December , , it was reported that Dr Bernard died suddenly at his residence in Buncrana on eight days previously on December . He was -years-old and was buried in Derry City Cemetery.Dr Bernard’s obituary ended: “He leaves a widow. His le was deeply scarred by three great sorrows, the deaths of his three children.”CAPTION: The volunteers involved in the restoration of Grianan of Aileach pictured at its official re-opening in ."},{"url":null,"title":"derry motocross racer owes great deal air ambulance","story":"A Co. Derry motocross racer is one of many patients who are grateful for the rapid response of the Air Ambulance.Eoghan Kerlin from Dungiven was taking part in a quad motocross event in Cookstown in September  when he required medical assistance. He was out on the track and unfortunately went over a jump at the same time as another competitor and collided at speed.Eoghan came off his quad in the air, landing on his right-hand side as he attempted to clear the jump. His we Kerrie, who was at the event, immediately rang .Due to the nature of this incident and the high index of suspicion for potential injuries, the air desk paramedic who was monitoring this call spoke directly with Kerrie to gain further information. The air desk paramedic dispatched the air ambulance on the knowledge that Eoghan was badly injured and required immediate pre-hospital critical care interventions.A road ambulance was deployed and arrived shortly before the air ambulance. Eoghan had a seizure and was sedated by the HEMS team at the scene before being transferred by the air ambulance to Royal Victoria Hospital.The Dungiven man’s injuries were all down the right side and he had an open fracture in his leg, his femur was shattered, and he had broken ribs and a bruised lung.Speaking about the accident, Eoghan’s we Kerrie said: “Standing on the side-lines and watching the accident was one of the worst moments I’ve ever experience, I really thought Eoghan was going to die.“Eoghan had a seizure at the scene which was incredibly frightening but when I saw the air ambulance coming into land my anxiety reduced. Within minutes of the HEMS team arriving, all the craziness seemed to calm, and I just felt so much more at easy as the team were so professional.”As part of his recovery, Eoghan visited the air ambulance base, and the home of the Air Ambulance Northern Irelandcharity, in Lisburn to meet the team who had helped him.He updated them on his recovery, saying: “I’m still undergoing treatment for my injuries and will have to have surgery on my kneecap which has unfortunately been damaged beyond repair. But I’m here and I’m on the road to recovery and every week there is further improvement.“I owe a great deal to all of the medical professionals who helped, and continue to help, me and I’m feeling positive about the future.”Kerrie added: “As a family, we know just how important the air ambulance service is and in recognition of this, we held a fundraiser in November last year and raised £, for the charity. We wanted to extend a heartfelt thanks to every single person who contributed in any way to help.“We are forever grateful for what AANI has done for us and couldn’t imagine what the outcome may have beenthey were not available.”The charity, AANI in partnership with the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service , provides the Helicopter Emergency Medical Servicefor the region and responds to seriously ill or injured patients, seven days a week, for twelve hours a day.AANI requires £, per day to keep this vital service going, meaning £million must be raised each year.You can support the charity by joining Club AANI, an exclusive members club, for a weekly donation of £.

This impact was particularly felt in areas like here in Strabane where pride in the hunger strikers, their courage and sacrice still remains undiminished almost  years on.”The roots of what took place in  began several years earlier, when in  Belfast republican Kieran Nugent became the first man to refuse to wear a prison unorm. In , republicans had been accorded what the British termed Special Category Status recognising the political nature of their offences.By the mid-s however, political status had been withdrawn and as the cages of Long Kesh were replaced by the concrete H Blocks, the new British policy of ‘normalisation’ was wholly designed to strike any notion of political credence away from the IRA campaign.When he entered the H Blocks, Kieran Nugent was instructed to put a prison unorm on by the authorities. He answered, ‘you’ll have to nail it to my back.’ This began five years of protest inside the prison and heightened violence outside it which resulted in dozens of deaths.The blanket and no wash protests of the first four years of the prison conflict yielded no concessions on the issue of political status.The years of isolation and living in dire conditions eventually brought the situation to a head. The choice was plain and stark. The protesting republican prisoners could either concede and serve out jail sentences classed as ‘ordinary criminals’ or escalate the protest to the last ‘weapon’ available to them inside a prison-the hunger strike.It was not a new tactic for the republican movement, and it drew its inspiration from stories from the old Gaelic order.It’s recorded in the annals of Irish history that when a citizen felt slighted by the ruling order, it was not uncommon for them to lie outside their dwelling and refuse food in the hope of publicly shaming the guilty party into reparation and or an apology.In , Thomas Ashe died in Mountjoy prison in Dublin after being force fed whilst on hunger strike demanding political status. Then, in , the Lord Mayor of Cork Terence McSwiney died after  days whilst on hunger strike in Brixton jail. And, next year in  to mark the centenary of the death of McSwiney, the National Hunger Strike Commemoration will take place in Cork city.Back in , Michael Gaughan died in Parkhurst on the Isle of Wight after  days on hunger strike, and shortly before the beginning of the prison blanket and no wash protests in Long Kesh, in February , another Mayo man, Frank Stagg died at Wakefield jail in Yorkshire after  days without food.The first Long Kesh hunger strike began on October , . The protestors set out a list of five demands: -The right not to wear a prison unorm -The right not to do prison work -The right of free association with other prisoners -The right to organise their own educational and recreational facilities and -The right to one visit, one letter and one parcel a week.Seven men, including Sinn Fein MLA Raymond McCartney said they would fast to the death in the pursuit of the re-establishment of political status. Simultaneously, three female republican prisoners also embarked on a strike in Armagh jail.As Christmas  approached, the British offered a deal which appeared to agree to the central demand of the right not to wear a prison unorm. One of the hunger strikers, Sean McKenna was close to death at this stage and the strike was called off. It later emerged that was really being offered was a deal to allow prisoners to wear ‘civilian type clothing’ supplied by the prison regime. The scene was therefore already set for a second strike.It began on March ,  when Bobby Sands refused to eat. Raymond McCartney said: “Obviously everybody’s memory of  is the fact that ten people died on hunger strike.“On March ,  the British Government removed political status. I think most people thought that this was a half-hearted attempt and they’d roll over within a short period of time.“But, clearly what was emerging was a complete change in policy by the British Government who were intent on the idea of ‘normalisation’, ‘criminalisation’ and ‘Ulsterisation’.“Instinctively, any of us who found ourselves in prison at that time, knew we were political prisoners and any attempt to criminalise us just wasn’t going to work. It became a battle of wills.“But, I think by the end of the hunger strike in October, , most people looking on were saying that whatever was going on in the North that nobody in their wildest notion thought it was a criminal conspiracy. They certainly saw it as a political conflict. They may not have agreed with the armed actions of the IRA, but they certainly viewed it as a political situation.“So, for us by that stage, the process of criminalisation was in tatters. But, there was a very high price paid because  people had died in prison and  or  people had died on the streets.“Within the prisons we knew that we still had work to do because what we had to do was turn that acceptance of political imprisonment into every day conditions. By the end of the hunger strike I suppose there was a big recognition of the dference between the criminal’s unorm and our own clothes was one manestation of it. And, over the years we continued to ensure the conditions in Long Kesh reflected that.“By the late s and early s, journalists were frequent visitors to the prison and left with the overwhelming impression that we were a ‘dferent type’ of prisoner. They may have gone out and had questions about who you were and what you were about but they were in doubt that we were political prisoners. That was a big source of validation.”The intensity of the events and scale of death and destruction between  and  in retrospect now seems enormous, but Raymond McCartney maintains that it paved the way for future political developments.“It was only five years, but it was a very intense five years. It is only when you get a bit older you realise just how short a time span it was, because when you roll onto  and the Good Friday Agreement there was an acceptance of the framework that there was a political conflict which had to be resolved by political means-the recognition of political mandates, the political framework to address all these issues, but at the core of that was the acceptance of political prisoners.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“There is no doubt there is evidence that there were elements within the British Government were determined that political status should not be granted for whatever reason.“Even in , when there was internment without trial and up to , people were held in conditions where they wore their own clothes. There was a recognition of the political conflict of one nature or another.“How that was defined by dferent people is a dferent matter. I know that other people have made the observation that for too long the British tried to deal with the North as a security issue. therefore, when you have a security mentality or emergency laws, emergency courts, emergency interrogation centres, everything is changed and turned upside down.“If you follow their logic from that point of view and they say ‘you cannot now say you are political prisoners’ whilst trying to pretend that everything  about the situation isn’t political too then the penny drops in a whole lot of ways.”The almost  years since  have provoked much debate within wider nationalism about whether or not the hunger strike was harnessed as a catalyst for the republican movement to embark on the path to politics.The election of Bobby Sands to Westminster and Kieran Doherty to the Dail was followed quickly by a debate within Sinn Fein about ending their policy of abstentionism from political institutions that would lead to a split in the republican movement in . The Derry News asked Raymond McCartney for his view on this.He said: “It is interesting now, because everyone has their story about what the origins of the peace process was. But, there is absolutely no doubt that when you look back as far as  that Gerry Adams that there needed to be a political way of resolving the conflict, because military stalemate was exactly that.“The famous Glover Report from the British Army accepted that there was not going to be a military defeat, was them in their own way, saying the IRA was a political force and that the guys in Long Kesh were political prisoners. They job they were sent to do, they couldn’t do and that was to impose a military defeat and by extension their laws of oppression were not going to work either.“It made the situation painful and made the conflict last longer. Then, whenever the formula for the Good Friday Agreement was put forward, some former prisoners will tell you that it was too high a price to pay, but the core accepted it was a political problem and without political solutions it was never going to be resolved.”When the first hunger strike ended in October of , Raymond McCartney had gone without food for  days. So, what are his own personal recollections of the physical effects of what took place “I suppose when you look at that time in , Martin Hurson died after  days whilst others like Kevin Lynch were approaching  days when he died.“In a very strange way hunger strike affects dferent people in dferent ways. Even the day the hunger strike ended in , I was still walking about, I was out of bed. But, there is no doubt that your body slows down.“My ability to see was greatly affected. But, the body is a remarkable piece of equipment and resilience is obviously built in. As you get older you reflect on it and it is dficult to work out in your head that you could sustain doing without food for  days and others for  days.“I suppose when you look at that time in , Martin Hurson died after  days whilst others like Kevin Lynch were approaching  days when he died.

But, there is no doubt that your body slows down. My ability to see was greatly affected.“As you get older you reflect on it and it is dficult to work out in your head that you could sustain doing without food for  days and others for  days.”Undoubtedly, it was Margaret Thatcher more than anyone  within the British establishment at the time who demonstrated complete determination to use the protests in Long Kesh to ide and break the republican movement.Many commentators have pointed to the INLA assassination of her colleague Airey Neave in  as one reason why the British Prime Minister embarked on a path of total intransigence towards the IRA. However, Raymond McCartney believes that her thinking was a lot wider than that.“Whatever her antipathy towards Ireland was and what came with that, she was setting out a broader political stall. Look at how she treated the miner’s later on.“Reading state papers now, years after these events, her take on the miner’s strike wasn’t just a battle about conditions in the mines, it was about strategically tackling trade unions. It was a case of her saying who is the strongest union-who is the spine of the working class and acting on that.“I always remember that being in jail gives you the time to reflect and read and think and I also always remember that Bobby Sands out of all the people who had been in jail was very clear about what he was there for because he wrote it all down. Some of the things he wrote captures the way a writer works-it’s all encompassing and puts it out there in a very vivid way.“I had previously been interned, I had an understanding about what being a political prisoner was. You had your own clothes and a bit of freedom to associate with other prisoners and you didn’t feel that sense of captivity although you were locked up. Bobby Sands caught on very early that the British were trying to defeat us in the prisons. It wasn’t just about trying to give you a hard time or denying you your own clothes, it was that they had a core idea to break us.“One of the rewarding things for me personally was that the system we had in the end in jail was one based on equality. That we treated people as equals. If you couldn’t treat the person beside you as a comrade and an equal that you couldn’t expect anyone  to believe that you’d treat all people as equals as you went on through le.”Those wishing to attend the th National Hunger Strike Commemoration are asked to assemble on Sunday, August  at .pm at the Diamond in Lford before marching across the border into Strabane where Martina Anderson MEP will deliver this year’s main oration.CAPTION: Raymond McCartney spent  days on hunger strike in ."},{"url":null,"title":"trade union blasts delusional derry employers treatment frontline workers","story":"A public sector trade union has blasted “unscrupulous” local employers for their “arrogant” mistreatment of workers.UNISON activists attended the recent NIHE Public consultation standardised regional payment rates event in the City Hotel to provide a voice for frontline workers employed through the Supporting People Programme.Earlier this year Derry City  Strabane District Council unanimously backed a motion in support of workers’ rights.The Supporting People programme, which has been operating since , provides housing support services delivered in partnership with service providers across the public, private and voluntary sectors.Support is provided to more than , vulnerable people every year, to enable them to live independently in their own homes, sheltered housing or in supported housing accommodation.Client groups include, Women’s Aid, the House in the Wells, Cheshire House, the Shepherds View Young Parents Project, Francis Street Young Persons Project, Apex Housing - Beechway House and the Simon Community.Its broad objectives are to achieve a better quality of le for vulnerable people, allowing them to live independently and maintain their tenancies. To provide housing support services to prevent problems that can often lead to hospitalisation, institutional care or homelessness.And finally, to assist with a smooth transition to those leaving an institutional environment to independent living.Following a review of the Supporting People programme by the Department for Communities in , it was recommended that payment rates across all Supporting People providers should be standardised.The new rates are supposed to ensure all schemes represent value for money.However, UNISON Community Branch members have questioned the commitment of certain employers within the sector.Niall McCarroll, UNISON Community Branch Chairperson said: “The Supporting People Programme has at its core the fundamental desire to improve the quality of le of those in our communities who need housing related support at any particular time.“However, the standards of living and quality of le frontline workers are experiencing does not reflect the work they complete, as a result of substandard terms and conditions of employment increasingly pushing them into debt, putting them at risk of homelessness and forcing them to use foodbanks.”‘Amoral employers’The UNISON delegation attending the Public Consultation impressed upon the NIHE that the current measures in place to protect frontline workers were inadequate and gave “unscrupulous employers” too much power. “Power which they use to disadvantage many workers whilst their inner circles led lavish lestyles on enhance contracts of employment,” Mr McCarroll added.He said the decision-making on how to manage staffing is at the behest of Supporting People funded organisations, this needs to change.UNISON told the NIHE that the current consultation process in place, designed to improve service delivery for vulnerable people would achieve nothing and fall short of any objectives,frontline staff were not valued and respected within the programme.The NIHE estimate that frontline workers should be in receipt of band  hourly rates with no mention of other band  terms and conditions such as sick pay or sht allowances. UNISON challenged this benchmarking estimate and its lack of detail in other areas, stating this was not the reality for many Supporting People Programme workers.Mr McCarroll continued: “A UNISON delegation of frontline workers will be meeting with the NIHE to further discuss our members’ concerns and we thank the NIHE for agreeing to continue the discussions on how best to protect and value workers, not forgetting that we are all involved in this programme to work together changing the lives of vulnerable people.“UNISON would like to put on record our appreciation of the position and approach taken by the NIHE in engaging with the trade unions and our continued disappointment at the right wing, anti-trade union position and approach taken by some Supporting People funded employers.“These employers operate with an arrogant, delusionary sense of entitlement, the UNISON led Supporting People Campaign will expose these employers and continue to organise workers to stand up and fight, bringing to an end the increasingly shaky gravy train which stops only at head office, bypassing frontline services.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh\"Head office staff receive  months full sick pay while frontline workers receive just  week in any year.  This particular contractual entitlement along with signicant dferences in take home pay is leaving frontline workers feeling undervalued.\"A NIHE spokesperson said the objective of the consultation is to hear the views of service providers, current and potential service users and their families and carers to enable the Housing Executive to identy the best option and approach for implementing this recommendation.The consultation runs for  weeks, it began on  June  and ends  August .Interested stakeholders are invited to participate by completing an online questionnaire at: https:consultations.nidirect.gov.uk nihe-supporting-people srpr"},{"url":null,"title":"machynlleth carnival 2019 event celebrates","story":"Moon landers : Olivia Garrod , Harry Smithand Izzy Owen ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgt drop in on Machynllltspan classtruncate-full-screengteth Carnival.

That total and then some was passed in no time and has now risen above the pound, mark which has delighted Jeff.ldquoMany thanks to all the sponsors, supporters, players, umpires and scorers, Jeff enthused.ldquoThanks also to Liz Byrne, Jackie Wilson and Dave Crudgington who ran the refreshments and food made by chef Ryan Finnegan. We just couldnrsquot have achieved our target without the help of a lot of people and I can never thank them enough, he added.Sunday was an emotional day for Jeff and he was at times reduced to the odd wee tear.ldquoRodney Hassardrsquos tribute had me close to breaking down, but I was able to hold it together. I got my wish of playing alongside a lot of my former team-mates and I am indebted to them all for turning up and sharing the occasion with me.In the first challenge game of the day Dundrumrsquos current first team took on a squad of former Dundrum players that included Alan Mills and Darren Oldroyd, from Drumaness, Mark Yeates, from Downpatrick, and Byron Woodruff, from Saintfield.The game was competitive to say the least and thanks to decent knocks from Terry Hutley , Stuart Campbelland Sean CameronDundrum posted .Yeates sent the stumps cartwheeling on two occasions with Oldroyd also picking up two wickets. Harry Hitchins got the prize wicket of first team captain Ian Wright.The golden oldies rolled back the years in reply with Rodney Hassardshowing his undoubted class in his first game in five years.Woodruff made , including two big sixes off Cameron and Shilliday danced his way down the wicket, as used to be the norm, for a quick fire . Oldroydand Yeatescompleted the job with five wickets to spare.The second game saw some excellent ball striking and decent bowling from an NCU Select team.Saintfieldrsquos Byron Woodruff and the best young prospect in County Down,  year-old Adam Reid, treated all the bowlers with contempt as the runs flowed quicker than the refreshments.Man of the match Reid hit  not out in only  balls including eight boundaries and one massive six that went out of the ground.Superb all rounder Woodruff showed his old team-mates what a talent he is, hitting  in  balls with four big sixes and the same in boundaries.If both had not retired they would have scored centuries and the Dundrum bowlers were happy to clap them off. Ricky Owens then rolled back the years with a splendid , including three big sixes and three fours, the NCU side posting .It was perhaps fitting that Alan Mills, the oldest player on the pitch and still ultra competitive, finished  not out.Dundrum fought back well after the early onslaught with good fielding catching and astute field placing by captain Gavin McNerlin.Wickets were shared around with Chandar Shekhar the pick of the bowlers, taking  for  of three overs. Shilliday was again on the money and finished with  for . McNerlin, Keba Butler, Neil Reilly and Peter Calvert all got one wicket apiece.Dundrum got a steady start from Greg Hutleyand Rodney Hassard before Drumanessrsquo Neil Gelston removed them both. Oldroyd then hit the middle stump with successive deliveries leaving Dundrum on  for .McNerlin hit Gelston straight over the scoreboard in his  before Stuart Campbellwas run out by Woodruff. Saintfieldrsquos T McCavera picked up two wickets with CIYMSrsquo Steven Hughes and Woodruff also getting in on the act.The last wicket partnership of  between Neil Reillyand Keba Butlergot Dundrum closer than it looked as the NCU side ran out comfortable winners.The match ball sponsors were Bao and Bento and Pizza Palazzo, Newcastle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Downpatrick railway’s first afternoon tea event is runaway success  ","story":"THE Downpatrick and Co Down Railway got out the best china when it hosted its very first afternoon tea event recently.The experience started with guests boarding the train at Downpatrick town station and taking a relaxing journey, travelling in a comfortable s carriage, to Inch Abbey by steam train.They then boarded the buffet carriage where guests were welcomed by the volunteers with a glass of prosecco, wine or a soft drink, before being directed to their allocated tables to enjoy a mouthwatering selection of freshly handmade sandwiches, luxury homemade scones with jam and cream and mini French patisseries.Guests were also offered bottomless teas and coffees, or their own pot of luxury specialist tea.Railway chairman Robert Gardiner, who was one of the servers, said: ldquoThis is something wersquove wanted to do for some time, and itrsquos always been a very popular treat on heritage railways in Great Britain.ldquoNerves may have been a bit jangled as with all first events.

If something does not happen soon we are finished, he said.ldquoTo be owed something like pound, by a public body like the Housing Executive is scandalous and someone should step in to sort this mess out.The crisis has been sparked off by staff shortages and industrial action in the accounts department of the Executive.A spokesman for the Executive said they were extremely concerned at the situation and had brought it to the attention of the Government.ldquoThere have been a number of vacancies in the department and we are unable to fill them because of the Government ban on recruitment to the public service. The result is that we cannot porocess these settlements as quickly as we normally do.He added: We are trying to do all we can to help the smaller contractors who are always much more vulnerable in such a situation.NEWCASTLE mdash A verdict of accidental death has been ed on Newcastle motorcycle ace Tom Herron, who died at the North West  earlier this year.Thirty year-old Herron, ranked third in the world, came off his bike at mph and smashed into a lamp post just  yards from the finishing line in the cc race. He died in hospital two hours later.The inquest at Coleraine heard how Herron had ridden in the race with an injury to his thumb and arm, but the pathologistrsquos report could not determine whether this would have interfered with his ability to control the bike at high speed.Two police constables, who witnessed the accident, told the inquest that the bike scraped the ground and the rider then lost control.The coroner, Mr Robin Wray, discounted suggestions to close the Portrush circuit and said that the racing gave a great deal of pleasure to a lot of people. He added that he had seen Herron race many times and always had a great admiration for him.DRUMANESS mdash Fresh hope for the old Drumaness Mill, which was becoming something of a white elephant, emerged this week with the news that Irish Waste Services have long term plans to develop it into an industrial estate.This week a spokesman for the company confirmed they had already moved on to the site. The long term plans for the , sq ft red brick building involve the setting up of an industrial estate with potential for several hundred jobs. The firm will advertise shortly for tenants and the spokesman explained that there was a real need for small factory premises providing employment in the area.The story of the mill since it closed down when owned by Hurstrsquos as part of the Ulster Weaving Group, when at one stage it provided work for  people, has been a long saga of disappointment.The mill was sold to Irish Waste for around pound, recently. This figure falls far short of the original asking price at a public auction held in Ballynahinch last year, which was believed to be around pound,.The news of employment hopes for Drumaness was welcomed by the chairman of Down Council, Mr Eddie McVeigh, who said it was ldquogood news indeed.He added: ldquoI would welcome anything which would bring jobs to the Drumaness area and I hope that this is not one of the many disappointments which we have suffered over the last few years.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Plessey Telecommunications in Ballynahinch was closed on Monday when more than  production workers walked out as part of a national campaign to obtain shorter hours and more pay.The strike action will be repeated on the Monday of the next two weeks and the production workers are also refusing to work overtime.Their demands are for a basic skilled rate of pound, a reduction in hours to an eventual  hours a week and two extra daysrsquo holiday.A spokesman for the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions said: ldquoWe would have prefer to have obtained our realistic claim by mutual agreement with the employers, but unfortunately we are left with no other alternative.STRANGFORD LOUGH mdash A strong plea is being made to boat owners on Strangford Lough to combat the nuisance caused by inexperienced owners of large fast powerboats.It comes from Mr T W McKee, of Sketrick Island, a noted yachtsman with more than  yearsrsquo sailing experience behind him.He is annoyed by a recent ldquomafia-type display of outrageous aggressiveness by a powerboat owner and would like to find an authority with the power to control such ldquoblatant abuse of delightful waters, not to mention the risk to innocent people and their boats by sea-borne thugs.In a letter to the Recorder, Mr McKee describes how his -foot yacht was rocked from side to wide so viciously by the wash of the powerboat, which buzzed around it, that his family and grandchildren were lucky not to be seriously injured as they were flung back and forth across the wheelhouse.He has passed the complaint to the Coastguard in the hope that they can have action taken, but understanding that use of Strangford Lough as a navigable waterway is free to all who wish to use it, he does not expect any success.PORTAFERRY mdash A public meeting is to be held in Portaferry next week to protest about plans for sewage disposal in the town.The meeting has been called by the local development association, which is concerned that the scheme about to be launched will be inadequate.Councillor Paddy Doherty, a member of the development association, appealed for the support of townspeople to support the meeting so that plans can be drawn up to combat the scheme by Ards Borough Council.Mr Doherty said the council originally proposed a filter bed scheme, which would pump treated sewage into Strangford Lough, but then abandoned the filter bed idea.LOUGHINISLAND mdash It was a historic day for the community in Loughinisland when Paddy McFlynn, the president of the GAA, declared open their new Macartan Park on Sunday.The weather certainly could have been kinder for the biggest day in the history of the club, but nevertheless there was a good crowd to witness the opening, as well as the football and hurling games.Mr Vincent Doran, the chairman of the club, welcomed the distinguished guests and said Loughinisland was one of the oldest clubs in East Down.

A few weeks ago Clonduff would have been regarded as red hot favourites to progress against their Division  opponents.However, it is uncertainthe Hilltown outfit will be at full strength as several of their players headed off to the USA a fortnight ago.Clonduff were beaten - to - on Friday night by Burren and given half a chance, Pat Havern and Daniel McCarthy could take full advantage of Clonduffrsquos misfortunes and lead Saval to a surprise win.The curtain-raiser for this game is the IFC encounter between Drumaness and Glasdrumman at .pm. Drumaness are expected to progress as the Quarter Road outfit have yet to win a game this season and seem certain to be relegated from Division .A Gary Murdock-inspired Drumaness beat Glasdrumman - to - at the start of July and they will be intent on repeating that result.There are two IFC games also down for decision over at Fontenoy Park when Drumgath face Darragh Cross and Teconnaught clash with St Johnrsquos.Darragh have been involved in a tense battle for promotion into the top flight, but recent defeats to Carryduff and Longstone have dented their aspirations.However, they are a championship team and in Shane Murray, Michael Monan, Joe McKinney, Matty Hardy and Anton McGrattan they have players capable of going all the way this year and Drumgath, who lie in second place in Division , will do well to get a result.The Teconnaught v St Johnrsquos derby should be a nice opener for the Drumnaquoile side who are more than holding their own in Division  with John Clarke, Conor Morgan, Marty Keenan and the Flanagans all in good form.Teconnaught, who won the JFC title last season, will rely on Paddy Grant, Jack Larkin, Ciaran Carville, David Kelly and Tony Davis to keep them competitive.Friday night sees another four games take place mdash two in Burren and two in Newcastle.A lot of focus will naturally fall on the SFC game between Kilcoo and An Riocht in Burren.Kilcoo have made no secret of the fact that they are determined to regain the Frank OrsquoHare Cup after losing out to Burren in last yearrsquos decider.They have blooded several new faces this season and are well in the running for the ACFL Division  crown, but they will not be taking An Riocht lightly, despite theirindferent season in Division . The Branagan, Devlin, Laverty and Johnston brothers will ensure Kilcoo go into the game in the right frame of mind.At the same venue, Shamrocks clash with Tullylish with the outcome hard to predict.Tullylish have fallen from grace in recent months and have been cast adrt at the bottom of Division . Shamrocks are in the top half of Division , but it looks asthey have missed out on promotion yet again.The game of the night should be in Newcastle where Carryduff lock horns with Castlewellan in the SFC.D J Morganrsquos Carryduff side seem destined for Division , while Castlewellan are battling to avoid relegation to Division .Carryduff have really made their mark this season with James and Daniel Guinness, Owen McCabe, Ronan Beatty, John McGeogh and Josh Connery all to the fore.Castlewellan are just now starting to get a few of their walking wounded back in action and Sean Dornan, Liam, Donal and Gareth McKibbin, Colly Flanagan, Rory Burns and Daniel Morgan could prove a handful for a young Carryduff side.The curtain-raiser to this game is the IFC encounter between Annaclone and Atticall.Ciaran Branniganrsquos Annaclone have been blazing a trail of glory at the top of Division  and it is unlikely that Atticall, who are  points behind them in the table, will inflict their first defeat of the season on them.Annaclone were held to a - to - draw by a fast-improving Ballymartin side on Friday night, but they still should have too much firepower for Atticall.Saturday sees another four games take place.Top billing goes to the Loughinisland v Longstone SFC clash in Castlewellan.Loughinisland have taken Division  by storm since theirthis season and are riding high in third place after Friday nightrsquos - to - win over a good Warrenpoint offering at Macartan Park.Longstone, on the other hand, are embroiled with Carryduff for an automatic promotion place at the top of Division  and now that Ambrose Rogers and Mark Poland are back to full fitness, this should be a cracking affair.Absolutely nothing separated the sides when they met in Division  last year and the same should be the case on Saturday.Loughinisland will rely on their big hitters Dan Gordon mdash still good enough to be playing county football mdash Jonny Flynn, Rory Mason, Stefan Mason and the McClements brothers and they should progress.This game will be proceeded by the Saul v Bosco IFC encounter.Saul,they can reproduce the sort of form they showed a fortnight ago to beat Carryduff, will be expected to ease past their Division  opponents, but championship football doesnrsquot always work that way.Bosco fell to a narrow - to - defeat away to Clann na Banna on Friday night while Saul were soundly beaten - to - by Bredagh.However, Donnan Ritchie will have his charges pumped up for this encounter with the Arnold, Harney and Mahoney brothers prepared to take the game to Bosco.It will be a short trip down the road to Kilcoo for the next two games on Saturday.Glenn play Liatroim in the IFC at .pm and Bryansford take on Bredagh.Neither Glenn or Bredagh have been causing a stir this season, but now is the time to turn it on. Liatroim should be at full strength with the McCrickard connections finally finished with their county hurling commitments and the Fontenoys might just cause an upset.The big game on Saturday night is the Bryansford v Bredagh game in the SFC.Bryansford have been plagued by injuries to key players all season long, but in Davy McKibben, Ruairi Wells, Danny Savage and Conor Maginn they have the men for all jobs and I would expect them to see off Bredagh.Brendan Masonrsquos outfit hammered Saul on Friday night and in Donal Hughes, Tommy McElroy, Eoin Costello and Conor Francis they have players capable of mixing it with the best, but last yearrsquos IFC winners might find Bryansfordrsquos physicality too much to handle.There are another three games to be played on Sunday.Ballymartin face Clann na Banna in the IFC at Mayobridge at pm before Warrenpoint take on Ballyholland and Burren lock horns with neighbours Mayobridge at Pairc Esler.Ballymartin seem to have turned the corner after a few disappointing results, but they are now operating at full strength again and warmed up for the championship with a draw against runaway Division  leaders Annaclone on Friday night.Clann na Banna are sitting in a comfortable mid-table position, but I donrsquot think they will give Ballymartin too much to worry about.The Ballyholland v Warrenpoint game should be another close encounter.Ballyholland may lie bottom of the Division  table, but Warrenpoint are only four points above them. The lsquoPoint have potential match winners in the Boyles and Ross McGarry with Ballyholland looking to the Murphy brothers, Tiarnan Rushe and Seamus Loughran.The Mayobridge v Burrren game is the tie of the round.Paddy OrsquoRourkersquos side, the defending league champions and Frank OrsquoHare Cup holders, will not relinquish their grip on both trophies without a fight.They have been a little bit inconsistent of late, but bounced back to their best on Friday night with a comfortable - to - victory away to Clonduff, while Mayobridge were beaten - to - by Kilcoo.In Kevin McKernan, Donal OrsquoHare, Liam Kerr and the McAvoy brothers, Burren have the perfect blend of youth and experience, while Maybridge will look to Corey Quinn, Shane Annett and the combative Conor Garvey to keep them interested.Downpatrick and Rostrevor bring the curtain down on the first round of fixtures when they clash in Hilltown on Monday night.The sides met last Friday night in the league at Petit Park with Rostrevor winning - to -. However, Caolan Mooney, who was literally unplayable in that game, is unable to play in the championship and that could well hand the initiative to the Hoops.Downpatrick will again look to big performances from their big game players and they donrsquot come any bigger than Gerard Colllins, Michael Magee, Conor McGrady, Jarlath Branagan and the Turley brothers.Without Mooney, Pete McGrathrsquos side will look to Conor Doyle, John Connolly, Shan Parr and Piras Kane for inspiration..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Great turnout for multi cultural event in Ballynahinch  ","story":"HUNDREDS of people attended the multi-cultural family friendly celebration at The Square in Ballynahinch on Saturday.The Connecting Cultures Event was held to help promote community cohesion and encourage acceptance and understanding of other cultures.In addition to music from all over the world, there were dancers entertaining the crowd, face painting, an exotic petting farm, stilt walkers, circus skills and cuisine from ious parts of the world.The African drumming proved particularly popular, with people of all ages keen to take part.

But when he arrived, to his dismay he found that the interview with the then taoiseach Jack Lynch had been turned into a press conference and he had largely wasted his time..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button It was Lynch who took the Republic into the EU on the same day as the UK joined in  – arguably Ireland’s single most transformative decision since partition.The outbreak of the Troubles meant that Lynch’s policy towards Northern Ireland defined much of his tenure, and although the current Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, only took up office two years ago and is only , Brexit is already almost certain to define his time in office.Leo Varadkar speaking to News Letter political editor Sam McBride in Belfast on TuesdayHis robust strategy of insisting that the UK commits to a backstop which treats Northern Ireland dferently to the rest of the UKBritain is to leave the customs union and single market now looks like it could have the unintended consequence of contributing to the UK leaving without any deal at all – a major economic threat to Ireland.Two weeks ago a poll found that a minority of the Irish publicback his Brexit strategy. The stakes are high not just for the Fine Gael leader, but for his nation.Sitting in the modern offices of the de facto Irish embassy in Belfast – the Irish Secretariat on Linenhall Street –Mr Varadkar has misgivings, he doesn’t show them.With relentless message discipline, he repeats the Irish government’s stance, insisting that it will not give up the backstop anda no-deal Brexit happens then it will be London’s choice.Mr Varadkar is a cautious interviewee, choosing words carefully and often appearing to say little beyond what has already been said. Even when asked when he first visited Northern Ireland , there is a sense that he is always thinking politically, delicately selecting his words.Did Northern Ireland at that time feel like an entirely dferent country or society “No. No. It definitely felt dferent, and is dferent, but certainly not foreign. I’ve always liked Belfast as a city and Queen’s in particular as a campus.”UFU: Brexit cull of , NI cattle is ‘scaremongering’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Again, when asked whether British-Irish relations are at their lowest point since the  Belfast Agreement – which seems obvious – he is coy, saying that relations between people in Britain and Ireland are “pretty good”, while “definitely Brexit has strained relations between the two governments ... and has created a very dficult environment for the parties in Northern Ireland”.But on Brexit there are subtle linguistic changes which hint at how the situation is changing. In January, he said that “even in a no-deal, there will not be ato a border”. Now, he implicitly accepts that no-deal will mean that there will be an economic border – although he hopes it can be enforced away from the border itself.However, he is clear that regardless of what happens – deal or no-deal, backstop or no backstop – the movement of people around the island will be unimpeded. Despite some people’s fears that no-deal would mean a border, impeding the movement of people crossing the border to shop, visit relatives or go to school, Mr Varadkar is clear that will not be the case.Highlighting how the UK and the Republic have given firm commitments to retain the common travel area, he says he is “confident” that will continue, along with access to each other’s labour markets, housing, education, welfare and pensions “as though we were citizens of both Britain and Ireland”.“We’ve agreed to keep that in place – so as long as the British and Irish governments commit to keep that in place, that will stay in place and our commitment to that is absolute and solid. I would hope that down the line the British government doesn’t decide that taking control of our borders means in any way diluting the common travel area – certainly we won’t.”His one caveat to that is that it is impossible to be certain of what “may happen down the line ... a lot of the reasons for the checks during the Troubles were security-related and I would certainly hope that the security situation would not deteriorate”.He stresses that violence at any future border is not inevitable “but I think we would be doing a disservice to our citizens north and southwe didn’t understand that it is a potential outcome”.Last week Arlene Foster – once Mr Varadkar’s opposite number as Stormont tourism minister and from whom he accepted an invitation to attend the Twelfth in Enniskillen seven years ago – accused him of being “very truculent” and refusing to engage in “sensible bilateral” discussions with the UK. She said he “hides behind the apron strings of the EU ... and he won’t speak to those of us who have a very big interest in finding a way forward”.When those comments are put to the taoiseach, he smiles, saying: “Yeah, I heard that and I’m conscious that it was Arlene Foster only last week who was advising me to dial down the rhetoric.“I don’t think in two years as taoiseach and in eight years in the Irish government I’ve ever made a pejorative comment about any unionist politician.”In a time of crisis in Northern Ireland  years ago, Jack Lynch’s solution was simple: “The reunication of the national territory can provide the only permanent solution for the problem.”Although Irish unity is more seriously talked about now than for many years, Mr Varadkar’s responses to questions around unity reveal a reluctance to rapidly move towards such a prospect.Asked whether the classic Irish nationalist idea of unity – an Irish unitary state – is a realistic or achievable prospect in the medium term, he said: “I would really not like to see the Brexit debate becoming a constitutional one. I fear thatyou have a no-deal hard Brexit, that that will arise and I don’t want that to happen ... I would really not like to see this issue of a united Ireland being brought to the fore as a consequence of a hard Brexit.“It’s the kind of thing that I always envisage,it ever would happen, it would happen in a more generational context and would give us time to talk about what that might look like because certainly for me it wouldn’t look like a unitary -county republic, the kind of thing that was envisaged by the founding fathers of the state, those that fought in the GPO – because that could never fully respect or embrace the million people here in the north who are British, who have a unique identity ... that was perhaps one of the flaws of the founding project of my state – that wasn’t properly respected at that time.”When askedhe envisaged the Irish and British governments staying neutral in a border poll or campaigning on either side of the debate, the taoiseach laughed and said: “That’s a good question, actually. I haven’t been asked that one before. I think long before we would ever have a border poll we would have to have a long and meaningful conversation as to what the question really is – we saw that with Brexit people voting on the issue of Brexit without perhaps a proper debate about what Brexit would look like or what Brexit would be.”Leo Varadkar, the gay son of immigrants at the head of a confident and technologically advanced Ireland, is a world away from Jack Lynch, the champion hurler at the helm of agrarian Catholic Ireland. But just as Northern Ireland unexpectedly imposed itself on his Fianna Fáil predecessor, so it is once more threatening to destabilise the southern state.try catch  TrendingN.I.

Wersquove had reports of youths consuming alcohol, using nitrous oxide canisters along with reports of damage caused to motor vehicles.Officers are working with British Transport Police to tackle this issue.Alcohol has been confiscated from groups of youths and a number of anti-social behaviour referrals orders have been made.Patrols have increased around the anti-social behaviour hotspots and operations at the train stations and surrounding areas will continue.I would also like to raise awareness of rogue traders in the area.Last week, officers attended to an address after concerns were raised about an elderly woman being asked to pay a large sum of money to have her patio cleaned.No money was exchanged and enquiries are ongoing into this incident.Residents should be wary of anyone who arrives at their property unannounced and uninvited and they should always very callers are who they say they are.We would advise people not to allow cold callers access to their property, to get at least two separate quotes before agreeing to have any work being carried out, to look out for their elderly relatives and neighbours, be vigilant and to contact the police immediatelythey are approached by any suspicious iniduals.If you see something suspicious or have any information related to this activity then call us on  or on appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Having stood empty for many years, I am delighted it is being given a new and exciting future.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The paper, which examines the negative impact of a ‘no deal’ EU exit, warns the “Northern Ireland Civil Service’s assessment remains that a ‘no deal’ would have a profound and long-lasting impact on NI’s economy and society”. Among its key points, it says a ‘no deal’ “could lead to a sharp increase in unemployment, with at least , jobs at risk, based on EU export exposure”. “The impact of EU tarfs could reduce NI’s exports to Ireland by % and the inclusion of non-tarf barriers could see a decline of %,” it says. Once again, it raises serious concerns over the agri-sector in particular, meat in particular, and beef especially, in regards to “increased vulnerability to low cost non-EU imports in the GB or NI market”. Its not just the physical goods, though as it says Northern Irelands IT sector is facing the cost of exporting services increasing, by an average of .%. And regarding foreign direct investment– one of the big business buzzwords here over the last few years – it says “under a ‘no deal’ exit, NI’s FDI attractiveness would be negatively impacted”. “A ‘no deal’ would see losses in the medium to long run of % per annum in the case of the number of FDI projects and of .% for FDI-related new jobs.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/hamilton_hotel.jpg","title":"new  bedroom hotel for titanic quarter","story":"Posted on Monday  July  by John Mulgrew Belfast looks set to get a new -bedroom hotel amid freshly submitted plans for a development across from Titanic Belfast.

While an operator for the hotel has not yet been announced, the group has developed a series of Holiday Inn hotels across the UK and Ireland, as well as Seraphine hotels.

A statement, signed by  business organisations and trade bodies, says that “two and a half years on from the collapse of the Executive, and now approaching the likely conclusion of the Brexit process, the Northern Ireland business community is deeply concerned at the continued absence of a ing administration and is calling on political representatives to redouble their efforts to reach agreement to get the Assembly and Executive working again”. “There has seldom been a time when strong and effective leadership has been more necessary, both to deliver on the domestic agenda and also to speak up for Northern Ireland in the Brexit process. “We need a fully ing administration to agree and deliver a Programme for Government that will build infrastructure, reform our health service and education system, ensure we have a strong economy, and create opportunities for our young people. We also need effective representation in the Brexit discussions, even at this late stage in the process, to ensure that the economy is protected through whatever changes arise and that all necessary mitigations are sought and secured. “The business community will give encouragement and support to those politicians who stretch themselves to reach a compromise. Without such a commitment and associated action from our elected representatives, we risk irreparable damage to our economy and our society for which future generations will judge us harshly.””  The letter has been signed by the following organisations: Belfast Chamber Causeway Chamber of Commerce CBI NI Centre for Competitiveness Construction Employers Federation NI Federation of Small Businesses Northern Ireland Freight Transport Association Hospitality Ulster IoD NI Londonderry Chamber of Commerce Manufacturing NI Mineral Products Association NI Newry Chamber of Commerce  Trade NI Grain Trade Association NI Hotels Federation NI Tourism Alliance Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry Northern Ireland Food and Drink Association Northern Ireland Retail Consortium Retail NI Women in Business NIView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/qub_1.jpg","title":"ulster business top  sees sales rise by ","story":"Posted on Monday August  by Ulster Business Michael Neill, head of office, AL Goodbody Belfast, sponsor of the Top , Flavio Malnarcic, chief financial officer, Moy Park and Ulster Business editor John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s largest businesses have seen sales rise by .% to more £.bn, the Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies list  has revealed.The list, sponsored by AL Goodbody, showcases the successes of the biggest firms from right across Northern Ireland.

Editor John Mulgrew looks at the numbers, the analysis and the once household names no longer with us The tattered corner of the Ulster Business Top  list from  probably isn’t the worst way to analogise the then state of the Northern Ireland economy, and a precursor to what was around the cornerWe’ve come a very long way in a decade, and while there are some big and familiar names on the  Top  list, there are firms which have fallen off it entirely, and resigned to the history books post-recession.In former editor David Elliott’s intro to the magazine, it references the fact that most of the accounting periods in the list were just as the downturn was starting to gather pace.Economist John Simpson, writing in the edition, says the “big recession of  and  did not impact evenly across the economy, and recovery will be best seen as a sequence of dferent proportions”.There are some positive things to take from it – including a large glowing image of Victoria Square, which in the more than  years since it opened in the heart of Belfast has become part of the retail fabric of the city.Topping the list at the time was Viridian Group, which owned Northern Ireland Electricity and now includes Power NI as a subsidiary, with turnover of £.bn. However, it made a loss of £m during that period.Second on the list is a business familiar to many. Quinn Group, headed by Co Fermanagh businessman Sean Quinn, posted turnover of £.bn for the year ending    but incurred a loss of more than £m during the same period. There have been enough column inches written about the business in the years since then to fill many a book – and they have.Among those no longer on the list is developer David Patton  SonsLtd, Armaghdown Creameries Ltd and Ballyrogan Holdings.Many others on the list have since been acquired by some of the now giants in their respective industries.Moy Park is an interesting one. Back then it was still a large player in the poultry sector with turnover of £m.Those fortunes have evidently changed dramatically since then, as the company has held the top spot on the list for the last eight years, and now posts big profits and turnover of £.bn.Meanwhile, WR Barnett is on the  list in position , with a turnover of £m and pre-tax profits of £m. In the last  years, it has climbed the list to comfortably take the number two spot with sales of almost  times that of those a decade earlier.As far as employment goes, it was Tesco topping the list in , followed by Bombardier – which at the time had a workforce of around , people – with Royal Mail and Queen’s University following in third and fourth position.A lot has happened in the years since that list. The economy has slowly but surely gotten back on its feet. Growth has been gradual, and in the last year or so has been sitting at around %, while employment levels and unemployment levels are at their respective positive record levels. However, we are amid the most challenging time for business in a generation and some of the signs, and whispered conversations, are far from positive. As I write this, we still sit on the precipice of whether we secure an agreement on Brexit, or shuffle off the edge without a parachute. Let’s hope it’s the former.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/flav_1.jpg","title":"top  moy park takes number one spot","story":"Posted on Thursday August  by Ulster Business From a purely editorial perspective it would be refreshing to have a dferent company head up the Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies list.But Moy Park has now made it to the top for eight consecutive years, as the poultry processing giant continues to expand both its workforce, global sales and pre-tax profit – firmly setting its place at Northern Ireland’s biggest business, with a workforce of more than , here alone.In the last year, it has grown turnover to just over £.bn, up from £.bn a year earlier, while pre-tax profits have surged by % – rising to £.m in its latest set of accounts, ending December .The business supplies Moy Park branded and own label chicken products to leading retailers and foodservice providers throughout the UK, Ireland and Europe.In numbers, Moy Park processes six million fresh chickens each week, , turkeys a year, along with , tonnes of other ‘added value products’.London-born Chris Kirke replaced long-serving boss Janet McCollum in , less than a year after Craigavon-based Moy Park was taken over by new US owners Pilgrim’s.And around a year ago, Flavio Malnarcicjoined the business – then as executive business director – before taking over as the firm’s chief financial officer.He was formerly business director at JBS Global, and has a senior leadership background as executive director of the poultry and export business in Seara, also as chief financial officer and chief executive at Tyson do Brazil and finance roles in Cargill.“There has been a consistence in the performance. We have been growing volumes… we got to six million birds each week, which is about a third of the UK market. For the UK, it is a signicantly big company.“Looking year-over-year, our performance was very consistent in the last few years.”“For people working there, working for a company which is the largest employer in a country, the top company, it is a source of pride for us.“But I don’t think that drives the behaviour of the team. We are more interested in making sure that our performance is sustainable in terms of margins.“It is nice that we arebut that is not our main goal. We are making sure that we are sustainable, work on quality, safety. There are lots of other things. It’s making sure that we fit our customer needs.“We have a lot focus on that, and we need to be competitive.”And as for growth, expanding turnover isn’t necessarily the main focus, according to Flavio“A lot of the efforts in the last year have been to consolidate the management tools they have in Pilgrim’s. They are very keen on efficiency, so that’s one of their strategies. “ a lot of focus in improving our performance, it’s how we can be more efficient, focusing on a portfolio that feeds our customer base, how we deal with our customers.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
