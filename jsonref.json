Work is not even being discussed with him. The only priority is him getting better.’A rep for Ant has been contacted for comment.If you\u0027ve got a story, video or pictures get in touch with the  Entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page - we\u0027d love to hear from you.MORE: Lisa Armstrong likes motivational tweet by Kanye West as Ant McPartlin leaves rehabMORE: Ant McPartlin leaves rehab ‘looking brighter’ as he’s spotted walking his dog after month of treatment"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/sec_9714653.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"kylie jenner flaunts massive diamond ring splashing boyfriends theme park birthday","story":"She flaunted the ring on her wedding finger sparking engagement rumours with her fans (Picture: BACKGRID)Only the Kar-Jenner clan can get away with pairing huge diamond rings with gym gear, and that’s exactly what Kylie did when she was spotted shopping in Los Angeles in a pair of sports leggings and an over-sized hoodie.The beauty mogul is known for always being on fleek, and even looks her best in her comfys, as she glammed them up with eye-catching rings.It looks like she had taken some time off from her mummy duties and was cooling herself off with an iced drink after a serious shopping spree.Holding her plastic cup up to her face, the star showed off her latest accessories that she’d paired with a rather large diamond watch.Engagement rumours were reignited by her fans (Picture: REX)Previously that day, the 20-year-old had revealed her jewels on her Instagram story, and flaunted her matching nails in the video.Fans couldn’t help but notice that one of her rings was wrapped around her wedding finger, which instantly reignited the rumours she is engaged to Travis Scott.Maybe she’s just probably giving him a couple of hints though… Like, what more does the girl have to do?However, Kylie wearing a ring on that particular finger is nothing new, as she was seen sporting one in her birth announcement video.In a couple of shots she gave a glimpse of her hand, which looked to be bedecked with an engagement ring, but neither one of the new parents have confirmed (or denied) speculation.This weekend marks Travis’ 26th birthday and Kylie decided to rent out the entire Six Flags theme park so that her boyfriend and their pals could enjoy the rides (without any queuing!)As well as the pair taking on countless of stomach churning rides, the fashionista had also prepared a birthday cake for her beau that featured them on a roller coaster holding onto an icing version of Stormi.Kylie has rented out a theme park for her boyfriend’s birthday  (Picture: InstagramKylie Jenner)She said as she zoomed in to the figurines: ‘Stormi, that is insane.

You may see a recreational regime here in the next five years as well.’Max Zavet: ‘We see the UK as a huge opportunity to expand in’ (Picture: Jen Mills)He spent several days in London to make contacts in the hope of expanding his business once the laws have changed.‘It could start with export, but eventually the UK will probably want a domestic-grown product,’ he said.Emblem, which produces and sells dried flower as well as cannabis oils, is one of 14 companies who presented at the Cannabis Invest conference at the May Fair Hotel.The exclusive London hotel is not necessarily where you’d expect to find businessmen and high net worth investors discussing the THC content of ‘premium flower’.Cannabis Invest: Not your typical stoners (Picture: Jen Mills)Those attending were almost exclusively in suits and cufflinks, with only one sequinned jacket in sight.Some present admitted they had never even tried cannabis, but were there because they saw it as an exciting investment.It shows how far the drug has come in being seen as acceptable, with canapés and glass bottles of San Pellegrino offered to guests – rather than a large order of Pizza Hut.Emblem operates legally in CanadaMany of those presenting were Canadian, which makes sense as the country will make recreational use fully legal by September this year. Brits in attendance were more likely to be listening than leading the sessions.Max believes UK industry as a whole will lose out because businesses will be playing catch-up once it is made legal (although one of the largest cannabis companies in the world, GW Pharmaceuticals, is based in Britain).‘The UK is on the forefront of most industries, but I think the culture is maybe a little too conservative, and is afraid of a new substance to harm children and harm society,’ he said.‘That’s even though people are consuming it regularly anyway.’The conference at the May Fair Hotel (Picture: Jen Mills)It’s obviously simpler for cannabis-based companies to operate if the drug is legal, because investors won’t be afraid it’s an illegal operation so it will be easier to raise capital.This has put US companies at a disadvantage, even in states where it is legal, because banks are federally regulated and at a governmental level cannabis is still outlawed.The Home Office insists it has no plans to relax the laws in Britain, describing cannabis as a ‘harmful drug’.It has been linked to schizophrenia and depression, with the Royal College of Psychiatrists warning of the ‘risk of serious consequences for people, such as the development of an enduring psychotic illness, particularly in those who are genetically vulnerable.’However, despite this many are optimistic the laws will soon change.Travis Wong, who used to be an investment banker in London, also attended the conference and hopes to move into the UK market.‘In the future we would love to look into Europe and London,’ he told .‘In a lot of markets there’s a two-step process. They always start with allowing medical access, having a regulated market for patients who want THC and CBD to help with pain management.‘As soon as people start realising the world isn’t blowing up and it’s not a gateway drug and there’s not people high on cannabis all the time, the second phase is to go recreational.’‘From what I recall, the UK has a relatively high level of recreational usage.‘Public opinion will shift very quickly.‘Everyone can see it being a global shift in public opinion.’Cannabis in its raw form is not recognised in the UK as having any medicinal benefit.It is subject to strict controls, which means it cannot be prescribed or supplied to the public, and can only be used for research under a Home Office licence.Despite this, the UK is one of the largest producers and exporters of legal cannabis to other countries. GW Pharmaceuticals has a licence to grow it for medical use to create its brands Sativex and Epidiolex, used to treat MS and epilepsy.Many places around the world have legalised medical cannabis (Picture: Getty Images)A Home Office spokesman told  the government has no plans to legalise cannabis, medicinally or otherwise.They said: ‘Cannabis is a controlled Class B drug, as there is clear scientific and medical evidence that it is a harmful drug, which can damage people’s mental and physical health, as well as harming iniduals and communities. The government is ‘absolutely committed’ to reducing drug use, they added.Uruguay was the first country to fully legalise cannabis in 2013. In Canada, cannabis is expected to become legal for recreational use nationwide in August or September this year.Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Vermont, Washington and Washington DC have legalised cannabis for recreational use, and dozens of states allow it for medical use.Many other countries allow it for medical use, including Israel, Italy, Denmark and Finland.Thousands of people gathered in London’s Hyde park on April 20, AKA 420 Day (Picture: Rex)Germany, Italy and Australia have recently relaxed their laws and are seen as exciting markets within the industry.‘I think the UK is probably going to take its regulation guidance from Canada, like Australia has,’ Max said.‘Yes the the UK is late, but there could be a robust and viable domestic industry. It could be a springboard to the rest of Europe.’MORE: This bloke’s been photographing his marijuana plants for over 30 yearsMORE: More than 5,000 weed smokers flock to Hyde Park for 420"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/sei_9765237.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"sainsburys asda agree deal merge create new supermarket giant","story":"The two supermarket chains have confirmed a merger which would create a new supermarket giant (Picture: PA)Sainsbury’s and Asda have confirmed that they will merge to create a new supermarket giant.Sainsbury’s announced in a statement that it will buy Walmart’s British unit Asda for £7.3 billion pounds ($10.1 billion) in cash and stock.Joining together the UK’s second and third-biggest supermarket chains will reduce costs and increase buying power but could face major regulatory hurdles, it has been claimed.Sainsbury’s, Asda and Argos stores will combine – but keep their respective brands (Picture: Getty)In its statement, Sainsbury’s said the combination would see both Sainsbury’s and Asda maintain their own inidual brands.More than 2,800 Sainsbury’s, Asda and Argos stores will be combined, it said, ‘to create greater choice for customers through more store formats and channels, with a combined 47 million customer transactions per week’.Yesterday there were calls for the proposed merger to be investigated by the competition watchdog over fears of the impact on consumer choice.The billion pound merger means the new supermarket giant will hold the biggest percentage of the grocery market, with shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey warning it risks ‘squeezing what little competition there is in the groceries market even further’.She said it would be ‘British shoppers that suffer from rising prices and British workers that may be fearing for their jobs’.Amber Rudd resigns as home secretary over Windrush generation scandalTwo people seriously injured in Glasgow bus crash"},{"url":null,"title":"When Ramadan 2018 Muslims fast does date change year","story":"Who is Janelle Monae? \u0026#8216Pansexual\u0026#8217 singer and actor revealed after Rolling Stone interview SNL\u0026#8217s Colin Jost and Michael Che to host the Emmys 2018Legoland to give free entry to anyone called Louis after Royal baby namingMarvel films get Unnecessary Censorship during Jimmy Kimmel\u0027s Avengers: Infinity War weekKanye West to launch DONDA Social to help City of ChicagoStephen Colbert says Melania Trump deserves $130K shopping spree for her birthdayWho is Maya Jama?

And they were wealthy enough to employ six servants, socialise with the great and good of Leeds, and involve themselves in the politics of the day.

Together, the tentacles of their influence reached across the city.But the family was also struck by tragedy.Arthur’s wife Harriot, who was a cousin of Beatrix Potter’s mother Helen, died in childbirth in 1888, at the age of 35, before her famous cousin published her first children’s book The Tale of Peter Rabbit, leaving her husband a widower with three children Arthur, two, Elinor, one, and baby Elizabeth.

Forensic artist...William¿s touching tribute to his father¿s tragic mentor:...Share this articleFour decades later, catastrophe struck again - and Arthur, who was pro-vice-chancellor of Leeds University, was again left bereft - when his oldest son Arthur, was involved in a horrific riding accident.On 14 December 1928, while riding with the Bramham Hunt, his horse failed to take a fence, throwing him to the ground, rolling on top of him and fracturing his pelvis. Within 11 months he was dead. A year later his father Arthur succumbed to grief.It was Hugo Lupton, son of Arthur’s younger brother Hugh and cousin of Kate’s great-grandmother Olive, who was responsible for linking the Luptons to Arthur Ransome.An old Wellingtonian and Trinity College alumnus, who won a Military Cross for his service in France, he married the author’s sister Joyce in 1920 and had four children Francis, in 1921, Arthur, in 1924, Cecily, in 1927, and Geoffrey, in 1930, ensuring the name Arthur went down through the generations.

Her paternal grandfather and uncle were both known as Charlie, although they were both christened Stephen Charles.The elder Charlie Goldsmith – Kate’s great-grandfather – was born at home in Acton, Middlesex, in 1886, and brought up in Southall. When he left home he lived in Uxbridge, where he worked as a mechanic and met his future wife Edith.A tiny woman, under 5 ft tall and weighing 7 stone, she was disfigured by a huge scar on her torso, which she had got during a narrow escape from death when she was a toddler.‘Grandad used to light his cigar in his big oil stove in the hall of the big house where they lived,’ his daughter Alice Tomlinson, the only one of his children still alive at 106 told me.‘He would roll a piece of paper up and put it in the stove and light his cigar. of course, when he went out, my mum copied. She had a go doing the same thing and nearly burned herself to death.’Charlie and Edith got married at Uxbridge Register office in 1909. She was four months pregnant with their eldest child, whom they named after his father.When Charlie Jnr was five years old, his father signed up, serving in France with the Royal Fusiliers, initially in the trenches and afterwards in the cookhouse. He was one of Kitchener’s ‘shilling men’.Luckily, he survived the war but returned home with emphysema. The father-of-six died in 1938, when his oldest son Charlie was 28 years old, and his youngest son, Kate’s grandfather Ronald was just six years old. His widow Edith was forced to move into a condemned flat and go to work at the local factory.Less than a century later, their great-granddaughter is living in Kensington Palace.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/27/20/4B77441D00000578-0-image-m-21_1524856582755.jpg","title":"Is royal baby look like","story":"    How a forensic artist predicted Prince Louis of Cambridge will look in years to comeThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have finally revealed the name of their newborn son, and this is how he could look in years to come.A forensic artist, who is based in Washington D.C, studied recent photographs of Prince William, Kate and their two eldest children.Joe Mullins then put together an image of what he predicts Prince Louis will look like in the future.According to Mr Mullins\u0027 predictions the youngster will have blue eyes, dark blonde hair and full cheeks.He has previously released images of what he predicted Prince George and Princess Charlotte would look like as they grew up.At the time Mr Mullins\u0027 pictures suggested that the children would both have dark hair and blue eyes.  Royalists and bookmakers alike have waited patiently since Monday to find out the name of the new arrival and fifth in line to the throne.     Joe Mullins has previously released images of what he predicted Prince George and Princess Charlotte would look like as they grew upThe name serves as a poignant tribute to Prince Charles\u0027 beloved great-uncle, mentor and \u0027honorary grandfather\u0027, Lord Mountbatten, who was killed in 1979 when the IRA placed a bomb in his fishing boat.   More than 100,000 bets were placed across the UK betting industry on the baby name, with both Albert and Arthur leading the way as the bookmakers\u0027 favourite.Legoland to give free entry to anyone called Louis after...Share this articleBut William and Kate have plumped for a moniker used for centuries across the Channel by the French, who have had 18 kings called Louis.    Following the baby\u0027s arrival, Prince Harry shifts down the line of succession to sixth place. The Duke of York, who was born second in line, has moved to seventh and Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie to eighth and ninth.             According to Mr Mullins\u0027 predictions the youngster will have blue eyes, dark blonde hair and full cheeksAndrew falling out of the top six means he will no longer have to ask the Queen for permission to marry - unlike Charles, William, George, Charlotte and Harry.The first six people in the line of succession must have the Queen\u0027s consent before they can marry on May 19, as set out by the Succession to the Crown Act 2013.The act\u0027s introduction also saw sex removed as a determining factor in the line of succession.It has also been claimed that the royal baby has been born a commoner.Royal historian Marlene Koenig told Town and Country: \u0027It sounds complicated, but in the UK, the only people who are not commoners are the Sovereign and peers of the realm, Duke, Marquess, Earl, Viscount, and Baron.\u0027  It was always thought that William and Kate would go on to have three children.Kate is one of three and had a happy home life with her sister, Pippa Matthews, and brother, James Middleton, and is close to both of her siblings.But William may need to adjust to caring for a newborn once again.Kate joked in the months leading up to her due date that her husband was \u0027in denial\u0027 about having a third.By having more than two children, William and Kate are following in the footsteps of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, who went on to have four children - although there was a gap of 10 years between their second child, Anne, and third, Andrew. Is this what royal baby could look like?

Workshops will be run to give parents ‘simple, straightforward strategies’ which they can take home and use with pre-school children.Mr Hinds said last night: ‘We know there is a gap in child development that can be visible at age five. The easiest way to measure it is the “word gap”.‘Where you are, in development terms, at age five and at the start of school, obviously makes a significant difference to your ability to get the most out of infant school and then junior school education.’The OUP report found that when children arrive unable to understand basic phrases, they find it much harder to follow commands, make friends and learn how to read. In the long term, it can lead to low confidence, underachievement and poor behaviour.      Music lessons boosts a child’s brainpower as their memory...Is this Britain\u0027s most hipster school? Children at new...Share this articleMr Hinds said he wanted to provide more support to parents to help them feel comfortable reading to their children and interacting with them so they can develop their social skills. He added that he and wife Jacqui, a teacher, had enjoyed reading books with their three children. ‘Reading to children obviously makes a huge difference,’ he said. ‘Many, many parents spend an awful lot of time doing that.‘The important thing is to be reading, and to be giving feedback, and sitting together, and all of those things that parents dedicate so much time to.’Mr Hinds – who became Education Secretary in January, taking over from Justine Greening – said: ‘Schools do a great job on accelerating development. But it is still the case that with the differences that are discernible even at age five or sometimes even before, it is all too depressingly predictable what some of the later differences in attainment will be at 16 or 18.‘The earliest years are where there is the greatest leverage for improving social mobility and improving children’s opportunity to fulfil their potential.’          Experts say disadvantaged children are disproportionately affected by the growing problem (file photo)However, he said some parents – especially those juggling many different responsibilities or jobs – may be finding it hard to dedicate enough time to helping their children develop skills.He said: ‘It’s always hard for parents and, yes, there are extra pressures in the modern world. It is difficult. Parents know that, and that’s why it’s so important when you can find ways… for professionals to give hints and tips to make it easier – I think that’s something that parents can find very valuable.’Today Mr Hinds is launching a £5 million pilot scheme in the North of England to help parents teach their children vocabulary at home through reading and singing nursery rhymes. It will be run by the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) and will provide workshops in nurseries, community centres and homes. The projects found to be most effective could later be rolled out across the country.In addition, £8.5 million has been made available to councils across the country for language and literacy development projects for disadvantaged children.EEF chief executive Sir Kevan Collins said: ‘By testing different ways of tackling issues like the early years “word gap”, this new fund will give us much-needed information about how we can give parents the tools they need to give their child the very best start in life.’"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/18/09/05D76DB9000003E8-0-image-a-27_1524038970727.jpg","title":"Murray swaps tennis strokes brush strokes","story":"    The two-time Wimbledon winner has picked up a brush while recovering from injuryThe father of two – whose wife Kim Sears paints pet portraits – is due to make a comeback soon after hip surgery in January.

I tried to see if I could see the scuff of the ball and the heel of his shoe in the paint.It could even be seen as a self-portrait in an abstract way because it represents him, the tennis player.I could almost see him with racquet in one hand and his tennis ball covered in paint in the other, whacking a ball against the canvas. But we’ve got to be a little bit tongue-in-cheek. I wouldn’t imagine that he’s saying, ‘I’m an artist’. But perhaps his wife Kim Sears, who is a fantastic dog portraitist, has had a great influence on him.If Pollock had picked up a tennis racquet we wouldn’t have said he’s going to win Wimbledon tomorrow.

There was quite a lot of bruising around and suffering.’Footage also showed calves in small hutches, each one surrounded by a metal fence. Farmers can take newborn calves from their mothers to these hutches for the first eight weeks of their lives. But Viva said ear-tag data suggested these calves were 16 weeks old and too big for the hutches, breaching welfare rules.A few miles away in south Devon is Halswell Farm, part of the Arla dairy organisation. It is the UK’s second largest dairy firm supplying milk to supermarkets and owns popular brands such as Cravendale and Anchor butter.At Halswell, Viva found an old, apparently emaciated cow with an injured back leg that was barely able to walk. Miss Gellatley added: ‘There were also countless examples of shockingly oversized and distorted udders.’ Viva has complained about both farms to the watchdog for farm animal welfare, the Animal \u0026amp Plant Health Agency. But the Carpenter family’s solicitors, Clarke Willmott, said a vet had examined its cows on April 19.It said ‘no animal welfare issues were identified’. And it described the claims as ‘vague’ and ‘inaccurate’, denying cows were emaciated.Arla issued a statement on behalf of itself and Halswell Farm, which is part of the Red Tractor scheme, which means it is independently inspected. It said: ‘Over 2,400 farmers are part of the farmer-owned Arla Foods. This footage is not representative of their farming methods or their approach to animal welfare.’ It added: ‘This farm was visited by an independent vet and Red Tractor and there were no immediate welfare concerns from either independent party.’Michael Oakes, of the National Farmers Union, said: ‘The reality is animals, just like humans, can occasionally receive injuries or be treated for different conditions.

The Koreas had used the same time zone for decades before the North created its own Pyongyang Time in 2015 by setting the clock 30 minutes behind South Korea and Japan. While Pyongyang says it will close its nuclear test site next month, Kim and Moon did not outline concrete measures to be taken to achieve that goal of denuclearization. Trump\u0027s new national security adviser John Bolton said in an interview with CBS News, also aired Sunday, that Kim may have \u0027concrete and tangible\u0027 ideas about giving up his nuclear arms program \u0027and we should hear him out.\u0027But he and Pompeo cautioned that North Korea has a history of reneging on its commitments.

It cannot simply be a take it or leave it choice as the Prime Minister has suggested.‘This amendment, which has cross-party support, would provide a safety net in the Brexit process. \u0027It would remove the possibility of a “No” vote leading to a no-deal.

The deal would create a new titan with a bigger market share than Tesco, but it will be closely scrutinised by the Competition and Markets AuthorityThe fact they are considering the tie-up shows the massive changes that have swept the UK grocery business in the past few years.German discounters Aldi and Lidl are growing at a ferocious pace, keeping prices far below what British rivals can offer and wooing the middle class with an increasingly high-end range of food.Any efforts by the merged group to cut their costs is sure to draw a robust response from the Germans.And unlike Sainsbury’s, which is listed on the stock market and must make profits or suffer a fall in its share price, they can afford to lose money for an extended period of time if it helps them win the battle.Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said it is vital that the CMA takes action.The former business secretary said: ‘The competition inquiry has to focus on the customers, that is their job.’Labour’s business spokesman, Rebecca Long-Bailey, said: ‘This merger risks squeezing what little competition there is in the groceries market even further and moves alarmingly close to the creation of a supermarket monopoly.’ The deal will be a crucial first test for former Tory MP Andrew Tyrie, the ex-head of the Treasury select committee, who is taking over as CMA chairman later this year.Retail analyst Richard Hyman said: ‘This is an enormous deal and there are huge ramifications. The strengthening of buying power is key but no one in this market is going to come close to matching Aldi on price.          The chains serve very different customers, with Sainsbury’s focusing on the middle class while Asda targets customers chasing a bargain and has a greater presence in the North‘Aldi is family-owned and in it for the long term – if it needs to not make money for a few years, then it will.’Tesco is also likely to respond vigorously to the takeover.Its chief executive, Dave Lewis, is on the brink of completing a major turnaround push at the company and is sure to take aggressive action to stop that being undermined by the rise of the new empire.Last night it was unclear exactly what form the tie-up will take, with Asda’s owner, US retail giant Walmart, expected to retain a significant stake in the new organisation. This could be done in several ways, including by buying a large number of Sainsbury’s shares or keeping a holding in Asda and running it as a joint venture.The deal will also give Sainsbury’s and Asda an opportunity to boost the non-food products they offer. Asda has a popular clothing range, George, which serves 800,000 customers a week online alone.Sainsbury’s bought high street chain Argos for £1.4billion in 2016 and has since shut dozens of its stores, replacing them with around 200 Argos outlets inside its supermarkets.Sainsbury’s Tu range of clothes is now available from Argos stores as well.There will inevitably be speculation that Argos shops will now open inside Asda.Mr Hyman added that the Sainsbury’s buying team will be able to boost Asda’s ranges, which are seen by many analysts as tired.Full details of the deal are being revealed in a stock market announcement this morning."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/30/01/4BB150CA00000578-5672455-image-m-34_1525047617415.jpg","title":"Tesla autopilot saves driver collision semi truck","story":"    Jeremy Visnesky was driving through North Carolina on I-95 when a semi driver \u0027decided to nod off or play with his phone or something\u0027 and drifted into the Model X\u0027s lane while passing          The Tesla\u0027s Autopilot system appears to detect the intrusion, triggering a quick evasive swerve toward the other edge of its lane to dodge the truckBut on this occasion, the Tesla\u0027s high-powered Autopilot computer intervened which saw the car also move to the right, out of the way of danger. It all happened so quickly there was barely enough time to even slam the horn, but the Tesla computer\u0027s intervention surely saved the car from being scraped by the truck - or something even worse. Driver Jeremy Visnesky posted the video online and wrote: \u0027I-95 south driving through North Carolina and a semi decided to nod off or play with his phone or something.

Indeed, in what appeared to be an effort to crack a joke, self-deprecating Kim Jong-un told the South’s Mr Moon that he was sorry that the timing of the early morning missile test had led to him being woken up at an anti-social hour.This sudden change in mood music raises an intriguing question: could this young despot might be positioning himself as his region’s version of Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet Communist leader whose overtures to the West helped bring about the end of the Cold War?Of course, reading tea-leaves from Pyongyang is often a mug’s game, given that little is known regarding even very basic details of life inside the secretive far-Left dictatorship. The country is largely closed to foreign reporters and visitors, aside from those who visit on closely chaperoned tours, and foreign diplomats have little access to reliable intelligence.There is no free press, and the country’s version of the internet, the kwangmyong, which is largely used by academics and civil servants, reportedly permits access to a mere 28 websites.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tells Kim Jong Un that he...Dennis Rodman claims he\u0027s responsible for easing tension...Share this articleYet what little we do know about Kim Jong-un suggests that his life has given him far more of an understanding of Western values than either his immediate predecessor and father, Kim Jong-il, or his grandfather Kim Il-Sung, who ruled the country with an iron fist from 1948 until his death in 1994.Crucial in this context is the fact that, aged 15, Jong-un was sent to an exclusive international college near Berne in Switzerland, before moving to the nearby Liebefeld-Steinholzli state school.Living there under a pseudonym, Un Pak, he was described to classmates as the son of a diplomat.Though apparently displaying little academic prowess, he developed a lifelong passion for Disney films and basketball, becoming a supporter of the pre-eminent U.S. team of the era, the Chicago Bulls.The team’s former star player Dennis Rodman has in recent years conducted several high-profile visits to Pyongyang.Nowadays a reality TV personality, with multiple tattoos and piercings, Rodman was almost certainly paid for the privilege.          \u0027U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last night said there was now real opportunity for a nuclear deal\u0027However there was also some truth in the suggestion that, as he put it, the visits helped to ‘break the ice’ between the nations. The Washington Post newspaper went so far last year as to speculate that Trump had given a 2017 visit his blessing, as a way to open a channel of communication between the countries.Aside from basketball, the young Kim Jong-un is said to have developed a passion for ‘rosti’ – the calorie-laden Swiss national potato dish in the style of a fritter, which contributed to his subsequent obesity — and spent plenty of time on his host nation’s ski slopes.Perhaps that explains why he has not only recently ordered the construction of Masik Pass — a new multi-million-pound ski resort — but was also anxious to send a large delegation to this year’s Winter Olympics, which were held in the South. A large orchestra, and squad of cheerleaders, turned out to support the North Korean team, while several diplomats met their counterparts from over the border, helping build momentum for last week’s summit.          \u0027Kim Jong-un’s wife Ri Sol-Ju is believed to have provided informal elocution lessons\u0027Time in the West also gave Kim Jong-un a far more cultured manner than his father, who was almost never heard speaking publicly (TV tended to voiceover images of his addresses), and whose absurdly-shrill real voice was only revealed when tape recordings were leaked of his calls to a kidnapped South Korean actress he was obsessed with.As a result, Kim Jong-un’s address on Friday, at which he described the two Koreas as ‘one nation’ who would in future ‘share in prosperity’ was confidently delivered.His wife Ri Sol-Ju is believed to have provided informal elocution lessons.Another key factor behind Kim Jong-Un’s sudden conversion to the pursuit of peace is likely to be straightforward pragmatism.Indeed, there are those who believe that, rather from being hot headed and impulsive, he is actually a calculating premier. To thisend, it’s worth noting that when he took office in 2011, at the tender age of 29, Kim Jong-un promised to bring his people prosperity and give their nation status as a nuclear power.Years of sanctions have since crippled North Korea’s economy, with its entire annual GDP of $40 billion coming in at under 2 per cent that of the South. Though it has been partly propped up by China, that support is thought to have evaporated after recent missile tests, with Beijing anxious to avoid economic refugees heading over its border.Abandoning nuclear ambitions will therefore give Kim Jong-un a sporting chance of keeping at least one of his promises.Indeed reports from Friday’s state dinner with the South suggest that — having put away a few glasses of champagne — he somewhat unexpectedly confessed that he was ‘embarrassed’ by his nation’s ‘poor infrastructure’ and determined to do something about it.That could just be the drink talking (there is some suggestion that he looked ‘bleary eyed’ during the meal) but it seems apparent even a mild thaw in relations will at this stage serve the interest of almost every player in the region, and also the U.S. (since Mr Trump can present it as a diplomatic triumph).In the longer term, of course, the big question is whether Kim Jong-un will actually keep his promises of nuclear disarmament.A decade ago, for example, foreign journalists were invited to watch his regime destroying a nuclear reactor cooling tower, in an effort to stave off sanctions. Yet it later turned out that, behind the scenes, they were already building a second facility.This time, cynics wonder if something similar is afoot. Indeed some analysts believe that the Punggye-ri underground test site, which he has so graciously pledged to publicly destroy, is in fact already useless because previous tests have caused structural damage.Mr Kim of course insists otherwise, using Friday’s State banquet to inform the South that the facility contains at least two tunnels which are currently in ‘good condition’. And so the ‘Rocket Man’ continues to rebrand himself as a man of peace — while the world prays he’s telling the truth. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/29/08/4080C15100000578-0-image-a-14_1524987946127.jpg","title":"Home ownership young families plummets Britain","story":"London Mayor Sadiq Khan calls for Amber Rudd to resign over...Cavoodle puppies stolen from pet store as police hunt down...Share this articleThe figures have emerged from an investigation overseen by think tank Resolution Foundation and chaired by former universities minister David Willetts, reports The Guardian.Analysis completed as part of the inquiry uncovered the fact that young people have no choice but to fork out their wages on housing which is both overcrowded and far from work - forcing them into long commutes. Shockingly, millennials are only expected to have reached the same level of home ownership as the previous generation by the time they are 45 - and that\u0027s with good economic conditions.Although some lucky young people will be at the receiving end of fast-growing inheritances from family members, close to a half of millennials who do not own homes do not have parents with their own property either.

Workshops will be run to give parents ‘simple, straightforward strategies’ which they can take home and use with pre-school children.Mr Hinds said last night: ‘We know there is a gap in child development that can be visible at age five. The easiest way to measure it is the “word gap”.‘Where you are, in development terms, at age five and at the start of school, obviously makes a significant difference to your ability to get the most out of infant school and then junior school education.’The OUP report found that when children arrive unable to understand basic phrases, they find it much harder to follow commands, make friends and learn how to read.

He added that he and wife Jacqui, a teacher, had enjoyed reading books with their three children. ‘Reading to children obviously makes a huge difference,’ he said. ‘Many, many parents spend an awful lot of time doing that.‘The important thing is to be reading, and to be giving feedback, and sitting together, and all of those things that parents dedicate so much time to.’Mr Hinds – who became Education Secretary in January, taking over from Justine Greening – said: ‘Schools do a great job on accelerating development. But it is still the case that with the differences that are discernible even at age five or sometimes even before, it is all too depressingly predictable what some of the later differences in attainment will be at 16 or 18.‘The earliest years are where there is the greatest leverage for improving social mobility and improving children’s opportunity to fulfil their potential.’          Experts say disadvantaged children are disproportionately affected by the growing problem (file photo)However, he said some parents – especially those juggling many different responsibilities or jobs – may be finding it hard to dedicate enough time to helping their children develop skills.He said: ‘It’s always hard for parents and, yes, there are extra pressures in the modern world. It is difficult. Parents know that, and that’s why it’s so important when you can find ways… for professionals to give hints and tips to make it easier – I think that’s something that parents can find very valuable.’Today Mr Hinds is launching a £5 million pilot scheme in the North of England to help parents teach their children vocabulary at home through reading and singing nursery rhymes. It will be run by the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) and will provide workshops in nurseries, community centres and homes. The projects found to be most effective could later be rolled out across the country.In addition, £8.5 million has been made available to councils across the country for language and literacy development projects for disadvantaged children.EEF chief executive Sir Kevan Collins said: ‘By testing different ways of tackling issues like the early years “word gap”, this new fund will give us much-needed information about how we can give parents the tools they need to give their child the very best start in life.’"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/30/01/4BAF93C000000578-5672113-image-a-47_1525049401960.jpg","title":"Disturbing dairy farm footage shows apparently emaciated calves","story":"    A calf at Halswell Farm in south Devon, apparently emaciated with an injured back leg making it barely able to walk          A cow at the farm hobbles around with its head lowered, seemingly injuredThe latter is among hundreds of farms that supply milk to supermarkets and for many top brands.Some cows on both farms have their rear legs shackled together to prevent them from splaying, causing serious injury, when delivering calves.The footage was taken by campaigning group Viva, which is opposed to the consumption of meat and dairy products. It claims the scenes are typical of modern dairy farming.The organisation says the cows are bred to be ‘udders on legs’ and claims many suffer problems with their legs and feet as well as udder infections.The last hours of a gentle giant tortured to death: Shocking...Don\u0027t mess with my Mum!

There was quite a lot of bruising around and suffering.’Footage also showed calves in small hutches, each one surrounded by a metal fence. Farmers can take newborn calves from their mothers to these hutches for the first eight weeks of their lives. But Viva said ear-tag data suggested these calves were 16 weeks old and too big for the hutches, breaching welfare rules.A few miles away in south Devon is Halswell Farm, part of the Arla dairy organisation. It is the UK’s second largest dairy firm supplying milk to supermarkets and owns popular brands such as Cravendale and Anchor butter.At Halswell, Viva found an old, apparently emaciated cow with an injured back leg that was barely able to walk. Miss Gellatley added: ‘There were also countless examples of shockingly oversized and distorted udders.’ Viva has complained about both farms to the watchdog for farm animal welfare, the Animal \u0026amp Plant Health Agency. But the Carpenter family’s solicitors, Clarke Willmott, said a vet had examined its cows on April 19.It said ‘no animal welfare issues were identified’. And it described the claims as ‘vague’ and ‘inaccurate’, denying cows were emaciated.Arla issued a statement on behalf of itself and Halswell Farm, which is part of the Red Tractor scheme, which means it is independently inspected. It said: ‘Over 2,400 farmers are part of the farmer-owned Arla Foods. This footage is not representative of their farming methods or their approach to animal welfare.’ It added: ‘This farm was visited by an independent vet and Red Tractor and there were no immediate welfare concerns from either independent party.’Michael Oakes, of the National Farmers Union, said: ‘The reality is animals, just like humans, can occasionally receive injuries or be treated for different conditions.

The Koreas had used the same time zone for decades before the North created its own Pyongyang Time in 2015 by setting the clock 30 minutes behind South Korea and Japan. While Pyongyang says it will close its nuclear test site next month, Kim and Moon did not outline concrete measures to be taken to achieve that goal of denuclearization. Trump\u0027s new national security adviser John Bolton said in an interview with CBS News, also aired Sunday, that Kim may have \u0027concrete and tangible\u0027 ideas about giving up his nuclear arms program \u0027and we should hear him out.\u0027But he and Pompeo cautioned that North Korea has a history of reneging on its commitments. Bolton said that a recent absence of weapons and missile tests by North Korea \u0027could be a very positive sign\u0027 or a sign that the programs have reached advanced stages and testing is no longer needed.

In June 2008, international broadcasters were allowed to air the demolition of a cooling tower at the Nyongbyon reactor site, a year after the North reached an agreement with the U.S. and four other nations to disable its nuclear facilities in return for an aid package worth about $400 million.But the deal eventually collapsed after North Korea refused to accept U.S.-proposed verification methods, and the country went on to conduct its second nuclear test detonation in May 2009. Pompeo also said that at Trump\u0027s direction, he spoke with Kim about the release of three U.S. citizens detained by North Korea.

It cannot simply be a take it or leave it choice as the Prime Minister has suggested.‘This amendment, which has cross-party support, would provide a safety net in the Brexit process. \u0027It would remove the possibility of a “No” vote leading to a no-deal. It would bring back control to Parliament.’          Jacob Rees-Mogg, chairman of the Tory backbench European Research Group, warned last week that peers risked voting themselves into extinction by attempting to thwart BrexitLord Callanan, the Brexit Minister in the Lords, said: ‘This flawed amendment seeks to tie our hands by inserting false deadlines and shifting the power to negotiate from Government to Parliament. \u0027It asks for meaningless votes on the deal before the deal is done.‘Those who want to overturn the referendum call this the “no Brexit” amendment. \u0027The Conservatives are taking the scrutinising role of Parliament seriously, to improve an essential piece of legislation. Labour are using it to frustrate Brexit.’Remain-backing peers have so far inflicted six defeats on the EU Withdrawal Bill, which proposes powers for ministers to change regulations with limited parliamentary scrutiny.Ministers argue the powers are needed to ensure that thousands of EU regulations are transferred on to the UK’s statute book before Brexit. But peers are using amendments to the Bill in a bid to soften the Government’s negotiating stance, including inflicting a defeat earlier this month on the issue of leaving the customs union.Jacob Rees-Mogg, chairman of the Tory backbench European Research Group, warned last week that peers risked voting themselves into extinction by attempting to thwart Brexit.He said the defeats on the legislation preparing for Brexit were a case of the ‘peers against the people’ and that they ‘have to decide whether they love ermine or the EU more’.‘They are trying to stop the largest ever public vote in our history,’ he said. ‘We are in a position of peers against the people.‘It is deeply unattractive and I think it is the weakest position for the House of Lords to be in.‘There is a problem with the House of Lords in that it is very condescending towards the democratic vote. \u0027They seem to think that they know better than 17.4million people.’"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/29/00/4BA835A000000578-0-image-a-7_1524957451359.jpg","title":"Hundreds stores close Sainsburys Asda plot merger","story":"    Sainsbury\u0027s and Asda could be forced to sell hundreds of stores if they are to win approval for their merger from the competition watchdogThe regulator could order the two chains to sell hundreds of stores before it approves the merger.And the CMA is likely to come under pressure to block the deal altogether to prevent consumers losing choice and to protect farmers, who rely on fair prices from the supermarkets to survive.The chains are thought to want to avoid store closures because they serve very different customers, with Sainsbury’s focusing on the middle class while Asda targets customers chasing a bargain and has a greater presence in the North.\u0027Keep the shops well lit\u0027: Last words of the man who founded...Asda stores set to become Sainsbury\u0027s if huge £15BILLION...Share this articleBoth brands are thought likely to continue to be used, even keeping their own head offices, but they are expected to combine their food buying teams and use new-found muscle to drive down prices.Their tie-up is the biggest change in food retailing since Morrisons swallowed Safeway 14 years ago.It will turn the Big Four grocers into the Big Three and will make the new group the largest of them all with a combined market share of 31.4 per cent versus Tesco’s 27.6 per cent.Combined, Asda and Sainsbury’s will have around 2,000 stores, almost 350,000 staff and annual sales of nearly £50billion.          The deal would create a new titan with a bigger market share than Tesco, but it will be closely scrutinised by the Competition and Markets AuthorityThe fact they are considering the tie-up shows the massive changes that have swept the UK grocery business in the past few years.German discounters Aldi and Lidl are growing at a ferocious pace, keeping prices far below what British rivals can offer and wooing the middle class with an increasingly high-end range of food.Any efforts by the merged group to cut their costs is sure to draw a robust response from the Germans.And unlike Sainsbury’s, which is listed on the stock market and must make profits or suffer a fall in its share price, they can afford to lose money for an extended period of time if it helps them win the battle.Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said it is vital that the CMA takes action.The former business secretary said: ‘The competition inquiry has to focus on the customers, that is their job.’Labour’s business spokesman, Rebecca Long-Bailey, said: ‘This merger risks squeezing what little competition there is in the groceries market even further and moves alarmingly close to the creation of a supermarket monopoly.’ The deal will be a crucial first test for former Tory MP Andrew Tyrie, the ex-head of the Treasury select committee, who is taking over as CMA chairman later this year.Retail analyst Richard Hyman said: ‘This is an enormous deal and there are huge ramifications. The strengthening of buying power is key but no one in this market is going to come close to matching Aldi on price.          The chains serve very different customers, with Sainsbury’s focusing on the middle class while Asda targets customers chasing a bargain and has a greater presence in the North‘Aldi is family-owned and in it for the long term – if it needs to not make money for a few years, then it will.’Tesco is also likely to respond vigorously to the takeover.Its chief executive, Dave Lewis, is on the brink of completing a major turnaround push at the company and is sure to take aggressive action to stop that being undermined by the rise of the new empire.Last night it was unclear exactly what form the tie-up will take, with Asda’s owner, US retail giant Walmart, expected to retain a significant stake in the new organisation. This could be done in several ways, including by buying a large number of Sainsbury’s shares or keeping a holding in Asda and running it as a joint venture.The deal will also give Sainsbury’s and Asda an opportunity to boost the non-food products they offer. Asda has a popular clothing range, George, which serves 800,000 customers a week online alone.Sainsbury’s bought high street chain Argos for £1.4billion in 2016 and has since shut dozens of its stores, replacing them with around 200 Argos outlets inside its supermarkets.Sainsbury’s Tu range of clothes is now available from Argos stores as well.There will inevitably be speculation that Argos shops will now open inside Asda.Mr Hyman added that the Sainsbury’s buying team will be able to boost Asda’s ranges, which are seen by many analysts as tired.Full details of the deal are being revealed in a stock market announcement this morning."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/30/01/4BB150CA00000578-5672455-image-m-34_1525047617415.jpg","title":"Tesla autopilot saves driver collision semi truck","story":"    Jeremy Visnesky was driving through North Carolina on I-95 when a semi driver \u0027decided to nod off or play with his phone or something\u0027 and drifted into the Model X\u0027s lane while passing          The Tesla\u0027s Autopilot system appears to detect the intrusion, triggering a quick evasive swerve toward the other edge of its lane to dodge the truckBut on this occasion, the Tesla\u0027s high-powered Autopilot computer intervened which saw the car also move to the right, out of the way of danger. It all happened so quickly there was barely enough time to even slam the horn, but the Tesla computer\u0027s intervention surely saved the car from being scraped by the truck - or something even worse. Driver Jeremy Visnesky posted the video online and wrote: \u0027I-95 south driving through North Carolina and a semi decided to nod off or play with his phone or something.

One of them, Jonas Bendiksen, a Norwegian photographer, has won international awards for his pictures of people just about as far away from home as can be – from isolated communities in newly independent states of the former Soviet Union to a book of photographs of urban slums around the world.Turning his camera toward the intimate, Bendiksen used the opportunity to track the arrival of his new baby daughter, Billie, through his wife Anna’s pregnancy to the birth. In publishing the pictures in Magnum’s book Bendiksen, who has a photojournalist’s distrust of the familiar, is apologetic about them. “These are some of the most important pictures I’ll ever take,” he notes. “But not because they are necessarily very interesting for others to see.” You have the sense he needn’t have worried.The picture on this page was the last of the home photographs Bendiksen took, showing Billie adrift on a table top amid the familiar plastic detritus of a children’s party. The deep infant sleep carries with it not only an ever-present trace of parental anxiety – what if Billie should roll? – but also an edge of lovely private comedy: what kind of world, of half-drunk dregs and abandoned shades and empty chairs has this child fallen into? In this week when baby photographs have been front-page news, it also goes to prove what newspaper picture editors have long known – that no other subject moves so effortlessly from the particular to the universal.Home, a collaboration between Fujifilm and Magnum Photos, runs from 18-27 May 2018 at the Vinyl Factory, London W1.

I check my watch: it’s five to two. “It’s not going to work today,” he sighs. “But this isn’t really work, this is just blah blah blah, it’s easy. The hard thing is writing things in the studio and thinking of stuff that’s interesting.”An afternoon nap might sound indulgent, but it is hard to fault 49-year-old Shrigley’s work ethic. An excellent new book is imminent: Fully Coherent Plan for a New and Better Society features 254 new illustrations, all drawn in his distinctive thick black pen on stark white paper, the naivety of the image offset by the scabrous, surreal or darkly comic text. He’s also the guest director of the 2018 Brighton festival (he moved to Brighton three years ago with his wife, Kim, and miniature schnauzer Inka, after 27 years in Glasgow). Shrigley has been involved in selecting performers for the festival – which features everything from art to comedy to music to a lot that is indescribable – and will be making several appearances himself.To that end, below us, in a large room that still has the stained-glass windows and pulpit from its days as a church, the finishing touches are being applied to Shrigley’s installation Life Model II. The work, which revisits a piece he made when he was nominated for the Turner prize in 2013, is an imposing 9ft nude woman with a severe fringe and long eyelashes that blink every so often. Surrounding the model are easels, paper and drawing materials, and visitors are invited to make a “life” drawing. These will then be tacked to the gallery walls and, in Shrigley’s mind, become artwork just as interesting as his original sculpture, if not more so.The show hasn’t yet opened when we meet, so on the walls are some examples from the last time Life Model II was shown, in Vienna, which will act as a “giddy-up” to the people of Brighton. “So they are drawings by Austrians,” says Shrigley, as though this fact might explain a lot.Life Model II is a just part of Shrigley’s contribution to the festival. What’s really disrupting his sleep right now is a new work called Problem in Brighton, which is billed as “an alt-rock pantomime” starring Pauline Knowles and Gavin Mitchell. In some ways it’s a companion piece to Shrigley’s 2011 “opera”, Pass the Spoon, but the truth is that even the artist is unsure what it will look and sound like.“I’ve always wanted to direct a performance on stage,” says Shrigley. “I did the opera thing a few years ago, but I didn’t direct that, I just wrote the words. But the word ‘pantomime’ suggests, ‘oh well, it’s a pantomime, it’s like a rubbish, funny play for children’. Then you say it’s ‘alt-rock’… I didn’t say ‘avant-garde’, because that’s pretentious. Basically I’ve set the bar really low, so I can do whatever I like and make a cacophonous noise.”Doing something totally different clearly appeals to Shrigley. Alongside his best-known work – the books and merch his 2012 solo show, Brain Activity, at London’s Hayward gallery his huge bronze thumb, titled Really Good, which until last month sat on the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square – he is also drawn to more esoteric commissions. In 2015, he designed a new mascot for the Scottish football club Partick Thistle he’s called Kingsley and looks like a furious sun. He’s made music videos for Blur and Bonnie Prince Billy, and hosted pop-up tattoo stations, at which he draws directly on to people’s bodies and, if they like the result, they can have it inked permanently.Now, for the Observer, Shrigley is submitting himself to interrogation by our readers. At 6ft 5in, he’s not hard to spot – does he generally have pleasant interactions with the public? “They give me the fear, if I’m honest,” says Shrigley. “In Glasgow it used to be, ‘You’re that guy, aren’t ye?’ And I’d be like, ‘Aye, I am.’ Then he’d say, ‘I thought you were, right, I think you’re that guy. All the best to ye.’”Shrigley laughs, “The thing is, who was he talking about? Was he talking about me? We’ll never know.”Hans-Ulrich Obrist, artistic director of the Serpentine Galleries Don’t listen to people like me. Or Hans-Ulrich. There’s that famous statement: every generation invents rock’n’roll, or whatever it is, for itself. And every generation invents its art anew. So, don’t find excuses not to do it. I’m sure a lot of young people have more excuses than I did when I was in my early 20s: I was lucky, there were no fees to pay then. But yeah, if you want to do it, get on with it.Yinka Shonibare, artistTommy Cooper was funny. The thing about Tommy Cooper is that he walked on to the stage and people laughed. That’s magic, isn’t it? If you can just look at people and they start laughing. I’m not really a nostalgic person, but when I watch things from the 1970s, when I was a little kid, The Two Ronnies and Dad’s Army are still funny. I couldn’t really say that about a lot of other things that have happened in the interim.I like standup, but I don’t go to it often. When it’s good, you always think: “Why don’t I do this more often?” Just laughing for a whole hour, it’s so therapeutic. But then you see something that isn’t that funny and you’re like, “Shall we go to the bar?” and you realise why you don’t do it so often. It’s very subjective as well. My wife and I went to see Stewart Lee and then we went to see an American guy whose name I can’t remember. She really liked the American guy and didn’t like Stewart Lee. And I was like: “How can you not like Stewart Lee?” And she said, “I think it’s a man thing. He’s just so bloody clever.” And that’s a criticism. That’s part of the reason I like him: because he is so bloody clever. Anyway, subjective, innit?Jess Kidd, authorRight, a bank holiday weekend – because it’s bound to be raining, isn’t it? So you’re indoors with this bloody ghost. I’m actually reading Jess Kidd’s book at the moment, which is all about ghosts. Anyway, who would it be? It would have to be Duchamp, because he could perhaps teach me to play chess – he was one of the best chess players in France. People have taught me to play chess before but it’s never stuck, so I’d like to go over it with him. And I could sit there in the park playing and tell people: “Well, Marcel Duchamp taught me to play…” Actually no: “The ghost of Marcel Duchamp taught me to play chess.” That would be cool.It would probably take longer than a weekend. Obviously there’d be a lot of questions I’d want to ask him: Duchamp is a kind of god, or a touchstone. And if Duchamp wasn’t available then Andy Warhol, but Duchamp would be my first choice.Sir Nicholas Serota, chair of Arts Council EnglandWell, I live in Brighton, so that’s really handy. And part of the reason they need a guest director as a marketing figurehead is because it is so disparate in terms of the things that are on. It’s very difficult to pull them all together into one unified blurb, other than: it’s here and there’s lots of really good things on. My programming was basically sending a list by email to somebody and, fortunately for me, a lot of the things came to be. So Deerhoof and Ezra Furman and Bridget Christie among others: Deerhoof are one of my favourite bands, Ezra Furman I’ve never seen before and Bridget Christie, I missed her show as well. So it was a way of filling in the gaps and not having to go to London and get the vomit express back at the end of the evening.Emma Jane Unsworth, authorWho! Who! Who! I let the dog out at 6am, and I don’t know why she wakes up at 6am but it’s always me that has to take her out. And it’s only when we’re in Brighton. We spend part of our time in Devon and she gets up at 8am when we’re in Devon. I think it’s the seagulls that wake her up here. Anyway, I’ve taken to wearing shorts in bed, so I don’t have to take my pyjamas off, I just go out in shorts and a coat and wander like a zombie around the block. She does what she has to do and then we go back to bed for another two hours.Evie Wyld, novelistI don’t like frogs and toads very much. They look, particularly toads, like dirt when you see them from a distance. I saw one on the doorstep the other day and I thought it was dog shit. I wish them well, toads, I wish them long, healthy lives, but if you said, “Would you like me to put a toad on your bare chest right now?” I’d say: “Absolutely not.”Ezra Furman, musicianI think they’re both. For some people they can be quite annoying, if you look at them too much. I’m aware of that. As an artist, you have to do what you’ve gotta do. There is some cathartic thing about making art: if you don’t get it out, it’ll fester inside and damage you somehow. I do feel a bit like that. So it’s healthy for me to make art whether it’s healthy for other people to look at it, I don’t know.Amanda Palmer, singerI guess so, but sometimes I misunderstand lyrics. There’s a famous old blues song called He’s a Mighty Good Leader Beck did a version of it on one of his early albums. I really liked it, but I always thought the lyric was, “Is the monarch a leader?” and it was only fairly recently that the Beck album was reissued on vinyl and I realised, Oooh… yeah: is the monarch a leader? And a picture of the royal family: are they a leader? Or is it just a token office?I’ve made a couple of pop promos in my life. I’d do it for Beck but not for anybody else. Now Mark E Smith is dead, Beck is probably the only one I’d do it for. But not this year, I’m too busy.Matt Haig, novelist (who lives in Brighton)I love it. It was hard to leave Glasgow and Brighton was probably the one other place I’ve always felt really at home. It’s my kind of people in Brighton, it’s by the sea, and the weather’s better than Glasgow.But it depends where you live as well. I’ve never actually met Matt but we have a friend in common, so doubtless I will soon. I think he lives in Hove, while I’m in Kemptown. The bad thing about Kemptown is that it’s full of dogshit and lunatics. And I suspect Hove isn’t. I’m not talking about homeless people, I’m just talking about genuinely mad people, barking at the moon, who live in houses and who are mad. To wit, the day after we moved in, I’d parked the car on the pavement and I was unloading it. Some guy was walking down the street and he was wearing a pair of shorts, flip-flops, a cowboy hat and a pair of sunglasses, and he had “Get High” written in lipstick on his chest. This was about 8.30am and he was smoking a joint and he said: “You can’t park like that, mate. I’m just telling ya.”Now, I like that, but I’d like to be like the people who come from a different part of town just to visit, to look at Mr Get High.Ed Vaizey, Conservative MP for WantageOh yeah, I know your mum. My mum lives with maybe two and they are both ceramic pieces, because she threw away all the rest. She and my dad between them discarded all of my work, probably shortly after I left home for art school. I’d say they’ve come to appreciate it a bit more over time. There was a watershed moment where there was some documentary about me on TV and overnight they went from knowing nothing to everything about what I did for a living. That’s not to say my parents haven’t been supportive, because they have they just didn’t really have any interest in art.Also, to be fair to them, I’m slightly less bothered about them throwing the artwork away than I was about them throwing away all my football programmes. I had the programme to the 1979 European Cup final, Nottingham Forest’s moment of glory. Don’t know where that is. Gone.Peter Jenkinson, co-founder of Culture+ConflictWell, it can’t always tell you which artworks are mine and which works just look like mine, for example. On Google image search there are works that are erroneously attributed to me, and then people invite you to participate in something that they’re curating and they say: “We love your work! Could we reproduce this image on the brochure?” And it’s not one of your images. Then you have to say: “You don’t like my work as much as you think you do.” So Google image search – problem.Dan Guthrie, Stroud, GloucsThe difficult thing about answering any question about what is or isn’t art is that even before you’ve finished making the statement as to what art is or what art isn’t, you think of an exception, a contradiction to what you’ve just said. You realise you’re wrong even before you’ve finished saying it.But, just for the sake of argument: stuff that’s in hotel rooms. Authorless, inkjet prints on canvas, you have to say that isn’t really art. It just looks like art but it isn’t art.Ally Ferguson, GlasgowIt’s very difficult to say. When I was looking for somewhere to study, I found Glasgow really exciting and different and mysterious. It was everything the suburbs of Leicester, where I grew up, weren’t. It probably took about 12 years for that to wear off and then suddenly I realised I was sort of a Glaswegian. This was my home. I can’t really remember my childhood in the East Midlands that well, but Glasgow is still very vivid. I lived there from when I was 19 to when I was 47 – teenage to middle age – and it was only three years ago that I left – it’s the biggest part of my life.Emma Richardson, BedfordGlad you enjoyed it. I guess when you make something that you invite somebody to draw, it’s going to look like what you’ve made. But their drawings can also be a critique of the work, perhaps, and it’s an acknowledgement that everybody sees an artwork differently – on a metaphorical level as well as a literal level. What I like about it is that it’s a nice inclusive work. I tend to hate all the big sculptures I’ve made after a while. But I like this one because I don’t look at it any more, I look at the people’s drawings, so it’s like going to a different exhibition every time. I just ignore the big person.Matt Wilson, MadridLeighton BuzzardYeah, the most difficult thing is to know whether it’s any good. That tends to change depending on what mood you’re in. Knowing whether it’s finished? Well, with a drawing, it has to be because all of the paper is covered. Then it’s definitely finished.William Tallan, AyrshireNo. We are not getting relegated, first of all. At the time of writing, we’ve got to play Ross County and we’ve got to play Hamilton. Win both of those games, we could feasibly be out of the shit we’re in. So first of all let’s think positive. Second of all, no. I’m not going to update Kingsley. Kingsley will be as he is and he will be there next season if we have to achieve promotion again.Selma Montford , honorary secretary of the Brighton Society 1973-2016I don’t think it’s clever, for the record. And it’s my handwriting, right, so what you’re objecting to is my handwriting. It’s like you’re basically objecting to me and there’s nothing I can do about that. I accept that. That’s why I don’t correspond by social media. It’s transmit only, I’m afraid, with social media. Because otherwise you’re just opening yourself – it’s a conduit to everyone in the world, some of whom are going to be really nasty to you.Sion Williams, Ruthin, north WalesYes, I do have a Moleskine notebook, as you might imagine, as every other note-taker does. I was in Glasgow one day, before we left, in the Botanic Gardens near where we lived, and I was making a little drawing, sitting on a bench. I overheard two guys walking past and they went: “Police.” How far from the truth can you be?Stefano Turato, EdinburghSelf-delusion probably. I’ve come to realise that self-delusion is quite important if you want to be an artist: “Oh, that doesn’t tally with my view of myself” – just ignore it. That’s the way my brain works. If you want to do something, you’ve got to ignore things that are unhelpful and that’s what I do.Mike Abbott, Limoges, FranceIt is my finger, yes. I think it’s my left hand because I’ve got a wonky nail on my left hand where my school friends trod on my finger when I was 10. Does it reference Lord Kitchener? In a sense the image functions in the same way as that famous recruitment poster but it isn’t a direct reference to that image.I don’t really make photographs any more – I stopped after the changeover to digital. Though that might be a digital picture actually, but I mostly stopped making photographic art in the early 2000s. I just stopped being interested in physical paper photographs. You start taking pictures on your phone and now there’s Instagram and that somehow seems to be enough: to make digital images and stick them on there.Luke, CopenhagenYeah, it’s a bad idea it’s been done. We’ve all got to be unique. Get “Finger” tattooed on your toe, that’s my advice. As far as I know that hasn’t been done and I’ll happily provide the text.Fully Coherent Plan for a New and Better Society is out on Thursday (Canongate, £14.99).

The pair have a combined workforce of 360,000 people and the merged company would leapfrog Tesco to become the UK’s biggest private sector employer. Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, said the proposed merger could create “even more concentrated local monopolies” and challenged Andrew Tyrie, the incoming boss of the Competition and Markets Authority regulator, to reverse a history of “spineless” inquiries by conducting a robust investigation.“This is an early test for Andrew Tyrie and an important one,” Cable said. “The CMA really needs to show some teeth after previously being soft in its remedies in the audit, banking and energy sectors.”Last year, the CMA waved through Tesco’s £3.7bn takeover of cash-and-carry group Booker despite warning by rivals it could drive them out of businessAndrew Simms, the co-director of the New Weather Institute thinktank and the author of Tescopoly, said: “This is profoundly not in the public interest. It’s going to have negative consequences for consumers and all the along the grocery supply chain.”Sainsbury’s will publish a statement fleshing out the terms of the agreement on Monday morning at 7am. The shares-based deal is expected to create a combined company worth £15bn including debt, led by current Sainsbury’s boss Mike Coupe. It is envisaged that his opposite number at Asda, Roger Burnley, will report to Coupe.The proposed new retail giant will have 2,800 stores and annual sales of more than £50bn. The plan is to retain both retail brands because they have different heartlands and attract different sorts of shoppers.One senior industry source said that Walmart had been trying to sell the struggling Asda chain for some time. The deal brokered with Sainsbury was, he said, evidence the US retailer was “flying the white flag” after failing to conquer the UK market during the near two decades it has owned the Leeds-based grocer.Talks between the two businesses have been going on for more than a year, with the deal based on pooling buying power to offer lower prices at the checkout – rather than closing stores or cutting jobs. The Qatar Investment Authority, the sovereign wealth fund that is currently Sainsbury’s biggest shareholder, is said to be supportive of the plan.It is thought the CMA has already been in advanced discussions with Sainsbury’s and Asda as the regulator’s guidance states that “businesses are strongly encouraged to approach the CMA to discuss their merger ... on a confidential basis” before formally notifying the regulator."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4ceb62ccd27aebb8de48c44484de92a8267acfe/0_354_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d82c6dc39e111eb140234e2b269eaa98","title":"local elections political engagement voter turnout polly toynbee","story":"Tory losses would send the message that council services must be protected, and that Britain demands an end to austerityThe shift to inidual voter registration risked knocking out the young, students no longer registered by universities, renters and ethnic minorities. The voter ID pilot this week will show whether yet another gerrymander in the voting system deters those – more likely to be Labour – arriving at polling stations without passports or driving licences.People vote in locals on national politics, sadly less on the quality of their local council. The very best and worst councils are swept in and out by the state of politics at Westminster, a brutal fact for the undervalued aeons of time councillors give, taking more brickbats than bravos. The iron law says governments lose council seats mid-term, oppositions surge.Party spinners are glumming down, energetically rubbishing their prospects to manage expectations. Prof Philip Cowley of Queen Mary College says, “Labour is set for its best results in 40 years.” But those expecting Labour to capture Tory flagships – Barnet, Wandsworth, Westminster – even Kensington and Chelsea, set the bar high. Outside London, Labour could take Tory Trafford, Swindon and Plymouth, but much depends on who captures Ukip’s 163 seats.The Tories pretend they’ll be happy just to cling on to Bexley. Labour’s humble pitch by shadow communities secretary Andrew Gwynne is, “Any gains on top of where we were in 2014 would be quite an achievement.” But he points to the open goals: cuts to NHS, police, schools, stagnant wages, dismal housebuilding.Labour could risk more boldness, because the Tory Brexit civil war is about to turn bloody. Theresa May delays the Commons vote on the customs union to its limit, but the crunch is coming. She keeps proclaiming a red line she cannot hold. Rees-Moggites make bloodcurdling threats that they will decapitate her if she takes one step towards compromise. Cabinet walkouts are predicted, Boris Johnson eager to challenge. A Brexit red mist threatens to overcome the party that traditionally put power ahead of all else.Brexit overlays and confuses these local elections too, all political life now refracted and fractured by that great ide. Many EU citizens denied a referendum ballot will be able to vote this time: will they use it to hit back? Will there be a new cohort of Windrush-energised ethnic-minority voters? If so, Labour should sweep the board. But they have most to lose if predicted gains fail.Despite the financial handcuffs, it matters who runs your council: Labour cities are better run than ever, with a higher calibre of leaders than I’ve ever known, from Newcastle and Liverpool to Manchester, Leeds and London boroughs. These elections matter for the sake of all who rely on good council services, above all the most vulnerable. A plummeting Tory vote would send a salutary shockwave up to Westminster: councils can take no more austerity."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f51b3902d4bf5f048cf28974263bb6aa946a9339/0_0_3047_1829/master/3047.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e0daa0d642bb5f4bbe3d12fe798d7448","title":"reality automation terrifying","story":"Plenty of people may not have heard of the retail firm Shop Direct. Its roots go back to the distant heyday of catalogue shopping, and two giants of that era, Littlewoods and Great Universal Stores. Now it is the parent company behind the online fashion brand Very and the reinvented Littlewoods. All this may sound innocuous enough. But in two areas of Greater Manchester, Shop Direct is newly notorious.Until now, what the modern corporate vernacular calls “fulfilment” – in other words, packing up people’s orders and seeing to returns – has been dealt with at three Shop Direct sites, in Chadderton and Shaw, near Oldham, and in Little Hulton, three miles south of Bolton. But the company now has plans to transfer all such tasks to a “fully automated”, 500,000 sq ft “distribution and returns centre” located in a logistics park in the east Midlands. The compulsory consultation period begins tomorrow, and the shopworkers’ union Usdaw and local politicians are up in arms: if it happens in full, the move will entail the loss of 1,177 full-time posts, and 815 roles currently performed by agency workers on the new site there will only be jobs for about 500 people. At a time when apparently low unemployment figures blind people to the fragility and insecurity of so much work, the story is a compelling straw in the wind: probably the starkest example I have yet seen of this era of automation, and the disruption and pain it threatens.Every time a self-service checkout trills and beeps and issues the deathly cry “unexpected item in the bagging area”, it points to the future. So does the increasing hollowing-out of British high streets. But much of the looming wave of automation in retail and so-called logistics is hidden in the increasingly vast distribution centres, and the research and development departments of online giants. Inevitably, no one employed by these companies is comfortable talking about an imminent decline in human employment across the sectors in which they operate, and the accelerated growth of inidual firms – exemplified by Amazon, which now employs 500,000 people around the world, up from 20,000 a decade ago – gives them plenty of cover. But the evidence is plain: the buying, selling, and handling of goods is rapidly becoming less and less labour intensive.Technology once considered expensive and exotic is already here. Around the world, Amazon now uses about 100,000 “robot drives” to move goods around its distribution centres. The warehouse within the new John Lewis “campus” near Milton Keynes has been described as a “deserted hall of clacks and hums”. It employs 860 robots and keeps the human element of shifting stuff around to an absolute minimum. Last year Credit Suisse looked at the patents the online supermarket Ocado had recently filed and concluded that the company – which, among other things, is working on driverless delivery vehicles – was pushing into “an automated future” in which half of its staff could be gone within a decade (even now, it operates a much less labour-intensive service than its rivals).And so to the really terrifying part. Given that it will be disproportionately concentrated on low-wage, low-skill employment, this wave of automation inevitably threatens to worsen inequality. There are whole swathes of Britain where, as employment in heavy industry receded, up went retail parks and distribution centres. In such places as south Wales and South Yorkshire, the result has been an almost surreal, circular economy in which people work for big retail businesses to earn money to spend in other retail businesses. What, you can only wonder, will happen next?If we are to avoid the worst, radical plans will be necessary. The insecurity that automation brings will soon demand the comprehensive replacement of a benefits system that does almost nothing to encourage people to acquire new skills, and works on the expectation that it can shove anyone who’s jobless into exactly the kind of work that’s under threat. In many places, the disruption of the job market will make the issue of dependable and secure housing – if not questions of basic subsistence – even more urgent. In both schools and adult education, the system will somehow have to pull as many people as it can away from the most susceptible parts of the economy, and maximise the numbers skilled enough to work in its higher tiers – which, given the current awful state of technology and computing teaching, looks like a\u0026nbspvery\u0026nbspbig ask.On the political right, there is no serious interest in anything resembling this kind of agenda: one of the many tragedies of Tory austerity is that it blitzed the chances of any meaningful responses to automation just as its reality became clear and Conservatives still seem either asleep, or chained to the kind of laissez-faire Thatcherism that offers nothing beyond the usual insistence that the market is not to be bucked. Some of them should read an overlooked report by the independent Future of Work commission convened last year by the Labour deputy leader Tom Watson – spun with the Panglossian claim that “robots can set us free”, though a lot of its analysis was spot on. It contained bracing predictions about the future of such “low-skill, low-pay sectors” as transport, storage and retail, and warned that “Britain’s former industrial heartlands in the Midlands and north are more vulnerable … because of a concentration of jobs in risk sectors. So, without policy intervention, the technological revolution is set to exacerbate regional inequalities.”There are signs that such things are now on the radar of senior Labour politicians – as with Jeremy Corbyn’s acknowledgment last year that automation “could make so much of contemporary work redundant”. But beyond rather dreamy talk of “putting the ownership and control of the robots in the hands of those who work with them” and commendable plans for a national education service, not nearly enough flesh has been put on these bones – perhaps because the conversation about automation is often still stuck in the utopian wilds of a work-free, “post-capitalist” future.What does the left have to say to all those Shop Direct workers in Shaw, Chadderton and Little Hulton? How will it allay the fears of the thousands of other people likely to be faced with the same experience? Put another way, if the future is already here, what now?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5fd7f6c7bc2db861ad50eeb61c63dae364c2bcbc/0_0_1200_750/master/1200.jpg?w=300\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47791b7e4399a9d02f0be09948b4c37f","title":"time for a riot how the art of 1968 caught a world in turmoil","story":"It was the year hippy idealism gave way to riot and struggle – with protests in Paris, tanks in Prague and black power in the US.  writers pick the pivotal works from that tumultuous timeOn 19 August 1968, Josef Koudelka returned to Czechoslovakia from Romania, where he had been living among and photographing Romany Gypsies. The following day, Soviet tanks appeared on the streets of Prague. For seven days, the 30-year-old Moravian-born photographer roamed the city with his East German Exakta Varex camera loaded with movie film, the only stock he could find at short notice.The resulting images, some of which were smuggled out of the country, but many of which were not seen until decades later, captured the tumult of a traumatised city. They are recognised as one of the most powerful photojournalistic essays of the 20th century.Koudelka photographed teenagers blocking the paths of Soviet tanks, old people imploring the young Soviet soldiers to return home, flag-waving youths clambering over army vehicles. He returned to his apartment only to find more film or succumb to exhaustion. His images of defiance have, in the interim, become infused with a romantic, even elegiac quality. Their atmosphere is echoed in photographs of more recent upheavals, most notably the Arab Spring protests.This image, which he titled Hand and Wristwatch, is of a different order: a singular moment of calm and stillness. Here, there is no movement, no noise, only the almost empty street and that anonymous arm in the foreground, stretching out into the frame. It captures not just the moment the troops entered Prague but also the eerie atmosphere of an entire city and country helplessly losing its sense of itself.Look closely and you can see a small group of people who have left their work to gather on the pavement. In the background, those blurry vehicles may be tanks. Everything is uncertain here except the hand of a passerby, curled into a fist, and the hands of the watch that signal the moment when everything changed utterly for the citizens of the invaded city. This may be Koudelka’s only conceptual photograph, but it resonates as an iconic image of a tumultuous political moment in which there is no tumult – only an eerie silence in which time itself seems to have come to a halt. Sean O’Hagan The events of 1968 took some time to percolate through pop: it wasn’t until a year later that Thunderclap Newman would reach No 1 with a song urging the listener to “hand out the arms and ammo … because the revolution’s here”, and that a mood of increasing militancy would really start being reflected by black artists. Of the musicians who did react quickly to 1968’s tumult, the Rolling Stones were audibly re-energised and the Beatles baffled – “you can count me out … in,” sang John Lennon on Revolution. The most incendiary music made in immediate response to the year’s events, a recording of Nina Simone performing at the Westbury Music Fair three days after Martin Luther King’s assassination, was bowdlerised before being released, not least to remove the sound of Simone urging the audience to avenge King’s death by any means: “I ain’t about to be non-violent, honey.”Meanwhile, released in September 1968 – in the aftermath of the Miami riots and the Democratic National Convention protests in Chicago – Jefferson Airplane’s The House at Pooneil Corners offers the sound of hippy idealism curdling into something infinitely darker. It opens with scraping guitar noise, before an ominous, lumbering two-chord riff strikes up. The lyrics bemoan both “all the bullshit around us” and the counterculture’s desire to “get balled and high”: “You say it’s healing, but nobody’s feeling it … you say you don’t see and you don’t”. After two minutes, in lieu of the usual guitar solo, there’s a lengthy electronic wail that sounds like a siren, and the tone is increasingly apocalyptic: “There will be no survivors, my friend”.By the song’s conclusion, the lyrics are positing that a post-human world where “all the idiots have left” will be a kind of naive pastoral utopia replete with cows and turtle doves, but the music tells a different story: it just grinds relentlessly on and on, with more siren-like feedback, more keening guitars. It’s effective because it feels like an honest reaction to the events of 1968: not a strident call for revolution, nor a glib attempt to assure listeners that it’s going to be all right, but the sound of people clearly shaken and confused: peering, terrified, into the void. Alexis PetridisOn 22 November 1968, Star Trek boldly went where no primetime programme had gone before when it aired the first scripted interracial kiss on American TV, in an episode entitled Plato’s Stepchildren. It was not, it should be said, the most romantic of embraces Captain Kirk (William Shatner) and Lieutenant Uhura (Nichelle Nichols) are forced into it by evil aliens with telekinetic powers. Thanks to some artful camera angles you don’t actually see their lips touch and the moment is very brief.But while the kiss may only have lasted a second, it represented decades of progress in regard to race relations in the States. It aired towards the end of the civil rights movement, after several hard-won legal milestones made African Americans slightly more equal under the law. In 1954, segregation was made illegal in public schools. In 1965 the Voting Rights Act prohibited racial discrimination in voting. In 1967, Loving v Virginia made anti-miscegenation laws unconstitutional and rendered interracial marriage legal across the US. In April 1968, days after Martin Luther King was assassinated, the Fair Housing Act was passed, preventing housing discrimination based on race, sex, national origin and religion.It would be nice to say that Kirk and Uhura’s kiss represented a turning point in the US. That the revolution had, indeed, been televised and centuries of racial injustice were over, sealed with a kiss. However, 50 years later, depressingly little has changed. US public schools are more segregated now than they were during the civil rights movement, according to a 2013 report. And, that same year, a Cheerios ad featuring an interracial family generated so much racist abuse it made headlines.“Where I come from, size, shape, or colour makes no difference,” Kirk told one of the evil aliens in Plato’s Stepchildren. That’s certainly not true now. Let’s hope things change sometime before the 2360s. Arwa MahdawiLandmark shows don’t have to be masterpieces. Alfred Jarry’s Ubu Roi is a piece of anarchic juvenilia but its Paris premiere in 1896 is accepted as the starting point of the theatre of the absurd. Similarly there may be better musicals than Hair but its opening at Shaftesbury theatre in London on 27 September 1968 (having been seen earlier that year on Broadway) was a political event for two closely connected reasons. The show not only built a popular musical out of protest. It was also the first production to capitalise on the abolition of theatrical censorship which had constricted the British stage since 1737.In those far-off days, all works had to be licensed for performance by the Lord Chamberlain, one of whose readers, in proposing a ban, reported of Hair: “It extols dirt, anti-Establishment views, homosexuality, free love, drug-taking and it inveighs against patriotism.” Actually, that’s a pretty accurate description of a show in which Claude, the son of uptight American parents, rejects the world of work and military induction to join a hippie tribe. Ultimately unable to dodge the draft, he ends up uniformed, hair-shorn and dead. The critic and director Charles Marowitz got it right when he wrote of Hair: “It is the most powerful piece of anti-war propaganda yet to come out of America. Without Vietnam and the American repugnance to that war, the show would never have come into being.”In Britain, there was a good deal of prurient interest in the show’s brief flash of nudity. But that was much less important than its rejection of the death-dealing values of the military-industrial complex and its celebration of life. Hair may have been prompted by anti-war feeling but the book and lyrics by Gerome Ragni and James Rado and the music by Galt MacDermot are joyous rather than jaded. The opening and closing choruses of Aquarius and Let the Sunshine In ring with jubilation. The best moment comes when Hamlet’s “what a piece of work is a man” is turned into an affirmative song for three voices.From today’s perspective, the show’s faith in flower power and chemical experiments may seem naive but no piece of theatre better captures the political mood of the late 60s than this “tribal, love-rock musical”. Michael Billington In 1970 the American choreographer Yvonne Rainer staged an elegant anti-war version of her signature work, Trio A, during which her dancers performed naked with just the United States flag draped ironically around their necks. Rainer’s protest against US involvement in Vietnam would be followed, over the next decade, by a spate of politically conscious dance-making on both sides of the Atlantic. But at the start of 1968, militant acts of choreography tended to focus on the artform itself, re-evaluating the language and conventions of dance.Many of those militants were former students of Merce Cunningham, who was dedicated to the possibilities of pure movement. Cunningham was, in theory, the least political of choreographers. Yet he was always intensely alive to the world outside his studio, and RainForest, created in the spring of 1968, remains a prime example of how dance can become so porous to the zeitgeist that it becomes expressive, even prophetic of history.Much about the work is evocative of its title. David Tudor’s semi-improvised score is a dark forest of buzzing, squawking sound there’s a feral strangeness to many of the dancers’ movements as they crouch, stretch and stalk the stage and overhead the silver balloons of Andy Warhol’s set design cluster like a canopy of light reflecting leaves. It’s those balloons that take RainForest out of its exotic habitat into the unruly party spirit of the late 60s. Some of them are free-floating, so they bob around the stage whenever the performers happen to nudge or brush against them some even fly into the audience. In RainForest there’s a spirit of transformative anarchy at work that not only liberates its dancers from the ordinary rules of human engagement but from the normal constraints of performance. No showing of the work can ever be the same: the sheer chanciness of its construction makes it an embodiment of perpetual possibility and change. Judith Mackrell If any one movie is saturated with the political spirit of 1968, it has to be Jean-Luc Godard’s bizarre, wayward, instructive documentary about the Rolling Stones, entitled One Plus One and later recut and released in a more commercial version (which Godard angrily disowned) named Sympathy for the Devil, in honour of the famous track from the album Beggars Banquet that the Stones are shown recording. When the London film festival attempted to show this version, Godard denounced it from the stage and stalked out, punching the producer on the way.The film is a time capsule. Break it open and an overpowering and unwholesome fume of radical chic and 1968-ness rises from it: fascinating, infuriating. Godard himself became the charismatic face of radicalism that year in March 1968 he led – along with François Truffaut – the anti-Gaullist demonstrations in Paris against the sacking of the Cinémathèque Française director Henri Langlois which ended in scuffles with the police, Godard’s glasses being smashed, and a combustible situation that materially led to the greater disturbances of May.That summer, he went to London and made his One Plus One: long, unedited real-time sequences of the Stones rehearsing and recording in the studio. No rows or disruptions, though at one stage poor old Charlie Watts gets it in the neck from Mick for his drumming sounding “a bit dead”. But these shots are interspersed and juxtaposed with other sequences: a group of Black Panthers hang out in a junkyard, reading revolutionary texts, passing around weapons and stagily humiliating various submissive women. (The casual misogyny of the era is on display).Godard’s wife Anne Wiazemsky, named “Eve Democracy”, is shown drifting through woodland, laconically answering yes or no to questions from a camera crew. (“Do you think the lower classes have more sexual vitality than the upper classes?” Answer: yes.) A lone figure is shown spraying graffiti in her room at the Park Lane Hilton and then around the streets of London, shown in all their social-realist bleakness: slogans like CINEMARXISM and SOVIETCONG. A weird voice reads from political, pulp and pornographic novels. In a comic book store people give each other Nazi salutes.And what of the Stones? Before the last scene, Godard flashes up the famous graffiti slogan: “Beneath the stones, the beach” punningly hinting that the Stones have the real spirit of 68. But his invocation of the Black Panthers is also a coded denunciation of their appropriating black music. The poses that Godard strikes in this film, and the longueurs between them, are exasperating, though like so many Godard films, this one now shows – I believe – his affinity with conceptual art, as much as cinema. It also shows the strange, tense moodiness of the times: the simmering sense of disorder: jittery, euphoric, but with an edge of bleary cynicism, like the voice of Jagger’s Lucifer.

So the directors of a new documentary about her short and scandalous life faced a difficult task.Was Mansfield, one of the first actresses to be marketed as a “blonde bombshell”, also a violin-playing intellectual with superb comic timing who spoke five languages? Or was the star who came to be known as the “working man’s Marilyn Monroe” actually a devil worshipper who was decapitated in a car crash as the result of a curse?For the makers of Mansfield 6667, these questions were only part of the story. Instead, the American film-makers P David Ebersole and Todd Hughes have created an unorthodox account of the world of Hollywood gossip and illusion. Top-billed contributors to the documentary, out in cinemas last month, include Tippi Hedren, Alfred Hitchcock’s muse, Kenneth Anger, the author of the bible of tacky ephemera Hollywood Babylon, and the film director John Waters, a master of offbeat kitsch.The release of Mansfield 6667 in Britain marks the 50th anniversary of the star’s death at 34. Focused on the last two years of her life, the film was made after Ebersole and Hughes failed to find producers for their fictionalised screenplay The Devil Made Her Do It, about Mansfield’s reputed dalliance with the San Francisco-based satanic guru Anthony LaVey.Unconventional elements of their finished documentary include interpretive dance sequences and a series of animated recreations of some key Mansfield myths. There are also clips of the star in the hit films The Girl Can’t Help It and Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? as proof of her sure sense of comic timing.Born Vera Jayne Palmer in Pennsylvania in 1933, she was initially hired by Warner Brothers in 1955 and then by 20th Century Fox, where she was seen as a potential successor to the troublesome Monroe.In her short life she also made a string of centrefold appearances as “playmate of the month” in Playboy magazine and had three husbands and five children. Her youngest child from her second marriage to the 1955 Mr Universe winner, Mickey Hargitay, is the actress Mariska Hargitay, a regular on the television show Law \u0026amp Order: Special Victims Unit.One fact about Mansfield never in doubt was her trademark proclivity for revealing her ample bosom. Those not familiar with her acting may know her name simply because of a notorious photograph of her taken in 1957 at a party Paramount Studios gave for the rising Italian star Sophia Loren. Although Loren was officially belle of that ball, it was her bemused reaction to Mansfield’s low-cut gown that became Hollywood folklore.Mansfield’s film career hit the buffers in the mid-1960s and she was forced to resort to working in nightclubs. She continued to make promotional special appearances, however, and travelled out to cheer the troops in Vietnam. It was at this stage, while also dating a married lawyer, Sam Brody, that she began to see LaVey, the self-styled head of the Church of Satan who had painted his home black and wore a dark cape. When a jealous Brody challenged LaVey over Mansfield’s affections, the legend says a fatal curse was brought down upon his head.During 1966 and 1967, Mansfield and Brody survived seven car crashes before an eighth eventually killed them both. The actress had been travelling from Biloxi, Mississippi, to New Orleans to appear on television when her car hit a trailer head-on. The accident gave birth to a persistent rumour that Mansfield’s head, or at least her blond wig, had been flung from the car. If it was not LaVey’s curse that killed her, it may have been the fault of a truck that had sprayed a thick fog of insect repellent across the road."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e8a8526bd7db8d7cb9079c21b14e79870744099/277_58_2445_1468/master/2445.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e39bb582c8e9ffe1736d16f6d55a2db5","title":"arsene wenger classy gesture manchester united","story":"• Sir Alex Ferguson presents Arsenal manager with vase• ‘My successor will watch game and come to positive conclusion’Arsène Wenger joked that his warm reception before Arsenal’s 2-1 defeat against Manchester United was because he is no longer a “danger”.Wenger, who finishes 22 years at Arsenal at the end of the season, was managing them for the final time at Old Trafford. To mark the occasion, before kick-off Sir Alex Ferguson presented on United’s behalf a vase to the 68-year-old Frenchman. Asked about his ovation as he walked along the touchline, Wenger said: “When you’re not a danger any more, people love you.“I am thankful to Manchester United because they had a nice gesture. It is the first time I get a trophy before a game. It is very classy from them.”Wenger fielded an inexperienced XI that was Arsenal’s youngest in the fixture since August 2011 and, after losing to an added-time Marouane Fellaini header, believes whoever succeeds him will take over a squad of depth.“The players are destroyed because they gave everything and were caught\u0026nbspin the final minute. There were many question marks if we would be strong enough to fight but the quality\u0026nbspwas good, the spirit was good, many players stood up. We tired a bit in the last 20 minutes and were a bit more under pressure. It was a negative\u0026nbspresult and a positive performance.”Paul Pogba opened the scoring on 16 minutes before Henrikh Mkhitaryan equalised on 51 minutes. Yet though victory puts United in pole position for a second-place finish with 77 points with three games remaining, Romelu Lukaku’s foot injury later in the second half is of concern with the FA\u0026nbspCup final on 19\u0026nbspMay.“I hope it is not something that keeps him out of a game that is in three weeks’ time but I don’t know. When a player is injured I’m not immediately going for good or bad news.”Wenger has injury concerns leading up to the Europa League semi-final second leg at Atlético Madrid this week. “Mkhitaryan I took off because he had a little knock on his knee and Ospina has a problem and Iwobi a hamstring problem. Definitely out for Thursday? No.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e33f1671c2c1ac0061cc4fbd71c911e930ae273/0_117_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b403ed4bcb047fe6cca03425e1df2e6","title":"chris coleman sackedd manager sunderland","story":"Sunderland lost a manager but gained new owners on Sunday when Ellis Short sacked Chris Coleman before announcing he had cleared the struggling club’s debts and sold it to an international consortium headed by the chairman of non-league Eastleigh.While Coleman paid the price for failing to prevent Sunderland from falling into League One, the outgoing Short wrote off tens of millions of pounds in liabilities, thereby facilitating the takeover spearheaded by Stewart Donald.Once this transfer in ownership has received Football League ratification, Donald will sever his ties with Eastleigh of the National League before he and his group of “football investors” begin the task of rebuilding a club which has suffered successive relegations, entering the third tier for only the second time in its history.Coleman had hoped to have been part of Sunderland’s rebirth and even offered to take a pay cut next season. Instead, the 47-year-old who led Wales to the Euro 2016 semi-finals was informed that the incoming owner wants a new coach.The consensus is that Coleman, who had never spoken to Short since swapping Wales for Wearside last November, and was apparently unaware of the impending takeover, has been treated shoddily. Yet if his honesty and enthusiasm impressed, it seems Donald and friends were unconvinced by Coleman’s collection of only five wins as Sunderland were condemned to finishing bottom of the Championship.His dismissal leaves the club seeking a 12th permanent appointment in 10 years. Early contenders include Mick McCarthy, most recently of Ipswich and a former Sunderland manager, and the former Reading coach Jaap Stam.Although the debts are understood to have been reduced considerably since the publication of the last set of accounts – which showed that Sunderland owed £69m to Short and £68m to Security Bank Capital – Short’s decision to wipe out those arrears still represents a significant, and generous, gesture which should go at least some way to repairing his severely tarnished reputation in the north-east.It is thought that eliminating the debt could cost him in excess of £100m, thereby lifting his total spending on Sunderland to around £250m. The club’s latest accounts are scheduled to be released this week. The Florida-domiciled American billionaire financier has made some calamitous decisions and wasted millions of pounds on signing sub-standard players during a decade in control. “It’s no secret that I’ve been trying to sell Sunderland,” Short said on Sunday. “But I’ve waited until the right group came along that have the experience, finances and plan to take this great club back where it deserves to be.”An initially hands-on owner who used to happily interact with fans, he became increasingly disillusioned as a series of poor managerial and boardroom appointments and unwise off field ventures – most notably the ill-fated Invest in Africa project – conspired to set the team on an inexorably downward spiral.“Overall, my chairmanship has not gone the way I would have wished the many high points of a decade in the Premier League have been overshadowed by the low points of the last two terrible seasons,” Short said. “I was therefore determined to ensure that I leave Sunderland in the best possible hands and in the best possible state to turn the corner. To achieve this, higher offers from less qualified buyers were rejected, and I’ve paid off all debts owed by the club to leave it financially strong and debt free for the first time since years before I owned it.“I will be a Sunderland fan for life and hope to return as a fan to watch them climb back to where they belong.”Apart from his role with Eastleigh – which he put up for sale on Sunday – Donald has also been involved, albeit in a much lower-profile capacity, with Oxford United’s recent revival. It is unclear what price his consortium are paying for Sunderland or how a deal kept secret until its shock announcement on Sunday lunchtime is structured.“All of us involved in this bid believe that Sunderland represents an extraordinary opportunity,” said Donald, who invested around £10m in Eastleigh and is expected to join fellow consortium members in the Stadium of Light’s directors box for the final Championship game against Wolves on Sunday. “All of us have been involved in building or rebuilding football clubs to reach their potential. We believe we have the necessary skill-set to overcome the many challenges facing us at this great club. For a club with one of the best fan bases, stadium and academies in the UK to find itself in League One is unacceptable.”A 43-year-old millionaire businessmen, he grew up in Oxfordshire and owns Bridle Insurance, a broker specialising in the civil engineering and construction industries.“We have a carefully thought-through plan to restructure Sunderland, make it sustainable and, with the help of the fans, restore its sense of pride and reconnect it with the local community,” the Oxford United-supporting Donald said. “We’re rolling our sleeves up to do what needs to be done to ready this club to start competing again.”It is likely that Martin Bain, Sunderland’s chief executive, will also leave, possibly along with a handful of other senior executives. Kit Symons, Coleman’s assistant, has already departed and other members of the backroom staff could follow.Charlotte Coleman, the departing manager’s wife tweeted that she and her husband were “gutted to be leaving Sunderland”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14b67b7f37002ad92645897652d575711eeddb83/141_111_3816_2289/master/3816.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=adf6d95a3cf933ea9bf18ddb22db88e3","title":"deportivo la coruna barcelona la liga match report","story":"Barcelona were crowned La Liga champions for the 25th time after beating Deportivo La Coruña 4-2 with the help of a hat-trick from Lionel Messi but while their coach Ernesto Valverde praised their consistency he acknowledged they have “lacked brilliance” at times.Barça needed only a draw to clinch the title and complete an eighth domestic double after winning the King’s Cup last week and they marched into a 2-0 lead with goals from their record signing, Philippe Coutinho, and top scorer, Messi, in the first half. The result also relegated Deportivo.Valverde said on marca: “When you chase it all season you say finally ‘the league is very long’. It is not decided only in a match. From the beginning we have been in the lead. In the end we were the best. The hard part is winning and winning.”The former Athletic Bilbao coach added: “I have not invented anything, in the end these players have already won titles and leagues with other coaches. It’s more of them than the coach.“We have been a competitive, compact team and we have overcome many difficulties, and in moments I know it has lacked brilliance.”Depor were forced to push forward knowing only victory would be enough to keep their survival hopes alive and they paid the price as Messi added two late goals to complete the 46th hat-trick of his career.The on-pitch celebrations were muted, perhaps out of respect for their dejected opponents, but Barça, who remain unbeaten in the league, could not be denied a seventh title in 10 seasons and Messi’s first goal was the pick of the bunch.Ousmane Dembélé, the first player Barça bought after selling Neymar last summer, drove forward before playing in Luis Suárez, who clipped a cross with the outside of his foot that Messi met with a sidefooted volley.Lucas Pérez pulled one back five minutes before half-time and the Turkish midfielder Emre Colak levelled for the Galicians from Celso Borges’ cross in the 64th minute. They then came close to finding a winner and becoming the first team to beat Barça in the league this season.But Messi had other ideas, restoring Barça’s lead from close range in the 82nd minute before completing his treble with his 32nd league goal of the season.That proved the ideal moment for the introduction of Andrés Iniesta at the end of a week where he emotionally announced he would be leaving the club after 22 years with them. Valverde’s side have 86 points from 34 games, 11 clear of second-placed Atlético Madrid, who have three games to play."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed007c825126a2ad0f6b39b5c69d50bf0d0d5993/0_119_3917_2350/master/3917.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8446c178b49031bc6ba91f66a69d3da","title":"manchester united arsenal premier league match report","story":"The problem with football, as Arsène Wenger is rapidly finding out, is that there is never any guarantee of a happy ending. Wenger had been clapped to his seat but the hospitality did not extend to the pitch. His team had conceded a 91st-minute winner and, however rich the tributes might be for the departing manager, Arsenal have now lost six successive away fixtures in the league for the first time since Billy Wright was their manager in 1966.Wenger left Old Trafford with a silver vase, presented by Sir Alex Ferguson, and the lingering memory of this game will be the applause that followed the Frenchman along the touchline before the start. By the end, however, Old Trafford had reverted to type. “We want you to stay” was the cry, directed towards Wenger, after the stoppage-time header from Marouane Fellaini that meant Arsenal’s manager will remember his final visit to this stadium with little affection.That goal means Arsenal are still the only team in England’s top four isions to have lost every league game on the road since the turn of the year. It is an ignominious record and typical, perhaps, of the club’s decline if it is generally accepted that the teams with the better away results are usually the ones with the stronger personality. Arsenal, for example, rarely lost on the road in Wenger’s peak years.Those days can feel a long time ago when it is Alex Iwobi in central midfield, rather than Patrick Vieira, and Calum Chambers operating in the space Tony Adams used to occupy. Yet it would be difficult to be too harsh when Wenger’s team selection was guided by the fact that the team have the second leg of their Europa League semi-final coming up against Atlético Madrid on Thursday.Mesut Özil, Aaron Ramsey, Alexandre Lacazette and Jack Wilshere were among the players given a day off. All the same, Arsenal held their own for long spells and, at times, threatened a winner of their own following Henrikh Mkhitaryan’s equalising goal against his former club.In total, Wenger made eight changes from the team that drew against Atlético last Thursday. This was the youngest Arsenal team, with an average age of 24 years and 67 days, since the infamous 8-2 defeat here in August 2011 and to put it into perspective, there were three teenagers on the bench – Eddie Nketiah, Jordi Osei-Tutu and Joe Willock – whose shirt numbers were in the 60s. Of Arsenal’s entire match-day squad, Mkhitaryan was only player with a number between one and 11.Wenger’s record against Mourinho – now two victories from 19 attempts – is fairly lamentable even with his strongest group of players. Here, though, he was trying to beat his old rival with the kind of inexperienced team he would usually put out in the Carabao Cup. Konstantinos Mavropanos, a 21-year-old Greek defender, became the 200th player of the Wenger era to be given a debut. Arsenal’s midfield included Reiss Nelson and Ainsley Maitland-Niles and, with so many changes for the visitors, it must have been troubling for Mourinho that his team could not exert more control. Wenger summed it up accurately as “a positive performance but negative result”.Alexis Sánchez certainly found it heavy going at times against his former club, whereas Maitland-Niles, in particular, seemed determined to show that Arsenal have more strength in depth than many people might realise. Sánchez was, however, prominently involved in the opening goal for United, in the 16th minute, when Romelu Lukaku’s cross picked him out at the far post. Sánchez’s header was going in until Héctor Bellerín thrust out a leg to ert the ball against a post. The rebound fell kindly for Paul Pogba and he hooked the ball into an exposed net.All that had originated from Nelson, Arsenal’s youngest player losing the ball to Jesse Lingard close to the halfway line. It was a lesson for the 18-year-old that, at this level, those kind of mistakes tend to be punished. Yet the teenager did well overall and the build-up to Arsenal’s equaliser was a reminder that even players of considerable experience can be guilty of costly lapses.For this one it was a combination of errors, with Nemanja Matic and Ander Herrera leaving a pass from Antonio Valencia to one another and as soon as Granit Xhaka sprung the counter-attack, United were vulnerable. Mkhitaryan had sprinted upfield in support and his low shot from just outside the penalty area picked out a gap between Victor Lindelof’s legs to find its way into David de Gea’s net.By that stage, United had lost Lukaku to a foot injury and it was not until the final exchanges that the home side started to pin back their opponents. Fellaini hit a post with one header and when the substitute Marcus Rashford bundled in the rebound the goal was ruled out by a late offside flag. Unfortunately for Wenger, the next time Fellaini won a header in the penalty area there was no intervention.That goal should confirm United’s second-placed finish, five points clear of Liverpool in third with a game in hand. Arsenal, on the other hand, have lost 10 away fixtures for the first time since the 1989-90 season and, with 57 points from 35 games, are guaranteed to finish with the worst total of Wenger’s 22-year reign, the previous low being 67 in 2005-06. He talked afterwards of his gratitude for the “classy” gift from United and the crowd’s applause. But he must have preferred the days when the crowd in Manchester had cause to fear his teams. “It shows that once you’re not a danger any more, people love you.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b6a05308baf6ec50cd179192b654f254d0b99de/1024_158_2388_1432/master/2388.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d2ab6cef1ddc607b2fb555062c7a69d","title":"pep guardiola manchester city can be best team in history","story":"• City just two points shy of Chelsea’s record tally with three to play• ‘It is incredible. We have something special in terms of confidence’Pep Guardiola has urged his Manchester City side to establish themselves as “the best team in history” after the champions moved to within two points of Chelsea’s record tally for a season in the top flight.City’s 4-1 thrashing of West Ham took them to 93 points with three games still to play, and to within one goal of the 103 Carlo Ancelotti’s Chelsea rattled up in 2010.Guardiola has invited his players to target the records as extra motivation over the campaign’s last few weeks and hopes to eclipse the points haul achieved by José Mourinho’s side in 2005 in next Sunday’s game against Huddersfield.“It is incredible. The numbers are a consequence of what we have done. We will try and surpass the number of goals and points but the guys have to play well and fight a lot.“We have something special in terms of confidence and we needed some targets to set in front of us. But these players like to play football. They are professionals.“They want to play and the guys on the bench want to play. They enjoy training and playing, like amateurs. They want to play for something, too. So, once we won the Premier League, the target became the numbers. It’s good to see something to fight for, to achieve something.”Guardiola reiterated his desire to add “maybe one, maybe two, no more than that” to his squad over the summer before a title defence and reminded his players they can still improve as iniduals and a collective. “Football is not a finished business: be more clinical,” he added.“The last five or 10 minutes of the first half here were not good. At 4-1 we weren’t hungry enough to score another one. There were inidual mistakes, our full-backs not controlling the players inside, so there are many aspects we can improve. If it was perfect, I would not be here next season. I would be done. The level of consistency was high this season, yes, but we are still a young team. Our strikers have an average age of 22.“For 20 guys in our squad, this will be the first time they’ve won the Premier League. That’s why it’s good.

In a letter from the agency she was told this action did not amount to disciplinary measures, but that UNAids would be conducting a management and operational review of the country’s office during her absence. The agency added that Maluwa, one of the most senior women within UNAids, was not allowed to enter the office or access the agency’s servers or documents without supervision. The following week, an email was sent to key partners, embassies and government ministries announcing that an interim country director had been appointed to her position.Maluwa was also copied into emails stating that her contract had been terminated, though she said the agency later told her these were sent in error. The campaign group Code Blue, which is supporting Maluwa, said the agency had not explained the reasons for its actions and was not following the correct processes. “The standard procedure if there’s going to be an administrative and management review is that you tell the staff member why, tell them what the claims are against them, and you give them the opportunity to respond to those claims,” said Paula Donovan, co-director of Code Blue. Last year, Maluwa was a key witness in an investigation into sexual assault and harassment allegations involving the UNAids deputy director, Luiz Loures, who was alleged to have assaulted a colleague in a hotel lift. Maluwa, who spoke to the complainant after the alleged assault took place, told investigators that the alleged victim was distressed and asked to borrow a phone – evidence that supported the woman’s claims. Loures, who denies the allegations, was not suspended during the investigation.Donovan said Maluwa was being targeted following her role as a witness, and her refusal to contribute towards internal efforts to defend the agency’s director, Michel Sidibé, who has faced widespread criticism over attempts to interfere with the inquiry.The investigation found the claims against Loures to be unsubstantiated, but its results have since been suspended. On Friday, it was announced the case would be reopened in light of additional allegations that had surfaced, and would be conducted by the UN’s investigations team, the office of internal oversight services. In February, the  reported concerns relating to how the investigation was handled, along with testimonies from a group of women alleging they had also been assaulted or harassed by Loures, or that they had warned the agency’s director, Michel Sidibé, about his deputy’s behaviour. The alleged victim in the Loures case, Martina Brostrom, claims Sidibé attempted to bribe her to drop her complaint by offering a promotion. Sidibé denies this, but admitted to WHO investigators that he had met Brostrom to suggest they “see how we can really find a way out without making it a big problem for all the organisation and for the credibility of the organisation, for yourself”.Brostrom said that she only heard the case was being reopened through the media. “A new internal investigation does not make any sense to me. Anything short of an investigation fully independent from the UN will not be enough,” she said.Sidibé faced further criticism after details of an all-staff meeting were leaked to the , during which he suggested women who have spoken out “don’t have ethics” and appeared to make veiled threats to whistleblowers. Several HIV activist groups have called for an independent investigation into the agency, with the Aids Healthcare Foundation calling for Sidibé’s resignation.In a letter sent to the UNAids staff this month, Sidibé appeared to backtrack from his earlier comments, writing: “I will do all in my power to ensure UNAids’s culture is one in which it is clear that no one should feel threatened – and in which no one is threatened … People who speak out and bring complaints forward help the organisation.”Code Blue said that, despite such promises, Sidibé had continued to retaliate against staff. It added that a new UN investigation would be marred by continued conflicts of interest. In a statement, the campaign group called for member states to establish a temporary independent oversight panel to monitor closely the UN’s response to inidual allegations of sexual offences, with the power to intervene immediately where actions could harm victims or witnesses.

Why? ‘It just feels like the right thing to do’‘If you analyse what I’m saying,” says Jamie Oliver, “there’s nothing clever and there’s nothing really that controversial it’s fucking really basic common sense.”We meet on the morning that a letter he coordinated has been released, addressed to the prime minister and signed by Jeremy Corbyn, Nicola Sturgeon and other party leaders. It calls on the government to ban junk food advertising before 9pm and unhealthy buy-one-get-one-free offers, among other things. Oliver is proud of it. He looks relaxed, sitting on one of the sofas in his industrial, vintage-styled head office – although he knows the attacks will come. Later, he will be accused on Twitter of being the “fun police” a column in the Sun will call it a nanny-state initiative that penalises poor people.He talks in long, rambling sentences, bristling with energy. His transformation from cheeky-chappy Essex boy chef to single-issue crusader, facts and figures to hand, about to appear in front of a select committee, is complete. You would think he would have enough going on – he closed several of his restaurants recently and restructured his business – but Oliver remains laser-focused on the issue of childhood obesity.So far, Oliver seems to be coming at obesity principally as a diet problem, rather than a social one, although it may be too much to ask even someone as energetic and ambitious as him to fix society. Obesity disproportionately affects children in deprived areas. If there is one criticism of Oliver that seems to stand up, it is that he does not entirely understand what it is like to live in relentless, grinding poverty: to be unable to afford fresh vegetables (healthy food is three times more expensive, per calorie, than unhealthy food – Oliver has suggested that the government should subsidise healthy food) to be too tired to cook from scratch every night to take the financial risk on a lentil recipe that your kids may refuse to eat.At one point, when we are talking about whether people – working parents, people who have to work several jobs – can be persuaded to turn their backs on the ease of convenience food, he acknowledges that “humans crave convenience, that’s what we’re programmed to do. But convenience food doesn’t have to be shit. The freezer is the future.” But what if you live in a small flat, with a tiny fridge and just an ice box? “Of course, but you can buy it on the defrost – that will be two or three days in the fridge still. You don’t have to have it all racked up in the freezer. But costs are down, welfare is up, waste down. Convenience food doesn’t have to be shite.” But it probably will not be cheap.Maybe it does not help when he keeps talking about “them” and “us”, as if people on low incomes or benefits are a separate species. But he is not having it. “Yeah, because I don’t have to worry about feeding my kids today and they do. It’s not hard to get someone to say: ‘Jamie Oliver is a wanker.’ I think the concept of having an opinion and caring in Britain is a really funny one, you know: ‘How dare you.’” It is true that he is in an impossible position – as a chef reportedly worth £150m, he is regularly accused of hypocrisy (years on, those lucrative supermarket adverts are used as a stick with which to beat him) and for lecturing the rest of us, but the alternative would be to do nothing. “When I stand up there and start talking, you may or may not like what I say,” he says. “But if you’ve ever seen the people representing the advertising industry or the food industry, I know you would trust me with your kids more than them.”Why does he do it? There must be times when an easier life – with his wife, Jools, their five children and their lovely £9m home in Hampstead, north London, and his TV cookery shows – seem more appealing. “The important stuff I’ve done I’ve rarely enjoyed,” he says. “I get a beating quite regularly.” So, why carry on? “It just feels like the right thing to do,” he says slowly, enunciating every word.Oliver became political early on. It was only three years after his explosive 1999 debut as the Naked Chef that he was training unemployed young people to staff his restaurant Fifteen – filmed, of course, for a TV series (few can match Oliver’s media skills). His campaign to improve school dinners culminated in the series Jamie’s School Dinners in 2005, while his 2008 series Ministry of Food followed his initiative to teach cookery skills in Rotherham (that project closed last year after Rotherham council stopped funding it, but there are others around the country).In 2015, Oliver turned his attention to sugar with his documentary Jamie’s Sugar Rush. The month it aired, he says darkly, “stuff changed. Like burglaries, computer systems, break-ins at the office, home.” Before I can ask if he thinks Big Sugar was trying to intimidate him, he continues: “I don’t know, but there’s a string of events since the month that started.” Still, the sugar tax was introduced, under David Cameron’s government (Oliver has been scathing of Theresa May’s childhood obesity strategy).People have often tried to work out what drives Oliver, but I suspect it is as simple as the satisfaction of seeing results (just like the process of starting with raw ingredients and producing a Sunday roast). “As time has gone on and we’ve got some stuff done, you realise that getting stuff done isn’t that common,” he says. Someone called him a socialist recently and he had to look up the definition. He does not think he is one he prefers the idea of running a commercial business with a social ethos.That is not to say everyone agrees he is succeeding. A report in the Times last month portrayed his chief executive Paul Hunt, who is married to Oliver’s sister, as a bully, quoting a former employee who said “morale is at rock bottom”. “It’s complete bollocks,” Oliver says. “You can walk round the business. Like I said to the editor when they ran the story, come in and talk to everyone. If you’re talking about some bad leavers, of course you’re going to find some people who have something to whine about.”It has been a tough year for Oliver – tougher still for some of his staff. He describes the closure of one of his two Barbecoa steak restaurants and 12 of the 37 UK branches of his chain Jamie’s Italian as “awful. Worst time in my life.” It is the job losses, he says. “We’ve still got 2,000 people, but we’ve had to close 12 restaurants, which is about 800 people.”It can be easy to forget that, amid all the campaigning and the chain-restaurant managing, Oliver is still a wildly popular and successful chef. His most recent book, 5 Ingredients, was one of his biggest-selling and he has another out in the summer. He still writes two recipes every day (about a third are healthy, the rest less so this is often pointed out as though it is evidence of Oliver’s hypocrisy).Anyway, he has to go – Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, that other anti-obesity campaigner and chef, is on the phone. Oliver says his business is committed to the target of halving childhood obesity by 2030. “That is what you’re going to hear me say for the next 12 years,” he says. You have to admire his single-mindedness. “Don’t get me wrong,” he adds, “I’m fucking looking forward to retiring.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30f4b9ec8f473c1c82d0e3effd7711d2870bc995/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1272a646421a9427484e68e5199538ed","title":"seven ways to support your immune system","story":"Your body works hard to fight off infections, but there are things you can do to give it a boostMost people know about the benefits of exercise for our hearts, waistlines, muscles and bones. Fewer are aware of how it supports our immune defences, especially as we age. Production of naive T cells, which raise the alarm when they detect infections the immune system has not encountered before, declines as we get older. Research published by Professor Janet Lord’s group at the University of Birmingham last month found that cyclists aged 55 to 79 were generating as many of these cells as young adults and had more B regulatory cells, which help to prevent autoimmune disease. Other studies show moderate to vigorous exercise reduces the risk of upper respiratory tract infections, including the common cold.Sleep is important to the functioning of the immune system. Research suggests that white blood cells in those aged 65 and over who sleep six hours or fewer a night may be less effective in dealing with invading pathogens than cells from those who sleep more. Sleep deprivation also makes people more susceptible to colds and flu.Our guts contain trillions of microbes that play key roles in the immune system. For example, they promote the production of T cells, which help to trigger immune responses and prevent autoimmune diseases. Having a low-fat, high-fibre diet with plenty of vegetables promotes a broad range of gut bugs and boost levels of beneficial bacteria. “Having a varied diet is likely to be better for your bacteria, which is, in turn, likely to be better for your immune function,” says Professor Sheena Cruickshank of the University of Manchester.Probiotics – live bacteria or yeasts added to yoghurts or taken as supplements – can reduce the risk of infectious diarrhoea linked to antibiotic use and help those with ulcerative colitis or pouchitis, a complication of surgery for ulcerative colitis. However, most of the claims made for probiotics are not supported by good-quality research evidence, despite a global market estimated to be worth about $40bn (£29bn). Prebiotics – non-digestible food ingredients that help existing gut probiotics grow – are also available. There are studies that suggest benefits, but most are small-scale and industry-funded. “It’s a huge business, but at this stage it’s not clear which bacteria we might want to nurture to promote health-giving effects, and most people could probably get the same effects with a healthy, balanced diet,” says Cruickshank.Drinking to excess can leave you with more than a hangover. A 2014 study found that drinking four to five shots of vodka reduced levels of white blood cells, which combat infections and cancer, for up to five hours after peak intoxication. Heavy drinking has also been found to undermine the ability of immune cells called macrophages to engulf bacteria.Smokers are more prone to inflammatory diseases and infections such as pneumonia and flu than non-smokers. Research suggests this may be partly down to nicotine undermining the ability of white blood cells called neutrophils to ingest and kill harmful microbes. Smokers also have fewer friendly bacteria and more pathogens in the nasopharynx, the upper part of the throat behind the nose, and higher levels of bacteria that cause skin infections and oral diseases.Our bodies create vitamin D when our skin is exposed to sunlight outdoors. Vitamin D helps to keep our finely tuned immune systems in balance by, for example, stimulating the development of cells that prevent the autoimmune responses seen in conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. It is also used by macrophages to help kill harmful bacteria, and supports our defences against colds and flu."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ae038e8c2c4b36908a25371c5654c626e38ed80/0_1953_5547_3327/master/5547.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56060177d1dbd221307c3fcc7443ad43","title":"bob dylan whiskey heavens door","story":"For a man whose Bootleg Series now runs to 13 albums, distilling his own Tennessee liquor seems like a logical next stepBob Dylan will next month launch a range of whiskeys, hoping to capitalize on growing demand for all things celebrity-tagged.The 76-year-old singer and Nobel laureate has joined with liquor entrepreneur Marc Bushala to turn a deconsecrated church in Tennessee into a distillery. Their Heaven’s Door Spirits – a Tennessee straight bourbon, a double barrel whiskey and a straight rye – will first be available in Tennessee, Florida, California, Illinois, New York and Texas. A wider rollout will follow.Dylan’s new project was announced on Saturday. “You don’t always find inspiration,” he mused in a press release. “Sometimes it finds you. We wanted to create a collection of American whiskeys that would each tell a story.” Bushala, 52, told his story to the . The project began, he said, when he noticed Dylan, whose Bootleg Series now runs to 13 albums, had filed a trademark application for “bootleg whiskey”. Bushala contacted the enigmatic singer and made his pitch.Knowing that Dylan is a whiskey aficionado, Bushala decided to approach the project from a whiskey-centric point of view. “That appealed to Bob,” he said. “This is not a vanity project for him. It’s a passion project.”When it came to a name, the two men “wanted a standalone name for whiskey that could also be a nod and a wink to Dylan”.Dylan’s songs are not short of whiskey references, among them Copper Kettle (The Pale Moonlight) (“Daddy he made whiskey, my grandaddy he did too  We ain’t paid no whiskey tax since 1792”) Blind Willie McTell (“He’s dressed up like a squire  Bootlegged whiskey in his hand”) Gotta Serve Somebody )“Might like to drink whiskey  Might like to drink milk”) and Moonshiner (“I’ve spent all my money  On whiskey and beer”).The two men got down to 10 favourites, then agreed to go with a reference to Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door, a hit from the 1973 album Pat Garrett \u0026amp Billy the Kid which in fact does not refer to whiskey. “Everyone felt strongly that Heaven’s Door was just a perfect name,” Bushala said, “especially given the imagery we’re using on the bottles” – wrought ironwork from Dylan’s own metalwork foundry in Los Angeles.Someone as “eclectic and erse as Bob”, Bushala said, should put out “an evolving collection or portfolio” of whiskeys. To achieve that, he said, he raised $35m from investors.Dylan’s idea for his own whiskey came from a more down-to-earth source: his earliest incarnation as a Woody Guthrie-esque, riding-the-rails wandering minstrel.In a statement to the New York Times, the singer said: “I’ve been traveling for decades and I’ve been able to try some of the best spirits that the world of whiskey has to offer. This is great whiskey.”Bushala said: “There have been spirits and whiskey in his music for as long as he’s been making it, going on 60 years, and in the kind of rural Americana that plays into it. So for sure in his mind, there were elements he was after. But it wasn’t directly articulated.“He was after a mood or a feeling. He wasn’t after saying, ‘This should taste more smokey or have more corn or rye, or adjust the proof.’” Presented with one distillation, Bushala said, Dylan said simply the drink should feel “more like a wood structure”. “We were nodding like we understood,” Bushala said. “But we didn’t really.”Nor, perhaps to the horror of Dylan purists, is this the singer’s first foray into the world of commerce. The singer is a periodic pitchman, endorsing Chobani, Chrysler and even Victoria’s Secret.“He didn’t sell out,” Bushala said. “This is his brand, and it’s his idea. We just helped him do what he wanted to do. Bob does not want to be face man of the brand and he does not want the packaging to scream ‘Dylan’.”Dylan’s signature is therefore on the reverse side of the label, Bushala said, making it visible only when the bottle is empty. “He was willing to do that but he’s not going to appearances or bottle signings. He didn’t even pick up his Nobel prize so he’s not going to go out touting this. And that’s great because it’s authentic for Dylan and authentic for the brand.” With some irony, perhaps, the rules that will govern the success or otherwise of Dylan’s project will, like his whiskey and his music, hark back to America’s past. Liquor distribution in the US is still based on a post-prohibition model, each market tightly controlled by licensed state distributors. Those markets have to be broken into much as folk musicians or promoters once toured local radio stations, seeking precious airplay.“There are parallels,” Bushala said. “You’re going from account to accounts and hand-selling. You’re going round, knocking on the doors.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d8a922afeb9e7049944a698f84df85c97f96318/0_0_6016_4016/master/6016.jpg?w=660\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d5d27da866ca6f77c035275e5dc1d99 660w","title":"amber rudd letter to pm reveals ambitious but deliverable removals target","story":"Exclusive: denials she was aware of deportation targets at odds with January 2017 letter now published in fullThe private letter from Amber Rudd to Downing Street in which she sets an “ambitious but deliverable” target for an increase in the enforced deportation of immigrants has been published by the  in full for the first time.Rudd has claimed she did not set, see or approve any targets for removals. The former immigration minister Brandon Lewis suggested on Sunday this proposed increase was an ambition rather than a target.But Home Office sources have told the  that it is “shame-faced nonsense” to claim the department had not been set specific targets in this area, or that these have not been regularly discussed at the highest levels.The latest furore was sparked on Friday when the  published details from a separate confidential memo that was sent to Rudd in June last year.Prepared by Hugh Ind, the director general of Immigration Enforcement in the Home Office, it picked up on the new policy outlined by Rudd in her letter to Theresa May.While Rudd has denied seeing the six-page briefing note, the  can now reveal that it was also sent to at least eight of the Home Office’s most senior officials, including:• Marc Owen, senior director of national and international operations in Immigration Enforcement.• Mark Thomson, the director general of the Passport Office.• Tony Eastaugh, UK director of operations at Immigration Enforcement.• Gareth Hills, director of performance and risk at the Home Office.• Stephen Kershaw, a senior director in Immigration Enforcement.• Andrew Wren, director of performance, assurance and governance at the Home Office.The home secretary has issued five apologies in the last week – four of them over her department\u0027s handling of the Windrush crisis and immigration targets.Rudd delivered an unprecedented apology to parliament and acknowledged that her department had “lost sight of iniduals” and become “too concerned with policy”.Rudd apologised for failing to grasp the scale of the problem. She told the home affairs select committee: “I bitterly, deeply regret that I didn’t see it as more than inidual cases gone wrong that needed addressing. I didn’t see it as a systemic issue until very recently.”On Thursday morning, Rudd was forced to admit officials did have targets for removals, having previously denied their existence.“The immigration arm of the Home Office has been using local targets for internal performance management. These were not published targets against which performance was assessed, but if they were used inappropriately then I am clear that this will have to change.On Thursday afternoon, Rudd was forced to issue a hasty clarification after appearing to leave the door open to the UK staying in a customs union with the EU.“I should have been clearer – of course when we leave the EU we will be leaving the customs union.In a series of late-night tweets, Rudd apologised for not being aware of documents, leaked to the , which set out immigration removal targets.\u0026nbsp‘I wasn’t aware of specific removal targets. I accept I should have been and I’m sorry that I wasn’t. I didn’t see the leaked document, although it was copied to my office as many documents are.The disclosure will heap further pressure on Rudd, who has said she will address MPs on Monday to answer the “legitimate questions” that have been raised over the past week.On Friday night, nine hours after the  first told the Home Office about the leaked memo, Rudd tweeted: “I wasn’t aware of removal targets. I accept I should have been and I am sorry that I wasn’t.”The response appears at odds with the letter she sent to the prime minister in January last year.But it also suggests that none of the other senior officials and special advisers copied into the subsequent briefing note ever discussed with her the targets which the Immigration Enforcement agency was attempting to reach on her instruction.Home Office sources have told the  that Immigration Enforcement has been working all year to reach the target of 12,800 enforced returns in 2017-18.They have been bracing themselves to acknowledge to ministers that the agency has failed to do so. To meet the goal, it needed to deport 250 people a week, but it has only been able to remove about 225 a week.“At the Home Office we work in a target culture,” said a source. “The civil service is completely target based. That’s all we do. It is shame-faced nonsense for Amber Rudd to say otherwise.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5563f68e8bfcdc29bf74aba848979f00e684761c/21_0_615_369/master/615.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79de17426590a332212e1c34319aa183","title":"davis under pressure to disown criticism of civil service chief on brexit","story":"Minister seeks to defuse row after backlash to claims he wanted Oliver Robbins sidelinedBrexit secretary David Davis has sought to defuse tensions with No 10 by playing down reports that he might resign unless Theresa May sidelines Whitehall’s top civil servant working on Britain’s exit from the EU.After unexpected interventions from the cabinet secretary Jeremy Heywood and May’s close aide Gavin Barwell defending Oliver Robbins, an aide to Davis said on Sunday evening that no such threats had been made. The aide added that Davis considered Robbins to be “a fantastic civil servant”.Davis’s intervention comes in a crucial week for May who faces a tense Brexit inner cabinet meeting on Wednesday when she is expected to discuss a plan, backed by Robbins, to create a customs partnership with the EU. Another option on the table is the so-called “max fac” – or maximum facilitation – solution, using technology to minimise the need for border checks.According to the Sunday Times, Davis told the prime minister to ignore Robbins in favour of her ministers.Robbins, tipped as a future cabinet secretary, was moved from Davis’s Brexit department into No 10 last year as May sought to take greater control over the process.A former minister claimed that Tory backbenchers could be willing to oust May if she does not stop listening to her adviser on the customs partnership plan.EU members (plus Turkey, Andorra, Monaco and San Marino) trade without customs duties, taxes or tariffs between themselves, and charge the same tariffs on imports from outside the EU. Customs union members cannot negotiate their own trade deals outside the EU, which is why leaving it – while hopefully negotiating a bespoke arrangement – has been one of the government’s Brexit goals.\u0026nbspSee our full Brexit phrasebook.“The prime minister would be extraordinarily unwise to take Robbins’s advice on this,” they told the newspaper. “There will be a very swift and very violent reaction. It will put the prime minister in personal peril.” Attacks on Robbins provoked an angry response from civil servants on Sunday morning. Dave Penman, the head of the FDA union, said: “Is there a more despicable form of political cowardice than to allow anonymous briefings in your name to effectively call for a civil servant to be sacked?“Civil servants advise, ministers decide. Politicians of all stripes know this. If David Davis leaves these comments from a ‘close ally’ out there unchallenged, it ultimately suggests that he supports them but isn’t brave enough to say so publicly.”Heywood also took the unusual step of tweeting about criticisms of Robbins. After May’s close aide Gavin Barwell retweeted a statement from the chief whip, Julian Smith, saying “Attacking ind civil servants is deeply unfair”, Heywood wrote:Under Robbins’ plan, the UK would collect import tariffs on behalf of Brussels, while being free to set its own duties for goods bound for the UK. Pro-Brexit Conservatives have described the plan as unworkable and say it will allow Brussels to dictate UK trade policy.An aide to Davis said the Sunday Times story was wrong, and added the Brexit secretary had praised Robbins in an interview with the newspaper on Monday but his words had not been published. According to the aide, Davis said in the interview: “Olly is a fantastic civil servant ... He’s the sherpa, he’s the PM’s sherpa and what do sherpas do? They get you to base camp so you can make the assault on the summit. It’s fine.”Senior Tory backbencher Bernard Jenkin said on Sunday that a customs partnership plan would mean the UK acting as a “tax collector” for the EU and would fail the prime minister’s key tests for a deal with Brussels. “It doesn’t pass any of the key tests that the prime minister has outlined in her statements,” he told BBC1’s Sunday Politics programme. “It doesn’t give us full regulatory autonomy so we wouldn’t be able to do free trade deals with other countries,” he added. The Brexiter business group Leave Means Leave has called for Robbins to be sacked and “replaced by someone from outside the civil service who will take a tough line with Brussels”.Richard Tice and John Longworth of the Brexit-backing business group wrote: “At each stage, Robbins has presided over a bungled negotiating position on behalf of the UK, giving leverage to the EU and acquiescing to their every whim in a way no business person would do.”In a further development, Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, has told the UK the time has come for it to “resolve the contradictions” in its Irish border policy.Writing in Ireland’s Sunday Independent newspaper ahead of a visit to the country on Monday, he said there will need to be “substantial progress” on the border issue by the next major meeting of EU leaders, who are due to assess progress on the border issue at a summit in June."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78144587dd3cb9d61989c3bd8a22c967be117aab/0_75_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a302611ff189c9ffb6edacf8665eab19","title":"how theresa may benefits from letting amber rudd remain in firing line","story":"To the last, Rudd and her allies insisted she didn’t know about deportation targets – but even if she didn’t, she should have doneBeleaguered, embattled, hapless – as the Windrush scandal worsened over recent days, these doom-laden adjectives had begun attaching themselves irresistibly to Amber Rudd’s name.To the last, she and her allies continued to insist that she didn’t know about deportation targets – they maintain the government’s “ambition” for boosting the number of people sent home is not a “target”.But crucially in her resignation letter, Rudd admitted “information provided to my office”did “make mention of numerical targets”. She didn’t see that information, shesaid – but admitted she should have done.Michael Gove, who defended Rudd robustly on Saturday morning, had already said the memo leaked to the  on Friday had never appeared in the home secretary’s red box.But that simply raised more questions: why not? Why had officials and advisers assumed the existence of numerical targets for chucking people out of Britain was something the home secretary would be sufficiently comfortable about not to have to ensure the details were brought to her attention and formally approved?Even on Sunday afternoon, senior Tories were suggesting that if Rudd could endure another mauling at the hands of Diane Abbott, Yvette Cooper and David Lammy on Monday, she could put the scandal behind her.But the Windrush fiasco has left a trail of devastated lives – and whatever did or did not find its way into her ministerial inbox, making fine distinctions about the precise meaning of the word “target” had begun to look increasingly crass.Certainly, neither Gove – who claimed the leaks were aimed at distracting from Labour’s antisemitism crisis – nor Brandon Lewis, who had the task of defending Rudd on Sunday, made things any better.Indeed, Lewis barely sounded convinced himself by what he must have known was a weak defence of his former boss. While Rudd had known about, and indeed set, an “ambition” for removing more illegal immigrants, he insisted she had no idea that it had been cascaded down to inidual Home Office outposts as a series of targets.The home secretary only survived as long as she did in the face of this swirling crisis, the personal aspects of which she herself described as “heartbreaking”, for two reasons.One is that she is well-liked and more than that, many of her colleagues had a strong interest in her remaining in cabinet.Backbench remainers, including Nicky Morgan, Anna Soubry and Nicholas Soames, threw their support behind Rudd on Friday night after the long wait for a response from the Home Office to the leaked targets memo.The home secretary has issued five apologies in the last week – four of them over her department\u0027s handling of the Windrush crisis and immigration targets.Rudd delivered an unprecedented apology to parliament and acknowledged that her department had “lost sight of iniduals” and become “too concerned with policy”.Rudd apologised for failing to grasp the scale of the problem. She told the home affairs select committee: “I bitterly, deeply regret that I didn’t see it as more than inidual cases gone wrong that needed addressing. I didn’t see it as a systemic issue until very recently.”On Thursday morning, Rudd was forced to admit officials did have targets for removals, having previously denied their existence.“The immigration arm of the Home Office has been using local targets for internal performance management. These were not published targets against which performance was assessed, but if they were used inappropriately then I am clear that this will have to change.On Thursday afternoon, Rudd was forced to issue a hasty clarification after appearing to leave the door open to the UK staying in a customs union with the EU.“I should have been clearer – of course when we leave the EU we will be leaving the customs union.In a series of late-night tweets, Rudd apologised for not being aware of documents, leaked to the , which set out immigration removal targets.\u0026nbsp‘I wasn’t aware of specific removal targets. I accept I should have been and I’m sorry that I wasn’t. I didn’t see the leaked document, although it was copied to my office as many documents are.That was partly because they like Rudd – and believe the scandal ultimately reflects the illiberal policies championed by May. They fear any successor could be less likely to challenge the inclusion of students in the net migration target, for example.But it was also because she has been their doughtiest champion inside cabinet in the tug-of-war over how close Britain should remain to the European Union after Brexit.The latest example came this weekend in reports that Rudd would be open to an arrangement with the EU that would replicate key elements of freedom of movement.The second reason Rudd remained in post was that with fresh Windrush injustices still emerging almost daily, she was a lightning rod for public anger, more of which may now be directed at the prime minister.Rudd loyally made repeated public apologies without allowing the blame to fall on the prime minister and the tone and policies that May set in her six years at the Home Office.Rudd had been deemed a potential leadership rival. Allowing her to continue to take incoming fire, particularly as it undermined her reputation for brisk, well-briefed competence, must have been highly tempting.On Sunday night, May was left to turn her thoughts to who should replace her.She may feel obliged to appoint another remainer, to avoid upsetting the delicate balance at the top table. But in the key arguments inside Cabinet, a newbie may lack the power base to be influential for some time – and Britain’s Brexit negotiating position is being fought over right now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7d4118ace8f192102934222e2e6902e55205e73/566_15_2697_1619/master/2697.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d3bcec3473d0e524ae851c00dfbd896","title":"the favourites to take over from amber rudd as home secretary","story":"Giving Michael Gove the job would cap a striking comeback but the timing favours Sajid JavidWho are the contenders to be the next home secretary? Downing Street has said a new appointment will not be announced until later on Monday but these are the ministers and MPs who are in contention to replace Amber Rudd.Javid is the favourite for the job and is already being tipped by Tory MPs. The timing could not be better from his perspective he was on the front of the Sunday  talking about his personal anger over the treatment of the Windrush migrants, saying: “I thought that could be my mum ... my dad ... my uncle ... it could be me.” Having backed remain, Javid would keep the balance in the top jobs, though he has made it clear since the referendum he is sceptical of softer Brexit options such as remaining in the customs union.Gove has courted the spotlight since his return to the cabinet table, with a series of eye-catching environmental policies, including a well-publicised war on plastics. However, the key test will be whether his personal relationship with May has mended, since the two clashed during the coalition government in a furious briefing war over her performance at the Home Office when she was home secretary. Were he to get the job, it is likely to re-ignite tensions over the anti-immigration messages of the Vote Leave campaign.Hunt made it clear at the last cabinet reshuffle that he did not want to leave the Department of Health. When May attempted to move him to Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, he convinced her to keep him in post. However, the Home Office is certainly a bigger draw and it could be the promotion to tempt him, perhaps even paving the way for an eventual run at the top job.Lidington is only just settling in at the Cabinet Office, replacing May’s old friend Damian Green who was sacked for making misleading statements about pornography found on his office computer. In Rudd, May has lost another ally that she trusted and confidants are now getting fewer by the day in the cabinet, so Lidington could get the role if May believes the priority should be a safe pair of hands. James Brokenshire, the former Home Office minister and Northern Ireland secretary who left the cabinet due to ill health, also fits that bill.Bradley worked under May at the Home Office, giving her direct experience of the complexities of the department. The former culture secretary was moved to Northern Ireland in the latest reshuffle, currently one of the most difficult jobs in government due to Brexit tensions over the Irish border and the collapse of devolved government in Belfast. Appointing Bradley would also mean keeping the 5050 balance of men and women in the four great offices of state.They are unlikely appointments, but both are capable and experienced former cabinet ministers. To appoint either of them would strip the pro-remain rebels in parliament of a key voice. Both, however, may find the compromise too much, and there is mutual animosity between May and Morgan after a fallout last year over a pair of leather trousers worn by May."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6bd6555ae52a74f100bcb41bbceec54e3ce24e6a/0_59_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cfd1e50c89c3da19563579c60f89eb0","title":"amber rudd brought down by claims counterclaims leaks and denials","story":"In the Windrush row, Rudd’s confusion over the more arcane matter of targets for illegal immigrants was her nemesisWhen Amber Rudd agreed to appear in front of political journalists at a Westminster lunch last week, it was an opportunity to demonstrate her leadership credentials.But by the time the event actually came around the fallout from the ’s reporting on the Windrush scandal was in full flow and she was, as she put it, “just thinking about staying in the game”.She had already had a hellish week involving several appearances at the dispatch box, a brutal session at the hands of the home affairs select committee and what felt like countless apologies.But while much of the anger directed at the home secretary over the preceding days had been a result of the mishandling of the Windrush generation of migrants, it was her confusion over the rather more arcane matter of targets for deporting illegal immigrants that eventually brought her down.The key moment in Rudd’s dramatic fall from grace was when she was summoned to explain herself – and her department – in front of the committee last Wednesday.Almost as an afterthought, committee chair Yvette Cooper asked about earlier evidence from the immigration officers’ union about targets for the number of people who should be deported from the UK.“We don’t have targets for removals,” Rudd replied, kicking off the series of claims and counterclaims, leaks and denials, that eventually led to her departure.The next day it emerged that immigration officials in her own department had been given targets after all. She was summoned to the Commons to clarify. “I was not aware of them,” she insisted.By Friday, her claims were unravelling after a secret internal Home Office document boasting of the targets in 2017 was leaked to the . Damningly, Rudd had been copied in.More than eight hours after the  approached the Home Office with details of the memo – as speculation swirled around Westminster about her future – she finally responded in a series of defiant late-night tweets.The home secretary insisted she had not seen the leaked memo, even though it had been sent to her office and that she wasn’t aware of the specific removal targets. “But I accept that I should have been and I’m sorry that I wasn’t.”She promised to make a fresh statement to the Commons on Monday about the affair. But if Rudd thought that was the end of the matter she was wrong.The last line of defence: that she had “an ambition” to increase deportations rather than a “target” was broken and it was clear both to Rudd and No 10 that she could not cling on any longer.May had been relying on her home secretary to protect her own legacy at the Home Office – including defending her “hostile environment” strategy – as well as her reputation. But keeping her in office became more damaging than letting her go. With her human shield now gone, the prime minister is even more exposed.The home secretary has issued five apologies in the last week – four of them over her department\u0027s handling of the Windrush crisis and immigration targets.Rudd delivered an unprecedented apology to parliament and acknowledged that her department had “lost sight of iniduals” and become “too concerned with policy”.Rudd apologised for failing to grasp the scale of the problem. She told the home affairs select committee: “I bitterly, deeply regret that I didn’t see it as more than inidual cases gone wrong that needed addressing. I didn’t see it as a systemic issue until very recently.”On Thursday morning, Rudd was forced to admit officials did have targets for removals, having previously denied their existence.“The immigration arm of the Home Office has been using local targets for internal performance management. These were not published targets against which performance was assessed, but if they were used inappropriately then I am clear that this will have to change.On Thursday afternoon, Rudd was forced to issue a hasty clarification after appearing to leave the door open to the UK staying in a customs union with the EU.“I should have been clearer – of course when we leave the EU we will be leaving the customs union.In a series of late-night tweets, Rudd apologised for not being aware of documents, leaked to the , which set out immigration removal targets.\u0026nbsp‘I wasn’t aware of specific removal targets. I accept I should have been and I’m sorry that I wasn’t. I didn’t see the leaked document, although it was copied to my office as many documents are.Rudd, an ardent remainer, impressed pro-EU colleagues in debates during the referendum campaign – with one particularly withering putdown of Boris Johnson especially memorable – and was subsequently a powerful voice in cabinet for those wanting to stay in the customs union. But while her absence around the cabinet table, with its delicate balance of remainers and Brexiters, will be keenly felt, she is also returning to the backbenches knowing exactly where all the bodies are buried.She sat on the Cabinet’s EU withdrawal “war” committee, led the government’s work on post-departure immigration policy, and was a trusted confidante for those in government, including in No 10, who wanted the lightest touch Brexit possible. Rudd has been unswervingly loyal to the prime minister so far, but she might not feel so inclined to be on the backbenches. Less than two weeks ago, the biggest obstacle between Rudd and No 10 seemed to be the question of whether she would hold her seat at the next election. Even at the height of the targets fiasco, many thought she would survive, not least because she retained the support of Tory backbenchers, many of whom liked her personally.Her fortitude in turning up for a television debate during last year’s general election, which May herself had refused to do, just 48 hours after her father had died won her the respect of MPs from right across the Commons. Her personal history is that of a woman who would always have intended to reach the top. Her father was a stockbroker, her brother Roland, a leading remain backer and financial PR wizard, and she was married for five years to AA Gill, the late restaurant critic, with whom she had two children. In his columns she was, famously, the Silver Spoon.Her backstory is typical of many women on the A-list of candidates David Cameron set up to symbolise his modernisation programme: private school, university, a brief career in banking and finance, and a reputation for networking. Richard Curtis, who recruited her to supply extras for Four Weddings and a Funeral, was impressed by how many dukes she knew.Rudd’s glamour and energy won her the marginal seat of Hastings in 2010 and 2015. After May’s arrival in Downing Street, she was one of the ministers who prospered. She proved herself suited to a project dear to May’s heart: building a female leadership team. Rudd went to the Home Office. With Johnson in the Foreign Office, May had set up her two most obvious rivals in jobs that nowadays rarely produce prime ministers.Loyalty is one of Rudd’s defining political characteristics. But she does not fawn, and she is trusted by the people who can influence her future. In the anguished team that ran the 2017 election campaign, Rudd blossomed, warm and authentic against May’s clumsy reserve. And on 9 June, it was Rudd who emerged stronger from the wreckage. Such was the bond of confidence built between Rudd and May that the idea of Rudd moving to the Treasury began to circulate. In a piece of historic symbolism, the second female prime minister would create the first female chancellor.Instead, Rudd began her second year as home secretary, a job where success is defined as stopping things from happening. For Rudd, it is even harder. No one who knows her thinks she believes in May’s cherished ambition of cutting net migration to below 100,000.Until a fortnight ago, it was generally understood Rudd was a natural liberal oppressed by the demands of the security state and the tendency of the prime minister to begin every conversation with the remark: “When I was home secretary …”Well-sourced stories emerged that she was trying to adopt a Blairite “tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime” strategy for violent crime. Yet when the strategy launched, she admitted to not having read her own research on the impact of police cuts. Now, as well as her job being taken away, it is difficult to see how her status as a leading liberal can survive the facts of Windrush."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fda58f19564d3b0c82d889f657448d36f188eef/0_37_3053_1833/master/3053.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2595f350b758ca92d4d2ff3e24745597","title":"lebron pours in 45 to carry cleveland cavaliers past indiana pacers in game 7","story":"LeBron James scored 45 points and got some needed help in Game 7 to stay unbeaten in the opening round of the NBA playoffs, leading the Cleveland Cavaliers to a 105-101 win over the Indiana Pacers, who pushed the game’s best player to the limit.James improved to 13-0 in the first round and kept Cleveland’s strange season alive – for the time being. It took everything James and the Cavs had to hold off the Pacers, who were swept by Cleveland a year ago and came in confident after a 34-point win in Game 6.The Cavs will open the conference semifinals on Tuesday at top-seeded Toronto.James played 43 minutes, leaving late in the third quarter and heading straight to the locker room to be treated for cramps. The 33-year-old was going to leave it all on the floor in what some Cleveland fans feared could have been his last game with the franchise.Tristan Thompson made a rare start for the Cavs – Cleveland coach Tyronn Lue used his 34th different starting lineup this season – and added 15 points and 10 rebounds. Kevin Love made four three-pointers, and George Hill returned after missing three games with back spasms to score 11 in 19 second-half minutes.Victor Oladipo scored 30 and Darren Collison had 23 for the Pacers, who were still within four points in the final minute before a cutting James scored on a bullet pass from Kyle Korver with 30 seconds left.Oladipo hit a three at the horn and was immediately embraced by James, who had never played a Game 7 in the first round and wasn’t about to let Indiana end his run toward an eighth straight finals.It was the first Game 7 in Quicken Loans Arena history, and Cleveland fans were on edge from the start.A loss would not only have ended the Cavs’ season earlier than expected and their reign as three-time conference champions, but would have pushed James closer to free agency. He’s expected to opt out of his contract in July to test the market, and there’s already a line of teams stretching from Philadelphia to Los Angeles looking to sign the three-time champion.After the Cavs were rocked in Game 6 at Indianapolis, Lue knew he needed to shake things up.So he switched his starting lineup for the fourth time in the series, going with James, Korver, Thompson, Love and JR Smith. Thompson had played just 24 minutes in the first six games of the series and made his first start since 28 March.It was the first time Lue used the starting lineup all season, and in the season’s biggest game, he went with the players he trusts most – James, Love, Smith and Thompson are the only holdovers from the three Finals teams.Thompson made an immediate impact, scoring six points and seven rebounds, and behind James’ 26 points, the Cavs built an 11-point halftime lead.James Harden proved once again that Utah’s vaunted defense was no match for him.Harden scored 41 points and the Houston Rockets raced out to a huge lead and sailed to a 110-96 win over the Jazz in Game 1 of the Western Conference semifinals on Sunday.Houston was up by 25 at halftime behind 34 points combined from Harden and Chris Paul. The Jazz, who didn’t wrap up their first-round series with Oklahoma City until late Friday night, looked sluggish and struggled to keep pace with the top-seeded Rockets, who hadn’t played since eliminating Minnesota on Wednesday.The Jazz tied for second in the NBA in the regular season by allowing just 99.8 points, but failed to stop Harden in any of their meetings. Harden, who also had seven assists and eight rebounds, picked up where he left off in the regular season against the Jazz when he averaged 34.3 points, led by a 56-point performance in a 137-110 win in November.“Their defense is really good – their defense is super,” Houston coach Mike D’Antoni said. “But James is James.”Utah coach Quin Snyder seemed at a loss as to how to limit the MVP front-runner, who had the sixth 40-point playoff game of his career.“He’s a special player,” he said. “It’s hard to give credit to all the things that he does. He just impacts the game in so many mays. You have to try to make it harder for him.”It was Houston’s fourth straight win by 10 or more points this postseason, and the Rockets have won their five games against the Jazz by an average of 16.8 points.“We’re different,” Harden said. “We’ve seen so many different defenses throughout this year that have prepared us for this moment.”The Jazz got 21 points each from rookie Donovan Mitchell and Jae Crowder while playing without starting point guard Ricky Rubio, who sat with a strained left hamstring. It was a significant blow after he averaged 14 points, 7.3 rebounds and seven assists in the first round.The Jazz refused to blame their tough game on the fact that they didn’t have much of a break between the first and second round.“It’s a quick turnaround obviously and there’s some fatigue,” Mitchell said. “But that wasn’t the reason for the performance.”The Rockets had 10 three-pointers by halftime, led by three apiece from Harden and PJ Tucker. They finished with 17, including seven from Harden, which tied his career-high for a playoff game.The Rockets were up by 18 entering the fourth after Paul hit a three-pointer at the end of the third. Utah scored the first seven points of the fourth quarter to get within 86-75, but Harden made three free throws over the next minute to end the run.Rudy Gobert, who had 11 points and nine rebounds, had a dunk after that, but a 3-pointer by Harden extended Houston’s lead to 92-77 with about eight and a half minutes left.Mitchell was shaken up when Eric Gordon stepped on his ankle as he drove to the basket with about five and a half minutes remaining. He stayed on the court for a second holding his ankle before hopping up and walking gingerly to the bench. But remained on the bench for just a few seconds before returning and said after the game that he was OK."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fc75899cbe64170d23a20947d81aecc3f955ccd/17_42_2521_1512/master/2521.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e330361f2033d6a28e48db8a0ce5249f","title":"lewis hamilton wins azerbaijan grand prix red bulls collide","story":"• Raikkonen second Pérez third Sebastian Vettel fourth• Red Bulls of Max Verstappen and Daniel Ricciardo collideFrom formulaic through to a denouement that simply could not have been scripted, the streets of Baku were once again the stage for a compelling, dramatic performance. Where cool heads were called for at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix there was not a little abandon and in its wake fortune too played its part to deliver an unlikely result in a season already notable for refusing to stick to a predictable plot.Lewis Hamilton took the win but it is unlikely to be a favoured memory. He inherited first place with two laps to go from his Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas, who had looked nailed on for the victory until a puncture caused by debris ended his charge, leaving the Finn disconsolate.Behind Hamilton his championship rival, Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel, for some time in control of the race, saw his hopes disappear after a late safety car when he sacrificed calm consideration for an overambitious lunge that reduced him to fourth place.This most unlikely turnaround at the front was reflected in an equally unexpected reversal of the championship standings. Trailing Vettel by nine points before Baku, Hamilton leaves four points to the good, the first time he has topped the table this season.Hamilton, who had not been on the pace all weekend and never looked like threatening for the lead, was honest about his good fortune. “It was mixed emotions,” he said. “Grateful for the opportunity to win but on the other side I did not drive the way I feel like I normally drive, so that hurts a little bit in my heart.”A likely win at the first round in Melbourne was denied Hamilton after a late safety car and he may feel that some justice has been served. But perhaps there will be more satisfaction that his chance of a win here last year was ultimately denied after Vettel barged him. “I was coming out of the last corner in disbelief,” he said. “It was very emotional. In previous years here I have been in the lead and then something went against me. I said maybe third time lucky and it was that scenario today.”Bottas’s ill-fortune and Hamilton’s good favour was the final part of a thrilling last act. Behind them the Red Bulls had been offering a fine narrative of their own, with Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen going wheel to wheel throughout. It was nail-biting stuff but the team had let them race, a decision they came to regret when the Australian went for a pass into the braking zone of turn one. Verstappen had already moved once and then shifted back to the inside where Ricciardo had committed. A terminal collision ensued. The stewards concluded that both were responsible, Verstappen for changing lines twice and Ricciardo for making his move too late. Both were given reprimands.Disappointment was writ large on the faces of the drivers, but that was as nothing to the condemnation from the team principal, Christian Horner. “We are not apportioning blame, they are both to blame,” he said. “They have been reminded that they are part of a team, they are highly paid iniduals and have to act with the team’s interests at heart, not just their own. That message was delivered very clearly.”The safety car the incident caused proved crucial. It allowed Mercedes to pit Bottas, who had stayed out long on his tyres and inherited the lead, to emerge still in front of Vettel.A further lack of focus saw Romain Grosjean put his Haas into the wall on lap 43 while weaving, and that kept the safety car out longer than expected. Five laps later at the restart Bottas had control, but Vettel did not. He charged up the inside into one, far too hot, locked up, went wide and lost places to Hamilton and Kimi Räikkönen, who was second, and then to Force India’s Sergio Pérez who took third, his team’s first podium of the year.It was not the percentage manoeuvre of a championship contender but the German insisted he had no regrets. “I am happy I tried the move. I am not happy it didn’t work. You have to try.” That’s a view he may come to consider again if the season goes to the wire.A lap later Bottas had to face his own slings and arrows, grinding to a halt amid disintegrating rubber. “It was just unfortunate. Unlucky. Ten pints of beer and maybe I will be fine,” said the visibly disappointed Finn. “I will get through it, you always have to get through, it is part of racing but at the moment it is painful.”Hamilton felt for Bottas but knows that he and his team have real work ahead. Their issue with bringing the tyres up to temperature looked no closer to being solved in Baku and he acknowledged that they had to address it.For the moment, however, he leaves with a lead, favoured by fortune but also more than aware that he kept his head and seized the reward. It was cause for the four-times world champion to remember the lesson he had learned in karting. “I never give up,” he said. “It has been a while since I have been reminded of that lesson my dad taught me years ago. I kept pushing and things turned out the way they did and that was a realisation of how true that mindset is.”Carlos Sainz in the Renault finished in fifth, while Charles Leclerc completed an exemplary afternoon and the rookie’s best drive thus far in F1 to take sixth for Sauber. The two McLarens of Fernando Alonso and Stoffel Vandoorne were seventh and ninth, with Lance Stroll eighth in the Williams and the Toro Rosso of Brendon Hartley 10th."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a4eca5dab1b7d743adafa178e9763c023ac4201/0_0_600_360/master/600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94721308e34d24afa2c2ff8c4d80ddbe","title":"mood music joe penhall old vic","story":"Gender politics and creative differences are explored in Joe Penhall’s drama about the record industry. He shares his journey through music psychologyWhen I was 11, I wrote to George Martin and asked him how I could become a record producer. He replied promptly, advising me to keep up my classical guitar lessons and music theory studies and not to give up my schoolwork. He said it was important to be passionate about music, but you had to be pragmatic too. Conflict lurks around every corner and you need a cool head to avoid it.As we’ve been rehearsing my new play, Mood Music, about a warring record producer and a young female singer-songwriter, the cast have been asking me why musical conflicts are so volatile. As one of my characters says: “Musicians don’t really like each other. They just like the music. When they’re actually playing, everything’s fine. The rest of the time it’s like Stockholm syndrome.” When it comes to creative differences, there’s nothing like a fight over music. From the Beatles to Fleetwood Mac, who have just split for the umpteenth time – replacing Lindsey Buckingham with the calmest man in rock, Neil Finn – quarrelling bands almost never escape or outgrow that conflict, even in old age.My assumption was always that because music is one of the most overwhelmingly emotional art forms, arguments about it were correspondingly emotional. It comes from the heart so you take it to heart. People sacrifice their lives for a career in music, so the stakes are high when things go wrong. Then I talked to psychotherapists, psychologists, psychoanalysts and entertainment lawyers to make sense of it and learned it’s even more complicated. Some music psychologists – yes, there is such a job – even argue it’s Darwinian.A character in Mood Music says: “Music affects the reward centre of the brain. It literally creates emotions. It stimulates the same neural pathways that are stimulated by love or addiction. It generates dopamine and serotonin. It’s very difficult to control your emotions when music is involved.” Research indicates that music can be used as therapy, to calm and reassure, or to inflict what the US military in Iraq calls “torture lite”. In a 2008  article, Clive Stafford Smith documented the way the US military claimed to have made “a quantum leap in psyops” by playing death metal to prisoners, inspired by the Biblical tale of Joshua destroying the will of the people of Jericho by using “loud horns”. The American band Deicide’s track Fuck Your God was deployed to destroy their will.But loud music with a hard backbeat is usually considered adrenalising because it stimulates our fight or flight response, going back to our primitive roots. When you’re in fight or flight, you’re volatile. It gives you courage and fortitude. You become fearless. Music affects emotion because it stimulates episodic memory and alters mood. It reminds you of emotional moments in your life, making you sad or joyous, bitter or nostalgic. “Evaluative conditioning” means that listening repeatedly to a song during an especially enjoyable activity results in that song causing enjoyment of its own accord. Navigating shifting emotional states is good for our social skills. It helps fend off trouble. But it also starts it.If somebody insists on changing or controlling the music you make, or taking it away from you altogether, it betokens a lack of empathy. If you’re in a recording studio, doing take after take, forced to listen over and over again, you’re in a heightened state of volatility – especially if you wrote the music and it means more to you than anybody else. When you combine music with drugs and alcohol, anything can happen. It’s no coincidence that drunk people tend to sing as well as fight. There is a phenomenon called “emotional contagion”. Listening to happy music is like being around happy people. Listening to angry or depressed music is like being around angry or depressed people – the mood is infectious. But we need it because by helping us to match other people’s emotions it helps us to practise empathy. When you throw gender into the mix, as Fleetwood Mac have admitted, it gets more complicated. Five years ago at an industry talk, Stevie Nicks told the crowd: “We fought very hard for feminism, for women’s rights. What I’m seeing today is a very opposite thing. I don’t know why, but I see women being put back in their place. And I hate it. We’re losing all we worked so hard for.” The music industry doesn’t just monetise talent, it monetises trauma, more often than not women’s trauma. Nina Simone, Janis Joplin, Karen Carpenter, Amy Winehouse, Kesha – there’s an endless list of female recording artists broken on the wheel. The musicians, lawyers and psychotherapists in my play ask infuriating questions stemming from music industry articles of faith. Are men better songwriters, or just better arrangers? Are men more technical, or just better bullshitters? Can women write riffs, or only lyrics? Does songwriter Cat have the detachment required to write a classic or is she too temperamental? In denying Cat a songwriting credit, producer Bernard ponders the notion that music is “more important than gender”. But I learned from a Harley Street psychotherapist that to rob somebody of their due credit is “just another way of subjugating somebody, breaking down their free will and sense of self and denying their very existence. It’s a particularly intimate form of betrayal, which can leave you feeling completely empty and engender powerful feelings of futility.” By labelling her a “a” and scrutinising her sexuality, he inflicts upon her feelings of emptiness and futility. But he also, inadvertently, adrenalises proceedings, stimulating her survival instincts. It fires her up and makes her fight. Gender politics, just like “musical differences,” are about asserting and protecting identity – and a source of deep-seated, instinctual conflict.

Gamblers’ every click, page view and transaction is scientifically examined so that ads statistically more likely to work can be pushed through Google, Facebook and other platforms.“They’ll know everything about an inidual from their inside leg measurement onwards,” said Nick, a consultant within the gambling industry.Users unwittingly consent to the use of their data in ways they aren’t aware of due to lengthy terms and conditions, enabling their information to legally be used in this way.“Once someone has logged into a gambling platform it can do whatever they want with them,” said Brian, a digital marketer for the gambling industry. “It’s like a science, it’s not just random advertising messages, the whole thing is personalised, and data-driven customer profiles are constructed from gamblers’ behaviour.”Last August, the  revealed the gambling industry uses third-party companies to harvest people’s data, helping bookmakers and online casinos target people on low incomes and those who have stopped gambling.Despite condemnation from MPs, experts and campaigners, such practices remain an industry norm.“You can buy email lists with more than 100,000 people’s emails and phone numbers from data warehouses who regularly sell data to help market gambling promotions,” said Brian. “They say it’s all opted in but people haven’t opted in at all.”In this way, among others, gambling companies and advertisers create detailed customer profiles including masses of information about their interests, earnings, personal details and credit history.“I never cease to be amazed at how low the gambling industry is prepared to go to exploit those who have indicated an interest in gambling,” says Carolyn Harris, a Labour MP who has campaigned for gambling reform.“The industry is geared to get people addicted to something that will cause immense harm, not just to society but to iniduals and their families. They are parasitical leeches and I will offer no apology for saying that.”The Facebook data scandal highlighted the potential risks of transferring people’s data to third parties, but there remains precious little regulation or transparency when it comes to data collection, retention and use.“The legislation on data is a long way behind the technology itself,” said Asif. “We were often audited, and there were strict regulations on advertisements, but there was never any oversight on data.“There are no safeguards to stop advertisers putting an email list with hundreds of thousands of people’s data on a USB and taking it with them when they finish a contract.”The Information Commissioner’s Office points to the Data Protection Act 1998 and GDPR, which both place requirements on organisations to inform iniduals about the ways in which their personal data is used.“The GDPR strengthens this right to be informed, requiring organisations to provide people with additional information, including the lawful basis for processing, the period for which data will be stored and details of any third parties that will receive the data,” an ICO spokesperson said.Elsewhere, there are plans to geolocate customers in order to identify when they arrive at stadiums so they can prompted via texts to bet on the game they are about to watch.The gambling industry earned£14bn in 2016, £4.5bn of which from online betting, and it is pumping some of that money into making its products more sophisticated and, in effect, addictive.“It’s no surprise that these companies are investing as much as they are into these sorts of algorithms to supposedly detect people who may be at risk of developing gambling problems, because the exact same technology allows them to market to people very effectively,” said Nick.“It’s not a benign move on the part of operators, and although I wouldn’t say it is a cynical ploy, there are clearly huge commercial benefits from this sort of investment.”A spokesperson for the Campaign for Fairer Gambling said: “Big Data is being cynically exploited by the gambling industry to target vulnerable consumers. So the Gambling Commission’s trust in operators to use customer data for social responsibility purposes is naïve at best.”Mark Etches, chief executive of GambleAware, a gambling-related harm charity, said: “Gambling advertising can be anywhere from TV screens, to social media, to mobile phone apps, and it can be hard for people at risk of developing a gambling problem to ignore the overload of messages.“We hope all gambling companies put a similar level of commitment and resources behind promoting safer gambling and the help available at BeGambleAware.org as they do their own products.”Some names have been changed to protect identities."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7713b21ba327a796481875257c1e6cc5017e9fe/2_0_10663_6400/master/10663.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c1905ee68409ea68a051282bb7fe106","title":"googles talk to books or how one day ai could lose its mind","story":"The search engine’s new feature is being sold as a creative tool – but mainly it’s a collection of semi-coherent and accidentally profound sentencesI’m confuddled by Google’s new search feature. Talk to Books lets you ask whole questions, and pulls up a list of responses from 100,000 books in the Google Books database. In theory, this is incredible. We know the internet is a trash can of terrible people and misinformation – a kitten clutching a cat-print edition of Mein Kampf and aggressively selling you maxi dresses. But books! Books are portals to the greatest minds of recorded time. Why ask Jeeves when you can ask PG Wodehouse? Or Montaigne or Tolstoy or Woolf? They’re sure to know more than Reddit. And at times, the tool does seem strangely wise.But there’s also something disorienting in the experiment, in which answers are given to slightly different questions than the one I ask. Sometimes they’re dry and literal. “What is death?” generates passages from medical textbooks, but nothing more spiritual. “Do you know the way to San Jose?” pulls up a Los Angeles hiking guide, which advises me to take the 118 Freeway West, then park in a dirt lot to the right. But it doesn’t ask where I’m coming from. I’m not sure I know where it’s coming from either – frequently, it sounds quite mad. “How deep is your love?” yields Charles Darwin’s thoughts on the evolutionary reduction of crest in Silk fowl. (Probably good the Bee Gees cut that verse.)It is refreshing, though, to step away from personalising algorithms and data tracking, which have given us a curiously claustrophobic internet, closer to a hall of mirrors. We’ve built a servile model of technology, and invariably imagine its flipside – the single-minded, aggressive robot uprising. Talk to Books presents an alternative vision of AI: the rambling pub bore. Semi-coherent, undeniably literate, accidentally profound. It suggests the future of the internet may be far stranger than predicted.

Or succumb to dispiriting, channel-mandated storylines about leaking client nudes by accident, winding up on a reality dating show, or being caught up in riots, and throwing their ladder into the window of a Footlocker.

McDonnell was joined by the Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable, who said there should be an inquiry into why En+ was allowed to float in a deal that earned banks, lawyers, auditors and PR firms £25m in fees.Cable said it was “very odd that we will follow Trump into military action, but won’t join in imposing tough sanctions on oligarchs”. On the En+ listing, he said: “There should be a review of this flotation. When Russian oligarchs are using the London markets to raise money we must take a strict line on scrutiny.”Six banks shared an estimated half of the £25m with the largest share taken by the lead bookrunner, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Citigroup, Credit Suisse, JP Morgan and Russian banks Sberbank and VTB Capital would have shared the rest. The remainder was to be shared by lawyers including Linklaters and White \u0026amp Case with smaller auditors KPMG and financial PR specialists Finsbury.En+ is a holding company for Deripaska’s metal and energy interests. He built his business empire during Russia’s so-called aluminium wars following the post-Soviet privatisations of the 1990s. It floated in London last November, raising $1bn which was used to pay back borrowings owed to VTB, a bank prevented by sanctions from raising capital in the EU and the US.The City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), approved the flotation, but a fortnight ago Deripaska was one of 38 Russian business leaders the US Treasury targeted because of “malign activity” on the part of Vladimir Putin’s government.En+’s share price tumbled as a result, and the stock is now priced at $6, less than half the $14 flotation price. A string of independent directors have resigned although the company’s chairman, the former Conservative minister Lord Barker of Battle, remains the firm’s figurehead. Finsbury no longer advises En+, saying its mandate only extended to the listing.The US Treasury cited Russia’s support for Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad, malicious cyber activities, the occupation of Crimea and support for violence in eastern Ukraine as its reasoning for putting the sanctions in place. They were already in preparation when the UK accused Putin’s government of being behind the poisoning of the Skripals in Salisbury.An FCA spokesperson said the regulator had responded to the Trump administration’s action by delisting a class of En+ shares aimed at US citizens, but that it had no plans to take any further action because the British government had not asked it to.Deripaska is one of Russia’s best connected international businessmen. Paul Manafort, the former head of Donald Trump’s election campaign who is fighting fraud and tax charges brought by special counsel Robert Mueller, worked for Deripaska for many years.Criticising the British failure to follow the US example, McDonnell said: “The City of London cannot risk to be seen as a light touch when it comes to imposing effective sanctions on Russia and clamping down on foreign oligarchs linked to the regime. In this case, it looks like once again we have been playing catch-up with regulators in other countries.”EN+ did not respond to a request for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da8a2b6483c373a8c35387af7848693464225378/0_84_3916_2350/master/3916.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80f9a107c7498a889d8d718fd1df54b0","title":"north korea denuclearization john bolton mike pompeo","story":"North Korea will have to show concrete and tangible evidence it has made a strategic decision to give up nuclear weapons before any move is made to ease pressure on the regime, Donald Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, said on Sunday.With a summit between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un potentially as close as three weeks away, Bolton warned that no progress would be made without verifiable evidence of Pyongyang’s commitment to complete and “irreversible” denuclearization. “What we want to see from them is evidence that it’s real and not just rhetoric,” he told CBS’ Face the Nation.The famously hawkish Bolton took a notably less hardline approach than was reflected in his many disparaging remarks towards North Korea before he was brought into the White House earlier this month. In one typical comment on Fox News he made what he called a joke: “How do you know the North Korean regime is lying – answer, their lips are moving.”Now Bolton is striking a more nuanced position. In an interview with Fox News Sunday, he stressed that the US had made no commitment to remove its military presence from the Korean peninsula and said: “There’s nobody in the Trump administration who’s starry-eyed about what’s happening here.”He went on to say that if North Korea were willing to allow full and complete disclosure of its nuclear weapons programme coupled with international verification, “things could move quickly”.Hopes of a breakthrough in dismantling North Korea’s nuclear weapons at a Trump-Kim summit have risen in the wake of fast-moving events. Details emerging from the office of South Korean president Moon Jae-in following his historic face-to-face encounter with Kim suggest the North Korean leader offered to allow foreign inspectors and journalists to witness nuclear decommissioning ahead of the Trump summit.The Trump administration is remaining noncommittal about such dramatic posturing from Kim, as the US tries to walk a hazardous path that both pursues a breakthrough and remains aware of broken promises made in the past. In his first interview as secretary of state, former CIA director Mike Pompeo characterized the current flurry of diplomatic activity as a “real opportunity for something that would be transformative for the world if we could achieve it”.Pompeo spoke to ABC’s This Week from Saudi Arabia, giving generally stilted answers and bringing the interview to an abrupt close after facing questions on US strategy. He declined to reveal intelligence on North Korean nuclear capabilities and said repeatedly: “This administration has its eyes wide open.”He added: “We know the history, we know the risks. We’re going to negotiate in a different way than before, we’re going to require steps that demonstrate denuclearization is going to be achieved. We’re not going to take promises or words, we are going to look for actions and deeds.”Earlier this year, Pompeo had a secret meeting with Kim in Pyongyang, lasting more than an hour. He told ABC it had been a “good conversation. We talked about serious matters, on the hardest issues that face our two countries.”Bolton went into further details about subjects that Trump will want to raise should the summit with Kim go ahead at a time and location still to be determined. North Korean ballistic missile programs, biological and chemical weapons programs, and the “abduction of innocent Japanese and South Korean citizens over the years” would all be on the list, Bolton said.Despite the reticence on the part of both Pompeo and Bolton to go into details about the precise US gameplan, top administration figures were outspoken on one point: all praise for current extraordinary events should be bestowed on Trump.The most passionate proponent of that idea is Trump himself. At a rally in Michigan on Saturday night he told the crowd: “I had one of the fake news groups this morning saying: ‘What do you think President Trump had to do with it?’ I’ll tell you what. Like, how about everything?”In response, there were chants of “Nobel! Nobel!”, in reference to the Nobel peace prize.Bolton made the same point on Sunday to CBS, albeit in more measured terms: “I think it’s clear we’re here where we are today because of the pressure that the Trump administration has put on North Korea. Economic pressure, political, military pressure. I think this is widely recognized.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/382261a9a7820c66b20f1c2433217523bb9b3a1f/693_272_3808_2286/master/3808.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5760d9fd1f8406a9d26eb586528fbf25","title":"monday briefing rudd blown away by windrush","story":"Good morning.

May faced immediate calls from Labour and the Lib Dems to front up to the Commons about Rudd’s resignation and the whole Windrush scandal. The other problem is who she should pick to replace Rudd at the Home Office and whether the loss of a “soft Brexiter” upsets the cabinet’s precarious balance of leave and remain forces.

Wolf’s barbs about the press secretary, Sarah Sanders, and Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, provoked an angry response from conservatives. The White House adviser Mercedes Schlapp and her husband, Matt Schlapp, who chairs the American Conservative Union, walked out. He later tweeted: “Enough of elites mocking all of us.” Several leading journalists and Trump critics agreed that Wolf had gone too far. But the comedian was defended by many people on social media who said she had the right to say what she wanted under the first amendment. Rosie O’Donnell, one of Trump’s bêtes noires, slammed those who called Wolf’s speech vulgar by replying: “It’s a roast – truth telling is required.”Rail cutbacks – Millions of trees are at risk of being chopped down as Network Rail engages in a “pre-emptive strike” to prevent falling leaves and branches from disrupting services. The company has used drones to create an aerial map of its 40,000 hectares of railway and identified “hotspots” it needs to deal with. But the cull has angered conservation groups who say the chainsaw massacre endangers the habitat of wildlife along the country’s railways. One passenger said of his journey between Leeds and Manchester: “It looked like some kind of logging operation .. all you could see was mile after mile of tree stumps and sawdust.”Cancer care alarm – More alarm bells have sounded for the NHS in the shape of a report by Macmillan Cancer Support which says specialist cancer nurses are being “run ragged” as they are forced to take on heavier workloads because of high vacancy rates in the profession. There is also a “startlingly broad variation” in the number of specialist cancer nurses in some parts of England compared with how many new patients are being diagnosed. New lung cancer cases each year per specialist nurse vary from 62 to 203 in different areas, while for breast cancer nurses they vary from 56 to 145. Vocation, vocation, vocation – As we enter local election week, it has emerged that almost one in 10 councillors in London either work for property businesses or have received gifts or hospitality from them.

Chinese officials and state media focused instead on president Xi Jinping’s meeting with Indian prime minister Narendra Modi and a visit by Xi to China’s Yangtze river. After the summit, China’s ministry of foreign affairs released a short statement saying Beijing “welcomed” the results of the talks. “China stands ready to continue to play its positive role to this end,” it added, according to Xinhua news agency. Then, on Monday, China’s foreign ministry announced it was sending its top diplomat, foreign minister Wang Yi, to visit North Korea this week.The visit comes as China, North Korea’s most powerful ally, moves to reassert itself in quickly moving peace talks with the formerly isolated Korean state. China has long said that North Korea’s nuclear programme is for Washington and Pyongyang to work out between themselves. But now warming ties between North Korea and the US could dramatically alter the power structure in the region, leaving Beijing on the outside.Kim said on Friday he is willing to give up nuclear weapons if the US promises not to invade and commits to a formal end to the Korean War that ended with an armistice in 1953. Kim and US president Donald Trump could meet within the next month.North and South Korea have been ided since the end of the Korean War (1950-53), and except for about a decade ending in 2008, relations between the two have remained frosty. The two nations technically remain in a state of war, since a peace treaty was never signed.\u0026nbspThere have been occasional outbreaks of violence, most recently in 2010 when 50 people were killed when a South Korean navy corvette was sunk and several islands close to the border were attacked.This meeting\u0026nbspcould touch on a formal truce\u0026nbspbut this is also not the first time North Korea has expressed a willingness to abandon its nuclear ambitions. A deal with the US, Japan and South Korea in the 1990s was meant to give the North civilian nuclear power without the ability to build a weapon, but the reactor was never finished.North Korea\u0026nbsppledged to relinquish its nuclear programme\u0026nbspin 2007 in exchange for sanctions relief and fuel, but later pulled out of that agreement and expelled inspectors in 2009.Read a full explainer on the Korea summit here“So now things are out of China’s control and it is no surprise that it is being excluded from the discussions.”While talks between North and South Korea and Washington fit China’s interest in stability on the Korean peninsula, Beijing is also worried about an unfavourable regional strategic balance unfolding.China will still be part of any discussions over a formal peace treaty to replace the armistice signed by China, the US and North Korea in 1953, ending more than three years of fighting between the North and the South. A trilateral summit in May between Japan, South Korea, and China will also provide Beijing another chance to exert influence, according to Kovrig. “Politically, I think China is being careful to give North and South Korea the space to advance the diplomatic process, because that’s in Beijing’s interest. Watching closely and working behind the scenes to position itself,” said Kovrig."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7367799adc822bdfd24c4f8625cef7eff67e830/0_80_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35d69f76f4e11be8bdd1e38e50a78438","title":"my financial future can i have my brunch and eat it too","story":"The options appear to be: never socialise and stay in to save for a house, or live a normal, modern urban life and spiral into debt. But is there a third way?Sitting firmly in the middle of the millennial generation (those born 1981-2000) and I’m told I could easily afford to buy my first home in London if I just give up: coffee, my gym membership, an annual weekend away, takeaway food, and a mobile upgrade, or one night out a week, for five years – or avocados.Sure, London living is afforded by renting the equivalent of a dodgy hostel dorm, nights out revolving around two-for-one deals, and “side-hustles”, which is a glorified term for my three jobs. So, should I accept that I can’t have my brunch and eat it too? Living paycheck to paycheck isn’t the dream and maybe neither is owning a home, but there must be a way I could at least consider the option.I’m certainly not alone, but maybe we’re placing too much value on “Yolo” – apparently a typical habit of young people today – so I’ve asked Paul Bridgwater, head of commercial and proposition at financial services provider OneFamily, and millennial lifestyle and personal finance expert Lisa Rowan from The Penny Hoarder what they think – and luckily neither suggested a five-year period where I give up all that I hold dear.Is it really that hard to save in a big city or am I being led astray?Rowan suggests that, unfortunately, it’s not all in my head. “Affordable, low-amenity units are being replaced with luxury buildings that are simply out of reach for many people, especially young people in the early stages of their careers,” she says. “This competitive housing environment means more workers in their 20s and 30s are enduring long commutes from the suburbs or are living with several roommates in order to make the most of their budgets.” But, Bridgwater says, while it can feel unattainable without the help from “the bank of mum and dad” we do have the benefit of living in a connected, digital age that can help us achieve our financial goals.I really value my social life – do I have to give up a chunk of it for five years?No, says Rowan, but there are some hacks to help make sure you don’t spend most of your monthly wages during the excitement of payday. In short, be at least a bit prepared. “Knowing the type of activity upfront can help you determine whether an event is a social and financial priority for you – then, it’s easier to make compromises. You may skip on the 12-person birthday dinner at a fancy restaurant, but you can still meet the group for drinks or dessert afterward. You can still go on a bar crawl with your friends, but perhaps eat a hearty meal before you leave the house,” she says.Bridgwater agrees, and says it’s safe to assume that most of your friends are in the same boat, so be straight up with them. “Money is a bit of a taboo subject for any age group, especially in the UK. On a practical level, earnings, savings and debts are not really discussed and perhaps they should be,” he says. “Like anything else in life, by talking and sharing issues, interesting solutions will come to light.”OK, so maybe I should be budgeting. What are some handy guidelines?Bridgwater says that budgeting isn’t the same for everyone, but taking away the temptation to spend is often the easiest way to save. “Create different accounts for your big expenses (housing, bills and savings) and then set up a standing order into these accounts one to two days after your wages go in from your main account. You’ll then know the money you have left in your main account is money you can spend,” he says.So, can I think about saving for a big purchase and still keep seeing my friends?Yes, says Rowan: “You can have your instant and delayed gratification at the same time.” A product like OneFamily’s stocks and shares Lifetime Isa is a good start when considering your options. With a Lifetime Isa, for every £4 put in, the government adds £1 – so save up to £4,000 a year and get £1,000 as a bonus (available after 12 months). Lifetime Isas are available either based on cash investments, which can be preferable for first-time house purchases in the short-term or stocks and shares investments, which might be preferable if you are aiming to buy your first home in five or more years, as they offer potentially better returns over the longer term, but be aware that capital is at risk.For information on the OneFamily stocks and shares Lifetime Isa, visit OneFamily.

But Pricewatch reckons that a good consumer needs to follow many more commandments to make sure they get the most out of life. By our count there are 24, in fact.We are all creatures of habit. We tend to shop in the same supermarkets and buy clothes in the same places and stick with the same phone, gas, television and broadband providers, come what may.This is understandable but not clever. Make a point of doing your “big shop” in a different supermarket every now and then. Just to shake things up. And if you have not experienced the delights of the German discounters in a while – and less than 30 per cent of Irish consumers shop in either Aldi or Lidl regularly – then give them a whirl.The quality has improved dramatically in recent years and they will save you money. They will also dramatically reduce the time you spend shopping because they are small and have less than 20 per cent of the stock a really big supermarket operated by their rivals has, so you will be able to zip around. And probably buy some class of weird jack hammer to boot.We throw away as much as a third of the food we buy and appear happy to bin hundreds, if not thousands, of euro each year. Stop doing that by making sure you only buy what you need. Make lists and stick to them.Not long ago we heard a terrible story of a person who ended up paying health insurance on the double for a whole year because they thought they had cancelled with one provider and signed up with another only to find out way down the line that the cancellation had not gone through as they thought.When the company they had tried to leave asked them what date they had made the original cancellation call and who they had spoken to they had no idea. No records mean it is always going to be harder to get redress if things go wrong. So if you are interacting with a company and the outcome matters, take a note of the date and time and the people you were speaking to on your phone.If you are making a complaint write a quick timeline of your grievances and include dates and times of phone calls or other conversations. Write down who you spoke to and what was said.People who shop on impulse rarely make the best decisions. Always ask yourself two questions: do you really need this thing? And is this thing really good value for money?And then go away and think about it for a while.Randomly received text messages and Facebook posts promising you free iPads are always nonsense. Expensive creams will not give you the gift of eternal youth, that expensive diet or homeopathic treatment aimed at taking years off you will not work.And the sub-Saharan princess with a case full of diamonds for you is actually a sweaty man in a wife-beater and Y-fronts who will give you nothing more than endless heartache. And if you ever get an unsolicited email from your bank, from Revenue or anyone else asking for your bank details – or even just your name and email address – it is a scam, no matter how convincing the mail looks.Cooking is cheaper and better for your physical and mental well-being than relying on processed food.Cyclists are healthier than drivers. That is a fact. A couple of years ago the Lancet published a report which showed cyclists to be slimmer and likely to live longer than their car-driving counterparts.Looking at biological data from more than 150,000 people and studying the health of half a million others aged between 40 and 69, scientists definitively concluded that getting on your bike was better for you. Another Danish study showed that regular cyclists live for more than five years longer than non-cyclists. And it will also save you thousands of euro in commuting costs while allowing you to feel super-smug.Generally speaking such diets are expensive and worthless – this is particularly true of detox diets which are just nonsense. Don’t trust anyone who tries to sell anything that claims to be detoxifying unless it is a human organ. And you’re probably better off not trusting someone trying to sell you a liver or a kidney either.For all its faults and for all the recent controversies of recent years, we should still be grateful that Ireland has a good supply of good-quality drinking water which comes from our taps free of charge (yes, yes, yes we know we pay for it through general taxation but you know what we mean).It takes three litres of regular water to manufacture a single litre of bottled water, and that plastic bottle will take at least 500 years to break down, at least until those enzymes that have evolved to eat plastic multiply. And let’s just hope they don’t evolve any further and start eating us.If you happen to be among the 70 per cent of Irish people with private health insurance who has not changed provider for a few years do before your next renewal date.It will save you hundreds of euro each year – and you may even save thousands if you happen to be on a really expensive policy. And if you are canny you should be able to make the savings without losing any real benefits.Remember when switching, providers can’t ask intrusive questions about your health. The only thing they can really ask if if you have health insurance already and, if so, for how long and with which insurer and what level of cover you have.As with health insurance providers, gas and electricity companies profit from our lethargy and ignorance. By switching from one charging you the standard rate to one offering a discounted rate you could easily save more than €200 over the next 12 months.As many as 85 per cent of Irish people pay a higher tariff for both electricity and gas than they need to. And unlike Cornflakes or broadband, there is no difference in the quality of the gas or electricity between the dearest and the cheapest.Every now and then set yourself a challenge to spend nothing for just one day. Then see if you can make it three days. Spending can be a habit and it can be broken.And speaking of spending money, never do your grocery shopping while hungry or your online shopping when you are drunk. Don’t routinely carry your credit cards with you. And avoid the temptation to shop on payday. Anyone who goes into Penneys on the day they get paid is bound to leave with an armful of clothes they are almost certainly going to regret buying.Big companies profit from our unwillingness to even open – never mind actually read and try to understand – the bills and statements they send us either virtually or physically. So make a resolution to pay attention to them. You never know when you are being gouged and by whom.Companies have made it a policy to make resolving problems as difficult as possible. The hope is that difficult customers – and by that we mean anyone looking for help or redress – will just go away. If you have a grievance with a company, persist. Don’t just give up if it seems like too much hassle. That’s just playing into their hands.You don’t want to be the person shouting in a shop because it refuses to sell you the flatscreen telly that was incorrectly priced at 1 cent. Retailers are not obliged to sell you a product just because it has a particular price tag on it.And you do not have the automatic right to a refund or a replacement if a product turns out to be faulty or flawed in some way. A provider can instead offer to repair it. Oh and if you pay a deposit for something and then change your mind, do not automatically assume a provider will give you your money back. They might. But they might not. It depends on the terms and conditions.Working as a shop assistant or in a call centre can be incredibly difficult and not very well paid. If you have a grievance, there is little or no point in shouting at the lowest-paid staff member, the very person who has no power to effect change. Always be polite – and always make sure you are addressing your complaints to the right people.Without generalising overly Americans and Germans are great at complaining while Irish people are rubbish. We hate “making a fuss”. Not even Pricewatch is immune and unless a waiter actually spits in our soup before tipping it into our lap we are likely to say everything is grand even if it tastes like cold vomit. But complaining is good and good businesses want to hear our concerns so they can have a chance to address them.Yes Amazon or Asos or the Honk Kong-based electronic’s retailer Dan’s Dodgy Deals might be cheap but what is the ultimate cost? If we all shop online all the time then local retailers will disappear and we will all be the poorer for that.There is no point in mourning the passing of Clerys or Guineys or wherever if the last time you spent any money there was back when Johnny Logan was asking what another year was.Unless you have friends in Senegal or the Democratic Republic of Congo don’t return a missed call from those places. In fact, if you have a missed call from any exotic looking number don’t call back. It’s almost always a scam.We know that sometimes they are longer than the Bible so a handy way to scan them is to copy the whole thing into a Word document and use Ctrl-F to look for key words you think might be relevant.It is easy to complain in a very public way using Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or whatever social media platform you are fond of using yourself. But remember to be polite.These platforms are populated with enough trolls already. And when it comes to sharing personal details on such platforms such as the above, mind yourself and limit the amount of information you put into the public domain.Is there an ombudsman or regulator who can help you out? There is a Financial Services Ombudsman, a Pensions Ombudsman, the Central Bank, a taxi regulator and ComReg, for starters. But remember they can rarely be your starting point, and you will have to exhaust the complaints procedure for that sector and deal with the company before they will entertain you.If you have been let down by a shop or service provider than contact Pricewatch – we might be able to help you out. But please remember we do get a lot of queries and complaints and can’t deal with them all."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Hardeep Singh running unaccredited Isles International University with Dublin addressEU\u0026rsquos chief negotiator wants significant progress on problem of Irish Border by JuneDublin City Council spent average of \u0026euro18,037 doing up 879 units last yearPricewatch\u0026rsquos top tips to help you become a smarter shopper and get the most out of lifeBloody Sunday Trust awarded \u0026euro500,000 to consider if model can be applied across NorthSkilled European negotiator who insists on backstop Border provision set to visit IrelandProposed law \u0026lsquoregressive, incompatible with human dignity and morally unacceptable\u0026rsquoRefugee support groups call for Repeal of the Eighth to protect rights of migrant womenCompulsory retirement ages may be discrimination unless \u0026lsquoobjectively justified\u0026rsquoSeveral women were not told of the delay in their cancer diagnosisOfficer treated in hospital for injuries to hand, head and body after Ballyogan assaultNiche market \u0026lsquoseasonal\u0026rsquo as number of deer farms drops from 500 to \u0026lsquoa small number\u0026rsquoCollision occurred around 6pm on SaturdayHSE: examination will be completed on Monday and women will be notifiedDuo attacked by group of vigilantes before being found in Mullaghbawn area of countyNational Spring Clean: \u0026lsquoIt\u0026rsquos something we have to face in Irish society, we\u0026rsquore quite a dirty nation\u0026rsquoCity\u0026rsquos Abbey Quarter selected for campus focused on crafts, heritage and agri-foodAtheist Ireland compares regulator stance on repeal mural at Project to Iona campaignsExclusive Nord Anglia International School Dublin sets September date opening target"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3478271.1525024171!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eighth amendment causing uncertainty for doctors gynaecologist","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Fine Gael  pressing for a Yes vote in the upcoming referendum on the Eighth Amendment. Photograph: Nick BradshawThe Eighth Amendment should be repealed as it is causing uncertainty and difficulty for doctors and delaying the treatment of seriously ill women, a gynaecologist has said. Speaking at the launch of Fine Gael’s Yes campaign in Cork, Prof Richard Greene said the amendment and the termination of pregnancy were difficult issues with both sides of the debate offering opposing views as to how it affects practitioners and patients. “How does it affect me as a clinician, dealing daily with women and I’ve been working in obstetrics and gynaecology for nearly 30 years? I would say the simplest message I would give about the Eighth Amendment is that it muddies the water –we just don’t have clarity about how we should practise,” said Prof Greene, who works at University College Cork and Cork University Maternity Hospital.He offered examples of how the amendment, which guarantees an equal right to life to the mother and child, has an impact on his work at the hospital. He cited the case of a woman he called Sheila, who presented at 13-14 weeks pregnant with her cervix already open in a pregnancy that she really wanted.“Sheila’s water bag around the baby had gone, the chance that this baby would survive is about one or two in 1,000. The chances of that baby’s lungs developing are limited and the risk of infection is very significant and we have to achieve another 10 weeks of pregnancy to get her to a viable gestation,” he said. “But I have to actually wait until her life is at risk to do what I know is an appropriate treatment. Yes, the 2013 Protection Of Life in Pregnancy Act will allow me to act once her life is in danger but effectively the Eighth Amendment is dictating a tardiness for both Sheila and myself.”Prof Greene also instanced the case of a woman he called Nancy who presented with an ectopic pregnancy, in which the foetus was outside the uterus and unviable. She was also showing signs of bleeding which put her life at risk, he said.“We discuss it with Nancy and her partner. The decision is made to treat her surgically and remove the pregnancy. There is a heartbeat but they accept that it is the appropriate treatment and it meets all the legal requirements,” he said.“However, I leave her and I am called to come back and counsel her again because she overhears a conversation where one staff member says to the other, ‘Is this legal, the baby’s heart is still beating?’ So the correct choice of care is being questioned because of the Eighth Amendment.”Prof Greene also gave the example of a couple he named Martina and Joe who suffered “a profound loss of pregnancy at 38 weeks when their baby was stillborn” and three subsequent miscarriages before Martina became pregnant again only to discover the baby had anencephaly.“This baby is not going to survive, it may be born alive but it will not survive. They were devastated given their story but they were absolutely horrified at the idea we had to wait for the pregnancy to proceed and go to the end of the pregnancy, knowing there was nothing to get out of it,” he said.“And the question they were asking was why cannot we do something now so that we can at least try again and hopefully have a child and I saw the horrendous pain they went through. In the end, the Eighth Amendment was adding to their grief and mental trauma.“They eventually went to the UK for a termination but they are still pained by all of this. They never had a baby to take home, they had no burial place, they had no service with their family. Martina’s physical life was not in danger but they are psychologically traumatised because of it.”Prof Greene accepted some believe the floodgates would open if the Eighth Amendment was repealed but the evidence from Eastern Europe and some US states where free contraception and early healthcare were provided suggested the number of terminations can be reduced multifold.“I trust the women I looked after in pregnancy and I can honestly tell you they make good decisions after much consideration before they undertake a termination. The Eighth Amendment is affecting women and doctors in providing good healthcare and that’s why I’m supporting a Yes vote.”Get the latest news and best analysis ahead of the Eighth Amendment referendum here"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3478324.1525027479!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"most costly school in state at 24 000 a year to enrol 180 pupils","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tChildren attending the Nord Anglia International School in a drum workshop. About €14m has been invested in the school to date. Photograph: Dara MacDónaillThe  Ireland most expensive school is expecting up to 180 pupils when its doors open next September.The Nord Anglia International School Dublin, which will charge day pupils up to €24,000 a year, declined to say how many pupils it has signed up already. Speaking at an open day on Sunday, founding principal Paul Crute said student enrolment was positive and he expected to enrol about 20 pupils in each year, which would deliver a pupil-teacher ratio of about nine to one. About €14 million has been invested in the school so far.“This group of students is made up of Irish students moving to our international curriculum, students of international executives, and students of expats some living and some relocating back to Ireland,” he said.According to the school website, pupils are being accepted for nine “year groups” from about three years to 14 years in the autumn. With 20 pupils in each year this would deliver an enrolment of 180, each paying from €5,900 per term to €8,000 per term depending on tuition and extras. Many of the families attending the open day were from Asia, but a spokesman said this was not necessarily representative of interest so far.Previews of what life will be like for those enrolled in the school in south Co Dublin were given to parents and prospective pupils on Sunday.The event featured a music and dancing session with teachers flown in from The Juilliard School for performing arts in New York.Nord Anglia which is to open in Leopardstown in September has a “strategic association” with the Juilliard School which allows pupils to develop their creative and dramatic skills “on the world stage” said Mr Crute. A previous “learning lab” introduction for prospective parents featured a session with Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Pupils in Dublin will be offered the opportunity to get involved in the “adopt a slum” programme in New Delhi, India, said Mr Crute. Mr Crute said the school would not teach the Irish curriculum, but will opt instead for the International Baccalaureate. The Irish language will be offered. Mr Crute said the school would attract the children of diplomats and those of foreign executives. He said many of the latter group work for global firms which will pay the school fees bill. “We have strategic partnerships with many global companies,” he added. When fully open the school will accept pupils aged from three to 18 years. But in September the school will offer places only to those up to about 14 years to allow children to progress through the International Baccalaureate format. Sports will include basketball, volleyball, martial arts, tennis, fencing and dance. “We are not a rugby school,” said Mr Crute before joking that Ireland “doesn’t need another private, rugby school”."},{"url":null,"title":"cork looks set to go to the wire in referendum on eight amendment","story":"  April 28, 2018Both sides in abortion referendum believe they have the edge.

Photograph: Cyril Byrne  The The Government is considering launching a statutory inquiry into the failure of the State’s national cervical cancer screening programme to inform women they were wrongly given the all-clear from the disease.Minister for Health Simon Harris is understood to be moving towards the option following an initial review of more than 200 cases, which is understood to have found a number of women were not told of the delay in their cancer diagnosis.A review team established by Mr Harris assessed each of the 206 cases over the weekend, examined the path of care afforded to each woman and potential failures in this regard.The Health Service Executive (HSE) said the review was not complete last night but the final results would be made known today. Women who were not previously informed will be contacted and offered another appointment, paid for by the State.The  understands the review team, chaired by the national director of quality assurance at the HSE, Patrick Lynch, found the majority of women were informed of the situation but several women were not.The magnitude of the problem came to light last week when a terminally ill mother of two, Vicky Phelan, settled a High Court case against a US-based laboratory subcontracted by CervicalCheck to assess the tests.Ms Phelan’s smear test in 2011 showed no abnormalities. In 2014, this was found to be incorrect but she was not informed until 2017.It has since emerged 206 women should have received earlier intervention than they actually did.Once the details of the HSE review are known today, it is expected the Government will move to launch a formal inquiry into the CervicalCheck programme.Senior Government figures said the terms of reference for such would be considered when the full picture was known today.However, it is expected to examine the level of knowledge within CervicalCheck, the HSE and potentially the Department of Health.It will also assess how CervicalCheck made its results known to inidual treatment sites and why it did not ensure this information was passed on to the patient.Mr Harris had initially proposed a review comprising international experts but it is understood senior Government figures believe this now warrants a formal investigation.It is unlikely to follow the form of a commission of investigation but the Health Information and Quality Authority (Hiqa) is expected to be asked to conduct a statutory inquiry.The Cabinet will also discuss this matter at its weekly meeting on Tuesday, and potential redress for the women affected is also to be considered.Tánaiste Simon Coveney and Mr Harris said they did not believe such cases should be contested in the courts and the women involved should receive the full support of the State.The advice of the Attorney General Séamus Woulfe will be required to assess if the State can prevent such legal cases from being taken.Meanwhile, political leaders have called for accountability in response to the controversy. The director general of CervicalCheck Dr Gráinne Flannelly resigned on Saturday after Mr Harris failed to declare confidence in her.Government figures are not ruling out further accountability measures but are insisting all of the facts must be established first.More than 2,000 people contacted the CervicalCheck helpline over the weekend and return calls to these iniduals will continue today.The Oireachtas committee on health will meet this week and consider bringing in the HSE, the Department of Health and CervicalCheck to answer questions on the matter.-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3478209.1525020075!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"michel barnier an energetic supporter of ireland in brexit woes","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Union negotiator Michel Barnier visiting to the EU subway station in Sofia: talks of the Belfast Agreement as a European agreement. Photograph: Dimitar DilkoffAFPGetty ImagesWhen Michel Barnier visits Derry on Wednesday as part of his tour of Ireland, the city will just have celebrated the launch of a new four-year project funded by the EU’s Peace IV programme.It is an apt reminder that the EU’s chief brexit negotiator has been here before. As commissioner for regional policy from 1999 to 2004, in the immediate aftermath of the signing of the Belfast Agreement, Barnier was responsible for the EU Peace programmes in Northern Ireland, crucial underpinnings of the agreement. He signed off on hundreds of millions of euro of EU support for both the Derry region and the North.Barnier has often spoken emotionally of how important that work was to him and how it informs his engagement with and commitment to Irish issues in the Brexit talks.He and his team also talk of the Belfast Agreement as a European agreement – safeguarding its provisions through the Brexit talks is as much about ensuring that the UK honours its undertakings to the EU as to the citizens of the North.He has been completely unambiguous in his warnings to the UK that agreement on a backstop Border provision is a precondition for the much broader Withdrawal Agreement and its provisions on transition. And soon.A sprightly and fit 67, Barnier, who has been described as austere, has been engaged in politics at national level and then Brussels for 40 years, and shows no sign of tiring. He is proud of his rural upbringing in the mountainous Savoie region and revels in hiking there. He was elected to represent it at 27, then the youngest politician in the National Assembly.He has served as EU commissioner twice – as regional commissioner, and from 2010 to 2014 as internal market commissioner – before being drafted in as a “safe pair of hands” by commission president Jean-Claude Juncker to head the task force on Brexit.He now aspires, it is reported, to succeed Juncker as president next year. If, that is, he can get the support of France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, although the latter is no supporter of the Gaullist tradition in French politics to which Barnier belongs.He might have more chance to get a nomination as the European People’s Party candidate from party colleague Leo Varadkar.His skill in leading the Brexit process has been in marshalling the many constituencies to which he reports , some almost daily, to maintain a remarkable unanimity over his evolving mandate. That need to communicate with so many parties has facilitated a mantra of “transparency” about the talks process – with so many in the loop, they might as well engage regularly and in detail with the press. (Except, it should be noted on the Irish strand).The task force is involved in a constant detailed dialogue with Irish diplomats, and reports on an almost weekly basis to the Brexit group of member states, and it to ambassadors.

Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy.

In practice, this means the infection is resistant to all commonly used antibiotics.The figures have emerged as Lord O\u0027Neill, the former Goldman Sachs banker who led a government-commissioned review into superbugs, accuses senior ministers of a lack of leadership on the issue. Lord O’Neill, former commercial secretary to the Treasury, said the Prime Minister, Theresa May, had allowed the issue to fade and that actions promised had not been taken.Lord O\u0026#39Neill has urged senior ministers to do more to tackle the threat of superbugs“It is disappointing to see that the UK government’s global and national efforts to fight AMR seem to have faded, he saidWriting exclusively for the  Lord O’Neill said that the UK was once seen as a leader in the field but that May had allowed the issue to slide.“The government should put this part of \u0027global Britain\u0027 back at the top of its priorities,” he writes. “There has been a lot of talk, but no action.Lord O’Neill’s review warned that if left unchecked antibiotic resistance would kill 10 million people and the world economy could lose up to $100 trillion by 2050.Antibiotic resistance | The true cost in Britain and around the worldOfficial figures suggest antimicrobial resistance claims the lives of 5,000 people a year in the UK, though experts have argued the real figure is at least double that. Getting global figures on the problem is difficult but reliable estimates suggest 700,000 are already dying each year – one person a minute.Lord O’Neill also attacked the major pharmaceutical companies for doing little to counter the problem, despite signing up to the Davos Declaration in 2015, where they pledged to combat the threat.He wrote: “Since then, no major pharmaceutical company has taken any fresh action.”Lord O’Neill said that since investigating the issue the number of reports of antibiotic resistance was rising faster and “in more places than we ever dreamt of.”.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}There has been a lot of talk, but no action.Lord O\u0026#x27NeillIn addition to the ‘super gonorrhoea’ case the PHE figures, obtained under a Freedom of Information request, show 29 people suffered from pan-drug-resistant-infections from Pseudomonas bacteria.Pseudomonas is a bug often found in soil or water (hospital sinks are tested for it) that usually affects people with a weaker immune system such as cancer patients, newborn babies, people with diabetes or patients with severe burns.Up to 11 per cent of Pseudomonas bacteria are now resistant to ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic commonly used in combination with others.A further six patients suffered pan-drug-resistant Klebsiella infections. New antibiotics to treat multi-drug-resistant Klebsiella infections were introduced last year in light of rising resistance, said Professor Peter Hawkey, a public health and bacteriology expert at the University of Birmingham. But they don’t work against every strain, he said.Antibiotic resistance | Global consumption fuels spread of superbugsProf Hawkey added that the cases show antimicrobial resistance is not a hypothetical or future threat but a real one currently affecting patients in British hospitals.These are organisms which are resistant to most antibiotics and then you’re in a tricky place, he said. The threat is very real. These figures are a wake up call,” he said.The pan-resistant infections recorded by PHE were from gram negative bacteria: rod-shaped bugs with thinner cell walls than their gram positive counterparts.Gram negative bacteria, some of which live in the human gut, are fast becoming resistant to antibiotics and are known as an emerging global threat. The government aims to halve the number of healthcare-associated gram-negative bloodstream infections by 2021.Prof Hawkey said pan-drug-resistant-infections are much more common in other areas of the world with lax surveillance and poor infection control, and these will spread to Britain.He said: With huge movement in populations people are coming back to the UK with these bugs in their guts. If you get it and you’re given the wrong antibiotic, you will die.Dr Susan Hopkins, deputy director for AMR and healthcare acquired infections at Public Health England, said: “While there is only a small number of bacteria identified that were resistant to a number of treatments in recent years, they serve as an example of the threat antibiotic resistance poses to public health.Madlen Davies is a reporter with the Bureau of Investigative JournalismProtect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding 2018: date, details and latest newsAmber Rudd resigns as Home Secretary as she admitsAmber Rudd: How the Home Secretary\u0026#39s rising star was brought back to earthSumo bows to pressure to reconsider ban on women entering ringImran Khan unveils populist plan as he launches Pakistan election campaignGiving vulnerable children a boarding school place can dramatically improve their future, Government study findsRestaurant ceiling falls in on customers leaving six people injuredFlat Earth conspiracy theorists gather to discuss \u0026#39proof\u0026#39 at first UK conventionUniversities are lowering grade requirements for disadvantaged youngsters amid ersity driveBP chief \u0026#39poisoned\u0026#39 in Russia plot, claims former colleagueSwedish crown princess Victoria \u0026#39groped\u0026#39 by French photographer at Nobel academyCapri could follow example of Venice as lagoon city installs barriers to manage mass tourismEmmanuel Macron turns to Iran to propose widening nuclear deal as Trump waversComment: After decades of strife, the French are finally falling out of love with strikesMillions of trees mapped by drone in Network Rail felling programmeLondon Marathon impostor revealed as homeless builder nicknamed \u0026#39Jogging Tramp\u0026#39Tiger mosquitoes capable of carrying Zika spread across half of France Power cut warning for Britain as south east and London brace for torrential rain, floods and galesFrench tycoon Vincent Bolloré blames Africa corruption charges on prejudiceWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"nature highlights national geographic travel photographer year","story":"A leaping leopard and a crowd of crocodiles are among the stunning photos released from the Nature section of the 2018 National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year contest.

bans filipinos going work kuwait maid found","story":"Rodrigo Duterte says that a ban on Filipino workers from heading to Kuwait that\u0026#39s been in effect since February will now be permanentPhilippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Sunday said the temporary ban on Filipinos going to work in Kuwait is now permanent, intensifying a diplomatic standoff over the treatment of migrant workers in the Gulf nation.Mr Duterte in February imposed a prohibition on workers heading to Kuwait following the murder of a Filipina maid whose body was found stuffed in a freezer in the Gulf state.The crisis deepened after Kuwaiti authorities last week ordered Manila\u0027s envoy to leave the country over videos of Philippine embassy staff helping workers in Kuwait flee allegedly abusive employers.The two nations had been negotiating a labour deal that Philippine officials said could result in the lifting of the ban but the recent escalation in tensions has put an agreement in doubt.The ban stays permanently. There will be no more recruitment for especially domestic helpers. No more, Mr Duterte told reporters in the southern city of Davao.There was no immediate response from Kuwait, where around 262,000 Filipinos are employed - nearly 60 percent of them as domestic workers, according to the Philippines\u0027 foreign department.Last week the Philippines apologised over the rescue videos but Kuwaiti officials announced they were expelling Manila\u0027s ambassador and recalling their own envoy from the Southeast Asian nation.In quotes | Rodrigo Duterte, President of the PhilippinesKuwait also detained four Filipinos hired by the Philippine embassy and issued arrest warrants against three diplomatic personnel, Manila said.Mr Duterte on Sunday described the treatment of workers in Kuwait as a calamity. He said he would bring home Filipina maids who suffered abuse as he appealed to workers who wanted to stay in the oil-rich state.I would like to address to their patriotism: come home. No matter how poor we are, we will survive. The economy is doing good and we are short of our workers, he said.About 10 million Filipinos work abroad, seeking high-paying jobs they are unable to find at home, and their remittances are a major pillar of the Philippine economy.The Philippine government has for decades hailed overseas workers as modern heroes but advocacy groups have highlighted the social cost of migration, tearing families apart and making Filipinos vulnerable to abuse.Mr Duterte lashed out at Kuwait in February, alleging Arab employers routinely rape Filipina workers, force them to work 21 hours a day and feed them scraps.However after the latest row, Mr Duterte used a conciliatory tone as he addressed the diplomatic ruckus on Saturday.Apparently it seems as if they have anger against Filipinos ... I do not want to send (workers) because apparently you do not like Filipinos, he said in a speech before Filipinos in Singapore.Just do not hurt them. I plead that they\u0027d be given a treatment deserving of a human being, he said in the same event.Please review our commenting policyAmber Rudd resigns as Home Secretary as she admitsAmber Rudd: How the Home Secretary\u0026#39s rising star was brought back to earthSumo bows to pressure to reconsider ban on women entering ringImran Khan unveils populist plan as he launches Pakistan election campaignGiving vulnerable children a boarding school place can dramatically improve their future, Government study findsRestaurant ceiling falls in on customers leaving six people injuredFlat Earth conspiracy theorists gather to discuss \u0026#39proof\u0026#39 at first UK conventionUniversities are lowering grade requirements for disadvantaged youngsters amid ersity driveBP chief \u0026#39poisoned\u0026#39 in Russia plot, claims former colleagueSwedish crown princess Victoria \u0026#39groped\u0026#39 by French photographer at Nobel academyCapri could follow example of Venice as lagoon city installs barriers to manage mass tourismEmmanuel Macron turns to Iran to propose widening nuclear deal as Trump waversComment: After decades of strife, the French are finally falling out of love with strikesMillions of trees mapped by drone in Network Rail felling programmeLondon Marathon impostor revealed as homeless builder nicknamed \u0026#39Jogging Tramp\u0026#39Tiger mosquitoes capable of carrying Zika spread across half of France Power cut warning for Britain as south east and London brace for torrential rain, floods and galesFrench tycoon Vincent Bolloré blames Africa corruption charges on prejudiceOn this day in 1429: Joan of Arc wins her first military victory as she outwits the English besiegers of OrléansWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/29/TELEMMGLPICT000161769325_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqvxY1SBh3Zy94n8Z2-u3DXpo3vSb9RvelYMC6seL5330.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"flat earth conspiracy theorists gather discuss proof first uk","story":"Organiser Gary John at the Convention The Ancient Greeks first argued the earth was round more than 2,000 years ago while Ferdinand Magellan proved it with the first successful circumnavigation in the 16th century. Yet 500 years on, a growing number of conspiracy theorists are convinced that every single mainstream scientist since then has got it wrong.

He is flanked by fellow ex-internationals Neil Back (left) and Will Greenwood (right)He said he might have to get the procedure done, and added: I guess it\u0027s something similar to a pug.The problem is that if I get it done, will people say I\u0027ve had it just because I\u0027m doing TV stuff now? Because it\u0027s definitely not.Tindall first broke his nose aged five when he collided in a dodgem car and headbutted the steering wheel.Earlier this year, The Queen has welcomed news that she is to become a great-grandmother again, as Zara and Mike Tindall confirmed they were expecting a baby.Mr and Mrs Tindall, who are already parents to three-year-old Mia, have announced they are expecting another child a year after enduring a miscarriage.The Queen, a spokesman said, said she was “very pleased” to hear the news, of that will be her seventh great-grandchild.She already has two great-grandsons, Prince George and Prince Louis, and four great-granddaughter: Princess Charlotte, Savannah and Isla Phillips and Mia Tindall.The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are expecting their third child in April, with the Tindall’s baby believed to be due in the summer.Confirmation of Mrs Tindall’s pregnancy was celebrated yesterday, just over a year after a spokesman announced the miscarriage of a child due in 2017.Their newest addition is likely to be born in the same Cotswolds NHS hospital as their first daughter Mia.Unlike the newest Royal baby, the new arrival will not be given a title with the parents keen for their children to have a normal upbringing.The children will be born into a family of true sporting pedigree with an Olympian as a mother and an international captain as a father. Zara Phillips won gold in the World Championships in the inidual eventing at the 2006 tournament in Aachen and gained a silver medal in the team eventing at London 2012. Her husband played 75 timed for England and notched up more than 350 games for Bath and Gloucester in a decorated career. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding 2018: date, details and latest newsAmber Rudd resigns as Home Secretary as she admitsAmber Rudd: How the Home Secretary\u0026#39s rising star was brought back to earthSumo bows to pressure to reconsider ban on women entering ringImran Khan unveils populist plan as he launches Pakistan election campaignGiving vulnerable children a boarding school place can dramatically improve their future, Government study findsRestaurant ceiling falls in on customers leaving six people injuredFlat Earth conspiracy theorists gather to discuss \u0026#39proof\u0026#39 at first UK conventionUniversities are lowering grade requirements for disadvantaged youngsters amid ersity driveBP chief \u0026#39poisoned\u0026#39 in Russia plot, claims former colleagueSwedish crown princess Victoria \u0026#39groped\u0026#39 by French photographer at Nobel academyCapri could follow example of Venice as lagoon city installs barriers to manage mass tourismEmmanuel Macron turns to Iran to propose widening nuclear deal as Trump waversComment: After decades of strife, the French are finally falling out of love with strikesMillions of trees mapped by drone in Network Rail felling programmeLondon Marathon impostor revealed as homeless builder nicknamed \u0026#39Jogging Tramp\u0026#39Tiger mosquitoes capable of carrying Zika spread across half of France Power cut warning for Britain as south east and London brace for torrential rain, floods and galesFrench tycoon Vincent Bolloré blames Africa corruption charges on prejudiceWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/30/TELEMMGLPICT000161884097_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqP11JIz1p9IOWu4bU6XcffKp16oywUUl9PdrW0k-RGMw.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"imran khan unveils populist plan launches pakistan election","story":"Imran Khan addresses supporters as he launches election campaign in Lahore, PakistanPakistani opposition figure Imran Khan on Sunday vowed to sweep to power in upcoming elections, promising radical change for the poor at a campaign kick-off rally in the city of Lahore that has long been the power base of ousted premier Nawaz Sharif.With the red-brick minarets of Lahore\u0027s Mughal-era Badshahi mosque in sight, Mr Khan outlined a populist 11-point plan to usher in a new era of prosperity that he envisages for Pakistan after the general election at which he hopes to become prime minister.Today we are at crossroads, said Mr Khan, a former cricketing hero and founder of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party.It is time to change our destiny and think big.He told a boisterous crowd of about 100,000 people that Pakistan was heading towards destruction but his plan would help forge a fairer society and steer Pakistan towards a path first envisaged by the nation\u0027s father, Muhammad Ali Jinnah.Supporters hope Imran Khan can sweep away decades of corruptionMr Khan said that if elected he would build schools and world class hospitals across the country, while farmers would get cheap loans. He also promised to build 5 million homes for the poor, which would create jobs and stimulate the economy.After spending much of his post-cricket political career on the fringes, Mr Khan has in recent years emerged as a key challenger to Mr Sharif, a three-time prime minister who was ousted by the Supreme Court last year but whose party retains power.Mr Sharif\u0027s legal woes, which the veteran leader says are politically motivated, could further boost Mr Khan in the run up to the elections as an anti-corruption court is due to soon deliver a verdict on another Sharif trial. Mr Khan has predicted Sharif will be jailed before the polls, likely in July.Mr Khan, who has sought to shed his playboy image of the past, is betting that his anti-corruption message, coupled with anti-America rhetoric and a projecting image of pious devotion, will propel him into power in the deeply conservative Muslim nation of 208 million people.In Lahore, his message resonated with many of the bandana-wearing young men waving PTI\u0027s green and red-colour flags.Imran Khan has given us the slogan of \u0027New Pakistan\u0027 and that\u0027s what we want, said Shahzad Khan, 17, in reference to the Naya Pakistan slogan used by PTI.The former cricketer has accused Mr Khan of being a puppet of the powerful military establishment that has a history of meddling in Pakistani politics. Mr Khan denies colluding with the army and the military denies interfering in modern-day politics.To dislodge Mr Sharif\u0027s Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party, Mr Khan\u0027s PTI will have to make inroads into Pakistan\u0027s biggest province, which is home to 110 million people and a well-oiled PML-N electoral machine built over several decades.Tens of thousands of supporters gathered in Lahore to head Imran Khan speak ahead of July\u0026#39s electionsMr Sharif was the chief minister of Punjab in the 1980s and his younger brother Shahbaz has ruled the province since 2008, entrenching PML-N\u0027s support across the wealthiest of Pakistan\u0027s four provinces.We feel they are weakening with every day, Mr Khan told foreign journalists ahead of the rally.He added that unlike in 2013, when PML-N swept to power, this time around many of the so-called electables - politicians who carry large rural vote banks due to their status as tribal elders, feudal lords and heads of various clans - will switch allegiances away from PML-N to PTI.The electables...weigh things up, they want to be on the winning side, he said.But at the Lahore rally, Mr Khan shunned talk of electables and focused on promising a new dawn for Pakistan\u0027s poor.This system cannot run unless we stand up with the downtrodden, he said. I am standing with you, it is time of make new Pakistan.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding 2018: date, details and latest newsAmber Rudd resigns as Home Secretary as she admitsAmber Rudd: How the Home Secretary\u0026#39s rising star was brought back to earthSumo bows to pressure to reconsider ban on women entering ringGiving vulnerable children a boarding school place can dramatically improve their future, Government study findsRestaurant ceiling falls in on customers leaving six people injuredFlat Earth conspiracy theorists gather to discuss \u0026#39proof\u0026#39 at first UK conventionUniversities are lowering grade requirements for disadvantaged youngsters amid ersity driveBP chief \u0026#39poisoned\u0026#39 in Russia plot, claims former colleagueSwedish crown princess Victoria \u0026#39groped\u0026#39 by French photographer at Nobel academyCapri could follow example of Venice as lagoon city installs barriers to manage mass tourismEmmanuel Macron turns to Iran to propose widening nuclear deal as Trump waversComment: After decades of strife, the French are finally falling out of love with strikesMillions of trees mapped by drone in Network Rail felling programmeLondon Marathon impostor revealed as homeless builder nicknamed \u0026#39Jogging Tramp\u0026#39Tiger mosquitoes capable of carrying Zika spread across half of France Power cut warning for Britain as south east and London brace for torrential rain, floods and galesFrench tycoon Vincent Bolloré blames Africa corruption charges on prejudiceOn this day in 1429: Joan of Arc wins her first military victory as she outwits the English besiegers of OrléansWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/11/26/TELEMMGLPICT000147682649_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"sumo bows pressure reconsider ban women entering ring","story":"The ancient sport of sumo wrestling is ready to think the unthinkable, and consider allowing women to enter the sacred wrestlers\u0026#39 \u0026#34doyho\u0026#34Stung by criticism that its rules are sexist and out of touch with modern society, the Japan Sumo Association has bowed to public pressure and will review its ban on women stepping onto the wrestlers’ sacred “dohyo”.The elders of a sport that can trace its roots back to ancient shrine rituals have announced plans to conduct a survey to determine public attitudes towards permitting women - who are considered “ritually unclean” - to enter the ring.The debate was triggered after an incident on April 4, when the mayor of the town of Maizuru, in Kyoto Prefecture, collapsed with a suspected heart attack as he gave a speech on the dohyo during a tournament.Onlookers - including at least two women, one of whom was a nurse - leapt on to the dohyo and began administering emergency first aid. As they performed cardiac massage, a JSA referee took a microphone and ordered the women to leave the ring.   The official’s comments have been roundly condemned, while a group of female mayors have also launched a campaign to permit them to deliver speeches at sumo tournaments in the same way as male mayors are able to.A photo grab from a Youtube video shows women climbing up a sumo ring to treat Maizuru city mayor Ryozo TatamiNaomi Koshi, mayor of the town of Otsu, has submitted a written request to the minister of culture and sport requesting that the ban be lifted.“Men and women are equal under the constitution”, she said. “It has become outdated that women cannot climb onto the dohyo and the rule should be reviewed”.The sumo association carried out a survey on the same issue in 2004, but was criticised at the time for only asking people who were attending tournaments.Sumo wrestling | Six things to knowThe debate comes at a difficult time for the sport. Its popularity has declined in recent years and it is currently gripped by scandal after two young wrestlers were physically abused.“It is a difficult situation and I can certainly see both side of the argument”, said Makoto Watanabe, an associate professor of communications and media at Hokkaido Bunkyo University.“Sumo has its roots in ine rituals so it cannot really be compared to other sports and that culture and heritage is an important part of its identity.“It is important that Japanese society has this conversation and it must be pointed out that the sumo association has already made it clear that women are permitted to enter the dohyo when it is a matter of life and death, but I am personally torn on the issue.“Sumo will lose a great deal if it starts to revise its traditions, but there needs to be common sense”.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding 2018: date, details and latest newsAmber Rudd resigns as Home Secretary as she admitsAmber Rudd: How the Home Secretary\u0026#39s rising star was brought back to earthImran Khan unveils populist plan as he launches Pakistan election campaignGiving vulnerable children a boarding school place can dramatically improve their future, Government study findsRestaurant ceiling falls in on customers leaving six people injuredFlat Earth conspiracy theorists gather to discuss \u0026#39proof\u0026#39 at first UK conventionUniversities are lowering grade requirements for disadvantaged youngsters amid ersity driveBP chief \u0026#39poisoned\u0026#39 in Russia plot, claims former colleagueSwedish crown princess Victoria \u0026#39groped\u0026#39 by French photographer at Nobel academyCapri could follow example of Venice as lagoon city installs barriers to manage mass tourismEmmanuel Macron turns to Iran to propose widening nuclear deal as Trump waversComment: After decades of strife, the French are finally falling out of love with strikesMillions of trees mapped by drone in Network Rail felling programmeLondon Marathon impostor revealed as homeless builder nicknamed \u0026#39Jogging Tramp\u0026#39Tiger mosquitoes capable of carrying Zika spread across half of France Power cut warning for Britain as south east and London brace for torrential rain, floods and galesFrench tycoon Vincent Bolloré blames Africa corruption charges on prejudiceOn this day in 1429: Joan of Arc wins her first military victory as she outwits the English besiegers of OrléansWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"http://www.independent.co.uk/s3/files/styles/readmore_card/public/thumbnails/image/2018/03/06/10/sainsburys-store.jpg","title":"sainsbury earnings underlying profits fullyear 2018 barclays argos","story":"Sainsbury\u0027s is set to report another dip in full year profits next week, with investors also expecting an update on cost saving measures and the progress of Argos.The supermarket is tipped to report a 6.2 per cent dip in full year pre-tax profits to £472m, according to analysts at UBS.On an underlying basis, consensus estimates point to a 1.5 per cent fall in profits to £572m, which would be the fourth consecutive year the metric has fallen.The investment bank believes that Argos sales were dragged down in the fourth quarter as it came under pressure from stock clearances at collapsed rivals Maplin and Toys R Us.“There have been some high profile general merchandise capacity exits through the first quarter of this year, such as Toys R Us and Maplin Electrics, which we expect to have had some impact on Argos sales as stock is liquidated, although this plays to Argos ultimately benefiting as an industry consolidator,” UBS said in a research note.Sainsbury\u0027s recalls beetroot that may contain shards of glassSainsbury\u0027s announces thousands of jobs at risk in management shake-upBrexit hands high street to Germany\u0027s Lidl as Sainsbury\u0027s put in shadeSainsbury\u0027s splashed out £1.4bn to take over Argos and Habitat owner Home Retail Group in 2016 and has been expanding its ranges and presence ever since.

We can expect an update on cost saving measures and the expansion of Argos into its stores.“The crowded marketplace with the rise of Lidl and Aldi makes for a very difficult environment for the group, which has been reflected in the share price performance for many years.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Possibly complicating matters was the fact that Denzel Washington was sitting next to him at the table.“When someone says you’re like your idol,” Jordan said, “It’s like: ‘Really? You see that in me?’ I’d only done that one movie. But then I started using it as motivation,” he said. “I wanted to pop up on Denzel’s radar. He’s the OG. If I could get recognition from him, I know I’m going down the right path, you know?”Denzel: We’re only getting further apart in this technological ageFinally, Washington broke in with a booming laugh: “And here we are, Mike! Looks like it’s working out already,” he said.In truth, it would be hard for an actor to choose a better role model than Washington. In a career ning more than 40 years and 50 films – and kicked off by the hit TV drama St Elsewhere – Washington, 63, has been nominated for nine Academy Awards. He won twice: for best actor as a terrifying rogue cop in Training Day and for best supporting actor as a Union soldier in an African-American army unit in Glory. And he was nominated for best actor Oscars in both of the past two years.Jordan (left, with Kevin Durand) in the 2013’s ‘Fruitvale Station’ (Weinstein Company)In the past decade, Washington has ruled the stage, too. He won a Tony Award for best actor in the revival of August Wilson’s Fences in 2010, later directing and starring in an Oscar-nominated film version. He led the acclaimed revival of A Raisin in the Sun in 2014. And today (26 April), he will open again on Broadway in a revival of Eugene O’Neill’s play The Iceman Cometh, a searing and (at four hours long) monumental drama about the lies we tell ourselves to get through life.Like Washington, Jordan, 31, got his big break on television: on HBO’s The Wire, when he was just 15. After his heartbreaking performance in Fruitvale Station, about the last day in the life of a transit-police shooting victim, he starred in the popular Rocky reboot Creed. And this year, he played the villain, Erik Killmonger, in the Marvel juggernaut Black Panther, winning perhaps the best reviews of anyone in the extremely well-reviewed cast.Next month, he stars in Fahrenheit 451 on HBO, a dystopian film based on the novel by Ray Bradbury. Jordan plays a “fireman,” part of a state-sanctioned brigade that hunts down readers and burns books. His company, Outlier Society Productions, is one of the film’s producers and also among the first to adopt inclusion riders, requiring ersity among cast and crew, as called for by Frances McDormand from the stage of this year’s Academy Awards.Over a cocktail hour at the Lambs Club in Manhattan (a Diet Coke for Washington, a sauvignon blanc for Jordan), the actors traded notes about creating characters and the socially minded work that really matters to them. These are excerpts from the conversation.Galanes: If Mike reminds people of a young Denzel, who did young Denzel remind people of?Washington: I never saw it that way. I never even thought about movie stars. My goal was to be on Broadway, to earn $650 a week. My hero was James Earl Jones. And I came to acting green. I was taking pre-law courses, then journalism courses. Then I took an acting class and got bit by the bug. So I came down to Lincoln Centre and saw plays and stage actors.Galanes: But all those things you did – law, journalism, acting – they’re all about getting to the bottom of a story, right?Washington: I like that part: building a character. You start with the material that gives you clues. If you’re playing a boxer, you want to throw out punches. If you’re playing a conductor, you want to get on a train.Galanes: And the script?Washington: Sure, but you don’t know who the character is just by reading the script. I don’t read a script and go, “Now, I get it!” That’s just the beginning. The first thread you pull.Jordan: The script tells you what’s going up on screen. But the biggest part, the fun part, is figuring out what happened to that character before page one of the script. What kind of food does he like? Did he get into fights going to school? That back story determines the choices you make within the confines of the script. And going through that process with the director is a big part of the collaboration. Now I’ve got notebooks and notebooks of back stories. Some directors may want you to add something or change your version. That’s when you try to find common ground.Washington won an Oscar for his role as rogue cop Alonzo in 2001’s ‘Training Day’ (Warner Bros)Galanes: Is that why you’ve both worked with directors repeatedly? Mike with Ryan Coogler Denzel with Spike Lee and Antoine Fuqua. Your common ground?Washington (laughing): Maybe they’re the ones who called. What you’re saying is part of it, but I don’t think it’s just one way.Jordan: Those are the roles I was lucky enough to get. Ryan and I have worked together three times, and I have a really close relationship with him. But I said no to lots of other things with other people in between. They weren’t right. Personally, I think you’re defined by what you say no to.Washington: I say yes to everything!Galanes: Why do I doubt that? Managing a career as big as yours must take a lot of work.Washington: Not now. Maybe early on. Now, I just do what I want to do. And you don’t want to walk down the same road twice. I’m sure after doing Iceman Cometh, I won’t be looking to do another play.Washington: Yeah, not for a while.Galanes: You’re too young to remember this, Mike. But early in his career, Denzel was so beloved for playing good guys – in Glory and Cry Freedom – that we all freaked out when he started playing villains: in Training Day, American Gangster. And he was even better at bad guys! Was that about walking down different roads?Playing Killmonger (right) in ‘Black Panther’ brought rave reviews for Jordan (MarvelDisney)Jordan: So much trickles down from the director. That’s why I try to choose the ones who make the best environments to work in, so we can maybe make something as good as Training Day. You don’t want to go into a project with somebody who won’t be helpful to your process – or vice versa.Galanes: I read this funny thing about you, Mike: you started choosing projects where you wouldn’t die in the end?Jordan: It started with my mom, who’s super emotional. When I shot my death scene in The Wire, she was on set. And the PAs kept coming to me and saying: ‘You may want to check on your mom.’ I go see her, and she’s sitting there bawling. I’m just a kid. I’m going, ‘Come on, Ma. You’re embarrassing me.’ And after Fruitvale Station, I was like, ‘Man, this is really affecting her.’ But there was another thing, too. Look at Denzel’s career. I want people to see me win. I want audiences to see me ending up on top – not dying. I want to be the leading man.Washington: Man, I got underwear older than that.Jordan: That was the real thought process: How do I become a leading man? I know phenomenal actors who can’t open movies overseas. How do you become the guy who can carry a film?Washington: So, you study the game?Galanes Is that why you went down the superhero route?Galanes You probably made up for it with Black Panther. Why no superheroes for you, Denzel?Galanes: Superheroes have changed. When Denzel might have played one, they were dull. The villains were interesting: Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger. Like you in Black Panther, Mike.Washington: When I was a teenager, Shaft and Super Fly, those were our superheroes. I remember watching Super Fly with my boy Carl, and when we got back to the projects, he carved the character’s name – Priest – on the elevator door. And Richard Roundtree in those long leather coats in Shaft.Galanes: Both of your new projects are dark. Iceman Cometh is brutal. And in Fahrenheit 451, competing ideas are so scary that people decide to burn all the books and kill the readers. Why choose them now?27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 Galanes: It’s powerful to watch a black man in your role.Jordan: But it wasn’t all there on the page. I needed to make sure that he was willing to collaborate, to change some things to help me, as a black man, feel more comfortable in that role. And my company’s co-producing it alongside HBO was important to me too. This is my first time working with the director and the network, giving my opinion and hoping that it’s taken seriously.Washington (laughing): Getting your big boy voice.Galanes Like coming back to the stage, Denzel?Washington: Yeah. Then we boiled it down to Iceman and King Lear. And he said: ‘Let’s do Lear five years from now.’ I said: “OK, we’ll do that next – God willing.”Washington: Eugene O’Neill. That simple. The chance to interpret his brilliant material. You know, my first role on stage, when I was a student at Fordham, was in The Emperor Jones. I’ve always loved O’Neill. And here I am, 40 years later, coming back to him in Iceman.Galanes: Your character, Hickey, seems like the life of the party at first, but what a tortured soul he turns out to be. What drew you to him?Washington: His desire to see people happy. Even when he knows he can’t make that happen, that desire is still there in him.Galanes: It’s a mountain of a play – four hours long. Is it hard to maintain that intensity every night?‘Fahrenheit 451’ sees Jordan plays a ‘fireman’, part of a state-sanctioned brigade that hunts down readers and burns books (HBO)Washington: Listen, this is what I love: acting on stage. And I don’t have to do anything else. Just be in this play. So, don’t feel sorry for me compared to most workers in America.Galanes: Is theatre on your radar, Mike?Jordan: Down the line. But right now, I want to take care of my family financially and grow my production company. That’s the big thing I want to do: set my family up.Jordan: As a kid, you don’t see your circumstances. I didn’t. It’s not until you look back and think, ‘Man, we were poor!’ My parents really hid that from me. They kept me safe.Washington: It wasn’t that tough. I was having a good time. A lot of my boys went to prison.Jordan: That’s why I want to take care of my family now. Then let me go and work on my craft, do something to fulfil me on the inside. That’s what I think theatre is going to be for me – when I’m older. What do you love about it, Denzel?Washington: The energy from the audience is immediate. And you get to develop a full life. See, in film, you might shoot the end first, then the middle. But on stage, it’s the full score of the character’s life. And you always get another night.Washington: In film, you don’t get another night to shoot a scene. You can try to fix it in other scenes. But film is a director’s medium. Theatre is for actors. We’re directed, but once the curtain goes up, it belongs to us. And every night’s as different as the audience. Some nights, they cheer the whole way through others, they don’t cheer at all.Galanes: Let me shift gears. We’re living through a time right now where men in power who’ve done ugly things –Washington: No. We’re not ‘living through a time right now’. It’s always been this way, from the beginning of time.

The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship“We are going after the money,” Boris Johnson promised after being questioned on the absence of specific measures to impose sanctions and financial penalties on the UK assets of Russian oligarchs closely aligned to President Putin. But when pressed by MPs on why decisive action was not being taken, the foreign secretary replied: “This is not a country where we in the government can say ‘Oi! We think this so-and-so deserves to have his or her collar felt’. This is not how it works.” While Theresa May may yet impose sanctions against Putin-supporting billionaires in response to the attempted murder of the Russian spy Sergei Skripal, her government’s track record has been marred by procrastination and prevarication.   Privately, the prime minister regards the exploitation of London as a haven for dirty Russian money as a serious problem. She once listened in stunned silence as a senior MI6 officer briefed her on the activities of Russian organised crime and certain oligarchs in the UK. And in 2016 she authorised the National Security Council to review why and how wealthy Russians buy property in London. But she has been nervous about taking action. For the past three years she has dithered on implementing a legally-enforceable register that will force all foreign companies that own UK property to disclose the identity of their owners.Russia claims Skripals poisoned using toxin possessed by UK and USRussia has been spying on the Skripals for at least five years- UKRussia stock market crashes after US imposes sanctions on oligarchsFreezing property assets is the key to inflicting pain on the Russian state and its compliant plutocrats. Since 2004, £190m of UK property has been subject to criminal investigation as suspected proceeds of corruption. The London property market has been skewed by laundered money, as The Independent revealed exclusively in 2014. Prices are being artificially driven up by wealthy, influential, foreign men who want to hide their assets in the UK.Multi-million pound payments are accepted without their origin being questioned. Oligarchs hide ownership behind anonymous shell companies registered in secretive jurisdictions while a London address offers a veneer of legitimacy and prestige that helps launder reputations as well as cash. Transparency International estimates that Russians account for £729m of the £4.4bn acquired in UK property via what it regards as “suspicious wealth”.There is no suggestion that all London property bought by Russian oligarchs is derived from illegal or criminal sources. For some Russian plutocrats buying luxury property in London is a symbol that they have been accepted by the British establishment. This is illustrated by the eleven bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square that Oleg Deripaska, regarded as one of Putin’s favourite oligarchs, snapped up for £17m through an offshore company registered in the British Virgin Islands in 2003 and now worth £45m.Oleg Deripaska’s 11-bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square is seen as a symbol of acceptance by the British establishment (Alamy)Built in the 1820s, it was formerly the home of Sir Henry “Chips” Channon, society host, Conservative MP and notoriously indiscreet diarist. It was designed for entertaining royalty and diplomats with its grand staircase, Madame Récamier sofas and flamboyant decor. When Harold Nicolson arrived at the house for dinner, he exclaimed: “Oh my God, how rich and powerful Lord Channon has become.” The equally grand and historic mansion Beechwood House, set in 11 acres of land in Highgate, north London, was bought by the powerful oligarch Alisher Usmanov in 2008 for £48m from the Emir of Qatar. Usmanov is a major shareholder in Arsenal football club and has amassed a £14bn fortune from metals and commodities and has long been regarded as a pro-Putin figure. And his fellow football-loving oligarch Roman Abramovich owns houses on Kensington Palace Gardens and Chester Square, Belgravia, and apartments on Eaton Square and Manresa Road, Chelsea.  One Hyde Park, one of the wealthiest residencies in the world, was famously bought up by Russian oligarchs (Alamy)It is not just prestigious houses that attract Russian billionaires. The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return for their cash, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship.  Since 2008 iniduals have been able to obtain “golden visas” if they invest as little as £2m in a UK business. And for £5m, they gain the right to become a UK resident on a temporary basis and then, after five years, a British citizen. By 2014, almost 700 rich Russians had paid for entry using this method, with Roman Rotenberg, son of Putin’s former judo partner Boris Rotenberg, being the most prominent example. He owns a mews house on Cadogan Lane in Belgravia.The government is taking some action to stop London becoming what David Cameron described as a haven to hide “dodgy foreign cash”. The National Crime Agency (NCA) is investigating a list of wealthy iniduals, not just oligarchs, to assess if they have used the UK to launder their fortunes.An estimated 149 iniduals are restricted on their travel and ability to conduct business in the UK. And the Unexplained Wealth Orders is now law, whereby the NCA can demand that the oligarch explain the origin of his wealth. But the problem with this order, according to a Russian businessman, is that the inidual in question could too easily lie about his source of wealth and instead produce a document that shows his fortune was based on, for example, share idends. Roman Rotenberg gained entry to the UK using the ‘golden visas’ method (Getty)Boris Johnson protests that the government cannot act directly against the pro-Putin brigade because it cannot interfere in criminal investigations. But it could make specific changes to the law, notably an amendment to the Sanctions and Money Laundering Bill, which would give Magnitsky-type powers to freeze the UK assets of relevant iniduals, including intelligence agents or other officials who have abused human rights.  The government could also implement the register of inidual owners of foreign and offshore companies that own UK property. But that bill has been delayed until 2021 and campaigners smell a cover-up after the government announced that one reason for the delay is that the Business Department has commissioned research on the impact of the register on investment decisions. “This is a crucial moment for the UK’s future trading relationship with the rest of the world, and we must proceed with as good an understanding as possible of the potential impacts on legitimate inward investment,” said foreign office minister Lord Ahmad. Skripal attack aftermath – in picturesSkripal attack aftermath – in picturesInvestigators in protective clothing remove a van from an address in Winterslow near Salisbury in Wiltshire, as police and members of the armed forces continue to investigate the suspected nerve agent attack on Russian double agent Sergei SkripaA police officer on duty near the protective tent which covers the bench where a man and woman were apparently poisoned with what was later identified as a nerve agent, in SalisburyMilitary in protective clothing prior to removing vehicles from a car park in SalisburyPersonnel in protective coveralls and breathing equipment cover an ambulance with a tarpaulin at the Salisbury District HospitalHome Secretary Amber Rudd visits the scene of the nerve agent attack in SalibsuryMembers of the emergency services in hazard suits fix the tent over the bench where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were foundOfficials in protective suits check their equipment before repositioning a forensics tent A poice officer stands guard outside a branch of the Italian chain restaurant ZizziDetective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who assisted the Russian ex-spy targeted with a nerve agent, was also hospitalisedSergei Skripal days before he was exposed to a mystery substance that has left him fighting for lifeSergei Skripal speaks to his lawyer from behind bars seen on a screen of a monitor outside a courtroom in Moscow.Yulia Skripal, who is thought to have been poisoned along with her father, Sergei SkripalProgress to legislation has thus been painfully slow. An insight into why political rhetoric has not resulted in legislative action can be gleaned by the recent flotation on the London stock exchange of the Russian energy company En+, then owned by Deripaska and chaired by former Conservative energy minister Lord Barker. For it revealed a fundamental dispute between MI6 and the financial regulators on how to make oligarchs who park their assets in London more accountable and transparent.MI6 and the prime minister’s national security advisor, Sir Mark Sedwill, were furious with the Stock Exchange and Financial Conduct Authority for failing to consult them and conduct the required due diligence of En+. Their main concern was about whether Rusal, a subsidiary of En+, had been manufacturing aluminium powder used by Russian arms firms for military purposes. Rusal adamantly denied it – yet its own website previously indicated that the defence industry was among the users of the type of aluminium powder it manufactured.Sir Mark Sedwill was furious when the required due diligence of En+ was not carried out ahead of its flotation on the London stock exchange (Getty)The En+ group could be a candidate for new sanctions as the Russian state-owned VTB Bank is a major shareholder with a 4.35 per cent holding, while Deripaska is known for being close to the Russian President. Leaked US diplomatic cables described Deripaska as “among the two to three oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis” and is “a more-or-less permanent fixture on Putin’s trips abroad”.Indeed, when the US imposed sanctions on seven oligarchs and the 12 companies they own or control last week, shares tumbled. Deripaska was among those affected, as was Rotenberg.  Still, Britiain cannot follow suit. And the anger of National Security officials and MI6 En+\u0027s flotation last year stemmed precisely from their belief that it typified the complacent approach to Russian money in London, which the infamous oligarch Boris Berezovsky once told me was “70 per cent dirty”. The inability to impose sanctions is similarly emblematic.The London Stock Exchange has long been a vehicle for Russian companies and oligarchs to raise money in shares and bonds – an estimated $200bn (£140bn) since 2004. Last summer, Russia’s largest gold producer Polyus, controlled by Suleyman Kerimov, a Russian senator awarded the Order of Merit by Putin, raised $879m. There are now 57 predominantly-Russian companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, more than anywhere else outside Moscow.   The wealthiest Russian oligarchs who call London homeA little-noticed loophole to avoid sanctions is that Russian sovereign debt is permitted to be sold in London. “We are allowing Russian sovereign debt to be sold in the UK and that debt is being used to reimburse Russians to bring back their money onshore in Moscow terms,” said the Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. “As that gold is moving towards Moscow, we are quite extraordinarily enabling those bond and debt auctions...This is one of those areas where sanctions on businesses are being compensated by the Russian state.”Just hours after Theresa May’s retaliation against the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, Gazprom issued a $750m eurobond in London and the following day the Russian government joined in by issuing a $4bn bond in the capital. Within hours, the Russian Embassy issued a revealing tweet: “Business as usual?”Could the nerve-agent attack in Salisbury be the unwitting catalyst for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London? (Getty)But the irony is that it is the attempted assassination of a Russian spy and double agent living in Salisbury and the murder of Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov in Surrey that could be the unwitting catalysts for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London.Mark Hollingsworth is the author of “Londongrad – From Russia with Cash’’ or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Ben Widdicombe visited the Marvel Comics creator at his home and heard him declare: ‘Nobody has more freedom’Stan Lee, the Marvel Comics maestro and co-creator of Spider-Man, X-Men and Black Panther, lives in a world of heroes and villains. But these days, it can be hard to tell which is which.Few creators have left as profound a mark on popular culture. According to The-Numbers, a box office data site, films featuring Lee’s superheroes have grossed more than $24bn (£17.2bn) worldwide. He has a huge Twitter following, and admirers have included Federico Fellini, Ronald Reagan and George RR Martin, the author of Game of Thrones.“Stan is right up there with Walt Disney as one of the great creators of not just one character, but a whole galaxy of characters that have become part of our lives,” Martin said. “Right now, I think he’s probably bigger than Disney.”Stan Lee\u0027s Avengers: Infinity War cameo might be his funniest yetYet at the summit of Lee’s career, storm clouds have gathered.The last year has brought an unsettling mix of tragedy and scandal, including the death in July of Joan Lee, his wife of almost 70 years suspicions that millions of dollars have been siphoned from his accounts even gossip reports that a former business associate stole his blood to sell to fans.Lee with his late wife Joan in 2011. Since she died last year the household has been thrown into disarray (Getty)Earlier this month, The Hollywood Reporter published an investigation that said Lee, 95, is the victim of “elder abuse”, partly at the hands of his 67-year-old daughter, Joan Celia Lee. The Daily Beast reported in March that Lee, who is said to be worth around $50m, was “surrounded by a panoply of Hollywood charlatans and mountebanks” and being “picked apart by vultures”.A radio talk show in Orlando, Florida, even aired a rumour that he is being “held captive” by handlers who “have him basically locked up in the house”.But on a recent visit to Lee’s home in the Bird Streets, a celebrity enclave high in the hills of West Hollywood, California, the man himself said otherwise.True, a 6ft 4in security guard, with a pistol on his hip, opened the front gate. And Lee hasn’t been getting out as much since a bout of pneumonia left him short of breath and looking frail. He also can no longer read because of macular degeneration.Lee pictured in New York in 1978: ‘Lately, I have found out that a lot of the money we made is no longer available for me’ (Getty)Despite all that, Lee seemed relaxed and enthusiastic. Wearing a yellow shirt and beige polyester slacks in his poolside sitting room, its Sherwood-green carpet bleached by 40 years of California sunshine, he welcomed a reporter into his home.So, is he a prisoner in his own house, surrounded by real-life supervillains?“I’m the luckiest guy in the world,” Lee said, chuckling and sounding like a 95-year-old teenager. “Nobody has more freedom.”He also defended his daughter, known as JC, against claims that she has been physically abusive and a financial drain. “My daughter has been a great help to me,” he said. “Life is pretty good.”A house in disarrayFor four decades, Lee has lived in a relatively modest two-storey house in the middle of what has become some of Los Angeles’ most valuable real estate. DrDre is a neighbour, and Leonardo DiCaprio lives down the block, on a street where houses can list for north of $30m.Inside the suburban-style home, a nurse and a maid bustled in the kitchen. Although Lee seemed at ease, the armed guard lent an air of surveillance that made it difficult to entirely relax.The house is a time capsule of late 1970s Hollywood. Decorated by his late wife, it is dotted with ceramic animals, carved figures in African and Asian styles, and large gilt-framed mirrors hung on mirrored walls. Empty hooks surrounded by dusty outlines sit amid prints and original works by noted artists – Joan Miro, Pablo Picasso, Alexander Calder, Salvador Dali and Roy Lichtenstein – suggesting a home being slowly eroded.“My wife, she’s the only person in the world that I would know of who would put a big mirror on top of a big mirror,” Lee said. “And when she was here, she had so many paintings, all over. Most of them have left now. My daughter took a lot of them, and a lot of them have gone elsewhere.”It’s the vagueness about what has “gone elsewhere” that has some of Lee’s friends so worried.Since Lee’s wife died last year, his household has been thrown into disarray, with three factions of once-trusted aides vying for control. Lee’s current gatekeeper is Keya Morgan, who has ousted former staff.Producer Keya Morgan and Joan C Lee – are they real-life supervillains holding Lee hostage? (Getty)A former memorabilia dealer from New York, Morgan moved to Los Angeles as the executive producer of the mobster biopic Gotti and now describes himself as a “producing partner of John Travolta”. Sitting at Lee’s side, he was dressed in a black suit and tie, black bowler hat and dark sunglasses, which he lowered on his nose to see indoors.In February, Morgan called police to the house to physically remove Lee’s longtime road manager, Mac Anderson, known as Max. Anderson was accused of, among other things, attempting to bribe a nurse to make statements that Lee was being held hostage. “He got into a big fight with Stan and Stan’s daughter” and was fired soon afterward, Morgan said.Reached by phone, Anderson declined to comment.Also out was Jerry Olivarez, a Hollywood publicist who briefly obtained power of attorney over Lee’s affairs last year, during which time more than $1m left the Marvel creator’s accounts. That included a $300,000 cheque made out to Hands of Respect, a novelty company owned by Olivarez and Lee that makes a $10 lapel pin advocating racial harmony.In unrelated matters, $1.4m may have vanished in a series of wire transfers, and a Chanel handbag full of cash may be missing from the house, according to Morgan. Also, a trove of Marvel memorabilia, including character sketches and figurines, is the subject of disputed ownership between Anderson and Lee, as reported by The Hollywood Reporter.Lee may be a creative genius, but he isn’t a financial one. “I’ve been very careless with money,” he said.“I had a partner or two who – since I’m not a money counter – I let them take care of keeping track of the money we made,” Lee said, as he sipped a bottle of mineral water to soothe his raspy voice. “Lately, I have found out that a lot of the money we made is no longer available for me. I don’t know where it is, but a guy, and maybe one or two others, have found a way to take it.“So, I feel bad about it, and of course we have a lawyer trying to get it back again,” he said. “But money isn’t worth losing your cool about, you know.”The child of Romanian Jewish immigrants, Stanley Lieber was born in New York City in 1922. He was hired in 1939 as an assistant at Timely Comics, the not-especially-promising ision of a pulp magazine publisher that would eventually be renamed Marvel.Following a staff exodus the next year, the newly rechristened Lee (an alias he adopted to save his real name for the great novels he aspired to write) was appointed its editor. The two great motifs of his life were established: a nagging feeling that his work in comics was cultural schlock and the fact that he would be a lifelong corporate employee, never owning the rights to his creations.His greatest streak of inspiration began in 1961, when Lee was almost 40 and thoroughly disenchanted with his career. With artist Jack Kirby, he created the Fantastic Four, a hit he bested the next year by inventing Spider-Man with artist Steve Ditko.Among the enduring characters he created over the next decade with those artists, and others, are the X-Men, Iron Man, the Hulk, Thor, Doctor Strange and, in 1966, Black Panther: an African warrior-king whose recent film adventure has grossed more than $1.3bn.“I’m sorry I didn’t introduce black characters a little sooner,” Lee said. “I tried to create an Asian superhero, I tried to create a South American superhero. And at that point I also was thinking it’s ridiculous that we don’t have a black superhero.”Asked if contemporary comics and films could be doing a better job of representing women and superheroes of colour, he replied, “yes”, but expanded: “You can’t force anything on the public. But if you do a black hero or heroine and you see that it’s well-received at the newsstand, then you’d be an idiot not to come up with more stories like that. Everything depends on the marketplace.”Evolution of Spider-Man: from the comics to Captain America: Civil WarEvolution of Spider-Man: from the comics to Captain America: Civil WarFirst introduction, art by Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko.First solo series, art by Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko.

While he has made exponentially more money than any of his Marvel co-creators, he only ever collected a salary, and does not receive any continuing royalties from the films based on his characters.In 2005, he received a one-time payment of $10m from Marvel, to settle a provision in his contract that had entitled him to 10 per cent of the profits from television and film adaptations. Four years later, Disney bought Marvel for $4bn it is unclear whether Lee was able to reap any benefit. (As Marvel’s chairman emeritus, he still receives a salary, reported to be $1m.)And while his personal appearances (including charging fans $120 for an autograph) are a lucrative source of income, later-life attempts to create wholly owned superhero properties have foundered.Stan Lee Media, a digital content startup, crashed in 2000 and landed his business partner, Peter F Paul, in prison for securities fraud. And Lee is embroiled in disputes with POW! Entertainment, the company he started in 2001 to create new shows, including Stripperella, a cartoon animation starring Pamela Anderson.POW! was sold last year to Camsing International, a Hong Kong-based company seeking to clone Marvel for the Asian market. Lee says he has not been paid, which the company denies. “Mr Lee has been paid and continues to be paid by the company,” said Shane Duffy, the chief executive of POW! “Statements like this only heighten our concern for Stan’s wellbeing.”Lee and actor Chadwick Boseman at the LA world premiere of ‘Black Panther’ in January (Getty)As part of the escalating fight, Morgan and Lee’s daughter entered the POW! offices on Santa Monica Boulevard on the night of 14 March and removed items they say belong to Lee. They triggered a silent alarm, prompting POW! to file a police report.The Beverly Hills police subsequently dropped the burglary investigation, but the fighting continues. “They’re acting as if they bought the company and everything on the four walls belong to them,” said Lee, sounding downcast. “So, another lawsuit.”An Oscar for Stan Lee?Outside the bubble of legal drama and personal strife, however, Lee’s creative influence remains at an all-time high.“There’s no doubt that Stan, in terms of American popular culture, he’s one of the giants of the 20th century,” Martin said. “Spider-Man and Iron Man the X-Men – they’re still as viable as ever.”From the floral sofa in his sitting room, Lee is a font of highly entertaining stories from the glory days, even if some of them sound taller than his 1962 creation Giant-Man.Like the time Picasso was so taken by Joan Lee’s beauty that he approached the couple in a New York restaurant and sketched her on their tablecloth. “We ran home to tell my father about what happened,” Lee said. But, “in our excitement, we had left the drawing in the restaurant. We never found it!”Stan Lee turns 94: His 25 best cameos in Marvel filmsStan Lee has already filmed cameos for four more Marvel moviesStan Lee has only good things to say about Tom Holland\u0027s Spider-ManOr the time when DiCaprio told Lee that he had written to the president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, lobbying for Lee to receive an honorary Oscar for his numerous cameos over the years. (Lee appears in nearly every Marvel movie, including Black Panther, in which he plays a gambler in a South Korean casino.)DiCaprio also wants to portray Lee in a film about the Marvel creator, according to Morgan, who accompanied Lee on a recent visit to DiCaprio’s house. (A spokesman for DiCaprio would not confirm this account of their conversation.)The thought of a biopic starring DiCaprio gave Lee pause. He looked out over the pool, to the canyon beyond, and pondered being portrayed by an Oscar-winning actor.“I don’t know if he could capture the essence of me,” he said, after a moment. “We have to talk about that.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Others were able to log in but, when they did, some or all of their account details had disappeared.Customers have also reported that they could access other people’s accounts, including account numbers, sort codes and transaction histories.TSB apology after customers complain of online banking ‘data breach’​TSB could not say how many people were still locked out of the service or when the problems would be fully resolved.The ongoing IT disaster began with botched upgrade work on Friday, but has developed into one of the worst technology failures to hit a UK retail bank and has left many of TSB’s 1.9 million customers furious.Some said they were falling behind with bill payments.Others said they were worried their money had simply disappeared.Many customers expressed frustration that the bank was not being clear about what had happened.That came after Paul Pester, CEO of TSB, tweeted on Wednesday morning: “Our mobile banking app and online banking are now up and running. Thank you for your patience and for bearing with us.”Our mobile banking app and online banking are now up and running. Thank you for your patience and for bearing with us.MPs demanded answers from TSB on Tuesday. Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury Committee, said: “The reports of unauthorised transactions, access to other customers’ accounts and failures of in-branch services have all the hallmarks of an IT meltdown.“This is yet another addition to the litany of failures of banking IT systems. Potentially, millions of customers could be affected by uncertainty and disruption.“It simply isn’t good enough to expose customers to IT failures, including delays in paying bills and an inability to access their own money.”A spokesperson for the Financial Conduct Authority said on Tuesday that the watchdog was “aware of the issue and liaising with the firm”. A spokesperson for the Information Commissioner’s Office said: “We are aware of a potential data breach in relation to the TSB and are making enquiries.”Mr Pester said on Tuesday that he was “truly sorry” about the problems caused. “We’re still seeing issues with access to our digital services,” he added. “One of the steps we need to take to resolve this is to take our mobile app and online banking down for a few hours.“We did this at around 10.30 this morning and we hope to be back up later this afternoon.”The problems stemmed from a switch to a new online banking system. TSB had rented the technology behind its app and online banking from Lloyds Banking Group since the two companies split. Over the weekend, TSB moved customers to a new platform which experienced some teething problems.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It’s time for Rudd to go.”UK residents threatened with deportation on charter flight to JamaicaI doubt Windrush-style outrage would apply to British MuslimsTory MP Sajid Javid speaks out over Windrush: ‘It could have been me’We need new laws so that Windrush never happens againRudd sparks Brexit row and makes Windrush U-turn on same dayThe senior Conservative had already been in trouble over the Windrush scandal when she told the Home Affairs Committee last Wednesday that the Home Office did not use targets for the number of illegal immigrants who should be deported.But the following day, she returned to the House of Commons and admitted in an embarrassing U-turn that immigration officers did indeed use “local targets”, though she said they were “not published targets against which performance was assessed” and – critically – she claimed not to have been aware of them.Her account was thrown into doubt with the leak of a Home Office memo referring to a target of 2,800 enforced returns for 201718 and progress made towards a “10 per cent increased performance on enforced returns, which we promised the home secretary earlier this year”.Amber Rudd denys Home Office have set deportation targetsIn a desperate attempt to rescue the situation Ms Rudd issued a series of late night tweets, claiming she had not seen the memo though it was copied to her office, but admitted that she should have been aware of the targets.As she moved into a political damage limitation exercise, she promised to again come to the Commons on Monday to answer MPs’ “legitimate questions” about what had been taking place.Amber Rudd resigned because she didn’t know what was going on in her own departmentHer position was further weakened over the weekend when former immigration minister Brandon Lewis – now the Conservative Party chairman – disclosed they had held weekly meetings to discuss her plans to increase removals, although he insisted they did not discuss detailed targets or numbers.Then came a further leak on Sunday – a letter Ms Rudd herself had sent to Ms May, in which she set out how she would allocate more resources to immigration enforcement teams to boost deportation rates by 10 per cent. She said the target was “ambitious but deliverable”.Windrush generation: threat of deportation from UKWindrush generation: threat of deportation from UKThe ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 arriving at Tilbury Docks from Jamaica, with 482 Jamaicans on board, emigrating to Britain.Jamaican immigrants being welcomed by RAF officials from the Colonial Office after the ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 landed them at Tilbury.

But the decision set off a nightmare that saw him lose his job, detained twice and almost deported to Jamaica. Jamaica-born Anthony Bryan poses outside his home in Edmonton, north London. Now 60 and a grandfather, Bryan thought the issue could be resolved swiftly, as he legally moved to Britain with his family as part of the Windrush generation of Caribbean migrants after World War II. In 1948, the ship Windrush brought the first group of migrants from the West Indies to help rebuild post-war Britain, and many others followed from around the Commonwealth. A 1971 law gave them indefinite leave to remain, but many never formalised their status, often because they were children who came over on their parents\u0027 passports and then never applied for their own.

She is very honest and principled person.” Ms Rudd, alongside chancellor Philip Hammond, had been one of the most prominent members of the Cabinet backing a softer Brexit that entails close relations with the EU after Britain’s withdrawal.But with her now vacating a great office of state, Ms May must decide whether to replace her with another ‘remain-minded’ inidual.Environment secretary Michael Gove, a leading Brexiteer, and communities secretary Sajid Javid, a close ally of George Osborne, have both been talked of as potential replacements.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It has also helped draw attention to a number of other virtual currencies looming in its shadow, most notably ethereum.Ethereum was created in 2013 by a 19-year-old Russian programmer and launched in 2015. For the first two years its price remained below $10. Then, in 2017, it exploded. In the space of 12 months, one unit of the cyptocurrency – called an ether – surged in value to be worth around $1,400 at its peak in January 2018.While its price has since fallen back down to around $700, many still see it as the most promising of all cryptocurrency platforms, and therefore the one that holds the most potential for future price gains. Some even believe it could one day surpass bitcoin.“Ethereum has the possibility to overtake the market capitalisation, and thus value, of bitcoin,”  Hubert Olszewski, director of business development at Blockchain Board of Derivatives, tells The Independent. “This is because from the get-go it was a more versatile tool.” A smartphone displaying the current price chart for ethereum on April 25, 2018 in London, England. Cryptocurrency markets began to recover this month following a massive crash during the first quarter of 2018, seeing more than $550 billion wiped from the total market capitalisation. (Getty Images)When bitcoin became the world’s first decentralised digital currency upon its release in 2009, the world was reeling from the worst financial crisis in decades. So-called crypto-anarchists and others who were disillusioned by the recession hailed bitcoin for its ability to facilitate payments without the need for a bank. Essentially, they thought, it held the potential to revolutionise the global financial system.Since bitcoin’s inception, more than 1,500 other cryptocurrencies have appeared in its wake. Each one has attempted to offer something that bitcoin can’t, with the argument being that bitcoin’s core technology contains a number a fundamental flaws that are being exposed as its network grows. Here’s why bitcoin might be on the verge of another price explosionSome, like litecoin and bitcoin cash, have improved transaction times and lowered transaction costs. Ethereum’s aim, by contrast, is far more ambitious than simply improving upon bitcoin’s credentials as a payment system and store of value.“Bitcoin is a virtual currency, but also a store of value similar to gold. It’s limited to this function by its own design,” says Alessandra Sollberger, an early investor in bitcoin who has since ersified her cryptocurrency portfolio to include ethereum.“That’s different with ethereum. Beyond being a virtual currency, it’s been designed as a software platform that enables applications such as smart contracts – which are self-executing, secure contracts – to be built and to run without the need of a third party.”Bitcoin: Is the virtual currency the new gold standard?Bitcoin: Is the virtual currency the new gold standard?Bitcoin exists without a central bank able to manipulate its valueEthereum is therefore designed to not just decentralise traditional banks – as bitcoin sets out to do – but decentralise the entire internet. It does this by expanding upon bitcoin’s core technology called the blockchain, which is the online public ledger that permanently records the transactions made across the network.Using ethereum’s more versatile and advanced blockchain technology, anyone is able to create their own decentralised applications.“This opens up a vast potential of business use-case particularly as we move towards a much more connected and autonomous future,” says Erhan Korhaliller, founder of the blockchain specialist PR agency EAK Digital. “Ethereum has the potential to proliferate to all levels of business interaction.”By completely cutting out third parties, ethereum could one day transform the way we transfer everything, from online data to the property deeds of a house. In doing so, it has earned the nickname “World Computer”.“The ethereum platform has the potential to facilitate major innovation in applications, helping to usher a future in which self-driving cars, for example, can accept crypto in order to become self-sustainable,” says Gaurang Torvekar,co-founder and CEO of Indorse, a professional network powered by ethereum.“In the years ahead, there might even be a way in which we can use our smartphones for research that can cure cancer, and in turn get paid for it. With a growing number of companies across the globe working on groundbreaking applications using the ethereum blockchain, the future of innovation is bright, with endless possibilities on the horizon.”The Independent\u0027s bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

But you can\u0027t leave the cost base with the old high street and expect it to survive with a new entrant, the internet.It\u0027s not fair to leave the high street to pick up the rates bill when they are only picking up 75 per cent of the trade that used to be there, due to what has gone online. We say to the Government, let the consumer be king but reduce the rates bill for those left in bricks and mortar on the high street.There should also be an equivalent version of business rates for warehousing, particularly if that warehousing is used for retail fulfilment.The last rates increase in April has been the last straw for a lot of struggling retailers, because of the massive increases. The Government says it has put rates relief measures in place to help those struggling, but it has not.It has exempted shops below \u0026pound12,000 rateable value when it used to be \u0026pound6,000, but there aren\u0027t many of our members with rateable value shops of \u0026pound12,000.Those are really tiny shops - the average independent is trading with a rateable value of about \u0026pound24,000. STOCKYorkshire and the Humber, and Greater London, have suffered the greatest decline in 2017He also highlighted the minimum wage and pensions auto-enrolment.While the Government prefers everyone to earn a certain amount, they have asked employers to pick up a bigger wage bill, he said. They have also made them pick up the cost of autoenrolment into pension schemes. The trade association, which represents 150,000 independent UK retailers, has submitted a proposal to the Government with simple measures to help its members. A cut in business rates is top of the list.Mr Hawkins said: If we had a \u0026pound12,000 allowance rather than a \u0026pound12,000 cliff edge, these shops on \u0026pound24,000 would see their rates halved. And if they were tighter on charitable relief and harder on internet warehouses there would be ways of making it revenue neutral.He said the three Ps - parking, property taxes and planning permission - were vitally important. He said: Parking is number one because it is perceived to be free out of town, even though it\u0027s often not.Newsagents, women\u0027s clothes shops and estate agents struggled the mostProperty taxes, being rates and rents, have also hit the high street.And finally planning permission, because it is too tempting for local planners to say \u0027yes, we\u0027ll allow a major development because it creates 10,000 jobs\u0027, without realising they are losing 11,000 jobs in the high street.A spokesman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: This Government is determined to see our high streets thriving - now, and in the future. With our Future High Streets Forum, we are working with retail leaders and industry experts to develop new solutions to the challenges we are facing.If you are a shopkeeper or shopper with concerns about the high street, write to Jon Coates, Sunday Express, Northern \u0026amp Shell Building, 10 Lower Thames Street, London EC3R 6EN or email jon.coates@express                            "},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/590x/Brexit-news-vote-latest-UK-EU-referendum-Lords-BBC-952761.jpg","title":"Brexit news latest UK EU Theresa May customs union House of Lords referendum vote","story":"The Green Party\u0027s Caroline Lucas claimed it would be \u0026ldquodemocratic for Britain to have a vote on the final Brexit deal.Speaking on BBC\u0026rsquos Andrew Marr Show, Ms Lucas said the House of Lords, which has a Remain majority, is right to debate the Brexit process following a series of votes by Peers against the Government.Ms Lucas said: \u0026ldquoI think Peers are trying to ensure that MPs would have the opportunity to amend that deal, or at least to tell them to go back and renegotiate it or get it better.\u0026ldquoIn my view, what they should be doing at that point is going to the country to have a people\u0026rsquos vote on that final deal because I think it ought to go back to the people.BBCBrexit news: Caroline Lucas claimed another Brexit vote would be democratic\u0026ldquoThey started this process and now they\u0026rsquove seen all the information they may well have different views about it about and it would be democratic for them to go back and have a look at it.Mr Pierce hit back and said: \u0026ldquoSo speaks the voice of someone who hasn\u0026rsquot accepted the referendum result, of which there are a lot of people in Westminster.The politician claimed she was referring to the final Brexit deal.

They have provided support and provided a home for a child in need.It is therefore right that Government supports them in doing so.

Because expectations are so low for the Tories, they are almost bound to surpass them.Mrs May’s own position is also stronger than it was in January thanks to her handling of the Salisbury attack.At the start of the local election campaign, the talk was of how the Tories were facing a wipe-out in London, how they would do well to end up holding on to even one council.But senior figures involved in the campaign now admit they should do much better than that.Conservative Campaign Headquarters’ biggest worry in London is simply being outgunned on the day.They fear Labour’s return to being a mass membership party under Jeremy Corbyn will enable them to get nearly all their voters out, while the Tories will struggle to get more than 40 per cent of their supporters to the polls.There is, though, still cautious optimism that the Tories will hold at least one of their two flagship London boroughs, Wandsworth and Westminster.Then they could claim the results were respectable for a government in mid-term.This is especially true as results outside London are expected to be quite good for the party.One former Cabinet minister loyal to Theresa May tells me: “Things outside London really aren’t bad.”The Tories are particularly hopeful of making gains in the West Midlands.It will be tempting for the Tories to declare the local elections are further proof the capital and the rest of country are diverging politically, and so their decline in London doesn’t matter much as it will be made up for elsewhere.But this would be a catastrophic mistake.Labour’s rise in London is quite remarkable.They have gone from 37 per cent of the vote in 2010 to 55 per cent in 2017.There are several reasons why the capital is turning red but one of the biggest is the decline in home ownership.Home ownership in London peaked in the 1990s and has been falling since.Homeowners became a minority in London in 2011, the first time that has been the case since Margaret Thatcher’s Right To Buy revolution in the early 1980s.On current trends, 60 per cent of Londoners will be renters in seven years’ time.It is no coincidence that this rise in renting has coincided with Labour’s surge in the capital.For one of the things that makes you most likely to vote Tory is owning your own home.Labour’s surprise success at the last election was largely down to a big increase in turnout among renters who swung heavily to Labour.Labour London offers a preview of what happens to the Tories when homeowners become a minority.If the Tories want to win elections they need to get more homes built — and fast.CABINET Brexiteers are getting increasingly frustrated.They feel that key decisions are not being taken in Cabinet, or even the Cabinet Committee tasked with managing the negotiation, but elsewhere.One senior Brexiteer complains to me that Olly Robbins, the Prime Minister’s chief Europe adviser, is, “Running around telling everyone we have to back down on pretty much everything”.This grumpiness has been exacerbated by this week’s meeting of the Brexit inner Cabinet not discussing the big issue of the moment, customs.One member of it tells me: “When people left, they all felt a greater level of frustration.”There is a sense No10 is not respecting the political process.This all ups the ante ahead of the Brexit inner Cabinet’s meeting next week.This will discuss Theresa May’s plan for a hybrid customs model which would see the UK leave the customs union but collect tariffs on the EU’s behalf.Brexiteer ministers regard this as complicated and as having no chance of being accepted by Brussels. They think persisting with it just wastes valuable time.One tells me Mrs May has been told this hybrid plan is unworkable on eight occasions but doesn’t show any signs of abandoning the idea.Part of the problem is that Mrs May remains deeply worried about whether she has the votes in the Commons to leave the customs union.No10 is extremely concerned about the customs union amendment to the trade bill, which is expected to come to a vote in June.Its hope is the hybrid model is close enough to a customs union to see off a rebellion on this issue but if the model is unworkable, as pretty much everyone thinks, it doesn’t solve anything.Mrs May would be better off making the argument that Brexit won’t mean Brexit if Britain doesn’t regain the ability to run its own trade policy and that she couldn’t continue as Prime Minister in these circumstances.CHRIS GRAYLING wants to make it a criminal offence to cheat on auto emissions tests.This law change, which will be part of Grayling’s road to zero plan to cut exhaust emissions and improve air quality, will enable the Government to prosecute car manufacturers who try to diddle the system.The law won’t apply retrospectively.But the Department for Transport hope it will help prevent a repeat of the Volkswagen scandal.OUR political class needs to remember we are NOT Americans.The question about Donald Trump isn’t whether we would have voted for him or if we think he is the right person to be President of the United States.But how we should deal with the country he leads – which is our most important security ally.No country expelled more Russian diplomats following the Salisbury attack than the United States.Mrs May should make clear that she is delighted, not embarrassed, to welcome Donald Trump to Britain on his “working visit”.Why, because a strong relationship with the United States is in this country’s national interest.French President Emmanuel Macron, on his state visit to Washington this week, didn’t hold back in either cosying up to the president, quite literally at times, or in making clear where he disagreed with him.This is a far more sensible approach than acting all embarrassed about observing the necessary diplomatic niceties.Without Trump, yesterday’s moment of history would not have happened. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It aims to force a binding Parliamentary vote on the draft deal while talks are still ongoing.Crucially, if the deal is rejected, MPs and peers would then have power to instruct ministers what action to take – even if it means stopping Brexit.Last night, angry Brexiteers accused peers of sneaky and dishonest tactics to frustrate our departure from the EU.Brexit Minister Lord Callanan said: “Labour’s flawed amendment seeks to tie our hands by inserting false deadlines and shifting the power to negotiate from government to Parliament.“It asks for meaningless votes on the deal before the deal is done. Those who want to overturn the referendum call this the ‘no Brexit’ amendment.“The Conservatives are taking the scrutinising role of Parliament seriously, to improve an essential piece of legislation. Labour are using it to frustrate Brexit.”Tomorrow’s vote will present a fresh headache for Theresa May who is facing a showdown with her Cabinet over her plans for a post-Brexit customs deal.Minsters have told the PM her offer to collect EU import tariffs on behalf of Brussels is unworkable.1.

She was reported to be building a war chest in the event of the PM being ousted. For Ms Rudd this humiliation is a nightmare.But the simple truth is that she has been toppled because she was simply not up to the job.Misleading parliament over routine targets for deporting illegal immigrants is the least of it.Ms Rudd was already marked with the Black Spot.Her real blunders were the failure to act far quicker on both the Windrush victims and the knife massacre in London.The Home Office is the infamous “political graveyard” which chews ministers up and spits them out.Theresa May is the rarity who not only survived but used it as a springboard.Now the famously cautious PM needs to carry out emergency repairs with flair and imagination. She needs a new Home Secretary today.The right man for the job is Environment supremo Michael Gove.He has rebuilt his reputation, almost destroyed by his assassination of leadership rival Boris Johnson.He is the most articulate heavyweight minister in Cabinet and has proved that he can handle big responsibilities with both flair and courage.But Amber Rudd’s department has smashed the delicate Cabinet balance between Brexiteers and Remainers.It exposes deep divisions within Tory ranks over the roubled negotiations currently under way with Brussels.A handful of Remainers are threatening to defy the government in a critical vote over remaining in the EU customs union.Meanwhile Brexiteers who have remained silent are plotting a leadership coup if Mrs May gives in.The departure of Ms Rudd could explode all of this into open warfare.Will Mrs May risk putting potential rival Michael Gove in one of the really Great Offices of State?Jezza’s empty promise to crack down on anti-Semitism followed Commons applause for tearful Labour MPs as they read out vicious Jew-phobic abuse from JC4PM supporters.The answer to Mrs Merton is that Labour, with a 22 per cent poll lead, expects big things in London on Thursday, perhaps including scalps in Tory crown jewel boroughs Westminster and Wandsworth.JC doesn’t want a row over Jew-baiting to spoil a good night for Labour.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

My ministers have made over 30 appearances to answer questions and debate the issues. And we will be giving Parliament a vote on the final deal when we have concluded our negotiations with the EU.When all is said and done, I’m a Parliamentarian before a Minister, and a democrat before a Conservative.But there is a clear distinction between the important work of revising legislation and attempting to overturn the referendum result to keep the UK inside the European Union, in direct opposition to the British people.The amendment Labour have proposed today in the House of Lords is at risk of doing just that.There are three crucial reasons why the Government could never accept it.Firstly, the amendment tries to secure a vote for Parliament before the negotiations have concluded. This is, quite frankly, nonsensical — because nothing in this negotiation is agreed until everything is agreed.Second, it demands specific votes by artificial deadlines which, if not met, would give Parliament the power to micromanage the Government on how to carry out these negotiations.This would give the EU Commission a clear incentive to delay the negotiations or present unacceptable propositions until the deadline has passed and the Government is stripped of its ability to negotiate freely.This fundamental change to the balance of our constitution would be both unprecedented and unworkable.And in our negotiations with the EU to date, the progress we have made has in part been down to the flexibility that both sides have shown.Imagine if every quick decision, proposal or response the Prime Minister and I have to take instead had to be timetabled, debated and voted on by over a thousand MPs and peers?Finally, the amendment proposes giving Parliament the power to direct the Government on anything relating to the negotiations – including extending the negotiation process and keeping the UK in the EU indefinitely.Sure, the peers proposing it may claim it is about keeping power in Parliament or ensuring their votes are ‘meaningful’.But those who want to overturn the result of the Referendum have been calling for a ‘no Brexit option’ for months, and this amendment would grant it to them.This is not what the British people want, and it is not something that we can accept. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There were times when I thought I wouldn’t get through it.I was exhausted, fearing I would end up in jail – all for doing the right thing by the person I loved most in the world, so that she did not have to die an undignified and agonising death.”Helen was diagnosed with a lung disorder in 2004 called alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency that forced her to leave her job as a college lecturer.In 2015 she made the decision to contact Dignitas and carried out all the research and payments herself.James, who was in a relationship with Helen for 33 years, said she was in a helpless situation and was in pain and suffering every day.He added: She said, ‘I’m not frightened of dying, but I am frightened about the way I die’.She had my support at every stage but said if I was uncomfortable with going she would consider going alone.We knew there could be a legal issue but there was no way I was ever going to let [her] be waved off at the door.”When the couple boarded the train to Switzerland, Helens lung capacity was at 15 per cent and she had oxygen tanks and nebulisers keeping her alive.After spending their final hours together in a hotel, the pair made their way to the clinic in Zurich where Helen was giving life ending drugs to help her pass away incredibly peacefully.But in a devastating twist of fate, the couples home in West Bromwich in the West Midlands was ransacked by thieves while Helen was ending her life in November 2016.The callous raiders stole Helen’s computer containing cherished photos and wrapped the stolen items in “the last bed sheet she slept in”.Neighbours raised the alarm and told police the couple had gone to Switzerland for Helen so she could end her life.James was then quizzed by cops within hours of arriving back in the UK without his long-term partner.He said: “Initially they were fine... The detectives said I had nothing to worry about. I told them I had a letter written by Helen outlining her decision and we had copies of all of her medical notes and letters between her GP and consultant. They just said they would be in touch.”But two months later, he was interviewed under caution and was investigated for six months until the charges were dropped in June 2017 after cops got hold of Helens medical records.James is now campaigning alongside charity Dignity in Dying to overturn the UK’s ban on assisted dying and has been in contact with Julie Smith, 48, whose husband Paul died in September 2016.The 57-year-old had been diagnosed with cancer but died in agony as his GP said he could not provide medical records for him to send to Dignitas on “ethical and legal grounds”.The disease, also known as AATD or A1AD, is a rare inherited condition that can cause liver and lung problems.Around 25,000 people in the UK have the genetic condition though most remain healthy so few have been diagnosed.Sufferers are much more vulnerable to the effects of inhaling smoke or other toxic materials like dust, fumes or chemicals.The condition increases the risk of lung disease including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It costs around £10,000 for a person to go to Dignitas to end their life with the sentence for assisting a suicide up to 14 years in jail.A West Midlands Police spokesman said: “The investigation was delayed because, despite West Midlands police requests for medical records, they were not made [available] until June last year.“That month, it was decided that it did not meet the evidential threshold for prosecution and the investigation was discontinued.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict000277727470.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"baby boomers struggling pay rent maybe even more than young people","story":"Most of the baby boomer generation own homes but 1.13million rent from private landlords.The findings show that half a million baby boomers who rent privately may have had to take drastic decisions in the past year to cover their rent.A fifth of those battling to afford bills also cut down on food or heating, and one in ten have used credit.Of those who need vital changes made to their homes, such as adding handrails, stair lifts, ramps or wider doorways for wheelchairs, around two-fifths (42 per cent) have fallen over in their own home and a similar proportion at 43 per cent leave home less often then they want to.Nearly three-fifths (59 per cent) have needed these changes for over a year, the survey found.David Orr, chief executive of the National Housing Federation,  said: We often hear that young people bear the brunt of the housing crisis but todays report reveals a shocking number of hidden baby boomers who are struggling just as much if not more.There is a huge amount of inequality amongst this age group and unfortunately the wealthier majority have hidden the reality of hundreds of thousands of people who have never been able to afford a house. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But because of what youve been through together, your love for one another will be strengthened.Little Alfie, aged 23-months, passed away in the arms of his mum and dad in the early hours of Saturday after surviving almost five days without life support.For Charlies parents Chris and Connie seeing the pain on the faces of Tom and Kate as they went through a similar experience of legal battles and bedside vigils, the couple decided to speak out.Earlier this week Chris and Connie backed calls from Alfies parents for a change to the law to give families more power over hospital care.They have now launched the campaign Charlies Law and on Sunday put out a call to action for people to write to their MP asking for support.Chris and Connie, from Bedfont, Middlesex, have also set up a foundation in their sons memory called Charlie Gard Foundation dedicated to fighting mitochondrial disease by raising awareness and funding research of the illness.In their interview, Connie said: We feel the pain of Alfies parents. Chris and I know how devastated and empty they will be feeling as their desperate fight to save Alfie has ended.Seeing them go through the agonies we have done has been incredibly hard.Their case has come so soon after ours and seeing them stood outside the same courts, pain etched on their faces, has been heartbreaking.It has resurrected very painful memories about our own journey. Sometimes it has been too painful to watch.I dont think any parent can fail to have been moved by the way Tom and Kate fought for Alfie. After all they are loving parents who would do anything to save their childs life.And now Alfies case has made us even more determined to fight for new laws to give parents more say in what happens to their child so that other parents might be spared the agony.Baby Charlie died aged 11 months old last July just a week before his first birthday after a long fight against a disease called mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome.His fight for life touched the world as Connie and Chris fought against a decision by doctors at Great Ormond Street Hospital who applied for permission to have Charlies ventilator switched off.They wanted to take him to the US for pioneering treatment and took their fight all the way through the court system of the UK and Europe.Alfie was admitted to Alder Hey Childrens Hospital in Liverpool in December 2016 aged seven months. It was believed he had a mitochondrial disorder, similar to Charlie, and parents Tom, 21, and Kate, 20, experienced a similar court-battle as they fought to take their son to a hospital in Rome.Both couples lost their legal cases to take their poorly children out of the country for treatment elsewhere.Charlies Law calls for independent mediation to be offered to all parents in a similar situation to prevent cases against doctors going to court.Dad Chris said: People thought Charlies case was unique but the fact Alfies case followed so swiftly shows it is not.In fact these cases are not that rare, which is why the law in this area needs to be addressed.They have offered to meet with Tom and Kate when they feel up to it."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict000402475535-e1525044266341.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"amber rudd pm hopes dashed","story":"She was first elected as the Conservative MP for Hastings and Rye in 2010, having lived in the East Sussex constituency since 2007.Her career saw her hold ministerial positions in the Treasury and the Department of Energy and Climate Change before becoming Energy Secretary in 2015.In the run-up to the 2016 Brexit vote Ms Rudd, 54, campaigned for Britain to stay in the EU.And when Theresa May became Prime Minister after David Cameron quit following the result of the referendum, Ms Rudd succeeded her as Home Secretary.

We’ve never, ever held the City of Westminster. We last held Wandsworth in 1978.“If we took those it would be a spectacular night.” Tories chairman Brandon Lewis yesterday tried to turn election debate into a referendum on largely Labour-run councils’ performances rather than a protest vote against Theresa May’s government.Mr Lewis also told the Andrew Marr Show: “It was interesting to see Andrew row back from turning the whole country red.“It’s people’s frustrations locally that matter.”But senior Tory MP Ed Vaizey admitted the Windrush scandal will have damaged the Tories’ chances at the ballot box. This comes as Home Secretary Amber Rudd resigns.Mr Vaizey told ITV1’s Peston on Sunday: “We’ll have to work three times harder to win back ethnic minority voters I think”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.
