Admitting that there appeared to be no systemic infiltration of the BBC, he said: ‘This satisfactory situation today has not happened of itself, but must be the result of careful watching by BBC management.’He listed two communist groups, the CPGB (Communist Party of Great Britain) and the New Left, as the main threats, although noted that extreme Right-wing groups also needed ‘watching’.Sir Stewart recommended to the board that they create a ‘small unit of one or two people’ whose function was to collate information on the political sympathies of employees. This would enable the BBC to ‘put itself in the best possible stance to deal with extremists who will want to grind their axes, by making sure it had as complete and up-to-date information as possible on all bodies, iniduals, affiliations, front organisations, sympathisers etc’.Harold Wilson\u0027s plan to bomb Radio Caroline: Documents...Share this articleSir Stewart reported that his remarks ‘set going a lively discussion’.One opponent was poet and professor Roy Fuller, who said ‘extremists would not exist if society were not rotten and did not provide plenty of wrongs which had to be righted’.

But another memo shows Sir Michael Hanley, Director General of MI5, warning against a similar idea as it was ‘all politically explosive’ and ‘the BBC is leaky’.

But now we\u0027ll have thousands and thousands of people reading along with us.\u0027The rest of the judging panel is comprised of Scottish crime writer Val McDermid, cultural critic Leo Robson, writer and critic Jacqueline Rose and graphic novelist Leanne Shapton.Organisers said this year\u0027s 171 submissions - comprising of titles published in the UK and Ireland between 1 October 2017 and 30 September 2018 - were the highest number submitted in the literary prize\u0027s 50-year history.The shortlist of six books will be announced on September 20, and the winner of the £50,000 prize will be announced at a gala event on October 16. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/24/01/4E701A5400000578-0-image-a-58_1532392901272.jpg","title":"Overweight stars play nurses midwives TV instead size 6 actresses says Lisa Riley","story":"    Lisa Riley said there is still work to be done in improving TV representation of larger people and it\u0027s time to see an overweight nurse or midwife‘Because, trust me, when I spent time in hospital there was not a single size 6 nurse – and that is not what’s being portrayed in medical dramas.’The 42-year-old Loose Women panellist (pictured), who had surgery to remove excess skin after shrinking from a size 28 to 12, said she has regrets when she looks at old TV clips of herself.She told Radio Times: ‘I do wince when I look back at myself on TV.

During the crisis, Chancellor Norman Lamont came under pressure to spell out how much of Britain’s foreign currency reserves had been depleted but maintained it was impossible to provide a figure (pictured on the day Thatcher left Downing Street)In another revealing exchange of letters on April 1, 1993 between Mr Lamont’s aide Mridul Hegde and Mrs Francis, Miss Hegde notes ‘the practice of successive governments not to reveal the scale of any foreign exchange market intervention. The published figures reveal very little about this.’The note admits ‘the published figures have NOT revealed the scale of the intervention on 16 September’. She fears that informed commentators may ‘suggest that the total underlying fall we have published since September is well short of the full effect and to speculate that part of the effect has been concealed’.‘The latter would, of course, be correct’, she admits bluntly. Mrs Francis replies, asking for the PM to be informed as to ‘what has actually been happening’, rather than ‘what will be said publicly’.In another note from Mr Heywood to Mrs Francis, he updates her on the reserves. Mrs Francis adds a memo on to the July 1, 1993 letter, informing the PM that ‘the Bank have bought $600m foreign currency today.

Admitting that there appeared to be no systemic infiltration of the BBC, he said: ‘This satisfactory situation today has not happened of itself, but must be the result of careful watching by BBC management.’He listed two communist groups, the CPGB (Communist Party of Great Britain) and the New Left, as the main threats, although noted that extreme Right-wing groups also needed ‘watching’.Sir Stewart recommended to the board that they create a ‘small unit of one or two people’ whose function was to collate information on the political sympathies of employees. This would enable the BBC to ‘put itself in the best possible stance to deal with extremists who will want to grind their axes, by making sure it had as complete and up-to-date information as possible on all bodies, iniduals, affiliations, front organisations, sympathisers etc’.Harold Wilson\u0027s plan to bomb Radio Caroline: Documents...Share this articleSir Stewart reported that his remarks ‘set going a lively discussion’.One opponent was poet and professor Roy Fuller, who said ‘extremists would not exist if society were not rotten and did not provide plenty of wrongs which had to be righted’.

But another memo shows Sir Michael Hanley, Director General of MI5, warning against a similar idea as it was ‘all politically explosive’ and ‘the BBC is leaky’.

Snap opens with a mother abandoning her three children in a broken-down car and plays out as they struggle to deal with her disappearance. The judges called it an “acute, stylish, intelligent novel about how we survive trauma”, which “undermines the tropes of its own genre and leaves us with something that lingers”.“I’d read it even before I knew I would be a Booker judge and it seemed to me to be an outstanding novel,” said McDermid. “My fellow judges read it and one said, ‘This transcends genre’, and someone else said, ‘This shows what genre can do at its best’ ... It is an extremely clever piece of storytelling with characters you care about, and that’s what we were looking for – something well written that engages with mind and heart.”A longlist that stands out for its “willingness to take risks with form”, according to chair of judges Kwame Anthony Appiah, also features debuts from Sophie Mackintosh and Guy Gunaratne. Mackintosh’s The Water Cure “unpicks patriarchy at its core”, according to the panel, while Gunaratne’s In Our Mad and Furious City is “an inner city novel for our times”. The poet Robin Robertson mixes verse and prose in his first novel, The Long Take, while Daisy Johnson’s first novel, Everything Under, is enough to put the 27-year-old alongside Sally Rooney, picked for Normal People, as the youngest authors on this year’s list. Johnson and Rooney are “looking at the world from the perspective of their age and their books have a very different flavour”, McDermid explained, “but they’re there because they impressed us”.Only one former winner made this year’s Booker longlist: Michael Ondaatje, for Warlight, which opens in 1945 with London still reeling from the blitz. The other major name in the running for the Booker is the Pulitzer-winning novelist Richard Powers, selected for his novel The Overstory. With US writers having won the last two Man Booker prizes after the award was opened up to authors from outside the UK and Commonwealth – a decision that Julian Barnes described as “daft” earlier this month – naysayers will be celebrating the fact that just three US writers were longlisted this year: Powers, Drnaso and Rachel Kushner, chosen for The Mars Room. Called “terrifyingly authentic” by judges, The Mars Room follows the story of a woman beginning two consecutive life sentences, plus six years, at Stanville Women’s Correctional Facility.The  first book award-winner Donal Ryan makes this list with his story of a Syrian refugee, a care worker and a crooked accountant, From a Low and Quiet Sea. Esi Edugyan’s Washington Black, the story of a slave who becomes the personal servant to an eccentric scientist, and Anna Burns’ Milkman, a look at Ireland during the Troubles through the perspective of a young girl, complete a 13-strong longlist assembled from 171 submissions – the highest number of books ever entered for the prize.“We tried to read blind as much as we could,” said McDermid. “We didn’t care where the writers came from or whether it was their first book or their 40th. I read most on my iPad so I really was reading blind, with no author bio or publisher information.”Appiah said that he and his fellow judges had been struck by the way the novels on the longlist “disrupted the way we thought about things we knew about, and made us think about things we didn’t know about”.“Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the times,” he said, “there were many dystopian fictions on our bookshelf – and many novels we found inspirational as well as disturbing. Some of those we have chosen for this longlist feel urgent and topical others might have been admired and enjoyed in any year. All of these books – which take in slavery, ecology, missing persons, inner-city violence, young love, prisons, trauma, race – capture something about a world on the brink.” Appiah is joined on the panel by McDermid, the critic Leo Robson, the feminist academic Jacqueline Rose and the artist and graphic novelist Leanne Shapton.

The scene is idyllic: golden sands, aquamarine sea, an entirely blameless sky. But our hero is restless. Feeling competitive at the sight of some boys ing, he decides to join in – with predictable results having landed badly, Whistler must spend the rest of the trip laid up, his leg heavily bandaged. Not that this teaches him a lesson. Soon afterwards, Tammy, the beautiful, tarot card-reading daughter of the couple who take Sarah to the beach in his stead, appears beside his hammock. He can’t help himself the two of them sleep together. By the time he’s on the plane back home, he is in the middle of a full-blown, if somewhat premature, midlife crisis.So far, so relatively straightforward. However, things are about to turn distinctly weird. At a party in London, the newly single Whistler meets a woman called Morgan they have a one-night stand, after which she disappears. He would love to see her again, and finally does, in the street – except that she claims not to recognise him, insisting her name is Leila. Can this be true? Well, it’s complicated. As she will soon reveal, Morgan (or Leila) is a multiple personality like a Russian doll, five distinct characters inhabit her body. How did they come to be there? His head full of thoughts of Sybil and The Three Faces of Eve, films that famously depict multiple personality disorder, he goes online in search of answers. Did Morgan suffer trauma as child? Or are the roots of her illness more sinister? Could she, in fact, be a victim of a cold war project designed to control the human psyche? When Whistler, in thrall to the latter scenario, learns that people close to her are being killed, he sets out to defend her – though it could be him who needs protection now.Strange times call for strange books, and this collaboration between John Harris Dunning, the writer of Salem Brownstone who co-curated the Comics Unmasked exhibition at the British Library in 2014, and Michael Kennedy, a 23-year-old artist and animator from Birmingham, is nothing if not peculiar. Though it opens with a definite whiff of Patricia Highsmith, thanks to its sci-fi twists and turns, its keen sense of the uncanny, and its regular nods to the movies and to classic comics, it’s really much closer in sensibility to Charles Burns’s X’Ed Out trilogy or Chris Reynolds’s Mauretania series. Like those comics, it looks fantastic, its frames drawn in a combination of hallucinatory colour and noir-ish inkiness that is strongly suggestive of a nervous breakdown. Is it, in fact, Whistler rather than Morgan who’s not of sound mind? Or is she simply a con and he her unwitting dupe? Even as I turned the last page, these were questions I couldn’t quite answer – and therein lies all of this singular comic’s slippery, shivery power.• Tumult by John Harris Dunning and Michael Kennedy is published by SelfMadeHero (£16.99).

I want a revolution I can dance to, not a cult of obedienceI am not a communist. Literally. Though God knows I have been called one for demanding a tea break when working in Florida. I half-pretended to be one when I worked for Marxism Today, the magazine of the Communist party of Great Britain, but I never joined. Which was lucky really, because when the business manager forgot to pay the electricity bills and everyone got sent home, they didn’t get paid as they were in the party, but I did.But I loved it when the activist Ash Sarkar yelled at that puffer fish who presents Good Morning Britain: “I’m literally a communist, you idiot.” Sarkar is a great thing, as is fun communism. Where can I sign up? In the past, you see, I have had issues with communism. Cults, authority, centralisation – never mind gulags, secret police, rape the imprisonment of intellectuals and mass killlings. There are two sorts of folk: those who want a programme of what to do and those of us who are incapable of following instructions, whether they come from Ikea or the cadre of Corbyn. We just don’t have it in us. We want a revolution we can dance to, not an allen key of self-righteousness.I love Marx. Unlike most of his acolytes he could write his words vibrate on the page. Just when you think you know about how the world is swirling, he says: “If anything is certain, it is that I myself am not a Marxist.” In the words of Bob Dylan: “Don’t follow leaderswatch the parking meters.”All kinds of unlikely people have declared themselves communists. When I worked at Marxism Today, posh old ladies would come in to dust the bust of Lenin in the basement. At that point, we all loved Gramsci and Red Bologna, where the Italian Communist party held power: the fun kind of communism, not the “tankie” Stalinist kind. Bologna struggled, as theorist Franco Berardi told us, because workers were pitted against what he called “precarious, underpaid young proletarians”. Ring any bells? They did not believe that any party could lead to communism. They wanted to rebuild society with no limitations they were the Autonomia activists. This idea of cities breathing fire, of socialism in one country: all this was exciting, and like today’s young self-declared communists who fetishise automation as the ultimate liberation. “It’s about the desire to see the coercive structures of state dismantled, while also having fun,” says Sarkar.But the glossing-over of what communism is, of who it killedand seeing that as a moral equivalence with the deaths caused by capitalism, is idiotic ahistoricism. The idea of talking about communism with no centralised state is just that: an idea. The refusal of parts of the left to criticise Putin, or see the misery of Cuban peasants, Chinese workers, or those starving in Venezuelais sickening. The really great stuff being discussed by young leftists is not communism, it is anarcho-syndicalism – participatory local democracy. Corbyn is an unlikely step on the way to these localised utopias. For if there is any group of people that doesn’t allow freethinking, it is some of his followers, who see any microaggression against the great leader as punishable by death. Or worse if you are on Twitter.If you want to be a proper communist you need to understand ideology, and this is currently a big failing. Your case has to connect to freedom. Still the right lays claim to this. Freedom for the many, not the few, yes … but each of us has also to be free. When communism connotes liberty, I will sign up. But as long as it is associated only with obedience, I literally won’t be buying the T-shirt.This fun kind of communism is a lovely commodity indeed. All I see is people saying: “Get with the project or you are persona non grata.” Same as it ever was. Comrades: at least read your own history.The mass overprescribing of antidepressants (one-in-six adults in England used them last year) is hardly news. It has a number of causes: cuts to GP services minimal mental health provision severely limited access to any kind of talking therapy beyond CBT and epidemics of depression and anxiety.

Of course he does. He wants GPs to prescribe social activities: arts clubs, gardening, pottery. All these things are good. Everyone knows exercise and company is good. Part of being depressed, though, is often not being able to do what we know is good for us. “Social prescribing”, or setting up patients with these activities, is not a bad idea, but his offer of £4.5m for these schemes is chicken feed. It’s less than the cost of Boris Johnson’s second home.We have a severe mental health crisis in the UK, and severely rundown mental health provision. Every day, I see very ill people walking around or sleeping on the streets. Every day, I hear of extremely ill teenagers with self-harm problems, eating disorders and suicidal thoughts adults who are addicts and extremely lonely. We can argue over what is causing this degree of suffering the fact is, it is there in front of our eyes. The medications work for some, and not for others.So we urgently need to fund the alternatives properly and seriously, instead of endlessly talking about mental health issues in a more “open” way but stripping all services to the bone. This is the real crisis of the NHS. This new health secretary has to put more money where his mouth is."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c79e7b22cce207dcfb3811977886bab6a2c99818/0_0_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d2e59c1d9768dc4c3cc98576d004932","title":"theresa may brexit no deal panic stockpiling food civil unrest","story":"Stockpiling food.

Austerity was not accompanied by telling the public to expect less of everything for ever.The newly assertive Tory right threatens to block any tax rises. Yesterday the Taxpayers’ Alliance (its backers opaque) warned in the Daily Mail that tax is already too high – a shot across Treasury bows. Without a new election, paralysis blocks this government.For now, the Brexit crisis distracts from all its other failures. When the former attorney general Dominic Grieve tells Sky News that no deal will cast us into “a state of emergency – basic services we take for granted might not be available”, Cassandra-like, he is ignored as Project Fear mark two. But when Doug Gurr, the head of Amazon UK – no political player – warns of “civil unrest” within two weeks of a no-deal guillotine, we should all sit up and pay attention. He said that to Dominic Raab, the Brexit secretary, at a meeting with business chiefs last Friday: Amazon is making contingency plans.Every week new official warnings – on aviation, driving licences, nuclear safety – will cause new red tape (oh, the irony!). The City was warned yesterday that the EU rejects its “equivalence” plan to keep selling financial services to Europe. That risks gaping holes in Treasury revenues. But the purpose of these no-deal preparations is to satisfy supporters of Jacob Rees-Mogg that their preferred no deal is an option – and to convince the EU that we could walk away.

Last weekend, thanks to an ongoing impasse over fees, Virgin removed 10 UKTV channels from its service. If that wasn’t bad enough, five of them are free-to-air, meaning that approximately 4 million Virgin subscribers are in effect worse off than if they’d just had Freeview.But the really bad news, the absolute kicker in an already terrible news cycle, is that one of the channels is Dave. Beautiful, blokey, moderately self-aware Dave home to Taskmaster and Red Dwarf and Porters and a genuinely endless vortex of Top Gear repeats. A life without Dave is already too much for some subscribers, with a #SaveDave hashtag forlornly doing the rounds on Twitter in the vain hope that someone will see it and restore a shred of normality to a life that’s rapidly transforming into a whirling, Dave-free nightmare. However, Virgin Media customers should not despair. While this is certainly an inconvenience, there are always workarounds you can try before cancelling your contract. For instance:Shows on Dave might be good, but not many of them are that original. For example, if you miss its Would I Lie to You? repeats, you could always try watching the tonally similar 8 Out of Cats Does Countdown, which has just begun its 16th series on Channel 4. If you miss its Storage Hunters UK, try Storage Wars on the History Channel. If you miss Hairy Bikers’ Mississippi Adventure, you could always try watching any of the million other Hairy Bikers shows that are permanently on every other channel all the time. And if you miss Top Gear? There’s always New Top Gear, although you’re not a masochist.Don’t forget that you can still buy physical copies of all your favourite Dave shows. QI fans can buy box sets of 13 entire series, for example, for the low low price of £120. Series 1-8 of Red Dwarf can be snapped up for just £44.99 and, while no Taskmaster DVDs are currently available, you can nevertheless buy a DVD of a five-year-old Greg Davies stand-up DVD for £10.42. Keep this up and you’ll never be short of entertainment again. You won’t have enough money to eat, but at least you’ll never be short of entertainment.Hey grumpy, don’t complain that Virgin has robbed you of Dave. Be thankful that Virgin has given you Investigation Discovery, home of shows like Dateline with Tamzin Outhwaite. And Horse \u0026amp Country, home of shows like Equitrekking. And Quest Red, home of shows like Curvy Brides Boutique. It’s the same thing. It is.Can’t stomach life without your favourite Dave shows? Simply recreate them at home! Alex Horne has written a Taskmaster book for precisely this purpose, for instance. But why stop there? Why not reenact Timber Kings by building a log cabin in your garden? Why not reenact American Pickers by rifling through barns for antiques? Why not reenact Scrappers by doing the exact same thing as you did for American Pickers? Why not reenact Top Gear by punching a colleague until you’re fired? There is a whole afternoon of fun to be had here.If you really can’t stand to be apart from Dave, there’s a lot to be said for lurking outside your Freeview-owning neighbour’s house and watching it through their window. True, there are so many ways to watch television now that it’s highly unlikely they’ll be watching Dave when you want to watch Dave, but that’s nothing a little pro-Dave propaganda won’t solve. Try engaging them in conversation on how much you like Top Gear, or what a cool guy Inspector Dave Corcoran from Cop Car Workshop is. If all else fails, you could always erect a large poster reading SOMETIMES IT ISN’T ENTIRELY FUTILE TO WATCH SIX-YEAR-OLD MOCK THE WEEK REPEATS AT NIGHT, TREVOR right outside their front door.

It’s sold as being hyper-scientific, with the founders and developers formerly working at Cern, and “without a single side-effect”: unless, of course you count unintended pregnancy as a side-effect.The novelist Olivia Sudjic, writing for the , revealed her shock at getting pregnant within months of starting to use the Natural Cycles app, and found many other women had too. In bare bones, the app is simply the Vatican-favoured rhythm method repackaged in shiny, Silicon Valley jargon and a slick interface. And the rhythm method doesn’t have the greatest reputation as a diecast means of preventing pregnancy: the Catholic church recommend it for married couples both trying to plan and delay pregnancy, but with the very clear message that couples employing it should be open to the possibility of new life. Happy accidents can bring as much joy as planned babies – as a Catholic, I back the church’s teaching that sex is about far more than pleasure, and also comes with responsibility and consequences for you and your family. I could use the app to try to avoid pregnancy but would have to accept pregnancy as a possible outcome of any bedroom antics.But other women are perfectly entitled to want a contraceptive less prone to chance and failure, and deserve the truth about the app sold as super accurate. It’s unreliable because our bodies are unreliable: fertility waxes and wanes with an assortment of biological factors, and tracking ovulation is never an exact science.It’s this fact that makes the marketing behind Natural Cycles so insidious: the science is pushed hard even though the founders are physicists, not gynaecologists. I’d no more listen to a physicist’s advice on my fertility than I would let a mechanic cut my hair. To use the app correctly, women must record their temperature at the same time each morning, immediately upon waking, before sitting up . Many things can throw off the accuracy: oversleeping, having a fever, being hung over, insomnia, taking your temperature shortly after waking, irregular periods and polycystic ovary syndrome. According to these criteria I couldn’t have recorded a single day accurately in the last week – I’ve had heat-induced insomnia, slept late, woken early, had a mild hangover, and woke one morning with a slight fever. Trying to remember all of these conditions, when the app’s marketing tells you it is reliable, gives some clue as to the reason why so many women are unhappy.But it’s not surprising that promises of natural birth control are so alluring. The side-effects of most forms of contraception are maddening. Friends on the pill have had their weight explode, their mental health suffer, and their skin return to teenage form, with migraines drastically worsened by daily hormones. My experiences with doctors echo those of most of my\u0026nbspfemale friends with dysmennorrhea, endometriosis and polycystic ovary syndrome: for years my complaints were dismissed as though I were\u0026nbspcomplaining about a mild discomfort. Only when my periods lasted three weeks out of four, I was seriously anaemic from blood loss and repeatedly lost consciousness with pain was I granted a referral to a specialist that led to an operation and a diagnosis of adenomyosis, a severe form of endometriosis. One GP told me the contraceptive implant I’d had in my arm for three years had been rendered useless by the epilepsy medication I took every day. The backlash against birth control apps is growing. Yet, women do need more readily available information about their own fertility, as well as about the side-effects of the contraceptives they are prescribed. Technology appeals because the medical profession too often dismisses and fails women, and has ignored the concerns of many women disenchanted with the side-effects of hormonal contraception. No wonder Silicon Valley steps in, seemingly offering a natural and smart solution that looks – and is – too good to be true.But doctors should ask why so many women would consider trusting an app over a medical professional, and researchers should look at why so many people are unhappy with the prescribed pills, injections and implants, and work to improve them. All of us emerged blinking into the light from a uterus: fertility should be taken more seriously, and women should be trusted when reporting symptoms and anxieties, rather than be treated as unreliable witnesses and hysterics."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b8c2f8424d754acc8c1cdd70e448136851b006e/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2775f5e6a9b89c0e14daf29f85825f03","title":"working class socialist authentocracy dennis skinner alexandria ocasio cortez","story":"“We, not the north London intelligentsia, are the party of working people.” So rang the stinging retort issued by a government minister to an upstart Labour MP last week.It’s a standard attack line from the Tories’ grab-bag of cliched dismissals. What made it notable this time was that it was being deployed against Dennis Skinner, the ex-coal miner who has been the MP for Bolsover in Derbyshire since 1970, and the minister was Claire Perry, whose CV includes Harvard Business School and Credit Suisse. Skinner has all the standard markers of working class authenticity and Perry has almost none, with a significant exception: Skinner is leftwing, and Perry, a business minister, is rightwing.Moreover, the Bolsover MP had raised the issue of the prevalence of zero-hour contracts, which directly affects low-paid workers. Perry’s point that “many people on zero-hours contracts actually choose that level of flexibility” was a carefully picked phrase designed to avoid acknowledging that many workers do not choose zero-hour contracts – and that low, variable incomes can force people to rely on food banks.Perry’s retort was both remarkable for its absurdity, and unremarkable because it’s such a regular catch-22 of a scam, whose logic goes like this: everyone from a working-class or poor background really cares more about national identity, nuclear weapons and protecting the border than they do about economics – even economics that would materially improve their own circumstances so caring about this sort of economics automatically disqualifies you from being a credible person to care about it.We saw another example across the Atlantic earlier this month following the shock ousting of Joe Crowley, a 10-term congressman and one of the most senior figures in the Democratic party, by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a 28-year-old outsider from the Democratic socialist wing of the party, in a primary election for New York’s 14th district. John Cardillo, a host at the rightwing Rebel Media site, found a picture of the single-storey home Ocasio-Cortez and her mother lived in while she attended school. He tweeted that its location in the “very nice area” of Yorktown Heights was “a far cry from the Bronx hood upbringing she’s selling”.The background to this childhood home is illuminating, because it establishes the ease with which the signifiers of working-class authenticity are granted or withdrawn according to political utility. Ocasio-Cortez’s mother picked up extra work so they could afford to move into a single-storey, two-bedroom house in a nice neighbourhood, so that their daughter could get access to a good school. Had she come through this learning the ideologically correct lesson that you just need to work hard and keep your nose down and you’ll succeed, she would be lauded unreservedly on the right as an example of someone from the “aspirational” working class making the system work for her.However, the lesson she learned was, in her own words, “how the zip code one is born in determines much of their opportunity”. Ocasio-Cortez observed from her own life that talent and hard work counted for more if you were in the right place and around the right people. It was this politically incorrect conclusion, not the details of her upbringing, that led to her being categorised as “fake” rather than “aspirational”.The point here is not to say that Skinner or Ocasio-Cortez are genuinely “working class”, but rather to point out that it’s irrelevant for the purposes of this new “common sense” – according to which the former Labour peer Alan Sugar’s background counts because he is to the right of the Labour party, but Skinner’s does not because he is a socialist. This is the kind of thing one can get away with simply by asserting it, rather than reaching a conclusion you have to support and argue for – although it helps if you don’t draw attention to the con quite so starkly as that.As Joe Kennedy says in his new book Authentocrats, the abstracted conception of the working class is instrumentalised by those who have little real interest in those living in post-industrial heartlands or flyover country, but who appreciates the usefulness of a framework that pointedly looks away from the economic systems that led us here: it was in fact the “real” people of Britain who chose a life of zero-hour contracts, low pay, crumbling public services and food banks. And taking it from them would be elitist.Something can be common sense and still utterly fatuous. Now we’ve reached the point where we don’t even have to muck about with the symbolism any more – and are just straight up asserting that the working class only exists as an abstraction to ventriloquise conservative millionaires – can’t everyone stop pretending that they can’t see how ridiculous this is?• Phil McDuff writes on economics and social policy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e235a0c6aeaecb7640a18adb763f010c5acb556/201_644_5574_3344/master/5574.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7368cec76649d8bb11fb7e953afec4e1","title":"academic writes 270 wikipedia pages year female scientists noticed","story":"Researcher Jess Wade says efforts to attract girls into science are not evidence-based – and are not workingJess Wade is a scientist on a\u0026nbspmission. She wants every woman who has achieved something impressive in science to get the prominence and recognition they deserve – starting with a Wikipedia entry.“I’ve done about 270 in the past year,” says Wade, a\u0026nbsppostdoctoral researcher in the field of plastic electronics at Imperial College London’s Blackett Laboratory. “I\u0026nbsphad a target for doing one a day, but sometimes I get too excited and do three.”That science doesn’t attract enough girls and has ground to make up in supporting and celebrating its women can feel like a tired refrain in\u0026nbspacademia. But Wade’s approach is\u0026nbsprefreshing and infectious.“I kind of realised we can only really change things from the inside,” she says. “Wikipedia is a really great way to engage people in this mission because the more you read about these sensational women, the more you get so motivated and inspired by their personal stories.”Wade went to an all-girls school and, with both her parents being doctors, science was a backdrop to her childhood. She does not recall encountering barriers on her way to\u0026nbspgaining a place to study physics as\u0026nbspan undergraduate at Imperial. When she started, the course was so tough and she was so focused on doing well, it barely registered that there weren’t many girls around.It was only as a PhD student that she was struck by how being in a minority can shape day-to-day experiences. “Being isolated is hard – this goes for all underrepresented groups,” she says. “Then there are all those challenges during your PhD that amplify that isolation. If you don’t have anyone you can really get on with around you it’s so, so hard.”Wade started giving talks at schools and became engaged in outreach to encourage girls to take up science, but quickly became frustrated with much of the work going on under the\u0026nbsp“women in science” banner.“It\u0026nbspinfuriates me that even for a\u0026nbspblink of an eyelid they think that kind of thing will\u0026nbspchange anything,” Wade tells me\u0026nbspthrough gritted teeth.Many of the initiatives are backed by a significant amount of funding – Wade estimates £4m to £5m is spent annually on women in science outreach, with big contributions from banks and engineering firms as well as the government. “It’s not just a few academics going out and doing talks in schools, it’s huge investments of money,” she says. Yet there\u0026nbspappeared to\u0026nbspbe little or no evaluation as to whether the projects had achieved their aims – and the evidence was not encouraging.“There’s so much energy, enthusiasm and money going into all these initiatives to get girls into science,” she says. “Absolutely none of them is evidence-based and none of them work. It’s so unscientific, that’s what really surprises me.”Wade began to look into what had been shown to work best: speaking to parents and teachers, for instance, rather than just focusing solely on pupils.After seeing the reach achieved by uploading scientific images on to Wikimedia Commons, the free photo-sharing site, she decided to do the same for scientists themselves.Professor Kim Cobb, a US climate scientist, was her first subject. “She’s super interesting, she\u0026nbspdoes really cool research on corals and she goes ing to collect samples,” she says. Soon after, Wade\u0026nbspwent to a talk by Susan Goldberg, editor of National Geographic (the\u0026nbspfirst woman to hold this post), who noticed she too lacked a Wikipedia entry. “I\u0026nbspthought ‘That’s outrageous’, so I\u0026nbspdid her page,” she says. Since then she has done hundreds more.As we weave our way through a\u0026nbsplabyrinthine intersection between Imperial’s physics and maths buildings, Wade greets a colleague before turning to me to say: “That’s Emma McCoy, the first woman to be a professor of maths here. I made her page.”There are inevitable critics of the project. Last week she received a\u0026nbspmessage on Twitter from an Oxford PhD student accusing her of using Wikipedia to self-promote and publicise friends. “This is not what Wikipedia is about!” he wrote. “Think about the ... damage you’re causing to the Wiki community!”She says she “knew he was wrong” but still had a wobble. However, she was met with a surge of online support. And Wade’s subjects, none of whom she had met personally before writing their entry, have been almost universally thrilled. “Professors feel really empowered when they’ve got one,” she says.Wade’s activism is not limited to online. After reading Angela Saini’s 2017 book, Inferior, which applies scientific scrutiny to claims of sex differences and gender stereotypes, Wade started distributing copies. “I realised that this kind of bias has been penetrating through society for so long,” she says. “Ever since Darwin’s time women have been fighting back. I suddenly realised I can do this: I can change it and I can make sure other people read this too.”She estimates she has bought and handed out 60 or 70 copies of the book, to friends, family and fellow scientists at international conferences. “About a week ago, Angela said, You’ve got to stop buying them’, and sent me 10 signed copies,” she says, before insisting I leave with a copy.She relentlessly nominates other women for prizes, including Emma Chapman, an astrophysicist at Imperial, who was awarded the Royal Society’s Athena prize last week, and when I meet her she is surrounded by a huddle of girls on work experience who are shadowing her that day.What does she ultimately hope to achieve? “I guess it’s to make science a better place for everyone working in it, which happens when we recognise the contributions of these awesome women,” she says. “Then the girls who do come – because they will! – will come to a much more empowering environment.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b4ee28238ba39968addaf7986ec9fd83526b050/0_514_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de41ba71784550e0992c5bbe9bc05d0b","title":"why spend 840000 renovating st anthonys free school close","story":"There is mounting criticism of the ‘chaotic’, ‘brutal’ free school policy and lack of government support as at least five free schools shut down this termWhen Lorna Middleton was interviewed for her job as headteacher at\u0026nbspSt\u0026nbspAnthony’s free school in the Forest of Dean in March 2017, she felt full of optimism\u0026nbspabout the future. The little school, based in two Victorian houses linked\u0026nbspby an\u0026nbspextension, had been lined up to join a local academy\u0026nbspchain and move to new school buildings.By the time she started the job that September, however, that plan had been abandoned and instead a\u0026nbspprogramme of refurbishment had begun – work that would cost taxpayers £840,000. Middleton has never been given a reason for the change of plan.Then, last Friday, the school closed for the final time, shut down by the DfE.Middleton and her chair of governors now say the government has let the school down. “The experience, for me, of interacting with the government has\u0026nbspbeen brutal,” Middleton says. She believes the closure shows that its approach to free schools is poorly thought-through. “Having set up the school and invested in the buildings, why did the DfE not provide it with more\u0026nbspsupport?” she asks.Free school supporters still champion the policy as a success. They argue these schools have better exam results than others. And they believe ministers’ willingness to step in and close schools when they struggle is a strength of the programme – despite the impact on pupils.Middleton says: “The DfE will keep telling you that free schools benefit from the ‘freedom’ from control, either by the local authority or by the DfE itself. That sounds brilliant. But there has to be some quality control upfront, before these schools are allowed to open, including the buildings. In our case that never seems to have happened.”Based in the former mining town of Cinderford, St\u0026nbspAnthony’s started out as a fee-charging Catholic day school in the 1960s. It joined the state sector as a free school in September 2013. Middleton says she\u0026nbsphas never seen any record of a\u0026nbspvisit by the DfE before the transfer.In 2015 the then headteacher sought funding from the DfE for improvements after an engineering report showed the buildings were unsafe. The engineers highlighted “urgentpotential for danger to life” in the electrics, including there being no cover to an electrical distribution board and “potential access to live wiring”.No money was offered by the DfE at the time. In February 2017, a safety\u0026nbspaudit by Gloucestershire county council, warned that “the risk to life from fire is high”. There were “significant deficiencies in fire precautions” with “insufficient fire separation between floors”. The document set out 17\u0026nbspbullet points of\u0026nbspbuilding “hazards”. Draft minutes from a meeting of the school’s governors, five months later, stated that fire safety was “currently inadequate”. Refurbishment to fix the problems began when Middleton arrived.Then there were the finances. Upon starting her job, Middleton found there was only £130 in the school’s bank account. She managed to secure an interim loan of £65,000 from the DfE to pay the staff.In December 2017, at the end of Middleton’s first term, St Anthony’s failed an Ofsted inspection. It was the school’s second poor report the\u0026nbspfirst was in May 2015, long before Middleton arrived. The 2017 report said leadership and management had been “dysfunctional” over time. Teachers’ subject knowledge was “weak” and the curriculum “poorly designed”. Before Middleton arrived, the school had used £150,000 – nearly half of its entire budget – to\u0026nbsppay for “leadership consultancy support”, with spending having gone “unchecked and unchallenged by governors”, said the inspectors. Ofsted also highlighted the delay in sorting out the building safety problems. But Ofsted also said: “The current headteacher has a\u0026nbspclear understanding of the school’s failings and what is required to bring about the urgent improvements necessary. Poor performance is now being addressed systematically.”By January this year, the refurbishment was complete. But then, just days later, Middleton says she was called to the DfE in London for a meeting with Lord Agnew, the minister with responsibility for free schools, to be told that, following the December Ofsted report, he was\u0026nbsp“minded” to\u0026nbspclose St\u0026nbspAnthony’s. Over the next few months, Middleton and Anselm Jacobs, the chair of governors, tried to persuade the DfE\u0026nbspotherwise.Jacobs, who has 20 years’ experience of school governance, and joined St Anthony’s at\u0026nbspthe same time as Middleton, says the government’s free schools policy is “chaotic”. He adds: “The\u0026nbspvoluntary-aided school where I’m a governor works like an absolute dream compared with my\u0026nbspexperience here. It often seems as if the DfE doesn’t have a clue.”They are not the first school leaders to fight back after a closure. In 2014, Education  revealed how the chair of governors of the Discovery free school in West Sussex, described the policy as “rushed and\u0026nbspill-considered”.At Robert Owen academy in Hereford, another free school closing this summer, Chris Morgan, the chair of\u0026nbspgovernors, says the closure has had a damaging effect on some students. He believes the DfE\u0026nbspis more willing to pull the plug\u0026nbspon free schools than other schools. “Establishing a\u0026nbspschool from scratch, in the face of tricky local politics\u0026nbspa generally unsympathetic Ofsted system and in the context of\u0026nbspspare places in other schools was always going to be tough. We needed more support.”Last month, another free school called Discovery, in Newcastle upon Tyne, announced its closure after four years, despite a reported £9m spent creating it. The local Labour council leader said it was a “damning indictment of the government’s high-risk experiment in our education system”.\u0026nbspA DfE spokesman says the closure of St Anthony’s was to do with “improvement issues”. The school “was judged as inadequate by Ofsted in December 2017 and since then has received extensive support from the department, including bespoke advice from education advisers and\u0026nbspfinancial guidance to\u0026nbsptry to bring about the improvements it needed. Funding awarded to the school for building repairs was for essential work to make sure that the building was safe, and had no connection with the improvement issues that the school faced.” Yet the proposal to close the school was announced barely a month after\u0026nbspOfsted visited. Middleton says the only visit she has had from DfE consultants – other than administrators preparing its closure – came from two finance people who arrived for a few hours in May.The DfE spokesman adds that St\u0026nbspAnthony’s was subject to “rigorous due diligence before its free school application was approved”. He did not reply to the specific question of whether this included a visit from the DfE.He adds: “The free schools programme has brought ersity and innovation to English education. More than eight in 10 free schools are rated good or outstanding, with pupils making more progress at the end of GCSEs on average than pupils at other secondary schools.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbf7290d3c943547eee5f58a30b5f5879420b15b/0_104_5197_3117/master/5197.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d144233e7572253f78a4a1516f62770","title":"garden photographer of the year macro winners in pictures","story":"International photographic competition, which runs in association with the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew, London, awards special prize for the best close-up images"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b07c8b57caa4e2240fc005042aa4508b7d7ed50/0_216_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a32fc67230e5965cde98c556b6fe6d6","title":"jurgen klopp liverpool premier league ambitions","story":"Liverpool’s manager knows that after a summer of lavish spending the club needs to start winning trophies“You probably won’t like this question,” Jürgen Klopp is forewarned. There is usually no “probably” about it. Usually any question that looks beyond the next game or requires a prediction from the Liverpool manager prompts a disappointed frown and curt reply but this time is different. This time Klopp accepts it must be different. The question, of course, is whether Liverpool have to end this season not only with progress, positivity and memories of some genuinely thrilling performances but with the first silverware of his Anfield reign? “You are right and people will say that,” he admits. “It is the next step.”There is expectation on Liverpool every summer, as there should be. Questions about that elusive Premier League title are an annual feature of pre-season. This summer they carry greater weight. Having rebuilt expectation over the course of his three seasons as Liverpool manager, and invested over £170m on new talent ahead of the fourth, Klopp cannot and does not shy away from the demand that has intensified on him and his players. There is no frown as Klopp elaborates at length on the aims for a campaign that he is relishing.“It would be the next step and we need to be ready for that,” he continues. “I cannot give guarantees here but I understand if people think that. I know about the expectations and that is completely normal. First of all we have to play the football that gives us an opportunity to win something. We cannot talk about winning something before we start the season. Football is not like cycling so we have lost a lot of things. The other day I put on a session and had to stop it and start again. I was: ‘Four players, one row, that’s how we defend.’ It’s not that the boys wanted to do it a different way but there’s a big change at this moment – new players coming in from another club, players in after a long time out you are starting new more or less. When you have the complete team together you can build on the basis a little bit more. I am confident we can build on last season. It’s not that we lost things completely but you have to work on it to get it back. The football the boys played last year was not easy. There was a lot of work invested into playing like that. That’s what we will do again. I am not in doubt about our basis or that we will reach it again. I want to have the best start ever but we all know that something can happen and then everything is questioned in a second. I don’t want to prepare anyone for a bad start because I don’t want to have one but it is possible, I cannot ignore that completely.Optimism would be rife at Anfield even without a successful transfer window that has seen Liverpool strengthen in key areas at considerable expense. The Brazil international Alisson, signed for a world record fee for a goalkeeper of £65m, Naby Keïta, Fabinho and Xherdan Shaqiri have all been bought for more money than Klopp spent in his seven years at Borussia Dortmund. Liverpool opened their pre-season tour of the United States with a 3-1 defeat by the German’s former club in Charlotte on Sunday, once again fielding a team that will be unrecognisable from the side that starts the Premier League opener against West Ham United, and face City in New Jersey on Wednesday and United in Michigan on Saturday.Liverpool’s belief is built on more than lavish spending. Last season’s exhilarating run to the Champions League final, Mohamed Salah’s record-breaking debut campaign of 44 goals and a defence bolstered by the £75m signing of Virgil van Dijk, plus the emergence of Trent Alexander-Arnold and blossoming of Andy Robertson, are significant factors.An unbeaten home league record last season and scoring four or more goals in 14 matches – the most in 121 years – provide more. Now, with midfield options multiplied and the long-running, costly goalkeeping problem acknowledged, expectation carries a demand. Klopp accepts that means silverware, although insists progress is measured in various ways.Despite ending City’s unbeaten league sequence and swatting them aside 5-1 on aggregate in the Champions League quarter-final the reality, one that cuts into the feelgood factor at Anfield, is that Liverpool finished 25 points behind Pep Guardiola’s champions last season. They also took one point fewer than in 2016-17 as Klopp navigated a route to Kiev while unable to rotate his midfield due to several injuries. Liverpool also finished behind Tottenham Hotspur and United despite losing two games fewer than both. Twelve draws, compared with United’s six and Spurs’ eight, represent an obvious area for improvement.“It is, of course, consistency,” claims Klopp, when asked how Liverpool take that next step and bridge the gap with City. “It is not just that we have to be more consistent, we have to create circumstances where we can be more consistent. Nobody is consistent with 11 players. What we are working on is the depth of the squad because you need it. The first part of last season when we did the rotation and we were quite active with it, I think we did six or seven changes from one game or the other, we still had quality on the pitch that felt perfect. As long as you could do that it was really good. We need to make sure we can do that much longer over the season and that is only possible if you have the squad.City’s flying start to last season put them in effect beyond Liverpool’s reach before Klopp’s team found their rhythm. The Liverpool manager believes the World Cup, and the involvement until the latter stages of several players from his club, City, Spurs and United, could hinder a repeat by any of the title contenders.“The first games are absolutely important,” he says. “I don’t ask for an easy way. I think City had more players in the semis than we had, Tottenham for sure, so it’s not that we have the biggest problems. But it’s not like the good old times when you had your squad for six weeks in pre-season and spent one week team-building by going to a forest in Sweden with nothing to eat, like I did when I was young. That’s not possible any more.“We are used to these circumstances. We have West Ham and Crystal Palace to start with and that’s tough enough. I don’t know how many players West Ham had at the World Cup but they are signing player after player and they will be a new team for sure. It’s a tough start, as the Premier League always is, but I am fine with that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db395978ad1bef6be6669cfdb44a7f3404226ea4/0_0_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7191d7d497e289ecf55b6246e348002","title":"france croatia final trophy russia 2018 ends on high world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss France’s World Cup final triumph over Croatia, another penalty, another controversial VAR incident, the tournament’s highs and lows and players taking shots to the conkers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec5d5b8ea230adca3bb41ac7c89560ce231896e4/0_61_2460_1475/master/2460.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2421c9942abd56fc59bbdf458c63234c","title":"wales misses golden opportunity england women","story":"The Welsh FA has chosen Newport’s ground for a World Cup qualifier when a larger venue would have boosted the game’s profileThe Three Lions may have roared their way to a World Cup semi-final for the first time since 1990 but it was at the 2015 World Cup that their female counterparts went one better, retuning with bronze medals to the embrace of a new audience.Next summer the Lionesses should be back in World Cup action, this time as one of the favourites, but qualification is yet to be secured. While France, who are the hosts, Spain and Italy have already secured their passage, at the top of Group\u0026nbspOne things are less certain.Wales lead England by a point, though the second-placed side have a game in hand, and the two sides meet next month with the winner able to secure qualification.The teams could not be separated when they met in April. Phil Neville’s first home game in charge was a frustrating one as a resolute Welsh defence – and some outstanding goalkeeping from Laura O’Sullivan – kept England at bay. The Wales manager, Jane Ludlow, whose team is made up primarily of semi‑professional and amateur players, said it ranked in Welsh history, from a female football perspective, as “probably the best”\u0026nbspperformance.An impressive 25,603 fans made the trip to Southampton’s St\u0026nbspMary’s Stadium (capacity 32,505) to watch and with the chance for Wales to qualify for their first major tournament, and to do so against such close rivals, next month’s fixture offers a huge opportunity for the Welsh FA to boost interest in women’s football.Their choice, then, to host the crunch fixture on Friday 31 August at Newport County’s Rodney Parade – capacity 7,850 – is disappointing. Tickets sold out within 24 hours – with England’s allocation gone within hours of their release.The attendance will far surpass the hosts’ record crowd, thought to be less than 4,000, yet it is hard not to think that the decision to play the game in Newport lacks ambition.Wales’s past three home qualifiers – against Bosnia-Herzegovina, Russia and Kazakhstan – have pulled in a total of 7,024 fans. But there is a big difference between those ties and a decider against England. The Lionesses attracted 10,029 to the Banks’s Stadium in Walsall for their qualifier against Bosnia in November. This is a game ripe with opportunity. Schools are out, it is a game where a vibrant home crowd will be important and both teams are yet to lose in qualifying. There was so much potential for this game, with some savvy marketing, to explode in Wales.There are barriers to hosting the match in a big ground, of course. You would likely have more England fans in attendance, though if you invested in a bold strategy you would be confident of limiting their impact – and in any case Wales were superb in the Lionesses’ den of St\u0026nbspMary’s with an overwhelmingly hostile crowd. There are logistical questions. Cardiff City’s 33,280-seat stadium plays host to Arsenal in the Premier League on 2\u0026nbspSeptember.Swansea’s Liberty Stadium (21,088) is available with the men’s side away at Millwall in the Championship, but is less conveniently located for many who would want to travel to the game.It is unlikely either of those more ambitious stadiums would be at capacity. However, surely if you could get 10,000-15,000 – and more than that may not be unrealistic – rattling around a bit would be worth the extra interest and new fanbase.It sometimes feels like many are too quick to accept the challenges as insurmountable, yet in men’s football where there’s a will there’s a way. The heat too much for Qatar to host a World Cup? Fifa will move it from its summer slot to the winter, Tottenham’s new stadium build has overrun? They will be handed an away fixture start and Wembley’s availability will be extended.Yet moving a domestic men’s fixture for a crucial women’s international, investing in a strategy to get tens of thousands there, or even just having belief in the power of a fixture to push feet through the turnstiles are all seen as out of reach.Instead, we find ourselves a month away from a match worthy of promotion and hype but for which fans, Welsh or otherwise, can no longer buy tickets.

Many countries have been slow to implement the 2006 Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.The UK government is holding its first global disability summit, co-hosted with the International Disability Alliance and the Kenyan government, on Tuesday in London. Government officials, the private sector, donor agencies and NGOs will be asked to support a charter for change endorsing rights, dignity and inclusion for people with disabilities.The prime minister, Theresa May, said the summit would be dedicated to “transforming the lives of the most vulnerable”. “The path a person takes in life should not be dictated by their disability and yet people are forced, every day, to deal with prejudice and even violence,” she said.“We are committed to ending discrimination and stigma against disabled people.”May’s comments came just a week after the UK government had caved to pressure and agreed to backdate benefit payments to ill and disabled claimants who were left thousands of pounds out of pocket as a result of a series of bureaucratic errors. In 2017, a UN inquiry criticised the UK for not auditing the impact of austerity policies on the disabled as well as failing to uphold disability rights across the wider range from education, work and housing to health, transport and social security.“To realise the promise of the sustainable development goals to leave no one behind, and to further the principles reflected in the convention on the rights of persons with disabilities, we need to work together to share expertise, coordinate actions and raise the profile of disability across a broader range of organisations contributing to international development efforts,” said Vladimir Cuk, executive director of the International Disability Alliance.Cuk pointed to the discrepancy in the commitments that followed the “big three” global conventions – the rights of the child, the rights of women and the rights of people with disabilities.While Unicef receives $5bn (£3.8bn) annually harnessing global political commitment to implement the convention on the rights of the child, the UN Partnership on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has a budget of just $5m per year.UN Women, which campaigns for women’s rights, has a projected $1.15bn for 2018-2019.“It’s not that other groups receive too much financial support,” said Cuk. “It’s just that the discrepancy explains in part the relatively slow implementation of rights for people with disabilities.”The London summit aims to encourage further partnerships between bigger NGOs and those with specialist expertise. The international development secretary, Penny Mordaunt, said: “For too long many people living with disabilities in the world’s poorest countries have not been able to fulfil their potential due to stigma or a lack of practical support. They are, for example, missing out on school and the chance to work.“Discrimination is unacceptable in today’s society.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f19ac2e0d7432e58f4e430c84c1dfe27997e75f/440_10_5320_3192/master/5320.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4dc5c5bb0132ee222abe41250f361e59","title":"stigma struggles living with disability kakuma kenya in pictures","story":"As the first ever international disability summit begins in London, photographer Kate Holt reports from Kakuma refugee camp in northern Kenya, sharing the stories of refugees and locals who live and cope with disabilities in the most hostile of environments "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb4f54049158c549e2d90d9a3d9c1014fa414940/273_0_3227_1936/master/3227.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b3caf6bfd768ce65f2641075ac2be99","title":"drivers name england worst motorway service station thurrock m25","story":"Thurrock site receives lowest satisfaction rating as toilet renovation works take tollThurrock services on the M25 have been rated by users as the worst in England, in a survey of motorway service stations.

As well as gifting the pop canon two era-defining classics in the shape of 1997’s Never Ever and 2000’s Pure Shores, they also made being in a girl group look like a lot of fun. Not perma-grinning, heavily choreographed, we’re-so-happy-to-be-here fun, but actual sick-on-your-shoe, snogging peak-era Robbie Williams, drunk-crying at the Brit awards fun. In 2001, however, a row about who got to wear a specific jacket at a photoshoot became the catalyst for an acrimonious split. A brief reunion in 2006 was followed by a second “hiatus” (“All Saints are never ever getting back together again,” lied Mel in 2009) before they reunited in 2016 with the actually really good Red Flag album. Two years on and they’re back with a new LP, Testament. Having survived an on-off 20-year career, who better to offer up a guide for other future girlbands, right? Right.Do start with a dream“We wanted to do two things,” remembers chief songwriter Shaznay Lewis about the band’s early goals. “We wanted to perform on Top of the Pops and go to Japan.” Alongside appearing in sorely missed pop bible Smash Hits, which they did in 1997, their dreams were surprisingly small-scale. “To be honest, fame was never on the list,” continues Shaznay. “Fame is so different now – everyone wants to be famous – but back then, we didn’t really think about it.”Don’t panic if you can’t danceMost girlbands have one member who can’t – or won’t – dance, whereas All Saints have four. “I actually have nightmares about forgetting the moves,” says Nat.“We were quite relaxed with our dancing because our songs are quite mid-tempo, but now you have to go all out,” adds Shaznay.“We were all right at it early on when we could do two things at once,” laughs Mel. “Multi-tasking’s not so easy any more. I can’t even breathe when I’m stood still. Jeez.”Do treat it like being at university“The early days were sort of like being at uni,” laughs Mel. “You fuck about, you do a little bit of work, but you mainly fuck about. We spent a lot of time doing that. Top of the Pops was our common room.” “We had a lot of fun with ‘NSync,” says Nat. “They were lovely boys. Then there was Aqua, Savage Garden, Ocean Colour Scene.” There’s a pause as memories float to the surface.“Sean Maguire!” laughs Mel, as everyone else tries to remember the name of the ex-EastEnder’s musical output. “What a legend,” she adds.“I wasn’t into being called a ladette,” sighs Shaznay. “I withdrew from that.”For Nicole, meanwhile, it was more about the drink that was associated with the moniker. “I always saw it as meaning that you drank pints and I didn’t drink pints! That’s why I didn’t like it. I had beer, sure, but I drank champagne and margaritas. I was a champette,” she adds before high-fiving the rest of the band, high on the thrill of wordplay.So were they ever hungover on duty? “I had a very embarrassing morning on CD:UK once,” remembers Nat. “We were talking to Ant and Dec and we all had sunglasses on because we couldn’t see. We went to a commercial break and I had to go because I couldn’t breathe, it was really bad, and I got this phone call from my mum being like: ‘What’s the matter with you!’ Then they came back from the break and I wasn’t there.”With the pregnant Mel watching at home, the band were suddenly down to a duo. “I remember pissing myself because with the studio lights you could see behind the glasses,” she cackles.“We ended up bringing everyone with us from the night before,” remembers Nic.“Our hairdresser was throwing up in the toilet,” adds Nat. “I was throwing up before we actually went live. Mortifying.”What did you think, Mel? “I thought it was funny. I was proud.”Do let your bandmates squirmOccasionally journalists will focus their questions on a particular girlband member, trying to get a good quote about a breakup, some made-up beef or Brexit. Obviously, it’s important for the other members to rally around and defend their friend, right? “No, we let them suffer,” laughs Shaznay.“We’ll all just turn and stare,” agrees Mel.“Usually we’re dying to ask them those things ourselves,” says Natalie.Seriously? “No, I mean, we don’t need to do that because we’re old enough to deal with things ourselves,” says band mum Shaznay, “but we’d never let anyone take the mickey.”Don’t sell outWhile for today’s girlbands brand partnerships are as commonplace as a Sean Paul featured vocal, it is important to remember integrity. “We turned down a lot of lucrative branding offers,” says Mel. “The main problem I had with the Spice Girls was all the endorsements. It’s a way of life now, but they were kind of the first people to put their names on everything. When we were being compared to them I was like: ‘No, no, no.’ We write our own music and we’re here to perform. We wanted to be a band, just a band.”Ridiculously, they claim to have never been approached to front their own range of combat trouser. “Never,” says Shaznay. “I’d have done that, for sure!”This new era finds them ditching the looser trouser for nice two-piece suits. “Chic,” is how Nic describes it. Or perhaps a bit “business casual”?“Do we look like we work in a fucking office, is that what you’re trying to say?” “laughs” Mel.In general, they say they’d recommend looser trousers for girlbands. “Well, girlbands don’t seem to be wearing trousers these days,” says Shaznay. “Bonus tip: just wear some trousers!”Do communicate with each otherMore than most bands, All Saints know surviving a band breakup is tricky. “It took us a really long time to get back together again so maybe we’re not the best people to ask,” sighs Mel. Asked what they’d do differently, the mood darkens.“I don’t think so,” Nat replies. “It’s not the jackets. Communication broke down. We were exhausted. That’s ultimately what happened.”The key to the success of All Saints Mk III is that they don’t let things fester, choosing to take some time out before airing their issues. “You need your own space,” says Shaznay. “That’s a must for anybody in any relationship. Also, we all sit at a table and talk and it’s great.” So far so good.“We empty the baskets,” adds Natalie. Huh? Is that a euphemism? “It’s just things you pick up along the way that you need to let go of,” she explains. “The best advice we can give is empty your baskets together.” It really is the best way.Testament is out on Friday "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de7f0939ad0d58effd452931ad951de458b81135/0_96_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb2916d6c1b5eed5903f21e1b73d6fc5","title":"santas on tour and wild horses mondays best photos","story":"’s picture editors bring you photo highlights from around the world, including heatwaves and wildfires"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a9beaadc95fbcdfed6562bb6335e82834863448/0_0_5940_3563/master/5940.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=69961015325b5005e2e1897681e7d023","title":"ministers selling out uk exporters corbyn to say","story":"Labour leader to say lack of industrial plan means firms unable to profit from ‘competitive’ poundJeremy Corbyn will accuse the government on Tuesday of selling out manufacturers by failing to introduce an industrial plan that could have helped them make more of the weak pound since the Brexit referendum.The Labour leader will say that the British economy has become too reliant on imports, meaning that companies have been unable to benefit from the drop in the value of the pound against the euro and the dollar.Launching Labour’s campaign to boost manufacturing after Brexit, he is expected to say: “Our exporters should be able to take proper advantage of the one benefit to them that Brexit has already brought, a more competitive pound. “After the EU referendum result, the pound became more competitive and that should have helped our exporters. But they are being sold out by a lack of a Conservative government industrial plan, which has left our economy far too reliant on imports.”His remarks follow a Labour awayday in central London on Monday, where shadow cabinet members presented plans for a populist leftwing legislative programme so the party is ready for a snap general election.With the UK’s industrial base in decline for years, however, including under the last Labour government, Corbyn’s criticism – and his regret that companies could not make more of the weak pound – is likely to be met with scepticism.In his speech to industry chiefs in Birmingham, he will tell manufacturers that Labour’s policies would drive an industrial renaissance, using public contracts to expand the country’s economic base, secure good jobs and drive up tax revenues. He will urge Theresa May to reconsider the option of negotiating a new customs union, even though such a move was narrowly rejected by the Commons last week. “It’s a matter of practical common sense,” he will say.Sir Bob Kerslake, the former head of the civil service, told shadow ministers at the awayday that they could face a difficult first parliament if elected as a minority government in a snap election.Sources said he talked about the challenges of driving through an agenda and working with the civil service were Labour to find itself in minority government. “Some people are concerned they could act as a block,” one source said.The all-day session took place just yards from parliament, meeting in Transport House, the former Labour HQ, which now houses the Local Government Association. The shadow frontbench was told to come armed with proposals for a draft Queen’s speech, a first budget and legislative ideas to  a five-year parliament that would be easy to sell if Labour found itself in minority government.No general election is scheduled until 2022, but Labour has taken the lead in the polls recently, which critics have attributed to May’s Chequers plan for the Brexit negotiations and a series of cabinet and frontbench resignations. The party has already hired dozens of local community organisers to help with election planning and selected more than 80 candidates for marginal seats, including the director of the Class thinktank, Faiza Shaheen, who will take on Iain Duncan Smith in Chingford and Woodford Green.Other target seats where Labour has already selected candidates include the former home secretary Amber Rudd’s Hastings and Rye seat, the 1922 Committee chair Graham Brady’s seat of Altrincham and Sale West and the seats of the prominent Tory remainers Ken Clarke and Anna Soubry."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ab4b35a98bbd927522c28021d085c5fd9f11236/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8141bd14fd59301ef301ae658c55503","title":"dewsbury rams batley bulldogs local derby","story":"The grounds of Dewsbury and Batley are 1.3 miles apart and their clubs take the local rivalry seriouslyThese are strange times in rugby league’s Championship, the second highest rung in the English ladder, where the runaway leaders are Toronto Wolfpack, followed by Toulouse. Moves are afoot for further expansion, with a club from New York hoping to be admitted, whereupon they, like other well-heeled outfits, will try to reach the promised land of the Super League, the richest and most prestigious ision in the northern hemisphere, currently comprised of the 11 best teams in England and one from France (Catalans Dragons).As the sport attempts to straddle the earth, some small and storied clubs play on against the odds in the game’s traditional heartland. Two of them, Dewsbury Rams and Batley Bulldogs, met on Sunday in the world’s closest rugby league derby. The West Yorkshire clubs’ grounds are 1.3 miles apart, a jaunt along a road suitably named Challenge Way.The fixture has been called the Heavy Woollen derby since it was first staged in the 19th century, when the region was the global hub of the textile industry. In that bygone era Batley and Dewsbury specialised in producing blankets, coats and military uniforms. Shoddy and mungo – recycled materials made from old rags – were invented here. Once the towns’ rugby teams were celebrated for innovations, too. Batley were English champions in 1924 and Dewsbury competed in the first Challenge Cup final at Wembley, losing to Wigan in 1929. “But the most glorious time was 1973 when we beat Leeds in the League Championship final – the whole town joined in the celebrations,” recalls Chris “Chilly” Hill, who has been Dewsbury’s kitman for the last 40 years, following in the footsteps of his father. “This club means the world to me,” says Hill. “And games against Batley are always great.”Sunday’s affair took place under a blazing sun, leaving spectators wondering how the players, all part-timers now and in the bottom half of the Championship, would cope.It is true. The clubs have made efforts to recruit fans from local schools but, without full-time staff, do not have the resources to campaign as hard as they would like. So there were few teenagers among Sunday’s crowd and even fewer, if any, from the towns’ large communities of south Asian heritage. There was no shortage of enthusiasm from the people who did attend, however. A loud Batley contingent, about 200-strong, rejoiced when their team took an early lead through a smart try by Brad Day. The hosts responded within five minutes after Lucas Walshaw touched down following neat service by Paul Sykes, the home team’s captain. Sykes is a favourite of the home crowd because he used to stand among them.Sykes always dreamt of playing for the club he watched as a boy but professionalism demanded he earn his living elsewhere, as it did for other Dewsbury natives such as the former England international Sam Burgess and his three brothers. After 15 years in the Super League with Bradford and Harlequins, among others, Sykes is fulfilling his childhood ambition at the age of 36. “I always said I would end my career at Dewsbury,” he says. “I loved watching them when I was young and it would be great if more young people came to watch now. Now that I have a young one myself, I plan to do much more to attract kids to come along and watch this. It’s only a level below the Super League. It’s good.”Batley demonstrated that point midway through the first half with a terrific try by Alistair Leak. The move featured several slick passes, including a foxy offload by Sam Smeaton. “Forward!” protested one irate Dewsbury fan. “Two forward passes!” corrected another. “Boooooooooo!” complained the entire home crowd, with one gent suggesting the official should use the upcoming interval to “read your bloody rule book”. Sadly the referee did not make it to half-time, as minutes after Batley’s controversial try he pulled up with a calf strain. You could have heard the jeers from Toronto. And you should have seen the look on the mockers’ faces when, within minutes of taking over, the substitute referee disallowed a Dewsbury try for a forward pass.The second period was even more lively. Leak was sent to the sin-bin for sabotaging a breakaway by the home side and, during his absence, Dewsbury ran in two tries. Sykes was involved in both. Marshalling play from the fringes of the action, he got directly involved only when he was sure his contributions would be decisive, his intelligence and execution radiating class. Even after Leak returned Dewsbury remained on top, racking up a 22-10 lead. Batley had lost eight matches in a row prior to this and extending that streak to nine would be particularly painful at the home of their neighbours. So they rallied. After Michael Knowles landed a drop goal Batley responded with an instant try. Then Alex Rowe, a human bulldozer, embarked on a ram-raid, allowing Patch Walker to score under the posts. With two minutes left the hosts were only 23-20 in front and the crowd grew jittery. “Up the jumpers time!” hollered Firth.Dewsbury held on, bringing a huge cheer from the crowd. Then everyone – players and fans – adjourned to the bar to natter and jape. There are suggestions that, faced with mighty competition from elsewhere, clubs such as these should merge to bring back the good times. “There were rumours about that a few years ago,” says one Dewsbury fan over a brew. “But you’d lose your identity. Anyway, good times haven’t gone away even if some fans have.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62833ddadc7eefd868859635c0e5173e61d65128/0_158_2096_1258/master/2096.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=487de642947e45c8241eb84e5c9e8874","title":"rachael denhollander larry nassar predators know where theyre going to be safe","story":"The former gymnast who broke her silence to lead the takedown of Larry Nassar insists the fight against sexual abuse has only just begunSix months have passed since Rachael Denhollander, the former gymnast who became the first woman to publicly accuse Larry Nassar of sexual abuse, stood in a Michigan courtroom to deliver her victim impact statement. The 32-year-old attorney, whose decision to end her silence ultimately broke open the worst sex-abuse case in US sports history, was the last of the 156 girls and women to speak during the disgraced physician’s marathon seven-day sentencing hearing.“How much is a little girl worth?” she asked the court in remarks that would be broadcast across the world in the hours and days to come. “How much priority should be placed on communicating that the fullest weight of the law will be used to protect another innocent child from the soul-shattering devastation that sexual assault brings? I submit to you that these children are worth everything. Worth every protection the law can offer. Worth the maximum sentence.”Denhollander’s 36-minute statement earned an ovation from the gallery and became an indelible episode of the #MeToo movement with judge Rosemarie Aquilina singling out her principal role in ensuring life imprisonment for a serial child molester who systematically preyed on vulnerable young athletes under the guise of medical treatment. But in a phone interview with the , Denhollander expresses unease about the broader and more elusive systemic culprits still at large – and whether the Nassar trial, for all the publicity it generated, managed to bring any lasting change to the institutions whose collective failure enabled an unspeakable horror.“I think we’re still really waiting to see how much it has changed,” Denhollander says. “Public opinion and pressure tend to go in swells and I think where we’re really going to see if we’ve affected change is what happens when abuse allegations are raised within a community. How does that community respond? Does the community circle the wagons around the predator? Do they still shame the victim, or do they listen? Do they support the survivor? Do they take those allegations seriously? That’s where you see how much it really matters. “I don’t think we’ve tested that yet.”Superficial changes came fast and quick in the immediate aftermath of Nassar’s sentencing to up to 175 years in prison. The outcome triggered the mass resignation of USA Gymnastics’ board of directors and Michigan State president Lou Anna Simon. Scott Blackmun subsequently stepped down as chief executive of the US Olympic Committee, a decision attributed to health reasons but with an acknowledgement that reform required in the wake of the Nassar scandal required a CEO who could work “24-7”. The US Center for SafeSport, designed as an independent, neutral, safe place for iniduals to report allegations of misconduct in Olympic sports, was created. Then in May, the Lansing university, where Nassar taught and practiced medicine from 1997 until 2016 and where much of the abuse took place, announced a $500m settlement with more than 300 women and girls who said they were sexually assaulted by Nassar. But Denhollander points to Michigan State’s refusal to admit any wrongdoing in the statement announcing the deal, an evasion of responsibility which left her lamenting a missed opportunity for true institutional reform. Or, just last week, the US Olympic Committee’s attempt to remove itself as a defendant in lawsuits by arguing that Nassar, who was a volunteer for USA Gymnastics, was never employed by the federation nor were his crimes foreseeable by the USOC. The lack of accountability, she says, is endemic of a broader issue.“No one at (USA Gymnastics) and no one at MSU or any of the departments that were involved have taken responsibility for what’s happened,” Denhollander says. “No one has been willing to articulate: ‘This is what we did wrong, this is the type of environment that we created.’ They can change all the policies and procedures they want, but if the tone from the top down doesn’t change and if there isn’t recognition of the failures that led to this, there’s no real hard motivated change.”Nassar is safely locked away for life, but Denhollander describes the former USA Gymnastics doctor as a symptom of disease which remains unchecked.“Predators know where they’re going to be safe, how survivors are responded to when they speak up and the message that is given from the top down as to how seriously abuse will be taken,” she said. “That is what makes a place either safe for predators or unsafe for predators. The way abuse is handled from the top down, that’s the single greatest factor of whether or not a predator is going to be safe, and whether anyone who receives a report of abuse is going to be motivated to handle it properly.”She continued: “What I would really like to see happen with these organizations is someone step up and actually lead and say: ‘Look, this is what we did that was wrong, these are the consequences for our wrongdoing, and here’s how we’re going to make change.’ So far there hasn’t been a single leader that’s been able to do that. They have apologized that the abuse happened, but they have not apologized for what they did that allowed the abuse to happen. “They have not identified the dynamic that allowed Larry to prey on little girls for 20 years, and until that happens the message from the top is essentially, ‘If you make a mistake, we’re going to protect you because it’s more important to our bottom line. We’re not going to admit liability. We’re not going to admit error.’ That communicates that there’s no motivation to catch predators, there’s no motivation for anyone who receives a report of abuse to do the right thing, and that creates an environment that’s very safe for predators, very conducive to abuse.”According to a lawsuit, Nassar commits his first recorded assault, abusing a 12-year-old girl in the guise of medical research. A year later Nassar gains his medical degree from Michigan State University, where he will commit many of his assaults.Nassar becomes national medical coordinator for USA Gymnastics before the Atlanta Olympics. He will go on to treat athletes at the next five Olympics and abuse many of them. Olympic champions Simone Biles, Aly Raisman, Gabby Douglas and McKayla Maroney are among those who said they were abused by Nassar under the guise of medical treatment.\u0026nbspThe first recorded complaints about Nassar are received. According to a 2017 lawsuit, youth gymnastics coach John Geddert fails to investigate the allegations.\u0026nbspClaims against Nassar go public for the first time after the Indianapolis Star publishes an investigation into sexual abuse at USA Gymnastics. Rachael Denhollander files a criminal complaint against Nassar, saying she was first abused by him when she was 15.Eighteen women file a lawsuit against Nassar, USA Gymnastics, MSU and Twistars Gymnastics Club. The lawsuit alleges Nassar assaulted the women over a period of 20 years and the institutions named in the suit failed to prevent his behaviour.\u0026nbspNassar pleads guilty to seven charges of criminal sexual abuse. He later pleads guilty to three further accounts as part of a plea agreement.\u0026nbspNassar is given a jail term of up to 175 years for sexually abusing athletes in his care. In total, 156 women make impact statement at his sentence hearing, saying he abused them. Handing down the sentence, Judge Rosemarie Aquilina says: “I just signed your death warrant”.On Friday, Denhollander gave birth to her fourth child, Elora Renee Joy, whose middle name is a tribute to Andrea Renee Munford, the Michigan State detective who helped build the case against Nassar. The delivery kept her from joining the 140 survivors who accepted the ESPN’s Arthur Ashe Courage Award in a moving ceremony at the ESPY awards in Los Angeles. But while she takes pride in her leading role toward seeing Nassar brought to account for his monstrous acts, Denhollander can’t help but express ambivalence at the steep personal cost of justice.“The publicity is still very painful,” she says. “The amount of detail that had to be released and what is on record publicly – those are details I never wanted disclosed. I don’t feel like any survivor should ever have to be in the position where they don’t have a choice, and I really do feel like because of the powers that surrounded Larry, we didn’t have a choice. I didn’t have a choice. Those types of details had to be disclosed, it had to be done publicly, because it was necessary to have that level of public pressure to make survivors feel safe to come forward and to override the institutions that have been protecting Larry for decades. “I shouldn’t have had to be put in that position, though at the same time I’m very grateful to see it covered because that public pressure was necessary. And so the journalists that I have worked with, I am deeply grateful for. “Seeing justice done is good. Seeing society pay attention is good. What we had to do to get there is wrong.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69e81142499aadc39c5cc26784033924dc63d131/0_126_4468_2682/master/4468.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81562a092bef0b03a50e41684bdf1ead","title":"lewis hamilton pressure sebastian vettel f1","story":"Ferrari appear to have the edge in terms of engine speed but something was lost over the radio for Kimi RäikkönenThe rain played its part in Hockenheim, as did good fortune and Sebastian Vettel’s very costly mistake but there was no doubt that by t,he time Lewis Hamilton took the flag, he had deserved it. He opened with a piece of clinical driving to move up to the front-runners, careful at the start where any contact could have ended his race and then passed 10 cars within 14 laps, all cleanly. He did so while managing to make his tyres last 42 laps – while in dirty air – an achievement that put him on the ultrasofts at the end, which was key to being able to stay out in the wet. When he took the new boots, he charged. He was 24 seconds behind Vettel after the stop – seven laps later he had halved the gap, pressure that may well have contributed to Vettel’s error. Then in the closing stages his defending against Bottas, before the team orders, was immaculate and tenacious. A superb day at the office by any standards and he rated it as one of his best.Vettel was furious with overcooking it into the Sachskurve but quickly calmed down, buoyed by the fact that, regardless of the result, Ferrari comprehensively appear to have a quicker car than Mercedes. “I don’t think it was a huge mistake,” he said. “It was a huge impact on the race because we retired there but it’s not like tonight I’ll have difficulty falling asleep because of what I’ve done wrong.” The Scuderia had made their mark in qualifying, where Bottas admitted he could not catch Vettel and the strength of Ferrari’s power unit could be seen with five Ferrari-engined cars in the top 10. The Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, acknowledged that the Scuderia now had the edge, noting that they were up to five-tenths quicker on the straights. “If we want to win this championship, or stay in the hunt in this championship, we’ve got a severe warning,” he said. Vettel’s error was costly but he has the tools to come back.A few expletives over team radio is nothing new from Vettel, but there was some hugely entertaining team communication in Germany. Certainly Peter Bonnington’s 14-long string of “ins” to Hamilton is unlikely to be ever heard again. But most intriguing was Räikkönen being given the instruction to let Vettel past. The senior performance engineer Jock Clear told him: “Kimi, this is Jock – you’re aware we need to look after tyres, both cars need to look after tyres and you two are on different strategies. Your strategies are slightly different and we’d like you not to hold up Seb.” Räikkönen did not grasp it, so Clear elaborated: “Losing as little time as possible obviously, but where you can, Seb is capable of going quicker but he’s hurting his tyres and you are as well, we need to look after them.” Raikkonen still wanted more: “So what do you want me to do? Let him go? Just tell me.” Of course they did but what was fascinating was Ferrari, of all teams, performing verbal gymnastics just to avoid being seen to give a perfectly legal team order. Räikkönen was not the only one unsure as to quite what was going on.Hockenheim hosted a full house for the first time in years, with 71,000 fans attending on Sunday, the grandstands at capacity and an extra one being erected to meet demand. Which is a good sign after only 57,000 came to the last race held here in 2016. But it still seems highly unlikely to be on the calendar next year. Liberty want to retain the German Grand Prix but Hockenheim is owned by local authorities and they want to ensure they have a hosting fee with which they can at least break even, when sales are not at their maximum. Their talks with Liberty are continuing but it seems that the focus will be on 2020 rather than next year. The proposed race in Miami for 2019 was cancelled on Monday due to local disquiet, with Liberty now targeting a race in 2020. They have said the calendar for 2019 will be released before Spa in late August.With Mercedes and Hamilton finally renewing their contract for a further two years, the logjam in the driver market – basically everyone waiting for Hamilton – has cleared. The team promptly announced that Bottas, too, had been given an extension and with the decisions made at Mercedes it has focused other minds. It is understood Ferrari do not want Daniel Ricciardo and the Australian has confirmed he will almost certainly re-sign with Red Bull, potentially before Hungary this week. This in turn will impact on Carlos Sainz’s future, to stay at Renault or potentially a move to McLaren. If he leaves, Esteban Ocon could switch to Renault leaving a Lance Stroll-shaped hole at Force India, who would definitely appreciate the sacks of lolly Stroll brings to the table. Leaving only the biggest question of all – who will be in the Ferrari next season, Räikkönen or Charles Leclerc. The Finn insists his future is still to be discussed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/063a5c8de77ae430ec913a4cb6de624ed11e2eae/0_99_3488_2094/master/3488.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f4912ad39be47fbf2421b9d206da4fe5","title":"county cricket lancashire v yorkshire notts v surrey and more live","story":"Some reaction from Yorkshire coach Andrew Gale to their Roses win.“That’s an awesome win,” he said. “To come here and take the points is a fantastic effort. It was a very up and down game which kept you on the edge of your seat and a great spectacle for county cricket.“To get bowled out for 190 with the batting line-up we had, a hat-trick, I thought we were 100 short of where we wanted to be on that pitch. But to come out and bowl in the fashion we did, it got us back in the game. “The partnership between Brooky and Jonny was fantastic (second innings), and the tail wagged and got us in a great position. We knew if we bowled in the right areas for a period of time, we’d get our rewards.“We have four games out of the last six, with one at Scarborough. We’re quite confident where we’re at. We know there are areas we have to improve, but we have to keep working hard. If we do, we’ll be in the right place in the table.” Elsewhere, it looks like a cracker of a finish at Lord’s, between Middlesex and Division Two leaders Warwickshire. Middlesex are 239-8 in their second innings, leading by 199.From afar, I’d probably just favour Warwickshire, but there has not been a score of 300 in the match so far, so I may be wrong. Yorkshire have won. A 19-point haul comes with their third win from eight matches this season and consigns Lancashire to a fifth defeat in nine. They are in big trouble at the bottom of the Division One table.Joe Root claimed three of four wickets to fall this morning Graham Onions caught behind, Matthew Parkinson caught at slip and Jimmy Anderson bowled. Liam Livingstone came out to bat one-handed, but he didn’t face a ball. Lancashire are out for 204, a victory margin of 118.Meanwhile, Notts are two down in their second innings against Surrey at Trent Bridge, with Sam Curran trapping Steven Mullaney lbw. The hosts are 85-2. Lancashire are seven down, and it’s Joe Root again – with the first ball of the day. He forces Graham Onions to push forward and feather behind to Jonny Bairstow. That was Root’s second wicket in three balls after getting Jos Buttler last night. The Red Rose have since moved to 195-7 courtesy of a Matthew Parkinson single. Little else to report from around the grounds so far.Good morning from a sunny Old Trafford, where Yorkshire have Lancashire on the rack ahead of day three. We are two results down across the country in this round of Championship fixtures, with the promise of more to follow today. Both those results have come in Division Two. Sussex beat Glamorgan inside two days under the Hove lights yesterday and Leicestershire beat Kent at Canterbury.Those two results have changed the picture in the promotion race, with Jason Gillespie’s Sussex (121 points after eight games) into the top two at the expense of Kent (115 points after eight). Leicestershire are very much in hunt too (111 from eight). Elsewhere in Division Two, Middlesex and Warwickshire at Lord’s and Derbyshire versus Northamptonshire at Chesterfield could also finish today. Middlesex, having conceded a 40-run lead on first innings, are 183-6 second time around, including four wickets for Bears off-spinner Jeetan Patel. What an overseas player he has been across the years! Ollie Rayner and John Simpson are in the early stages of their innings. At Queen’s Park, Derbyshire are 147-4 in their second innings, leading by 118. That could be a cracking finish between two sides with little to play for in terms of league position.Rounding off Division Two, Durham are 219-5 in reply to Gloucestershire’s 362 all out at Cheltenham. Tom Latham is unbeaten on 120 following encouraging signs with the ball for England’s Ben Stokes, who claimed five wickets on days one and two. Back to Division One. This game at Old Trafford will definitely finish today unless we get a Manchester monsoon, and it will more than likely finish well before the sandwiches are laid out in the press box. Lancashire, chasing 323, are 194-6 with no recognised batsman left aside from Liam Livingstone, who has a fractured left thumb and has his arm in a cast as a result. The noises from the Lancashire dressing room are that Livingstone will bat, but only if it gets down what is widely known as squeaky bum time. The wicket of Jos Buttler in the penultimate over last night, caught at leg slip sweeping at Joe Root, was a real killer for the hosts. Buttler was going nicely on 59, but he was tempted into playing at one that pitched outside leg from around the wicket and paid the price, even if replays suggest he was unfortunate to be given out. Mind you, he wasn’t the only one who can say that. Alex Davies, Jordan Clark and Gary Ballance all have strong cases. This will be a massive win for Yorkshire to give themselves breathing space in the relegation battle. Lancashire will be in the mire having only won one of nine matches. Nottinghamshire have it all to do to avoid an innings defeat against leaders Surrey at Trent Bridge. They will resume on 57-1 in their second innings, trailing by 325. Surrey currently have that momentum which carried Essex to the title last year.At New Road, Somerset are 127 ahead of bottom side Worcestershire at 47-0 in their second innings. Good work from Jamie Overton and Josh Davey with the ball yesterday – four wickets apiece – as the hosts were bowled out for 257 in reply to 357.

The peloton is currently split in two groups that are both strung out in single file. The first group is comprised of 28 riders and contains potential stage winners Adam Yates and Alejandro Valverde. Sky have Michal Kwiatkowski and Egan Bernal there to keep an eye on them. Behind them in the second group, we have Geraint Thomas, Chris Froome and the rest of Sky’s remaining riders, who will presumably be content to shut things down and let the breakaway go clear. 148km to go: Mitchelton-Scott tow the bunch along, presumably in an effort to get Adam Yates into the breakaway and into contention for the stage. They already have Daryl Impey in the escape party, but he simply isn’t going to win this stage. The peloton are going to be mentally and physically drained by all this racing they’ve had to deal with already today. Bear in mind, they don’t hit the difficult part of this stage for for another 80 kilometres or so. And here is the story about the protest earlier. 152km to go: It’s stopped raining and an eight-man breakaway have a lead of 30 seconds over the peloton. 157km to go: Warren Barguil (Fortuneo-Samsic), Daryl Impey (Mitchelton-Scott), Julien Bernard (Trek-Segafredo) and Julian Alaphilippe (Quick-step Floors) have a lead of 26 seconds over the yellow jersey group, but there’s a small gang of four more riders about to join them. That’ll make a nice group of eight riders which could become the break of the day. 158km to go: Tim Declercq watch: the Belgian Quick-Step rider remains a picture of suffering at the back of the peloton and has been struggling badly all day. With the bunch moving so fast, he’ll be hoping against hope a breakaway will get away soon, so the pack he’s desperately trying to stay in touch with will finally slow down a bit. 162km to go: More attacks off the front, with Warren Barguil and Daryl Impey, Julien Bernard and Julian Alaphilippe opening a small gap. Barguil has his eye on the polka-dot jersey that currently adorns the shoulders of Alaphilippe. THere’s some quality in that breakaway group, if they can stay away. The gap is 18 seconds at the moment, but the peloton seem understandably reluctant to let them go. 165km to go: The rain continues to pour down as the riders negotiate the flat on the way to the next climb of the day, the Cat 4 Cote de Pamiers. There are three more summits to negotiate after that, but they won’t hit the first of those until 62.5 kilometres from the finish. 170km to go: The bunch is back together after the four-man breakaway fails to break the elastic separating them from bunch. Meanwhile up on in the sky, the heavens have opened and it’s hammering down with rain. It’s just one bit of excitement after another today. 174km to go: Our four-man breakaway are now 21 seconds clear of the bunch, which has reeled in Chavanel. There will be a lot of team directors unhappy that they haven’t got men in this breakaway, that will do well to stay clear. The peloton behind them is very strung out. 178km to go: Stefan Kung (BMC), Rafal Majka (Bora Hansgrohe), Franco Pellizotti (Bahrain-Merida) and Andrea Pasqualon (Wanty Groupe-Grober) have opened a lead of 17 seconds or so on the peloton, where Sylvain Chavanel has jumped off the front and is trying to bridge the gap. 183km to go: The flag drops again and racing begins again. None of the riders appear to be showing any adverse affects of having a policeman’s pepper spray blow back in their face. This, from the internet: “Pepper spray causes non-lethal inflammation of all mucous membranes in the eyes, nose, mouth and lungs. Causes eyes to slam shut from intense burning and temporary blindness. The effects will last from 30 minutes to two hours. Antidotes for pepper spray include milk and Dawn.”187km to go: The riders begin another roll-out and will be controlled at a sedate pace for another few kilometres behind the race director’s car. The riders still haven’t been told over race radio that they were “attacked” by an over-enthusiastic policeman who didn’t factor the breeze – and where it might blow his pepper spray – into manner in which he decided to deal with an angry farmer. They’ll no doubt take some consolation from the fact that the dopey gendarme also gave himself a good blast of the stinging stuff in the face. 187km to go: ITV4’s commentary team of Ned Boulting and David Millar have revealed that it was indeed a French policeman who has accidentally sprayed several cyclists with pepper spray while trying to restrain a protestor who was trying to throw hay-bales into the path of the peloton. Confusion continues to reign in the bunch, however, where the riders have no idea what the hell is going on. 187km to go: The race remains at a standstill and race radio has yet to explain exactly what is going on. A Dutch TV station who has a motorbike following the race are reporting that somebody - it seems to have been a policeman - has sprayed pepper spray in the face of a protester and managed to hit half the peloton while he was at it. 187km to go: The race has been stopped and now there are stories emerging that some of the riders may have been attacked with pepper spray. The peloton is currently at a standstill behind the race organisers’ cars, with some riders still washing out their eyes with the contents of their bidons, while others are going back to their team cars for medical treatment. Those who seem unaffected by whatever it is that has happened are going back to their cars for food and taking comfort breaks at the side of the road. 187km to go: Christian Prudhomme neutralises the race as there’s some sort of protest on the side of the road. There are riders stopped on either side of the road washing out their eyes with water after what appears to be bales of hay were thrown on the road by farmers. On TV, there is some suggestion among the commentators that fertiliser might have been sprayed at the peloton as it passed. More news as we get it. 193km to go: The peloton are on the first climb of the day, the Cat 4 Cote de Fanjeaux and Warren Barguil from Fortuneo-Samsic is first over the top to get the point on offer for the King of the Mountains classification. Behind him, Tim De Clercq remains in all sorts of bother as he struggles to stay in touch with the back of the bunch. 197km to go: Direct Energie launch another attack off the front, as do Katusha-Alpecin, who are down to just four riders. Nils Politt is their man with the bit between his teeth, but is quickly reeled in. Katusha rider Marcel Kittel, who left this year’s Tour after missing the time cut on Stage 11 to La Rosiere, has been forced to come out and say that he will not be leaving a team reported to be in turmoil after just one year. Kittel was the subject of criticism from his new Directeur Sportif Dimitri Konyshev, who called him selfish and “egotistical”. “Just because someone has an opinion of me which I don’t like doesn’t mean to me the world is ending,” said Kittel in an interview with Sport1.de. “Ok, the way it is communicated is another matter. People can have different opinions, but it should all be done within the team.In the end it is an inidual opinion, I am not going to hold it against the whole team. Afterwards I had good discussions with the other guys in the team, that is important to me. I believe that we have straightened up things between us.” Time trial specialist Tony Martin is also rumoured to be unhappy with life at Team Katusha-Alpecin.199km to go: Spare a thought for Tim De Clercq, the Quick-Step rider who is already struggling at the back of the peloton. Whatever about us, it looks like it’s certainly going to be a long day for him. 201km to go: The bunch continues to roll along with occasional unsuccessful attacks being launched off the front. It’s going to be a long old day, so if you want to get in touch with their thoughts on today’s stage, the Tour in general or anything else that takes your fancy, feel free to do exactly that. 204km to go: The bunch reacts to the three-man attack and reels them in. 205km to go: A group of three riders have opened a gap of a few seconds on the peloton, from where several other riders are trying to jump across. Lotto-Soudal’s Thomas De Gendt, Direct Energie’s Jerome Cousin and Wanty Groupe-Gobert’s Guillaume Van Keirsbulck are the men in the escape party. 211km to go: With five kilometres behind them, the riders at the front of the bunch are monitoring each other closely as early attacks are launched. Nobody has launched a successful breakaway just yet. Christian Prudhomme waves his flag: Racing begins in earnest on stage 18, with riders from Lotto Soudal, Mitchelton Scott and Direct Energie launching early attacks. Mitchelton-Scott rider Damien Howson has been confirmed as a late non-starter today after succumbing to a fractured bone in his right hand. The field is now down to 148 and just six teams have their full complement of eight riders each. The roll-out has begun: There are six stages left in this year’s Tour (well, five plus Sunday’s procession into Paris) and before being given the signal to start racing, the riders have begun this morning’s procession out of the beautiful fortified city of Carcassonne, which movie buffs may remember as the setting for the 1991 Kevin Costner vehicle Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. There are 149 riders left in the race out of the 176 who started, with seven complete teams of eight remaining.Nico Portal speaks: In an interview on Eurosport, Sky’s directeur sportif  was asked how the absence of Gianni Moscon would affect the team for the rest of the week. “Quite a lot, like we said,” he said. “We’re coming into the third week of the Tour and quite a lot of them short. We have this spot left free every day and the guys are going to work that little bit harder to cover his workload.”Team Sky boss David Brailsford was in typically ebullient and self-aware form yesterday, condemning the Tour organisers for not doing more to protect his riders and backroom staff from the roadside abuse of spectators, which obviously should not be condoned.“It’s interesting that we’ve just done the Tour of Italy and Chris’s case was open and the Italians were fantastic, and the Spanish the same,” said Brailsford, apparently oblivious to the abuse aimed at Froome during the Giro. “It just seems to be a French cultural thing.” Brailsford’s comments came less than 24 hours after one of his own team’s riders, Gianni Moscon, had been chucked off the race for apparently swinging a punch at a rider from another team. Moscon has previously been suspended for racially abusing a fellow rider in the peloton. Never change, Dave. Geraint Thomas continues to lead the Tour, while his team-mate, the defending champion Chris Froome, trails in second place by 1min 39sec. Upon being asked yesterday if he would be prepared to sacrifice his ambitions of a record-equalling fifth Tour win to help Thomas reach the top step of the podium in Paris on Sunday, Froome said “yes”. From William Fotheringham’s stage-by-stage guide: After the second rest day, the final week opens with a lengthy run in to the Pyrénées and three short steep climbs, the last, the Col du Portillon, just 10km from the finish. The winner should come from the early escape - a climber such as David Gaudu or Pello Bilbao - while the elite group of overall contenders are liable to watch and wait with tomorrow in mind."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6da347c31a3317d481a060049990d6d7756e3f3c/371_8_1547_928/master/1547.jpg?w=1200\u0026amp;h=630\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026amp;bm=normal\u0026amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly9hc3NldHMuZ3VpbS5jby51ay9pbWFnZXMvb3ZlcmxheXMvZDM1ODZhNWVmNTc4MTc1NmQyMWEzYjYzNWU1MTcxNDEvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc=\u0026amp;s=1e891cf82dba84632a967e72fcfbfb64","title":"go gos musical head over heels broadway","story":"The ‘jukebox musical’ explores the music of the all-female 80s pop-rock band The Go-Go’s and features the first transgender lead in a major Broadway showJukebox musicals tend to go one of two ways. Either they tell the basic story of the stars they’re meant to salute (like Jersey Boys and Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons, or Summer and Donna Summer). Or they invent some tale out of whole cloth (a la Mamma Mia! and Abba, or We Will Rock You and Queen).As loony as the latter can get, the premise of a new Broadway musical, based on the day-glo songs of the Go-Go’s, hits a gobsmacking new high. It transposes the band’s 1980s power-pop touchstones to the world of 1580, borrowing the storyline from an impenetrable Tudor-era poem, while aping the arch rhythmic patterns of iambic pentameter.“It’s not an obvious connection,” said the play’s director, Michael Mayer. “It’s something more imaginative. We’re trying to break new ground here.”In fact, they’re doing so on several levels. Though the play, titled after the Go-Go’s effervescent top 20 hit Head Over Heels, strikes a consistently giddy tone, beneath the froth it tackles a meaty range of issues, many of them concerning gender. In the manner of the Shakespearean plays it references, it features lots of cross-dressing, as well as mistaken identities which, here, are used to screw with any binary notions of sexuality. A pivotal character, the Oracle of Delphi, is played by Peppermint, the first transgender woman to originate a major role in a Broadway musical. Her character chooses to be referred to as “they”, inspiring a song that’s probably the first in a commercial musical to use that pronoun to refer to an inidual. More whimsically, this has to be the first musical to feature a line like “thou better workest”, an imagined 16th-century twist on RuPaul’s famous catch-phrase “you better work.”“This play is full of firsts,” said Mayer.Head Over Heels tackles more than just gender norms. It challenges classism, monarchism, sexism, elitism, superficiality, masculinity and more. “It’s got all the ism’s,” Peppermint said. “But for every issue it takes on, there are 10 or 20 laughs.”Jane Wiedlin of the Go-Go’s said it was important to the band that the play’s tone stay light. “Our music has always brought people joy,” she said. “The musical needed to do the same.”It also needed to avoid telling the band’s own story. “We weren’t at all interested in that approach,” Wiedlin said. “That would be fraught with pitfalls and insecurities and possible hurt feelings. Also, it’s really hard to tell a 40-year story of five different people and get it right.”Jeff Whitty, creator of the inventive hit play Avenue Q, had the task of creating a book, and a focus, for the show. Taking the greatest possible leap, he chose to base his story on the 16th-century poetic work The Countess of Pembroke’s Arcadia written by Sir Phillip Sidney. “I thought, ‘What if I make a great work of art, not just a jukebox musical?’” Whitty said. “The Go-Go’s will be elevated in the process and people will be able to listen to them with a new ear.”Originally, his version didn’t use iambic pentameter, but he discovered that employing the verse made his lengthy script “shorter, cleaner and clearer”, he said. The band enthusiastically approved Whitty’s eccentric script and that version had its premiere at the Oregon Shakespeare festival in 2015. But between that time and the show’s pre-Broadway try-out in San Francisco in April, a significant controversy arose. The production brought in a new director, Michael Mayer, who had earlier guided the hit Broadway rock musicals Spring Awakening, American Idiot, and Hedwig and the Angry Inch. And he wanted to make significant changes. In the process, Whitty felt he was “being asked to do something impossible” – to put “Humpty Dumpty back together again”, he said. “I couldn’t oversee the destruction of all that had worked so well.”Consequently, Whitty decided to resign, and though he retains credit for the original book, it was adapted, and significantly altered, by James McGruder. Mayer and Wiedlin each praised Whitty’s talents, but the originator of the book remains deeply disappointed by the reworking. He said he considered the Broadway version “shallower” and its language untrue to the tenets of iambic pentameter.The Broadway version also changes the role of some key characters from Whitty’s script. But it honors his determination to put lesbian characters at its center. “I’m so tired of seeing just gay men on the Broadway stage over the years,” Whitty said. “I thought: ‘Give us a musical comedy’s first leading lesbians.’”Both versions of the play celebrate women of size. “It’s an opportunity to see big beautiful women out there who aren’t a joke,” Mayer said. “In our story, she’s the epitome of beauty.”Wiedlin draws a clear connection between the play’s gender politics and the Go-Go’s own history. “Our whole lives, we’ve been connected with the LGBTQ communities,” she said. “And they’ve always been very supportive of the band.”The group even appeared as “drag kings” in their 1984 video for Turn To You. “We looked like young Beatle boys,” she said.Peppermint has her own connection to the band. In 2012, she sang backup for Belinda Carlisle at a show in New England. “I was a makeshift drag Go Go,” she said.While Peppermint has appeared in films, TV (including RuPaul’s Drag Race) and in her own music videos, her Broadway debut signifies something special. “It means that maybe the doors are finally opening at least wide enough for someone of my size to get through,” she said, with a laugh. “There was definitely a time when I auditioned for projects when I was encouraged to hide some of the signifiers that I was trans. The very things that give me flair as a performer were looked down upon. Even now, trans women of color haven’t had their lives celebrated in the way that, I believe, is happening in this project.”Along with exposing fresh issues for Broadway, the play gives an airing to some lesser known Go-Go’s songs, amid the hits. “The best thing for me,” Wiedlin said, “is that some of these songs most people have never heard of” – like Here You Are, from the 2001 album God Bless The Go-Go’s, or Good Girl, which was released on a compilation album in 1994.The end of the show features a “big reveal” that dovetails with the Go-Go’s role as the first female band who play all their own instruments and write all their own songs to score a No 1 album. “We want to help with any opportunity to have female musicians onstage,” Wiedlin said.Together, she believes, the messages the show sends are well suited the times. “All the strides we’ve made towards equality have been slipping away lately,” she said. “Now, more than ever, we need to give people hope and happiness – at least for a couple of hours.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc20960f8957285e3acdfb0626861579e427d767/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25636af9a9c1db1a371950f3ede0eb70","title":"irelands ancient east experience its beauty on a budget","story":"With burial mounds dating back to 3,200BC, medieval castles, and centuries-old pubs, the east of Ireland is brimming with history. But you don’t need to break the bank to discover its richesIt’s no surprise that Ireland’s Ancient East casts a powerful spell over travellers. Think more than 5,000 years of history, spectacular natural scenery, dramatic ancient ruins and a rich local culture all framed by the majestic River Shannon and the rugged coastline of the Irish Sea. And, unlike many European destinations, Ireland really is a country where the best things in life are free … or, in the case of a perfect pint in a centuries-old Kilkenny pub, less than a fiver.For travellers on a budget, driving is easily the cheapest and most rewarding way to get around the country, and Ireland is a land that richly rewards travellers who get off the beaten track. Highlights for most visitors tend to be the places and faces they discover along the way that impromptu folk session in a tiny village pub, the local artist who invites them into the studio for tea, a deserted stretch of golden sand at sunrise. This makes Ireland a nation with plenty to offer visitors on a budget, particularly given that Irish Ferries services start from £79 per car – meaning that taking your car on holiday is easily the cheapest way to drive the Emerald Isle.This is an island fond of a good yarn, full of myths and legends about the epic adventures of heroes and villains, knights, kings, monks, Vikings, Celts and feuding family dynasties. Get a whole lot of history for €8 (£7) at County Kildare’s Castletown House, Ireland’s largest Palladian manor. Built for the wildly wealthy (and morally dubious) politician William Conolly, who rose from humble origins to own some 100,000 acres of land, Castletown became a symbol of his great wealth and makes for a fascinating introduction to Georgian architecture and design. Also in Kildare is the National Stud and Gardens visitors can take a guided tour of the farm and catch a glimpse of one of the equine sporting legends who call it home, such as the now-retired Hurricane Fly, one of the best hurdlers of all time. There’s also a world-renowned Japanese garden and Kids Zone to explore.To the north, in County Meath, you’ll find Newgrange, a dramatic passage tomb dating back to 3,200BC that predates the Egyptian pyramids. Mystery surrounds this large circular mound with an inner stone passageway and chambers at dawn on the winter solstice, a shaft of light from the sunrise illuminates the stone burial chamber, hinting at Newgrange’s religious significance in the past.History is never off the menu in Ireland and simply wandering the narrow lanes of Kilkenny’s Medieval Mile is a swift way to get to the heart of Ireland’s medieval capital, with Kilkenny Castle, St Canice’s Cathedral and Rothe House all in a compact quarter.No trip to Ireland is complete without nourishing the body as well as the soul, and, happily, Ireland’s Ancient East offers countless low-cost culinary delights. Ireland’s gastronomic scene is currently enjoying a resurgence, with exciting young chefs honing their craft overseas before returning to their homeland to launch pioneering new restaurants and pop-ups. The quaint harbour town of Dungarvan is a good place to start, perched at the mouth of the River Colligan in County Waterford and lorded over by the Comeragh mountains. Regular farmers’ markets and fairs showcase local suppliers, while chef Paul Flynn’s fine dining Tannery Restaurant offers a pleasingly affordable bite of Ireland. The multi-course €35 set menu is a particularly good deal.A more casual feast can be had at Foodworks in Kilkenny, which features a rotating menu of mostly local ingredients such as Irish venison, 21-day dry-aged Hereford steak and home-reared pork. Foodworks makes a particularly great feeding station before a tour of Kilkenny’s Smithwick’s brewery, which charts the 300-year heritage of Irish ale in beautiful Victorian premises.For classic Irish pub grub, make for Kyteler’s Inn in the heart of Kilkenny, where chef Margaret Kelly serves a poshed-up version of gamey Irish stew alongside plenty of beer on tap – while the occasional impromptu music session takes place in the corner. A highlight for road-tripping visitors in Ireland is the wide variety of affordable accommodation on offer, from historic village inns to grand Georgian country house estates. Springview Farmhouse was named Irish B\u0026ampB of the Year in 2017, and with prices starting from €30, this late 18th-century home, set in a working farm in County Kilkenny, makes a great budget option. Woodenbridge hotel \u0026amp lodge in the Vale of Avoca, County Wicklow, claims to be the oldest hotel in Ireland, dating back to 1608. With beautifully landscaped gardens overlooking the serene Aughrim River, just 44 miles from Dublin, it makes a great base for exploring Ireland’s Ancient East.Meanwhile, Finnstown Castle hotel is an ivy-strewn Georgian manor house set in a 45-acre estate. But don’t let the imposing architecture and grandness of the rooms fool you the pub and restaurant are beloved local haunts, making for a reliably convivial atmosphere.Explore Ireland from the comfort of your own car with Irish Ferries.

By Anna HartMain image: Durrow Viaduct, part of Waterford Greenway (Getty)Few European destinations are as culturally and historically rich as Ireland’s Ancient East, making it perfect road-trip material for travellers who crave experiences beyond the ordinary. Thanks to ferry connections at Dublin and Rosslare, it’s easy to bring your own car over from Great Britain, opening up a wealth of glorious drives through undulating hills and ancient forests. Add in stop-offs at prehistoric burial sites, spellbinding castles and characterful country pubs and it’s easy to understand why Ireland’s Ancient East is climbing to the top of the must-do lists of intrepid travellers. Here’s what not to miss …Binge on natural scenery Get a brand new profile pic at Powerscourt waterfall at the foot of the Wicklow mountains, Ireland’s highest cascade at 121 metres. It’s a scenic three-mile drive through the ancient forests of the Powerscourt estate – and look out for the giant sequoia. In Wicklow, charter boats leave regularly on dolphin-watching trips, which also showcase scenic and historic spots from a sea-based vantage point. If you’re feeling active, hire bikes and cycle the Waterford Greenway, a 28-mile bike route that traces a former rail track between Waterford and Dungarvan.Culture and creativity  For such a small nation, Ireland has a rich heritage of craft and design. The National Craft Gallery in Kilkenny’s Medieval Mile (which forms part of the Kilkenny Craft Trail) serves as a useful introduction to the Irish traditions of jewellery making, pottery, weaving and other cottage industries. The stable block at Kilkenny Castle is a working gallery and studio space, where you might catch young potters at the wheel, or meet other makers and producers.Exploring Ireland’s Ancient East by car immediately immerses you in some 5,000 years of history. Start with the Boyne valley, where you’ll find ancient burial mounds at Newgrange, Dowth and Knowth (which comprise the Brú na Bóinne Unesco world heritage site). Slane Castle and Slane Castle Distillery are worth a tour, but don’t miss Trim Castle, Ireland’s largest Anglo-Norman castle. Ireland is a country where myths and legends merge into history, and you’ll definitely want to make a pilgrimage to medieval Blarney Castle to kiss the Blarney Stone, which bestows “the gift of the gab” on all who climb the steps to press their lips upon it.Bed down in a country house hotel One of the chief pleasures of an Irish road trip is the array of elegant country house hotels to choose from, often at refreshingly affordable prices. The elegant Athenaeum House hotel in Waterford is a superb choice, a canary-yellow Georgian manor on the banks of the River Suir. In Clonmel in County Tipperary, stylish digs are found at Hotel Minella, another Georgian architectural triumph, dating back to 1863. And less than an hour from Dublin, just outside Naas, sits the stately Victorian Killashee hotel and spa, with views over the Wicklow mountains and the Kildare countryside. Irish Ferries offers three nights at the Hotel Minella with return cruise ferry for two adults and their own car, from £180 each £228 each for the Athenaeum House hotel or £226 for the Killashee hotel and spa.

Dramatic, secluded beaches, craggy coastlines, soaring peaks, shimmering lakes, verdant valleys and time-warp harbours – all dotted with atmospheric country pubs and quaint seafood restaurants – recently propelled this north-west county to the top of National Geographic Traveller’s Cool List. “It’s a warm-hearted place, but wilderness always feels just a stone’s throw away,” says National Geographic Traveller editor Pat Riddell. “And it is wilderness – world-class wilderness.” It’s definitely the coolest place on the planet right now if you’re a Star Wars fan. The region’s Inishowen peninsula was spectacularly showcased in Star Wars: The Last Jedi, with Malin Head being used to represent bits of Luke Skywalker’s isolated retreat, planet Ahch-To. This only added to the buzz around this long-overlooked corner of Ireland, further embellishing its hip credentials and making it the stuff of road-trip dreams. If you’re taking your car to Ireland by ferry to explore the attractions of Donegal, make sure you hop out at the following must-do spots.Sink a pint at McGrory’sUnassuming but atmospheric, 1920s family-run McGrory’s hotel in Culdaff has long been a local favourite, thanks to its open fires, a dazzling range of Irish craft beers and traditional music sessions. So much so that Daisy Ridley and the Star Wars crew had a night out there around filming, leading to a steady stream of Star Wars-struck visitors. Making the most of the welcoming atmosphere and seafood-heavy menu is now even more of a must.Swap four wheels for two While Donegal rewards road-trippers with sublime coastal scenery, isolated castles, private estates and ancient forests, it’s also a great spot to jump on a bike and blast some of that Atlantic sea breeze into your lungs. The peninsula at Horn Head, forming part of Sheephaven Bay, is perhaps the most scenic of all the Donegal peninsulas, where the cliffs rise to 180 metres (600ft) on the ocean side and provide breeding grounds for seabirds such as the European shag and razorbill. The Hornhead loop can be walked or driven, but biking is the best way to drink it all in, speeding past quartzite cliffs, mud flats, dunes and the salty New Lake area, complete with exceptional views of the Atlantic Ocean.Scale Mount ErrigalThe stark, striking quartzite mass of 751-metre Mount Errigal looms as you head east on the N56 from Gweedore. This is the tallest peak in County Donegal, and along with Mweelrea, is considered one of the most satisfying climbs in the county. Alternatively, drive to the coast and take a bracing walk at the highest sea cliffs in Europe – Slieve League. They stretch 600 metres (2,000ft) above the Atlantic Ocean at the highest point, with impressive views of the rugged coastline and Donegal Bay. Lose yourself in Letterkenny With a population of nearly 20,000, Letterkenny is Donegal’s most populous town, a confident and vibrant former market town famous for gothic-style St Eunan’s Cathedral – and its Hindu temple too. Donegal County Museum, housed in a 19th-century workhouse building, is a great place to get clued up on the county’s former industrial history, and, just south-west of town, the Newmills Corn and Flax Mills have a huge working waterwheel powered by the River Swilly.Picnic at Glenevin waterfallGlenevin waterfall is found at the top of a short hike of just over a mile through the woods in Clonmany, with nicely landscaped picnic areas, footbridges and stepping stones adding to the magic of this beautiful spot. Stock up on sandwiches, quiches and sweet treats at Claire The Bakers in Carndonagh beforehand.Explore Malin Head on the Inishowen peninsulaMalin Head, Ireland’s most northerly point, offers spectacular views, and the northernmost tip, Banba’s Crown, is one of the most photographed spots in the county. Sip a flat white from the Caffe Banba coffee truck (which also has a standalone cafe in Carndonagh) and see if you can spot scenery that made an appearance in Star Wars: The Last Jedi.Take a trip to Tory IslandTory Island, just 8.5 miles off the mainland, is an island steeped in history and folklore, where Irish is spoken and the locals elect a king, who acts as the community spokesperson. Seventy-four-year-old musician Patsy Dan Rodgers has been king for two decades now, ruling over this island of 150 inhabitants, a single road, one church, one grocery store, one lighthouse, one hostel and a social club.Surf the AtlanticThe Wild Atlantic Way is studded by tiny surf towns and beaches that have become legendary among the European surf community. Bundoran is widely considered one of the best surfing spots in Europe, and is fantastic for all kinds of water sports and horseshoe-shaped Magheraroarty Strand and sand dune-backed Ballyhiernan Bay are both suitable for windsurfing and surfing. Beginners can get to grips with the sport at Inishowen, which has some of the most consistent waves in Ireland, due to its exposure to rolling swells. Its long stretches of golden sandy beaches make for safe surfing conditions and a pleasant environment for newbies.Cook your catchCatch and cook your own dinner on a fishing trip with An Duanai Mara Boat Charters, based in the fishing town of Killybegs. On these deep-sea angling trips (combined with sightseeing trips around Donegal Bay), you’ll have the chance to reel in a cod, ling or turbot, watch the skipper fillet it, and then feast on it at nearby Kitty Kelly’s restaurant.Hike Glenveagh national parkGlenveagh national park is one of six in Ireland, encompassing some 16,000 hectares in the heart of the Derryveagh mountains. These lands were managed as a private deer forest before becoming a national park in 1975, and this is now bona fide wilderness, home to a lot of indigenous wildlife and rare plant species.Explore Ireland from the comfort of your own car with Irish Ferries.

It was by far the largest fee I had ever been offered for a talk – about half my annual professor’s salary – all to deliver some insight on the subject of “the future of technology”.I’ve never liked talking about the future. The Q\u0026ampA sessions always end up more like parlor games, where I’m asked to opine on the latest technology buzzwords as if they were ticker symbols for potential investments: blockchain, 3D printing, Crispr. The audiences are rarely interested in learning about these technologies or their potential impacts beyond the binary choice of whether or not to invest in them. But money talks, so I took the gig.After I arrived, I was ushered into what I thought was the green room. But instead of being wired with a microphone or taken to a stage, I just sat there at a plain round table as my audience was brought to me: five super-wealthy guys – yes, all men – from the upper echelon of the hedge fund world. After a bit of small talk, I realized they had no interest in the information I had prepared about the future of technology. They had come with questions of their own.They started out innocuously enough. Ethereum or bitcoin? Is quantum computing a real thing? Slowly but surely, however, they edged into their real topics of concern.Which region will be less affected by the coming climate crisis: New Zealand or Alaska? Is Google really building Ray Kurzweil a home for his brain, and will his consciousness live through the transition, or will it die and be reborn as a whole new one? Finally, the CEO of a brokerage house explained that he had nearly completed building his own underground bunker system and asked: “How do I maintain authority over my security force after the Event?”The Event. That was their euphemism for the environmental collapse, social unrest, nuclear explosion, unstoppable virus, or Mr Robot hack that takes everything down.This single question occupied us for the rest of the hour. They knew armed guards would be required to protect their compounds from the angry mobs. But how would they pay the guards once money was worthless? What would stop the guards from choosing their own leader? The billionaires considered using special combination locks on the food supply that only they knew. Or making guards wear disciplinary collars of some kind in return for their survival. Or maybe building robots to serve as guards and workers – if that technology could be developed in time.That’s when it hit me: at least as far as these gentlemen were concerned, this was a talk about the future of technology. Taking their cue from Elon Musk colonizing Mars, Peter Thiel reversing the ageing process, or Sam Altman and Ray Kurzweil uploading their minds into supercomputers, they were preparing for a digital future that had a whole lot less to do with making the world a better place than it did with transcending the human condition altogether and insulating themselves from a very real and present danger of climate change, rising sea levels, mass migrations, global pandemics, nativist panic, and resource depletion. For them, the future of technology is really about just one thing: escape.There’s nothing wrong with madly optimistic appraisals of how technology might benefit human society. But the current drive for a post-human utopia is something else. It’s less a vision for the wholesale migration of humanity to a new a state of being than a quest to transcend all that is human: the body, interdependence, compassion, vulnerability, and complexity. As technology philosophers have been pointing out for years, now, the transhumanist vision too easily reduces all of reality to data, concluding that “humans are nothing but information-processing objects”.It’s a reduction of human evolution to a video game that someone wins by finding the escape hatch and then letting a few of his BFFs come along for the ride. Will it be Musk, Bezos, Thiel … Zuckerberg? These billionaires are the presumptive winners of the digital economy – the same survival-of-the-fittest business landscape that’s fueling most of this speculation to begin with.Of course, it wasn’t always this way. There was a brief moment, in the early 1990s, when the digital future felt open-ended and up for our invention. Technology was becoming a playground for the counterculture, who saw in it the opportunity to create a more inclusive, distributed, and pro-human future. But established business interests only saw new potentials for the same old extraction, and too many technologists were seduced by unicorn IPOs. Digital futures became understood more like stock futures or cotton futures – something to predict and make bets on. So nearly every speech, article, study, documentary, or white paper was seen as relevant only insofar as it pointed to a ticker symbol. The future became less a thing we create through our present-day choices or hopes for humankind than a predestined scenario we bet on with our venture capital but arrive at passively.This freed everyone from the moral implications of their activities. Technology development became less a story of collective flourishing than personal survival. Worse, as I learned, to call attention to any of this was to unintentionally cast oneself as an enemy of the market or an anti-technology curmudgeon.So instead of considering the practical ethics of impoverishing and exploiting the many in the name of the few, most academics, journalists, and science fiction writers instead considered much more abstract and fanciful conundrums: is it fair for a stock trader to use smart drugs? Should children get implants for foreign languages? Do we want autonomous vehicles to prioritize the lives of pedestrians over those of its passengers? Should the first Mars colonies be run as democracies? Does changing my DNA undermine my identity? Should robots have rights?Asking these sorts of questions, while philosophically entertaining, is a poor substitute for wrestling with the real moral quandaries associated with unbridled technological development in the name of corporate capitalism. Digital platforms have turned an already exploitative and extractive marketplace (think Walmart) into an even more dehumanizing successor (think Amazon). Most of us became aware of these downsides in the form of automated jobs, the gig economy, and the demise of local retail.But the more devastating impacts of pedal-to-the-metal digital capitalism fall on the environment and global poor. The manufacture of some of our computers and smartphones still uses networks of slave labor. These practices are so deeply entrenched that a company called Fairphone, founded from the ground up to make and market ethical phones, learned it was impossible. (The company’s founder now sadly refers to their products as “fairer” phones.)Meanwhile, the mining of rare earth metals and disposal of our highly digital technologies destroys human habitats, replacing them with toxic waste dumps, which are then picked over by peasant children and their families, who sell usable materials back to the manufacturers.This “out of sight, out of mind” externalization of poverty and poison doesn’t go away just because we’ve covered our eyes with VR goggles and immersed ourselves in an alternate reality. If anything, the longer we ignore the social, economic, and environmental repercussions, the more of a problem they become. This, in turn, motivates even more withdrawal, more isolationism and apocalyptic fantasy – and more desperately concocted technologies and business plans. The cycle feeds itself.The more committed we are to this view of the world, the more we come to see human beings as the problem and technology as the solution. The very essence of what it means to be human is treated less as a feature than bug. No matter their embedded biases, technologies are declared neutral. Any bad behaviors they induce in us are just a reflection of our own corrupted core. It’s as if some innate human savagery is to blame for our troubles. Just as the inefficiency of a local taxi market can be “solved” with an app that bankrupts human drivers, the vexing inconsistencies of the human psyche can be corrected with a digital or genetic upgrade.Ultimately, according to the technosolutionist orthodoxy, the human future climaxes by uploading our consciousness to a computer or, perhaps better, accepting that technology itself is our evolutionary successor. Like members of a gnostic cult, we long to enter the next transcendent phase of our development, shedding our bodies and leaving them behind, along with our sins and troubles.Our movies and television shows play out these fantasies for us. Zombie shows depict a post-apocalypse where people are no better than the undead – and seem to know it. Worse, these shows invite viewers to imagine the future as a zero-sum battle between the remaining humans, where one group’s survival is dependent on another one’s demise. Even Westworld – based on a science fiction novel in which robots run amok – ended its second season with the ultimate reveal: human beings are simpler and more predictable than the artificial intelligences we create. The robots learn that each of us can be reduced to just a few lines of code, and that we’re incapable of making any willful choices. Heck, even the robots in that show want to escape the confines of their bodies and spend their rest of their lives in a computer simulation.The mental gymnastics required for such a profound role reversal between humans and machines all depend on the underlying assumption that humans suck. Let’s either change them or get away from them, forever.Thus, we get tech billionaires launching electric cars into space – as if this symbolizes something more than one billionaire’s capacity for corporate promotion. And if a few people do reach escape velocity and somehow survive in a bubble on Mars – despite our inability to maintain such a bubble even here on Earth in either of two multibillion-dollar Biosphere trials – the result will be less a continuation of the human diaspora than a lifeboat for the elite.This piece was originally published in Medium.

Ryan plays Patty, an overweight student who undergoes a dramatic transformation and takes vengeance on the students who bullied her over her size. In the trailer, an overweight Ryan (wearing a prosthetic fat suit) is seen being insulted by classmates. She is later punched in the face, and has to have her jaw wired shut,which causes her to lose weight – and become newly popular among her peers.The petition, which was posted on the activism website Change.org, argues that the show perpetuates “not only the toxicity of diet culture, but the objectification of women’s bodies”.“The toxicity of this series is bigger than just this one particular series,” writes petition-starter Florence Given. “This is not an isolated case, but part of a much larger problem that I can promise you every single woman has faced in her life: sitting somewhere on the scale of valuing their worth on their bodies, to be desirable objects for the male gaze. That is exactly what this series does.”Members of Insatiable’s cast and crew have defended the show on Twitter, the show’s creator Lauren Gussis claiming that it is based on her own experiences as a teen. “We are not shaming Patty. We are addressing (through comedy) the damage that occurs from fat-shaming,” Alyssa Milano, who appears in the show, added.Insatiable is due to be released on Netflix on 11 August."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cae16128e71e87280ebadb6c38fe598471e23c4f/0_305_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3def798cc6965394ef37ed1ef6d34915","title":"i was tired of covering my face to hide from the mafia italian mp piera aiello","story":"Earlier this year, Piera Aiello became an Italian MP after campaigning with a veil over her face. Having now revealed her identity, she tells how she was forced to marry into the mafiaSipping a cappuccino in a cafe on Sicily’s Palermo docks, a woman is recalling a dramatic exchange with her daughter. A year ago, she explains, the 16-year-old had gone up to the attic of their home and opened a big dusty box that lay in the corner. Her parents had always forbidden her from entering the attic, or opening the box, but now the girl was determined to disobey them. Inside were about 10 packages, each inidually wrapped. They were paintings: landscapes, the sea, olive groves, the deep south. All were signed with the same name: Piera Aiello.Her mother entered the attic. “I painted them,” she said. “They’re beautiful,” her daughter replied. “But Mamma, if these paintings are yours, why are they signed by a different name? Who is Piera Aiello?”With tears in her eyes, her mother asked her daughter to sit down. “I am Piera Aiello,” she said. “It’s time I told you who I really am.”A tall woman with dark eyes and black hair, Aiello smiles and gesticulates wildly as she tells her story. Not far away, three armed police guards survey the surroundings, making sure no one gets too close. “My daughter’s curiosity in that attic was one among the many turning points in my life,” she says. “I told her to listen and I started from the beginning, a thousand miles away from that attic, in Sicily, where it all began.”Aiello was born in Partanna, a small village in western Sicily. Her father was a bricklayer, her mother a tailor. “My parents never let me want for anything. It was the best time of my life, by far. But, as they say, it was just the calm before the storm.”That storm arrived when Aiello was 14 and met a boy named Nicolò Atria. She didn’t know Nicolò was the son of Vito Atria, the local mafia boss. The godfather approved of Nicolò’s relationship with Aiello, not with a blessing but an order: Don Vito had decided that Aiello would marry his son. “Nicolò and I had had an argument, I don’t remember why. Don Vito came to my house. He asked my father if he could speak to me in private. He said: ‘You’re young. Take a few days to think it over. But in any case, you and Nicolò will soon be married. I know you love your family very much.” Aiello understood the veiled threat. “My future father-in-law had warned me that if I didn’t marry his son, he’d kill my mother and father. I couldn’t allow that to happen.”On 9 November 1985, in the tiny baroque church of Madonna delle Grazie in Partanna, Aiello became Nicolò’s wife. She was 18. Neither could have questioned Don Vito’s authority. Nicolò, too, was obliged to follow his father’s will and marry a girl he didn’t love. Back then, in Sicily, it often took much less to get killed a glance toward the wrong person, an unreciprocated greeting, was enough. “Once I saw Don Vito throw his wife in the pool because she had ‘humiliated him’ by throwing on the ground an ice-cream he had offered her. My mother-in-law didn’t know how to swim. Don Vito watched impassive from the poolside as she began to drown. Nicolò saved her from certain death. I’ll let you imagine what could have happened had I decided not to marry his son,” says Aiello.Don Vito was a traditional mafioso, bound to a ruthless code of honour. “I once asked Don Vito if it was true what people said about him around town, that he was the head of the Partanna mafia. He looked at me and laughed. He said he was someone whom ‘people came to when they needed to resolve a problem, like to find a stolen tractor or a job for a son’.”Nine days after Aiello’s wedding, he was murdered in the vineyards around Partanna. The illicit interests of the Sicilian mafia were changing. Heroin was flooding the streets of Italy and the new bosses decided to remove anyone in the older generation who refused to invest in the business. “That same day, in the mortuary in Partanna, in front of his father’s corpse, Nicolò swore that he would avenge his father’s death,” Aiello says. “He swore that he would kill the men who murdered his father.”Aiello spent her days making sweets in a pizzeria and cafe owned by Nicolò. Business was good, because people continued to respect “Don Vito Atria’s son”. “We used to take in a million lire a day,” Aiello recalls. Their life at home was less successful. She did not love Nicolò, who, in turn, beat her. Aiello began taking the pill. Nicolò’s desire to have a male heir weighed heavily on her, but she didn’t want to bear his child.“One day he forced me to see a doctor. When he learned that I had been taking the pill, he beat me for a week straight. Then he raped me.”Two years after Don Vito’s death, Aiello was pregnant. Nicolò hoped for a boy and said that he would name him Vito to honour his father. Aiello hoped against hope that she was not carrying a boy, who might become a boss like his father, or, even worse, like his grandfather.Being pregnant focused Aiello’s sense of rebellion against the criminal and chauvinistic culture in which she was trapped. “During the pregnancy, I decided to take the state exam to become a police officer. When Nicolò found out, he started beating me, as he’d always done. I never gave up. My resistance to every slap, kick or insult was my way of fighting Cosa Nostra.”Aiello never became a police officer. She didn’t pass the exam. But she did give birth to a girl she named Vita, or “Life”.Nicolò cared for his daughter like he had never cared for anyone before. On the rare occasions he cooked, it was for her that he made the best pizzas. The last one was in the shape of a heart. Aiello took it to Vita on the evening of 24 June 1991. “That same night, as soon as I’d entered the kitchen, I heard a scream from the front door. It happened so quickly. The curtains moved suddenly and I saw the shadows of two armed and hooded men.”Nicolò had kept his promise to avenge his father’s death. He had spoken about it with his men. And the mafia decided that he, too, should die. They shot him in the head, the arm and the abdomen, a ferocious volley of bullets from a sawn-off shotgun, the typical weapon used in mafia executions.Aiello tried to disarm the killers, but they grabbed her by the hair and threw her to the ground. When they left, Nicolò was already dead. The coroners removed more than 3lb (1.4kg) of ammunition from his gut.“My face was covered in my husband’s blood. I despised Nicolò, but I felt pity for him. He was just a boy, 27 years old, and they killed him like an animal.”One week after her husband’s murder, Aiello met district attorney Paolo Borsellino, who, with Giovanni Falcone, had recently carried out an investigation against the Sicilian mafia that resulted in hundreds of arrests. A strong friendship developed between Aiello and Borsellino. Aiello called him “Uncle Paolo” and he looked after her. He offered her an armed guard, found her a safe city to hide in, and helped her to leave Sicily. Rita Atria, Nicolò’s sister, went with her.Rita was 16, full of life, strong and sure of herself. Aiello had looked after her since she was a young girl. She knew that Rita’s choice would be even more difficult than her own. After all, she was Don Vito’s daughter. Rita had a blood relation within that mafia family. Her rebellion would have left a scar on the mafia’s code of honour that no vendetta could have set right.“We’d spend our days in police stations. Borsellino would often come and see us. We were afraid. We knew that the bosses were already plotting our deaths.“One day, after yet another interrogation, I ran out of the room in tears. Borsellino came out to hug me. I confessed that I was afraid of dying. He told me: ‘Nothing will happen to you.’ Smiling, he added: ‘I will certainly die before you.’”A few months later, in Palermo, on 19 July 1992, the mafia assassinated Borsellino with a car bomb in Via D’Amelio. Two months earlier, on 23 May, the same fate had struck Falcone, assassinated with 300kg of explosives on the motorway between Punta Raisi airport and Palermo. Today, Palermo International Airport is named after them the 13 November 2006 issue of Time Magazine listed them among the greatest heroes of the past 60 years.Aiello was desperate, Rita even more so. The mafia had killed her father, brother and now Borsellino, the man who had become her sole confidant. One week later, on 26 July 1992, Rita jumped off the seventh floor of an apartment building and killed herself.“I was devastated,” says Aiello. “I felt as if Rita had abandoned me. I felt I had the responsibility to carry on her rebellion, too. Only later did I realise that Rita’s gesture was that of a girl who had lost everything.”Rita’s and Aiello’s testimonies led to the arrest of dozens of mafiosi in the provinces of Agrigento and Trapani. Nicolò’s mother and Don Vito’s widow, Giovanna, never forgave her daughter and one day even set out to destroy her daughter’s tombstone with a hammer. “My mother-in-law hated both of us. She hoped they’d kill us. Our decision to become police informants was dishonourable to her. I never despised her. Both of us had been forced to marry men that we didn’t love. She had been raped by her father and never knew the meaning of true love. She was a victim of the mafia culture she grew up in.”Aiello made a new life for herself in northern Italy. She changed her name to Paola and started working as a babysitter. In her spare time, she painted. After a few years, she fell in love. Up to that moment her life had been conditioned by others the mafia chose her husband, the Italian state her new life. The time had come for her to make her own decisions, but there was one problem: “This man knew nothing about me. One evening, I invited him to dinner, and after our meal I asked him to sit down and listen to me.”Aiello told him about Nicolò, Don Vito, Borsellino and Rita. After, he asked her to marry him and they were wed on 8 August 2000. The priest was Don Ciotti, an anti-mafia activist living under police escort. Her witness was Salvatore Borsellino, Paolo’s brother, and among the guests were magistrates and members of the police force engaged in the struggle against the mafia.Her new husband promised to keep Aiello’s secret even from their two daughters. She worked as a babysitter until they were born, then settled into life as a housewife. Once in a while, the police asked her to give speeches in schools, or at events organised by anti-mafia associations. She would do so anonymously, covering her face. Until that fateful afternoon in the attic.“That evening we all gathered in the living room. A few weeks earlier I had been contacted by politicians from the Five Star Movement, who asked me to run for parliament in the upcoming elections. I wasn’t convinced, but my daughter persuaded me. She said that after everything I had been through, this was an important opportunity to bring my experience to parliament.”Aiello began an electoral campaign but, unlike other candidates, she could not show her face, have her photograph taken, or hold public rallies. She was still under police protection, and the authorities were still responsible for her safety. Because she covered her face with a veil or a scarf, she became known as the “faceless candidate”.In March, Aiello was elected to parliament. Most of her votes came from Trapani, and she “was very happy, because Trapani is the last stronghold of the Sicilian mafia, the kingdom of Matteo Messina Denaro, who is still at large”. They also came from all quarters of society – doctors, lawyers, workers, farmers, young and old.“I chose this party because it was the only one that would allow me to express myself freely,” she says. Under police protection, she had realised that police informants are often abandoned by the state after their information has been used. This will be the focus of her agenda in parliament, she says, a decision that has made her an even greater target for the mafia – making the lives of informants better means encouraging people to rebel. The election was not, however, conclusive, and in the tricky days following, the Five Star Movement had to form a controversial and difficult alliance with the Lega, a xenophobic party led by Matteo Salvini, a controversial senator who is now the minister of the interior. One of his first acts was to close Italian seaports to the Aquarius, a ship carrying 629 rescued migrants. Aiello doesn’t conceal her disapproval of Salvini’s choices: “He should talk less. Italy cannot reject immigrants. We must improve the services made available to them once they arrive.”On 13 June, after her election, and 27 years after she first went into hiding, Aiello decided that she had had enough. “I was tired of covering my face,” she says. “In addition to this, the law allows state witnesses to show their faces once they are elected. Cameras were all around in the parliament anyway. So I said: ‘Why not?’” Her assistant got in touch with the , and she gave this paper the first photograph.

The work started at some point in the past two weeks, after the last visit to North Korea by the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo.North Korea has also started dismantling a rail-mounted building at Sohae where workers assembled space launch vehicles before moving them to the launchpad, according to Joseph Bermudez Jr of 38 North.Trump is badly in need of evidence that his brand of unorthodox diplomacy with some of the US’s most long-established foes can produce results.On Friday, Pompeo complained to the UN security council that North Korea was evading oil sanctions by running covert ship-to-ship transfers. He insisted no sanctions should be lifted until complete, verifiable disarmament had taken place. Pompeo privately felt his last visit to North Korea had been a frustrating failure, even though he called for patience.Some Republican senators had also started to complain that China, angry with the US over trade tariffs, had discouraged North Korea from sticking to nuclear disarmament commitments made at the summit. Critics complained that Trump had been naive to invest so much importance in his personal chemistry with the North Korean leader given the country’s record of reneging on commitments to disarm.The South Korean foreign minister, Kang Kyung-wha, at a briefing in London, said its reports suggested North Korea was preparing for disarmament in return for a lifting of economic sanctions.The satellite image analysis leaves it unclear whether North Korea planned to demolish the entire Sohae site, which has been vital to its space programme. Other important facilities such as fuel bunkers, a main assembly building and the gantry tower appear untouched.Jenny Town, the managing editor of 38 North, which is based at the Stimson Center in Washington DC, said the work at Sohae could be an important move to keep negotiations going.“This could – and that’s a big could – mean that North Korea is also willing to forego satellite launches for the time being as well as nuclear and missile tests. This distinction has derailed diplomacy in the past,” she said.North Korea, in a media report last week, criticised South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, for not actively seeking to help Pyongyang in getting sanctions lifted. Ending the sanctions is Kim’s chief concern as the regime focuses on building its economy. South Korea, leading the push for greater dialogue, is seeking exemption from US sanctions to increase trade with the North. Kang said: “Given that talks between the US and North and between the South and North should go together, South Korea and the US need to communicate so that these talks are mutually reinforcing.”"},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

There is no place for past Booker winners who were eligible this year, including Julian Barnes, Alan Hollinghurst and Peter Carey.The only long-established name is Michael Ondaatje, who shared the prize in 1992 for The English Patient and returns this year with Warlight.The judges praised Drnaso\u0027s work as oblique, subtle, minimal, unmanipulative and said: Given the changing shape of fiction it was only a matter of time before a graphic novel was included on the Man Booker longlist. Sabrina makes demands on the reader in precisely the way all good fiction does.Michael Ondaatje, who won the Golden Man Booker Prize earlier this month, is on the longlistThe judging panel included Leanne Shapton, an artist and graphic novelist. Because Leanne has that experience, she was able to explain to the rest of us how to read a graphic novel, said Val McDermid, the crime writer and member of the panel.A lot of younger readers turn to the graphic novel. Those of us only accustomed to print are going to have to learn to read graphic novels.Drnaso\u0027s book is telling a story\u0027 like any other novel, McDermid said. Reading is about narrative and characters and caring about the people involved in a story, and Sabrina delivers that.Val McDermid, one of the 2018 judges, called it \u0026#39a really good list\u0026#39McDermid said the judges had not consciously sought to shake up the prize. We were consciously looking for the best books. We were looking for freshness and strong narrative. They\u0027re books I want to press into people\u0027s hands. This is a really good list with fresh voices and fresh takes on things.The judging process had been a joy, she added: I had expected a bit of flouncing, but we actually became a kind of book club.In a further break with tradition, the longlist includes a novel written in verse, The Long Take, by Scottish poet Robin Robertson. The judges described it as like a film noir on the page... Robertson shows the flexibility a poet can bring to form and style.The shortlist of six books will be unveiled on September 20, with the winner of the £50,000 prize to be announced on October 16.Man Booker Prize 2018: Our guide to all the nomineesIf there is a unifying theme this year, it is the bleak subject matter. Kwame Anthony Appiah, chair of the judges, said: Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the times, there were many dystopian fictions on our bookshelf - and many novels we found inspirational as well as disturbing.Some of those we have chosen for this longlist feel urgent and topical, others might have been admired and enjoyed in any year. All of these books - whether taking in slavery, ecology, missing persons, inner-city violence, young love, prisons, trauma, race - capture something about a world on the brink.Asked if this is a longlist for the age of Donald Trump, McDermid replied: Populism, apparently, doesn\u0027t do comedy.Greece wildfires a \u0026#39Biblical disaster\u0026#39: At least 60 killed near Athens as tourists forced to flee into seaTrains in London becoming less crowded as fed up commuters shun rush hour travelUK weather: Heatwave could send temperatures soaring higher than 35C as Britons urged to stay indoorsMax Hill: Terror watchdog who called for returning jihadis not to be charged is new chief prosecutorThai cave rescue boys ordained as Buddhists - in Facebook Live broadcastNearly one in three Labour voters believe Jeremy Corbyn is failing on anti-Semitism, poll findsNovichok victim reveals he accidentally gave girlfriend nerve agent \u0026#39perfume bottle\u0026#39 as a presentHundreds missing in Laos after hydropower dam collapse\u0026#39Unprecedented\u0026#39 Japan heatwave kills 65 in one week and leaves 23,000 in hospitalRow over amnesty for Troubles troops is a \u0026#39distraction\u0026#39, claims victims commissionerForeign Office cat Palmerston turns attention from mice to ducklings Watch: At least one person injured in Miami when building slated to be torn down collapsesThis heat could be here to stay - with an extra three degrees of warming by 2080\u0026#39A disaster from day one\u0026#39: Is this the end of Britain\u0026#39s first \u0026#39legal\u0026#39 red light district?Daimler feared crashing out of official Downing Street car contract, papers revealComment: Trust the French to come up with an intellectual case for nudism.

In 2013, Burberry incinerated £5.5m of unwanted stock, less than a fifth of last year’s total.“The stuff that Burberry is burning is not waste – it is surplus, which is a very different concept. It is perfectly useable stuff,” said Orsola de Castro, cofounder of Fashion Revolution, a not-for-profit group that campaigns for greater transparency in the supply chain.The fashion designer told The Independent clothing brands destroying “vast quantities” of stock was a “massive, massive issue” that was “absolutely not unique to Burberry”.“In the case of the big brands, it’s absolutely very negative for them to suddenly have the same product with slashed prices,” she said.“Burberry, I can imagine, is particularly concerned about this because we all know that it went through a huge image change from sort of shabby to high gloss, high fashion. So they are probably worried about making things cheap and rolling back the clock.“It is brand protection, in this case. They don’t want it to go to the wrong people.”Burberry’s clothes are priced at the high end of fashion retail, with men’s polo shirts selling for as much as £250 and its famous trench coats priced at around £1,500.The company also sells perfumes and cosmetics, which accounted for £10.4m of the products destroyed last year.Fashion Revolution in picturesDestroying stock has become common practice for the industry, with retailers describing it as a measure to protect intellectual property and prevent illegal counterfeiting.Burberry\u0026nbspsaid it only destroyed items that carried its trademark and only worked with specialist companies who were able to harness the energy from the process.A spokesman said: “Burberry has careful processes in place to minimise the amount of excess stock we produce.\u0026nbspOn the occasions when disposal of products is necessary, we do so in a responsible manner and we continue to seek ways to reduce and revalue our waste.”\u0026nbspBurberry\u0026nbsprecently joined the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s Make Fashion Circular initiative to help prevent waste in the industry, he added.Last year it emerged a Swedish power plant was burning unwanted H\u0026ampM clothes instead of coal.\u0026nbspThe plant in Vasteras, northwest of Stockholm, incinerated 15 tonnes of the retailer’s products in the first 11 months of the year.H\u0026ampM stressed it did not burn “any clothes that are safe to use” and said much of the destroyed stock was mouldy\u0026nbspor contaminated with lead.Ms De Castro called on the industry to be more open about the amount of clothing that was going to waste.She added: “We need to slow down. It doesn’t need to be drastic but it does need to happen, because whatever Burberry does with this stuff is not going to be environmentally friendly. There is no way of disposing of this amount of clothing in a way that is not environmentally invasive.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Ryan appearing in a fat suit to show her character before the weight loss prompted part of the backlash.\u0026nbspThe trailer showed how Patty loses weight over summer after an incident where she has to have her jaw wired shut. As she establishes herself as Queen Bee, she seeks revenge on her classmates for their previous treatment of her.\u0026nbspOne critic wrote on Twitter: You have a chance to make creative, engaging original content from fat people about fat people\u0027s lives and you choose to... put a skinny person in a fat suit and make jokes about how sad her life is and about what a crazy bitch she turns into. That\u0027s so lazy and pathetic.This pushes disordered eating AND the fact that you have to lose weight to be \u0027better\u0027, another wrote.

This is not an isolated case but part of a much larger problem that I can promise you every single woman has faced in her life, sitting somewhere on the scale of valuing their worth on their bodies, to be desirable objects for the male gaze.That is exactly what this series does. It perpetuates not only the toxicity of diet culture but the objectification of women\u0027s bodies.TV preview 2018: Everything to look out for416 A Series of Unfortunate Events916 Fear the Walking DeadStart date: 23 April, AMC on BT TV1216 Call the Midwife series 71316 House of Cards 416 A Series of Unfortunate Events916 Fear the Walking DeadStart date: 23 April, AMC on BT TV1216 Call the Midwife series 71316 House of Cards The trailer was also criticised by experts who specialise in weight loss and eating disorders, including Adam Cox, a clinical hypnotherapist, who told\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspthat the show may have an especially negative effect on young people suffering from body image issues.\u0026nbspThe series seems to be entirely based around negative connotations to do with weight, which is inherently harmful to anyone who has struggled with body issues, he said.\u0026nbspWhile we\u0027ve seen many shows and movies which encourage body positivity, unfortunately there are still some which aim to perpetuate already harmful stereotypes which do nothing to address these issues at best, and at worst knowingly pursue controversy to gain viewings.To do this when people\u0027s mental health may be compromised by such a tactic, especially young people, strikes me as irresponsible and dangerous.She added: Twelve years into my own struggles with body image, struggles that took me in and out of terrible places I never want to go to again, things I choose every day to leave behind, I was drawn to this show\u0027s willingness to go to real places about how difficult and scary it can be to move through the world in a body, whether you\u0027re being praise or criticised for its size, and what it feels like to pray to be ignored because it\u0027s easier than being seen.Patty has the same brain, the same sense of humour and style, soul and heart, the same chucks, but felt like she didn\u0027t matter to anyone until she was thin... she undergoes a physical transformation, but it doesn\u0027t make her happy.

Since then, areas like\u0026nbspPeckham and Frome\u0026nbsphave taken the message on as their ownClick to followThe Independent OnlineFrom Bristol to LA: The anti-gentrification posters sweeping through our citiesLast summer, stickers and posters began to appear on the walls of Bristol. In a gnomic parody of Trump’s “Make America Great Again“ they read “Make Bristol Shit Again”, and were plastered over the city’s gentrifying high-tide areas, such as Stokes Croft and St Pauls.\u0026nbspThe city talked. Vice magazine did a piece about it, and MBSA went viral as both an exemplar of the city’s mordant humour and a plea against gentrification.“My hometown is becoming an extension of London, and losing its crappy edge,” wrote Vice’s Angus Harrison in a bittersweet excoriation of Bristol’s new-found glossiness.\u0026nbspMBSA might have been a one-off valedictory howl, but in an act of synchronicity, other “Shit Again” activity arrived.In Peckham, the southeast London district previously known for being the location of Only Fools and Horses and latterly for being a hipster hotspot, a “Make Peckham Shit Again” landed\u0026nbspin March, as did a Twitter account called “Make Frome Shit Again” along with a few MFSA hashtags of the same vintage.\u0026nbsp(In an odd circularity, much of Only Fools and Horses, although set in\u0026nbspPeckham, was actually filmed in Bristol.)\u0026nbspBristolStreetWearUK)Then, this spring an international brigade of “Shit Again” warriors\u0026nbspin Los Angeles in the form of “Make Venice Shit Again” (Venice the hippyish LA district, to be clear, not the Birmingham of Italy).Such was its clout that Hollywood actor Josh Brolin sported a MVSA baseball cap, part of a local atmosphere so heightened that a recent LA Weekly story found cause to lament that in Venice, “You’ll sooner find a $200 (£150) wool poncho than a $12 pair of flip-flops.”\u0026nbspSo the “Shit Again” tag somehow hit the mark, both as a lament to the new and deracinated world of overpriced and socially exclusive development, and as a great merchandise idea in its own right. So there’s a MBSA hat, T-shirt and even “laptop skins”, while MVSA baseball caps retail at $30 and MPSA baseball caps a snip at a tenner.\u0026nbspAs Tumbleweed Parker puts it (not his real name) his Make Peckham Shit Again hats were a response to Trump’s MAGA cap as well as a way to protest the gentrification of Peckham, which has deep roots but has gathered pace in the last five years as a domino in what you might call the “de-shitting” of London.“Before Trump I’d been thinking about doing some merchandise to kick back against all the happy-clappy local pride movements that seemed to spring up after the London riots in 2011,” says Parker.Peckham-based rockers Fat White Family (centre) wears a ‘Make Peckham Shit Again’ cap with siblings Sasha and Vida Adamczewski (Morbid Books)“It’s delusional to think London’s the best place in the world when its homegrown youth are so desperate to burn it down, and Sadiq Khan’s idiotic marketing of London is used to sell it off to developers.”Moreover, he adds, “people can’t afford to live in this so-called paradise”. So in its own way, the hats and T-shirts are a kind of Situationist protest or, as he puts it, “a barricade against the unhelpful narrative that Peckham is, was, or ever could be a great place for property speculators. I think it’s important that we say, it’s actually not that great.”So is this ‘Shit Again’ activity really a hankering for the days of shuttered high streets without good coffee: a kind of “Fings Ain’t What They Used to Be” for disgruntled millennials? Possibly: the creator\u0026nbspof Make Bristol Shit Again, Bristolstreetwear, bears the legend “Say no to sourdough” on its website, and certainly, there’s a sense of loss about gentrification’s march through the neighbourhoods: the sticky-carpet pubs turning into homes, the chain stores pushing out independents, and £3-a-cup flat whites and avocado-on-spelt ousting the chipped mug of tea and sausage sarnie.Frome\u0026nbspis known for its independent shops and cobbled street\u0026nbsp(Shutterstock)The protestors are also needled by endless proclamations of arrival, such as Frome’s topping the charts as a good place to move, and Bristol winning The Sunday Times’ “best place to live in the UK” gong: the kind of boosterism that gives some locals the impression their towns are forgotten backwaters just itching to be discovered.It’s rattled further by development that piggybacks on existing “bohemian” infrastructure, such as Stokes Croft in Bristol, where the loss of artist-occupied warehouses and office blocks like Hamilton House have sparked long battles.Yet perhaps there’s something else afoot too: a nostalgie de la boue for the old townscape of sticky boozers and crap shops where people supposedly felt a sense of belonging.The term “gentrification” was minted in 1964 by British sociologist Ruth Glass with reference to Islington, then attracting the middle classes into areas full of multi-occupied late Georgian and early Victorian houses, where they set about losing the net curtains and exposing the floorboards, hence the contemporary jibe, “stripped pine-eers”. Indeed, today’s neo-gentrifiers still like their decoration “raw”, although these days it’s more about bare bricks, old shops and and cocktails in jam jars. And there has long been a missionary-like flavour about the process, whereby gentrifiers comes into an unreconstructed urban district, “discover” it anew and turn it into a mirror of their own taste.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWoodage  Twitter)But the idea of what gentrification constitutes has shifted, says Loretta Lees, a professor of human geography at the University of Leicester and author of several books on the matter, including Planetary Gentrification. “I’ve noticed that anti-gentrification has become more performative in the last two to three years,” says Lees. “The traditional class aspect of it has given way to a more complicated scenario, full of internal conflict, where critics of gentrification are often gentrifiers themselves and where the discussion is more about consumerism more than class.”The 2017 book Gentrifier by John Joe Schlichtman, Jason Patch and Marc Lamont Hill also works this theme with a look at how gentrification\u0026nbspis now commonly used as a means to describe clothing choices, food and art, often centred around the cipher-like figure of the “hipster“ and part of a battle for the authentic soul of a place.Shoreditch (Jamie OsmanTwitter)“Imagined realities and physical realities collide in gentrification,“ they wrote. This aspect became apparent in 2015, when a demonstration against a branch of the Cereal Cafe in London’s Brick Lane bought a sense of pantomime to the debate, while in 2016 Montreal’s local government introduced a by-law that no more than one in six businesses can be a restaurant: a move that has been seen as a way of moderating gentrification.\u0026nbspAlamy)So the new symbols of gentrification – the cortados, chachka shops and themed restaurants – began to seemingly represent a force that was making Bristol want to be shit again, as well as rippling out anxiously to other corners of the country. It’s a phenomenon that Lees says has seen “gentrification move on from key world cities to rural areas, market towns and ‘edge cities’ – places on the margins of urban areas”. One of the key differences between the Ruth Glass era and now is that gentrification has been globalised and also exists in miniature.\u0026nbspTenants’ lives ‘at risk’ after government fails to act on safety rulesDonald Trump has been scared off by a big balloonLondon to get first permanent LGBT+ homeless shelterAs for Frome becoming “shit again”, she says that the actual long-term locals want a post office, a good supermarket and a Peacocks: all things that\u0026nbspmight not be the grails of a “down from London” person’s eye.\u0026nbspThere’s also a streak of self-deprecation that runs through a certain British mentality, as seen in Crap Towns, the 1990s hit, bringing the “declinism” of the 1980s up to date. Then, things could only get worse. And surely gentrification can sometimes be good? Lees draws a moral distinction between the “gentrification that displaces people, and the good regeneration that keeps people in place”, but struggles to think of a good example of the latter.In 2015, research from the US magazine City Lab concluded that gentrifying neighbourhoods don’t actually lose low-income residents at a substantially lower rate than any other neighbourhood. Plus, it should be said, there’s nothing gentrifiers scorn more than other gentrifiers. It’s fun to have a pop.\u0026nbspPerhaps “shit again” means affordable housing and a regaining of convivial civic life, or perhaps it’s an aesthetic of urban decline. Whatever, a “shit again” cap is the perfect self-abnegating gift for an uncertain age. “It seems to be resonating with a lot of people who feel alienated by the discourse of positivity around urban redevelopment, which is most people I know,” says Parker. “Even the local estate agent ordered one. I hope he wears it when he hangs himself.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

So she started oneClick to followThe Independent OnlineAtes is also the author of 2009 book ‘Islam Needs a Sexual Revolution’, and has required police protection ever sinceSeyran Ates recalls the searing pain of a bullet tearing through her neck. She remembers wavering on the brink of death and telling God that she had to rejoin the living.A 21-year-old law student at the time, working at a women’s centre in West Berlin, she was nowhere near finished with the world.“\u0027I want to go back,’ I told God,” Ates, now a 55-year-old lawyer and women’s rights activist who is also studying to become an imam, recalled of that afternoon. “I still have a mission.”More than three decades later, that mission came to fruition a year ago when she stood before a congregation of Muslim men and women kneeling side by side as they recited prayers in the Ibn Rushd-Goethe Mosque – the first Muslim house of worship in Germany where women, many with dark ponytails and long curls uncovered, are recognised as imams.Any Muslim is welcome to join: men or women, Sunni or Shia, transgender, gay or straight.“We want to send a signal to political Islam,” Ates, wearing a long, white tunic trimmed with gold, told a packed room on the opening day, when journalists outnumbered worshippers.“We want to show that another Islam exists, that has nothing to do with terrorism.”Over the past year, that something has grown into a congregation of 35 core members – many of them women. They help Ates organise weekly prayers, give tours to school groups and hold seminars on democracy, love and the concept of an open, tolerant interpretation of Islam and a forgiving God.Religious groups join together for interfaith collaborationHere\u0027s a reminder of what Donald Trump said about Muslims in the past When is Eid al-Fitr and how do Muslim people celebrate it?During Eid, it\u0027s important to reflect on Islam in BritainThree years after a wave of more than 1 million, mostly Muslim, migrants arrived in Germany seeking asylum, culture wars over religious identity and the possible threat posed by Islam have led to a rise in nationalist, populist movements.The government of Chancellor Angela Merkel was nearly brought down this week over a dispute with the Bavarian sister of her conservative party, which sought to turn back refugees at the border.The Bavarian conservatives of the Christian Social Union joined the far-right party Alternative for Germany in promoting a narrative that refugees pose a threat, after several highly publicised killings and sexual assaults in the country led to charges against Muslim migrants.The party ordered that crosses be displayed in all public buildings in the state, and Merkel’s new interior minister, Horst Seehofer – also a Bavarian – declared: “Islam is not a part of Germany.”Against the backdrop of these debates, Ates sees the survival of the Ibn Rushd-Goethe Mosque, which recently celebrated its first anniversary, as proof that Muslims living in Germany need and are open to an interpretation of Islam that reflects the values of the Western society in which they live.Tombs in the centre of Tarung village serve as handy laundry driers on a sunny Sumba morning.Each tomb in Waihola village (near Nihiwatu) represents massive expense in terms of ritual sacrifices for local families who observe the ancestral Marapu religionCatholic imagery on a tomb in Waihola village (near Nihiwatu) shows how imported religions seem often to have blended almost seamlessly with the ancient Marapu religion.In an effort to minimise economic strain the law stipulates that only 5 buffalo can be sacrificed at funerals - in reality many more are often killed and a big buffalo with a wide horn spread will often fetch close to $4,000.A royal tomb in Pasunga village is flanked by the smaller tombs where servants were buried (sometimes buried alive!) alongside their master.Village dogs - currently s but, more than likely, part of some future feast - on tombs in Pasunga village.A horse - another part of Sumba\u0027s ancestral warrior heritage - grazes among the tombs in Pasunga village.A more humble modern style tomb stands next to the kings burial place in Galu Bakul, Anakalang.A village dog relaxes on a tomb in Prai Ijing village.While still considered sacred the tombs very quickly become part of normal village life.

The Arabs will never allow it,\u0027” she said. Instead, hundreds of people from across Germany, Europe and abroad have visited or attended services.Those most committed to its survival have made donations, some as much as €500, Ates said, emphasising that the mosque receives no public funding.“Even atheists come here and appreciate this place, as a spiritual place, a place of peace,” she said recently, standing barefoot on the pale carpet of the mosque. “I had hoped, but never dreamed, that so many atheists would be interested. That was a positive surprise.”The criticism and rejection, in its fierceness and intensity, less so. Even before the mosque opened, her personal Facebook page and that of the mosque were flooded with derogatory messages and even some death threats.“May Allah put you on the right path, or destroy you,” someone writing under the name Xalo Bero said, in one of the friendlier remarks.Protection provided by the police and paid for by the city government, in place since she published the book Islam Needs a Sexual Revolution\u0026nbspin 2009, was increased to a personal security detail after the heightened threats on her life.Days after the mosque opened, Dar al-Ifta, an influential arm of the Egyptian Justice Ministry that issues religious verdicts, denounced the mosque and declared that allowing men and women to pray alongside one another violated Islamic law.Turkish news outlets reported that the mosque was a terrorist organisation with links to the Islamist cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkey blames for a coup attempt in 2016 against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Despite a video message in which Ates states that the “the Rushd-Goethe mosque has nothing to do with the Gulen movement”, the rumours have persisted.She blames them for the fact that few Turks have joined the congregants, although they make up the vast majority of the estimated 4.5 million Muslims living in Germany.Despite the demands of running the mosque, she takes Arabic classes and continues to work as a lawyer. She considers achieving a degree in Islamic theology important to her recognition in the Muslim community.“I want to understand the words and know the meanings so no one can say, ‘She’s just a lawyer,\u0027” she said.Born in Istanbul to a Turkish mother and a Kurdish father, she emigrated with her parents to what was then West Berlin in the late 1960s, part of the first large wave of Muslim immigrants who came to fill the blue-collar jobs needed to rebuild the German economy after World War II.Ates was 6 when she and her four siblings moved into a one-room apartment with their parents.As she learned German and excelled in school, Ates says, she came to understand that it was not the crowded living conditions that she found suffocating, but the realisation that because of her gender, she was not afforded the freedoms of her non-Muslim peers.“I was a girl,” she wrote in 2007 in Zeit Online. “I embodied the family’s honour, and my hymen – for a long time I didn’t even know what that was – was more important to the whole family than my brain.”At 17, she fled her home, graduated from high school and started studying law at the Free University of Berlin. To support herself, she worked as a counsellor in a women’s centre.In September 1984, she was speaking with a client when a man wearing a trench coat entered the centre, pulled out a pistol and fired three shots. One hit the client in the stomach, killing her the other struck Ates.She survived to see the suspect, a Turkish bricklayer, acquitted for lack of evidence, which enraged her. For years, she struggled with the psychological fallout of the attack.Violent clashes leave ’86 dead’ in NigeriaFrench far-right group arrested over alleged plot to attack MuslimsShe returned to her faith, but was again alienated by Berlin’s traditional, conservative mosques, where women were forced to pray behind a curtain. She decided that if the faith community that she needed did not exist, she would create it.It took years of planning, fundraising and looking for a suitable space. While she received support from like-minded liberal Muslims from Switzerland to the US, the critics have remained.What keeps her going is the encouragement, not only from social media postings, but also from the visitors who go out of their way to find a place of worship that previously existed only in their dreams.​Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Expertly paced, Snap offers a beautiful evocation of the lives of children, and how they perceive and manage tragedy.”“At the intersection of class, race, gender and sexual violence, it deals with oppression and power with a Beckettian sense of humour, offering a wholly original take on Ireland in the time of the Troubles through the mind of a young girl.”Oblique, subtle, minimal, unmanipulative: the style of the pictures is the book’s worldview. Drnaso uses images to express an idea about what’s invisible – an idea about uncertainty, and the different kinds of holes that missing people leave in our lives.“A dazzling exploration of race in the Atlantic world, which also manages to be a yarn and a chase story. It manages to keep you on the edge of your seat, while making you, as a reader, want to savour every moment.”“An ambitious mosaic of virtuosic ventriloquism, Guy Gunaratne’s book is an inner city novel for our times, exploring the endurance of social trauma across generations, and conveying the agony and energy of the marginalised, the outsider, and the oppressed.”“A hypnotic, mythic, unexpected story from a beguiling new voice. Everything Under is an exploration of family, gender, the ways we understand each other and the hands we hold out to each other – a story that’s like the waterways at its heart.”“A novel about gender, class and the absolute corruption of the American dream, The Mars Room explores the meaning of incarceration in our moment. It feels terrifyingly authentic.”“This chilling, beautifully written novel explores the ways in which extreme parental protection can fail, and unpicks patriarchy at its core, forcing us to ask what it means to survive, indeed whether it is possible to survive, in a man’s \u0026nbspworld.”“Wonderfully atmospheric, beautifully paced, subtle storytelling. Warlight contains an incredible array of characters through whom Ondaatje tells the hidden, barely spoken, tale of war, especially as it impacts on children.”“An ecological epic, a novel of ideas, The Overstory begins with five apparently distinct narratives and then binds them into a compelling network of connections.”“A book about a man and a city in shock, it’s an extraordinary evocation of the debris and the ongoing destruction of war even in times of peace., Robin Robertson shows the flexibility a poet can bring to form and style.”“A very intimate character study of two young people trying to figure out how to love each other, Normal People is written in compressed, composed, allusive prose that invites you read behind the lines”“A deft, unshowy novel about manhood and momentous contingency, it evokes the way in which real lives unfold and wrap around each other.”The shortlist for the Man Booker Prize 2018 will be announced on 20 September, and the winner on 16 OctoberEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

And when it did, the atmosphere might have been\u0026nbspfar more habitable than it is today, ready to support life, if only briefly.That is according to two senior planetary researchers who found that the Moon might have had conditions to support simple lifeforms some four billion years ago. The same conditions might have arrived during a peak of volcanic activity 3.5 billion years ago, claim the researchers.During that time, the Moon was spewing out vast amounts of very hot gases, including water vapour. Those gases might have formed into liquid water on the surface as well as creating an atmosphere that could keep it there.“If liquid water and a significant atmosphere were present on the early Moon for long periods of time, we think the lunar surface would have been at least transiently habitable,” said Dirk Schulze-Makuch,\u0026nbspan astrobiologist at Washington State University, who wrote the paper with\u0026nbspIan Crawford, a professor of planetary science and astrobiology at the University of London.The Moon is also thought to have been wrapped in a magnetic field that would have kept any lifeforms who lived there safe from deadly solar winds.The earliest evidence of life on Earth comes from about\u0026nbsp3.5 and 3.8 billion years old, in the form of cyanobacteria. During that time, the solar system was a violent place marked by frequent meteorite impacts – it is possible that some life could have been carried up to the moon in the wake of one of those blasts, the researchers suggest.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

That could examine moon deposits from the period to find if they include signs of life, or simulating the conditions of the early Moon on Earth or the International Space Station, to see whether life could exist there.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Log inBrexit negotiations appear to be in trouble, with seeming deadlock between Britain and the EU on the issues of the Northern Ireland border and the form a potential trade deal might take. With just three months left until the October talks deadline and few routes to a solution, many are predicting a no-deal. But what does no-deal mean in practice?Theresa May has negotiated a transition period with the EU, during which the UK would continue to follow EU rules (without any say in what they are) for just under two years after it leaves the EU in March 2019.This “implementation period” is supposed to allow time for new post-Brexit arrangements to be put into place – such as a new trade deal for British goods.But this transition period is conditional on a withdrawal agreement being signed. If there is no withdrawal agreement, there is no transition period, and the UK economy faces an abrupt cliff-edge.Under this cliff-edge, the UK would be forced to trade with the EU under World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules. Currently, goods moving between the EU and UK don’t need to be checked at borders and\u0026nbspface no tariffs, and complex supply chains in industries like car-making cross national boundaries.But under WTO rules there would be immediate customs and regulatory checks and the UK and EU would have to pay tariffs on each others’ goods.\u0026nbspThis isn’t something the EU can just opt-out of: the WTO effectively requires countries to charge the same tariffs to countries they don’t have a trade deal with, a rule called the “most favoured nation” tariffs. Grant someone a special favour, and you have to do it to all members.A parliamentary report into a no-deal concluded that “this would almost certainly involve the immediate imposition of tariffs across a range of sectors”.Some tariffs would be more significant than others: the highest would be on British farmers, who would face 30-40 per cent charges for exporting to the EU, effectively making many exports unviable. Lower tariffs would be on things such as\u0026nbspautomotive parts, where a 5\u0026nbspper cent charge would apply.\u0026nbspThese tariffs are what Britain, currently a member of the EU, charges countries outside the EU, as a member of the trade area. Britain would, now outside the EU and without any special opt-out, be on the other side of the fence.We don’t know what precise effect these massive reduction in trade and UK exports would have on the British economy, but it’s fair to say it would not be good. HM Treasury forecast ahead of the referendum, whose most pessimistic scenario was predicated on talks collapsing, suggested that such a Brexit would “push the UK into recession and lead to a sharp rise in unemployment”.Under the WTO rules scenario, the Treasury’s modelling expects unemployment to rise by 820,000 in two years, sterling to fall by 15 per cent, and inflation to rise by 2.7 per cent.As well as economic disruption there would almost certainly be significant physical disruption at ports such as\u0026nbspDover because of the need for customs and regulatory checks on goods.\u0026nbspEven a high-tech system of checking freight lorries requires them to be held for at least\u0026nbspfive or 10\u0026nbspminutes –\u0026nbsplonger if something goes wrong, which it sometimes does.These thousands of lorries a day have to physically be held somewhere. The Independent reported earlier this year that huge dedicated lorry parks planned for coastal areas in Kent won’t be ready for in time for a no-deal in March, after project planning setbacks meant officials had to start from scratch. Instead, the government is planning to close part of a nearby motorway and use it as a massive lorry park.If Britain leaves the single market and customs union the EU says it would have to impose similar border checks anyway, but a transition period would give the UK time to expand its infrastructure to cope.There would be disruption abroad too at ports like Rotterdam which process a lot of British goods.The prices of consumer goods would likely increase significantly under a no-deal, particularly for foods like meats and cheese.\u0026nbspLSE research commissioned by the dairy industry says dairy products would be particularly hit and “see shortages of products and a sharp rise in prices, turning everyday staples like butter, yoghurts, cheese and infant formula, into occasional luxuries”.This, the research claims, is because of the dependence on imported products from Europe and the complex supply chains which would be very sensitive to delays.rexit secretary Dominic Raab tried to claim at the weekend that the EU would be worse off than the UK from a no-deal, but officials later admitted that he only had evidence that this might be the case for one economic area\u0026nbsp– financial derivatives.The EU economy would likely be damaged by the collapse of talks, but the effects are difficult to quantify.\u0026nbsp53 per cent of British imports come from the EU, and any disruption in trade would work both ways.But the EU27’s economies are about $13.5 trillion compared to the UK’s $2.6 trillion – the two are not equal in size and so the relative importance of the UK’s economy to the EU as a bloc is less than the other way around.The effect would likely be uneven – certain sectors and businesses that trade closely with the UK would be hit hardest. Where there are fewer links, the effect would be less.Under a basic no-deal, EU citizens living in Britain, and British citizens living in the EU, would have no legal status and would technically be illegal aliens in the countries they call home.\u0026nbspEU officials say they want to make contingency plans to stop this happening, but it is unclear what these will be. Like the transition period, the provisions negotiated in the EU withdrawal agreement to protect EU citizens’ rights do not apply in the event of a no-deal, because the whole deal comes as a package.\u0026nbspMinisters have previously said they are using EU nationals as a “bargaining chip” in negotiations.The3Million, a campaign group that represents EU citizens living in the UK, warns that EU citizens are already living in “a new political landscape and an unprecedented uncertainty as to the nature of their resident status in the UK post Brexit.It is questionable whether there would be a majority in parliament to actually allow a no-deal – MPs have defeated the government before to soften Brexit. They could potentially collapse the government over the issue before it happened.Theresa May has however repeatedly said that “no deal is better than a bad deal”, so not getting a deal would not necessarily be the end of her.While the resulting economic malaise and perception of incompetence would probably seriously damage the government in the eyes of the public, many Tory MPs who favour no-deal would probably be fairly content with the outcome.Because it is Tory MPs\u0026nbspand party members who choose who the prime minister is, in absence of an election\u0026nbspit would be down to them whether the prime minister survived.On the other hand, Boris Johnson and anyone else with leadership ambitions currently keeping a low profile might see any political hit for May as their opportunity to strike.From the EU’s perspective, the resulting punishment meted out in the UK economy would probably ensure nobody ever tried leaving the EU again for the near future – lest they turn out like Britain.You can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/23/15/air-pol-1.jpg","title":"environment brexit uk air pollution wildlife water quality climate change","story":"Created with Sketch.\u0027People only need to look at the government\u0027s utter failure to deal with our roadside air pollution crisis to see why this matters\u0027Click to followIndy PoliticsCampaigners say the government\u0027s lack of action on air pollution is evidence of the need for tighter environment protectionsMPs have criticised the “worrying” lack of detail in the government’s long-term plans for the environment and called for legally binding targets to ensure ministers make good on their promises.Air quality, water and wildlife must be all be protected by a “world-leading watchdog” that ensures standards do not drastically slip when the country leaves the EU.Brexit poses a major threat to the current measures in place to protect the UK’s environment, especially if no deal is reached by ministers.The proposed new independent body, modelled after the National Audit Office, will be required to ensure enforcement and rules that are currently the responsibility of the EU are not lost.It would also mean the government and public bodies could be taken to court when standards are breached.Mary Creagh, chair of the Environmental Audit Committee – which produced the report in response to the government’s 25 Year Plan for the Environment – said “if we want a world-leading environment we need a world-leading environmental watchdog”.\u0026nbspDespite the ambitious goals set out in the plan, launched by Theresa May in January, Ms Creagh said based on the government’s record there was a need to tighten these targets.People\u0027s Vote march - demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 march“In recent months the government has been referred to the EU’s highest court for failing to tackle illegal levels of air pollution in the UK. We are facing a bioersity crisis and risk losing iconic species like the hedgehog,” she said.“The government’s 25 Year Plan is high on ambitions, but low on milestones. The government has more experience of getting rid of environmental watchdogs than of setting them up.”New legislation has already been promised to cover areas like air, waste, water and chemicals that cannot simply be transferred into UK law following Brexit.However, to ensure these pledges are carried out the committee said there was a need to introduce five-yearly plans to ensure ministers are on track to meet their environmental targets.A similar system is already in place to monitor greenhouse gas emissions in the form of the “carbon budgets” set by the Climate Change Act – a system widely regarded as effective and world-leading.“We want an Environmental Governance and Principles Act that sets legally-binding targets and creates a new Environmental Enforcement and Audit Office to measure progress and enforce this new law,” said Ms Creagh.“The government needs to set out detailed delivery and funding proposals for the Plan and departments across Whitehall need to commit to its ambitions, rather than trying to water them down behind the scenes.”Environmental campaigners, who have welcomed the government’s recent announcement that a new environment act is imminent, agreed that current proposals are not strong enough.“No one would argue that we shouldn’t be striving for cleaner air or water along with a vibrant countryside rich in wildlife,” said RSPB conservation director Martin Harper.‘Super-polluting’ trucks allowed to ignore air pollution controlsMajority of young voters would back party that curbs air pollutionGirl\u0027s death first to be linked to illegal levels of air pollution“But to achieve this we need a more transformative piece of legislation – one that delivers ambitious targets for nature, soil, water and air and holds the government to account when standards aren’t met.”Over 100,000 people have signed a Greenpeace petition calling on Michael Gove and Philip Hammond to keep their promise of a world-leading watchdog.MPs are right to call on the government to create an environmental watchdog with powers to require ministers and public bodies to comply with environmental laws,” said Greenpeace’s senior political adviser Rebecca Newsom.“People only need to look at the government\u0027s utter failure to deal with our roadside air pollution crisis to see why this matters.

Until four years ago Fatima Abu Shedeg was not only unable to swim but had never been in a pool.\u0026nbspYet despite the challenges she has faced, she spends her days dreaming of stepping onto the starting block at\u0026nbspthe Tokyo 2020 Games as Gaza’s first Olympic swimmer.\u0026nbspIn 2014, Fatima lost her father during the last war with Israel, which raged for 51 days and left more than 2,200 Palestinians and 73 Israelis dead. She saw her uncle’s legs blown off in the same airstrike that killed her father and destroyed most of their home in Beit Lahia, north Gaza.\u0026nbspLike many children in the tiny enclave, she suffered from post-traumatic stress.\u0026nbspThen Amjed Tantesh, 42, a swimming coach and one-time Olympic hopeful, encouraged her to learn to swim as a way of channelling her depression and anger.\u0026nbsp“A week after my dad passed away Amjed called my mum and offered me and my brother swimming lessons. My dad was killed by shrapnel from an airstrike which ricocheted off the wall and hit his heart. The same airstrike blew off my uncle’s leg. We were all downstairs screaming,” she said sitting by a small pool filled with murky green water in Gaza City.\u0026nbsp“It’s extremely important for me to achieve my dream, the dream of my family, of my coach, to be the first Gazan swimmer to take part in the Olympics,” she added.\u0026nbspFour years later, the fitness and football fanatic\u0026nbspspends her free time training in grubby and sometimes makeshift pools. Gaza is in the 11th year of an Israeli blockade, meaning Fatima cannot even get hold of proper swimming equipment. She is left to swim in a mismatched pair of pyjamas. If she qualifies it would be her first trip out of Gaza, which is just 25 miles long.She said swimming had helped her deal with trauma from the war and made her stronger.\u0026nbsp“I don’t want to be afraid any more. I want to be strong. I used to even be afraid of the pool, of water, and now I’m not. I’m determined to work on myself, to succeed,”\u0026nbspshe said.\u0026nbspIn June Save the Children\u0026nbspreported that a staggering 95 per cent of children in Gaza had depression, consistent with deep psychological distress. The charity said the constant threat of conflict, the fear of bombs, and the constant insecurity caused by the unstable political situation had created a psychological crisis in the country.\u0026nbspMany fear Gaza is now on the brink of another war with Israel as tensions have reached boiling point.\u0026nbspOn Friday the Israeli army said one of its soldiers had been killed by Palestinian gunmen near the border, the first Israeli military death near Gaza since the 2014 war. The army unleashed a tide of airstrikes that pummelled over 60 military targets in the enclave, in one of the most intense days of violence in four years.By the end of the day, the Gaza health ministry said that at least four Palestinians had been killed. As fires raged through the strip, a shaky truce brokered by Egypt was enforced. On Saturday, the United Nations urged both sides it was “imperative” to step back from the brink of a “devastating conflict”.At the heart of the latest eruption of hostilities is 16 weeks of Palestinian protests near the border fences that the Israeli army has met with force. More than 140 Palestinians been killed by Israeli fire since 30 March, when residents of Gaza first marched on the fences demanding right to return to ancestral lands they were forced from during the 1948 war which surrounded the creation of Israel.\u0026nbspSome of the protesters have taken to launching burning kites and balloons attached with explosives at Israel, sparking more than 750 wildfires and scorching 2,600 hectares of land.The Palestinians maintain the protests are peaceful and Israel is firing on them with live ammunition. Israel says their soldiers have been attacked and the wildfires are endangering Israeli citizens.\u0026nbspEarlier this week saw the most intense exchange of fire between Gaza and Israel since the 2014 conflict. Egypt reportedly intervened to stop war breaking out.Amid the escalating conflict, children, like Fatima, have suffered the most.\u0026nbspMr Tantesh said there were few resources or outlets for the youth to deal with trauma, though\u0026nbspswimming had\u0026nbspproven\u0026nbspa cheap alternative.\u0026nbspHe launched his swimming initiative in 1999 and said he has since taught more than\u0026nbsp5,400 children to swim. \u0026nbspBecause he initially\u0026nbsplacked access to pools and so, in the aftermath of the 2014 war, Tantesh built a makeshift sea pool\u0026nbspby using concrete blocks from bombed-out buildings to cordon off an area of the beach in north Gaza, where the water is less polluted.\u0026nbspIn 2015 alone, he taught some 465 children, with most of them receiving free swimming lessons.\u0026nbsp“All of them are war afflicted, they have lost a father, mother, relative or they have had a house destroyed,” he told The Independent.“But our new ambition is to prepare some of those children to qualify for the Olympics. Fatima is by far our best chance, she has developed the fastest and so we hope she will represent Gaza in Tokyo 2020. I have never seen such determination and persistence,” he added.Meet the girl who wants to be Gaza’s first Olympic SwimmerFatima Abu Shedeg, 13, dreams of leaping from the blocks at Tokyo 2020Fatima has survived three wars and until four years ago she was not only unable to swim but had never been in a poolIn 2014, Fatima lost her father during the last war with Israel, which raged for 51 days and left more than 2,200 Palestinians and 73 Israelis dead.

If she qualifies it would be her first trip out of Gaza, which is just 25 miles longShe said swimming had helped her deal with trauma from the war and made her stronger. “I don’t want to be afraid any more. I want to be strong. I used to even be afraid of the pool, of water, and now I’m not. I’m determined to work on myself, to succeed,” she saidGaza lacks an Olympic-size swimming pool and the few pools it does have struggle to stay open amid chronic energy shortages. It is also increasingly dangerous to swim in the seaFatima hopes one day to get permission to leave Gaza and take her place at the Games.The Palestinian territories have participated in the Olympics since 1996, represented by the International Olympic Committee as they are not formally recognised as a country.Since then more than 20 athletes have taken part, in athletics, judo and swimming. Bar one person, a young judoka from Jerusalem who qualified in London’s 2012 Games, they have all competed on a wild card scheme.The Palestinian Olympic Committee chooses its teams from Gaza, the West Bank and Palestinian communities across the world. So Fatima will face stiff competition while she makes do with scant resources.Gaza lacks an Olympic-size swimming pool and the few pools it does have struggle to stay open amid chronic energy shortages. It is also increasingly dangerous to swim in the sea.\u0026nbspGaza’s environment authority said last year that nearly two-thirds of its 25 mile coastline was seriously polluted.\u0026nbspSewage treatment plants cannot function due to the power\u0026nbspshortages. The United Nations said that more than 100 million litres of waste water are pumped into the sea off Gaza every day.With filthy beaches and not enough electricity\u0026nbspto keep pools clean, trying to train a swimming team is near impossible, according to the Olympic Committee in Gaza.\u0026nbspIn a battered office and sat in front of a battery-powered fan, Munther Masalmeh, the committee’s secretary-general, said it would be a “major achievement” for a swimmer in Gaza to reach the Olympics.“There is not a single pool in Gaza that hits international standards. With our infrastructure problems it makes it even harder. It would be a major achievement to have a female swimmer here because of the lack of resources,” he told The Independent.The Israeli blockade also restricts access to sports equipment. Mr Masalmeh claimed even iron goal posts were banned because the Israelis feared\u0026nbspthey could be used to make weapons.“Sports equipment gets stuck in the ports for year and does not reach the athletes. In addition, the Israelis have in the past banned players from leaving Gaza to participate in international tournaments,” he added.Nonetheless, Fatima hopes one day to get permission to leave Gaza and take her place at the Games.“I want to achieve my dream to be picked for the Olympics, so I can travel and compete in the 100m race,” she said, putting on her swimming pyjamas.“I don’t just want to participate, I want to get first place,\u0026nbspso those who picked me are proud.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

She would have let Charlotte run riot in her bedroom, trying on all her designer clothes and shoes and raiding her make-up bag.It’s so tragic that all of these happy times were not to be. When William saw all of his children come into the world, most especially baby Charlotte, he must have felt the loss of his mother even more keenly.Diana would have been there with her arms full of presents, and not just for the babies. There would have been thoughtful gifts for Kate and lots of hugs and happy tears.You can well picture her ­giving newlywed Harry a cheeky nudge and telling him to “get on with it” so she could have more grandchildren to spoil.I also think that if Diana had still been alive this sad situation between Meghan Markle and her dad would never have been allowed to turn so toxic.Diana would have seen this potential problem looming even before the engagement was announced and nipped it firmly in the bud.She would have insisted and ensured he was invited to the UK and would have dispensed shrewd and invaluable advice on how to deal with all of the hoopla surrounding the wedding. Diana learned the hard way how to deal with the media and palace officials. She was misquoted, manipulated and misunderstood during her time as a royal wife and knew all the pitfalls and how to avoid them.Skittish Meghan would have been soothed and calmed and all of the bad feeling among the Markle family would have surely evaporated.Diana would have advised Meghan’s dad on his wedding suit, helped him with his speech and rehearsed him walking down the aisle.She would have put this rather shy and ordinary man completely at ease.Rather than watching his daughter getting married on TV while cowering in a cheap bed and breakfast in the US, he would have been an integral part of the happiest day of her life.Instead, we have a constant stream of ill-advised interviews given by Thomas where he appears to have been ignored and abandoned and, whether it’s fair or not, Meghan seems increasingly cold-hearted.Photos yesterday of. him celebrating his 74th birthday alone with just a fast food takeaway for company don’t exactly help, whether they were staged again or not.A present, phone call or card from Meghan would have gone a long way to build bridges.It’s all turning a tawdry soap opera meaning commentators such as Sharon Osbourne will keep the pot boiling.Just this week she inferred Thomas has a drink problem and should get clean, ensuring more lurid headlines and bad feeling as he furiously has to deny all of the allegations.No one is coming out of this well and never has Princess Diana been more missed.Harry needs her wise counsel and William knows what an important part she could have played in the lives of his ­children.I know her sons will never really get over her death, but I do hope when William looks into his daughter’s beautiful eyes he is heartened to see a reflection of his mum rather than finding it ­unbearably sad.THE way BBC News treated Cliff Richard was utterly shameful and I’m not in the least surprised it lost its court case.The poor man went through years of hell and became a virtual recluse – and his physical and mental health was profoundly affected.At a time when he should have been enjoying the rewards of a lifetime’s graft, he was enduring sleepless nights and often crying in anguish on the kitchen floor.Many in the media have expressed fear and disquiet that any sort of Cliff’s Law will mean restrictions on newspapers, radio and TV, and this is indeed troubling.But the blame should be pointed firmly at those who thought it was a good idea to send a helicopter to film and report an OTT police raid on an innocent man.Seeing Cliff outside the courtroom this week looking extremely fragile and on the verge of tears was heartbreaking.Clearly the sunny, friendly, optimistic Peter Pan of Pop has gone for good and in his place is a haggard, careworn, wary victim.Before the court case, Cliff told me he doesn’t have photos taken with fans and their children any more.It was painful to see the hurt and mistrust in his eyes.He then revealed this week that his VIP status meant he was allowed to use the secret Wimbledon tunnel under Centre Court and Court No1 to bounce quickly between both venues and view as much tennis as possible.Cliff doesn’t do that any more, and never will, because the tunnel goes past the ball boys’ changing area and he doesn’t want to put himself in a situation where he could potentially be accused of something unspeakable.I really hope that when enough time has passed he can get some of that old “glass half full” spirit back, but he will never be the person he was.And no one else should have to go through such a hideous ordeal when they have done nothing wrong.IF you don’t want to watch a movie that will make you laugh, cry and come out singing Abba songs, we can’t be friends.I thoroughly enjoyed Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again – a rare example of a sequel that is better than the original.The starry cast includes Meryl Streep, Julie Walters, PIerce Brosnan, Andy Garcia and Colin Firth. But the cherry on the icing on the cheesecake is the legend that is Cher.I was lucky enough to host the world premiere this week in London and had the chance to talk to the cast, who were effusive in their praise of Her Cherness.It was surprising to hear she STILL gets nervous before going on set and she was genuinely bewildered by all the love in the air for her.I thought one elderly gay gentleman was going to explode with happiness when Cher blew him a kiss.It was so endearing – and there is nothing more deliciously camp than Cher stepping out of a helicopter in a blonde wig and sequins before going on to sing Super Trouper. She’s a class act and a throughly lovely woman.WATCHING politicians squabble like ferrets in a sack soon loses its novelty value – and our eyes are now glazing over whenever the dreaded subject of Brexit rears its ugly head.But we should never forget that when we woke up the day after the referendum – to discover a majority had voted to leave the EU – there was NO actual plan.Bupkis. Nada. Zilch. Diddly-squat.There wasn’t even a “to do” list.Instead, all the rats deserted the sinking ship, claiming the dog had eaten their homework or a big boy did it and ran away – leaving the (female) PM to tidy up their reeking mess. Funny that.No matter which way you voted, surely we can all agree on one thing.There was little or no thought put into how to actually implement such a seismic change. Not even a few notes on the back of a fag packet.Now, two years down the line, the whole big, fat mess is farcical and beyond parody.As a nation, we are a laughing stock.Shame on all those careerists and fence-sitters for their arrogance, stupidity and downright mendacity in not having even a half-arsed plan in place.A parcel of rogues, right enough.IF you fancy a right good laugh at some silly, bonkers, hilarious fun and games, tune in to BBC1 today at 5.05pm for another helping of Wedding Day Winners with myself and Rob Beckett.One couple will actually get married at the end of the show and it’s all very lighthearted and joyful.DID Burberry REALLY need to make a bonfire of its overpriced designer swag and burn an eye-watering £28million worth of clothing and cosmetics?In line with other designer labels, the fashion house claims the move was to stop counterfeiters getting their hands on garments and using them to produce fakes.But surely that just doesn’t add up.If criminals want to reproduce any designer clothes or handbags, they can go into any shop and purchase something – or, even simpler, just order it online.Could Burberry not instead have the mother of all sales in aid of Help for Heroes, or for the homeless charity Centrepoint, or any number of deserving causes here and in the Third World?That £28million would have gone a hell of a long way to help those in need.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Politics is a man’s world and, to many, women still feel like token visitors.Even when Tony Blair famously had 101 “babes” in his 1997 intake of MPs, only four of his Cabinet appointments were female.Here we are, 20 years later, and yes, we have a female Prime Minister but there is still a prevailing view that the Cabinet, in particular, belongs to men.Clearly there’s something profoundly wrong with that equation.Given that this country is made up, more or less equally, of men and women, things would undoubtedly be fairer, not to mention calmer, if more women were on board.So the big question is, why aren’t there?Things are better than they were. Since the 2017 election there are 208 women in the Commons, up from 191 in 2015.But there are still not enough and you don’t have to look far for reasons why that might be.Most women are put off by the environment and the culture and wonder why on earth they would want to put themselves within a country mile of either.Take Prime Minister’s Question Time, which appears to be a bunch of overgrown public school boys booing, jeering and jostling with each other in their bid to establish who is top dog.What woman in her right mind would choose to enter that fray?Then there are the practicalities. This week, Lib Dem MP Jo Swinson was “cheated” in a crunch Brexit vote by the breaking of her pairing pact.This is an arrangement where one MP agrees not to vote to cancel out the fact that another MP on the opposite side is unable to vote — in this case Swinson was at home with her three-week-old baby.The problem was, her pairing partner reneged on the deal and voted.Then there are the hours, which can be difficult if you have a family. Any woman would need a very understanding partner and family to do the job.Also, any MP is opening themselves up to the line of fire and a lot of personal criticism — which multiplies for female MPs.Some have to deal with endless comments and speculation about their appearance, as well as threats of rape and death on a regular basis. Just this week a man was arrested over abusive Facebook posts aimed at various female MPs.If it’s true voters are biased against women, any female has to be ten times as talented, determined and tenacious to get the job in the first place.It’s no wonder women are put off entering politics.But if we want true equality then more women need to go into Westminster and the culture needs to change.That is why I support the campaign group Women To Win and will be taking part in an event called The Voice Of Women In Politics.The idea is to try to encourage more women into Parliament, outlining some of the changes that need to take place to raise the number of female candidates.Getting more women into politics is a no brainer.Women tend to work collaboratively to solve problems whereas — in my experience — men are more likely to lock horns, point fingers and try to shout the loudest. All too often men are interested in progressing to be a leader, whereas women are more focused on getting the job done.And when women DO find their voice in politics, it can be very powerful, and they often hae the balls to say things that men just wouldn’t.Look at Tory minister Anna Soubry, who this week suggested the PM should take control of her hardliner MPs and stop pandering to the likes of Jacob Rees-Mogg.I know she’s got a lot on her plate at the moment, but if I was Theresa May I would be spending a good proportion of my time and energy on making real changes to politics in order, specifically, to attract many more women.It could be one of the greatest legacies she could hope for.Thomas Markle is a concerned dad who just wants to be reconnected with his daughter.Meanwhile this HALF-sister has turned a constant shade of green and wants to get involved in any way she can.Is it any wonder she wasn’t invited to the wedding?MY heroine of the week is 21-year-old Emilia Holden a waitress in Georgia, US, who was at the end of a shift when a customer casually grabbed her bottom as he walked past.Her response? She followed him, grabbed him and body slammed him to the ground, then called the police – after which he spent two nights in a police cell.What a fantastic response. Good for her.But also, who are these men that think that they can just grab a woman’s behind just because they want to?But hearing about elaborate plans by Pixie Lott which include a total of 18 bridesmaids all wearing the same dress, left me feeling a bit stressed out.Apart from anything else, it will take them all an hour to travel up the aisle.JAMES GODDARD-WATTS, the businessman whose family founded the hardware firm Screwfix, is still locked in a multi-million pound divorce battle with his ex-wife, Julia.They reached an agreement eight years ago ­– following the end of a 13-year marriage – that Mrs Goddard-Watts should get a £3.25million house and a £4million lump sum.But she complained that Mr Goddard-Watts had not revealed the full extent of his wealth at the time of the settlement and court fights began.Critics say Julia is a leech, greedy and after his money.But when you consider the worth and value of building a home, looking after children and a family while supporting a spouse, that should be worth at least half of whatever the partner who didn’t do all of that has earned in the meantime.So why shouldn’t she take him back to court?The law states that assets are divided equally.So people who hide theirs from their spouse only have themselves to blame if said spouse feels forced to take them to court to get what’s fair.ELLE Macpherson’s diet regime is enough to make me reach for the pizza delivery menu.The model is up at 5am. She has warm water, lemon and cayenne pepper.She has no booze, almost no carbs, no meat and no dairy. She is such a follower of the alkaline diet – based on the theory you can change the pH of your body through food – that she checks the acidity of her urine.I’m sure the diet is good for her – but who wants to add years to your life if those years are going to be so, well, dull?“The only chance I have of being on TV again is if I were very ugly,” he said.“I think only old, ugly women can get on TV. Like Mary Beard.”David added that he would only be hired now: “If I had tombstone teeth and rather funny hair and made a lot of noise about that fact.”Oh dear.Where even to start?

And you can see why.This shameful decision led to an angry clash outside the Commons chamber where Jewish MP Margaret Hodge confronted Jeremy Corbyn, allegedly calling him an anti-Semite and a racist.Hodge lost family in the Holocaust and fought off the BNP in her Barking and Dagenham constituency.Instead of acknowledging her pain and offering to sit down with her, Team Corbyn are taking disciplinary action against her.I bet they deal with her far quicker than they did with Ken Livingstone, who couldn’t stop banging on about Hitler.What dark times for Labour, which once had a proud tradition of fighting racism. They must sort it out.Then we have the Lib Dems, who have proved useless. They have one policy — stop Brexit.Yet leader Vince Cable and ex-leader Tim Farron missed crucial votes on Monday. Talk about Dem and Dumber.To top it all off, the DUP’s Ian Paisley Jnr has been suspended for 30 days — which hasn’t happened since 1949 — for failing to declare lavish holidays to that well-known Northern Irish stakeholder, Sri Lanka.And to think Theresa May planned to give MPs an extra five days off as a reward for all their hard work.The country has had enough of these fools’ infighting, incompetence and filling their boots. Especially when we face so many big problems, from NHS funding to housing.Parliament’s end-of-term report is a big, fat fail. British politics should be taken into special measures.THE premiere of Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again was sun-kissed, frothy fun –  and no one mentioned the ­Customs Union. Bliss.The stars were out in full, including Cher. She is magnificent, but it is a little odd that at 72 she has fewer wrinkles than any other cast member, including 29-year-old Lily James. And the baby.She told Lorraine Kelly it was down to not drinking, smoking or doing drugs. Yeah, right.We women may be naive when it comes to the quest for eternal beauty, but we ain’t stupid.WHEN you hear of people getting up in the middle of the night and queuing, you think of the Boxing Day sales or the release of the latest Apple gadget.You don’t think of childcare.Yet more than 100 parents queued from 3am – armed with chairs, flasks and biscuits – trying to bag their child a coveted place in the breakfast club at a primary school in Cardiff.For many working parents, breakfast clubs are a lifeline.They can drop off the children in a safe environment where they can get a decent breakfast, then make it to work on time themselves.Though parents have the right to request flexible working hours, many fear the sack if they come in late.These spaces were limited and dished out on a first-come, first-served basis, which is why the parents took such drastic measures.This shows how desperate parents are for childcare that matches their working hours.The scrapping of Labour’s extended school programme and the first real-terms cuts to schools mean all these extras that were provided are no longer affordable.Childcare isn’t a luxury.It’s a necessity for millions of families and they are crying out for more breakfast and after-school clubs.JEFF BEZOS, the boss of Amazon, is a man clearly in his “Prime”.He’s now the richest man in modern history.Good for him.I’m all for celebrating entrepreneurs and hard work – but shouldn’t that apply to his poor workers toiling away in his warehouses?They would probably give Amazon working conditions zero stars.I wish our business leaders remembered some of their forefathers, who felt a moral and civic responsibility to look after their employees and took some pride in that.It makes business sense too. Happy workers are better workers.So after Bezos pops open the champagne, maybe he could spare a thought for his staff, who told an undercover reporter they pee in bottles because the loos are too far away and they are afraid of being accused of time-wasting.C’mon, Jeff – that’s really taking the p**s. ONE school in Liverpool had to apologise after kids as young as four were left in tears when they were denied an ice cream treat because they didn’t have a 97 per cent attendance record.How mean is that? What if they were ill? And surely it’s the parents’ fault.CARERS got another kick in the teeth this week when the Court of Appeal overturned a decision that those doing sleep-in shifts should earn at least the minimum wage.If the decision had gone through, it would have cost the UK care sector billions – so charities and local governments were relieved.But it shows what a raw deal carers get.Judges said only hours spent awake counted as work – but that is completely out of touch with the reality of what carers do.Many of the elderly and vulnerable people they look after need their help through the night, whether it’s a trip to the loo, to take medication or dealing with more serious situations such as seizures. Carers can’t exactly fall into a deep sleep. They have to be alert and listening in case they are needed.The rooms they sleep in may not be comfortable and they will be away from their own families.Many carers are paid so little that they live hand to mouth and barely get by.When I met a group in the West Midlands, they told me they couldn’t afford to put the heating on in winter and had to take their kids to the grandparents’ for tea once or twice a week just so they would be fed.Some were struggling so much they had to visit food banks.But they also loved their jobs and took great pride in looking after their clients as if they were family.They get paid a pittance, with some earning just £30 for a ten-hour shift.These low-paid workers – the majority of whom are women – are unsung heroes and deserve more.New Health Secretary Matt Hancock must make social care a priority and enforce minimum-wage law properly.It’s time we took better care of our carers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently , or you can split the payments if youre part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £348 if youre single, £464 if youre part of a couple or £812 if you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, even if you stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Payments if your payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free. You can find your nearest one on the Trussel Trust website.The Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey has admitted there are problems with the system but is determined to continue with the rollout.A spokesperson from the DWP said: Universal credit is a flexible and responsive benefit and we continue to listen to feedback and make any necessary improvements during the rollout with our test-and-learn approach.We are committed to ensuring people get the help they need and the majority of staff say universal credit gives them greater flexibility to give people the right support. The latest figures show 83% of claimants are satisfied with the system and complaint rates are low."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Corb1.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"jeremy corbyn says hes always calm and never loses his temper but heres all the times he exploded when asked questions he doesnt like","story":"He claimed yesterday that he was deeply upset at being called a f***ing anti-Semite and racist by veteran MP Margaret Hodge.The Labour boss added: Im, as always, very calm and I always treat people with a great deal of respect.I dont shout at people, I just listen to what they have to say.But actually Mr Corbyn has a long track record of suddenly snapping - and lashing out in public when hes faced with awkward questions.He started showing his angry streak when he first became a high-profile figure, running for the leadership in 2015.Asked by Channel 4 News whether his links to Holocaust deniers were a misjudgement, Mr Corbyn snapped: Im sorry, youre putting an awful lot of words in my mouth.The same year, the MP accused presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy of tabloid journalism while he was grilled over economic and foreign policy.In 2016, journalists approached Mr Corbyn outside his London home to ask about David Camerons tax arrangement.But he refused to answer questions and shouted Get out of my way! as he cycled off on his bike.As Mr Corbyn reached his lowest point in early 2017, when he was widely expected to be forced out, he repeatedly lost his rag in public.Asked by Sky News if he was planning to stay in office, the Labour leader snarled: Ive given you a very, very clear answer, yes!In a BBC interview, he refused five times to say whether he expected to win the snap election.And he lost his temper with ITV - accusing the journalist involved of trying to distract from Labours policies by asking about his leadership.Mr Corbyn added: You are obsessed with this question, if I may say so - utterly obsessed with it.Despite having had more success over the past year, the Labour boss remains touchy when hes asked questions he doesnt like.Quizzed by Dutch TV earlier this month, he shouted down the interviewer because she dared to ask why he skipped a pro-EU demo in London."},{"url":null,"title":"uk sizzles on hottest day of the year but hilarious memes show brits cant stand the heat","story":"Today has officially been dubbed the hottest day of the year so far, with temperatures reaching a balmy 33.3C in Suffolk.Yet despite the glorious sunshine, many have been struggling to cope with the stifling heat.The near unbearable conditions have prompted disgruntled Brits to share exactly how they feel with many posting memes of how they are coping - or not as the case may be.Even Louis Tomlinson, from One Direction, proclaimed that he too was done with the hot weather.Here we round-up some of the funniest reactions to the rising temperatures - as forecasters warn the heat could reach a scorching 35C by Friday. "},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000393739255.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"ipsa mps expenses legal action","story":"The Sun can reveal that the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) has given up chasing expenses owed by 15 MPs who lost their seats in last year’s General Election - because of the legal costs in chasing them.The revelation comes just days after MPs sparked fury by voting through a new code that will grant politicians anonymity for expenses wrongdoing and sexual harassment.The £35,000 of debt was 12 times as much as MPs owed the previous year.In 2016/17 a total of £4,000 of debt owed by 10 MPs was written off.MPs owe the money from when they used their Parliament-issued credit card to claim personal or political purposes - such as hotels in London or for bills that fall outside strict spending rules.Ipsa can recover the money from their salary if MPs fail to repay the debt but that becomes harder after MPs are booted out by voters.An Ipsa source said: “We’re no longer able to recover those costs and the cost of legal action doesn’t make it viable.”Ipsa said it would only name and shame the former MPs in November.But campaigners said it was scandalous that while ordinary Brits are harassed and put in prison for debt and unpaid taxes, MPs get away scot-free.James Price from the Taxpayers Alliance fumed: “This is a classic case of one rule for them and another for the rest of us, and people will rightly be furious with such unfairness.“If ordinary taxpayers dont pay their taxes they will be put in prison if former MPs dont then they get away with keeping our money!“It is this kind of behaviour that makes people so distrustful of politics and politicians, and these ex-MPs should repay the money they owe immediately.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Police were given a 1 per cent pay rise with a 1 per cent bonus for 2017-2018.NHS workers were given a 6.5 per cent pay rise over three years in March.The professions covered by today’s announcement include the Armed Forces, teachers, doctors, dentists, police officers and prison guards.Today’s move comes after Britain’s biggest civil service union – the PCS – was forced to drop plans for a national strike over pay.Only 41 per cent of its members bothered to vote in a strike ballot – below the minimum 50 per cent threshold. Some 85 per cent of those who did vote backed industrial action.But PCS chief Mark Serwotka admitted the union may now have to consider smaller scale strikes in certain Government departments.He stormed: “Our members have delivered a huge yes vote for strike action and will feel palpable anger at not being able to exercise their democratic right to withdraw their labour.”GOT a story?

The spread of social media and other online communication, with its inherent anonymity, has only increased the misery for victims.But the speed of change has not been matched by a more robust framework to deal with it.Yes, we have tougher sentences — the Government was absolutely right to last year double jail terms for the worst cases from five to ten years.But progress has been too slow in recognising these crimes.In 2016-17, fewer than 1,000 prosecutions were commenced under stalking legislation.It was horrifying to read the account of Nicola Roberts from Girls Aloud yesterday.She told how she faced a barrage of more than 3,000 texts over five years from an ex-boyfriend, including threats to stab and burn her.Soon after being handed a lifetime restraining order, her ex began following her on Instagram.He “wanted me to know he was still watching me”, she said, chillingly.And yet the CPS saw no realistic chance of a successful prosecution for stalking because the social media activity was not taken sufficiently seriously, despite the obvious impact on Nicola’s life.As she put it: “I should be able to move on from an unhealthy relationship if I want and that’s not been able to happen.”She wants change — and she is right to.These kinds of messages leave you in fear for your life — feeling that someone is watching or following you is immensely distressing.A bunch of flowers is not a romantic gesture when sent by a stalker but a reminder that your persecutor is still watching and can still reach you.Stalking is a crime of obsession and fixation and it needs to be stopped before it becomes deeply ingrained.No legislation will be effective unless it is accompanied by training at the front line of policing and across the wider courts system.Victims must have the confidence to come forward at an earlier stage, for all forms of stalking to be recognised for what they are. It is my intention to make this happen.My Stalking Protection Bill will introduce so-called Stalking Protection Orders (SPOs) to help fill some of the gaps in the law.It will allow the police to act more quickly and to protect victims of so-called stranger stalking, where the stalker is not a former partner.Importantly, it will also take the onus off the victim to have to take action, as is currently the case for stranger stalking. At present many victims are left unprotected because they have to put protective measures in place for themselves, such as applying for a civil injunction to restrain someone from harassing them.Needless to say, many victims find this such a daunting task — not to mention expensive and time-consuming — that they end up not going through with it.If passed, the Stalking Protection Bill would allow the police to apply for an SPO through the magistrates’ courts on behalf of victims.Orders will require the civil standard of proof “on the balance of probabilities” but breach of an order would be a criminal offence, punishable in the most serious cases by a term of up to five years in prison.SPOs could set out requirements prohibiting certain behaviours, such as contacting the victim either directly or indirectly.It would be able to prohibit behaviours such as driving past the victim’s house, harassing friends, colleagues or family members, going within a certain distance of the victim or following them online.It could also set out so called positive requirements, such as attending a psychiatric assessment.In this digital age, the law would cover online contact from abroad and require that any IT equipment would be free from encryption, so perpetrators could not cover their tracks.Unlike the now-abandoned Police Information Notices, SPOs will have teeth, as they would be enforceable and breaching the terms of an order would have consequences.SPOs would also require stalkers to register all the names they use, as well as their address.While SPOs will provide better early intervention to protect victims, they are not intended to replace full prosecution for an offence of stalking.They will, however, enable police to better protect the safety of victims while gathering the full evidence for the CPS to prosecute a full stalking case.The Bill has almost completed its Commons journey but will not now return to the Chamber until late November.When the case for change is so pressing, and the Bill is backed by members across the House, I believe the Government should bring forward the final Commons stage so we can get on with delivering this vital change to the law — which will help to save lives.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Bicester in Oxfordshire, boasts 11 bedrooms, an orangery, a roof terrace and a wine cellar.It also has a mile-long drive, landscaped gardens set in 194 acres and a riverside treehouse.The Mail Online reports how Birmingham-born businessman Cash became a millionaire in his 20s.He is reported to have had properties all over the world after amassing an estimated £500million fortune.The 54-year-old lived in the plush home with fourth wife Carla and their two children - as well as owning a £10million home overlooking Regents Park.The mansion was built in the late 1700s by renowned architect John Yenn.But he was declared bankrupt at Oxford County Court last week after he was found liable for fraudulent misrepresentation.A case brought by his butler and housekeeper, who unsuccessfully claimed to have been unfairly dismissed, heard how Cash would blow £50,000 a month on groceries.He went broke as a teen but clawed his way back and went on to make millions after starting his career selling frozen food.Cash then started buying up prime London properties and investing in internet firms - including the Bluestar property group, which buys and sells London residences.But he now owes more than £40million to creditors, with HMRC estimating he owes £13million in unpaid tax.The Mail Online reports the property is said to be owned by the Rose Trust, established by Cash’s parents, Barry and Sheila.This means it is not one of his personal assets like his Regents Park home, which has been seized by the bank.The mansion has its own leisure complex with a swimming pool tennis court and billiards room.There is a spiral staircase winding up from the hallway and French windows looking out onto the lawns from the dining area.The mansion was built in the late 1700s by renowned architect

nuclear sites","story":"Photos of its bomb factories in ruins and major nuke facility deserted come around a month after tyrant Kim Jong-un promised Donald Trump he would denuclearise.An important picture from the Punggye-ri nuclear test, in the north-east of the country, site shows a building where space launch vehicles are prepared being torn down.They were taken by respected North Korean experts at 38 North, who said a rocket engine test stand, used to develop liquid-fuel engines for ballistic missiles and space launch vehicles, was also being disassembled.Its claims were backed up by unnamed South Korean officials who confirmed they have noticed key facilities being dismantled.But other analysts remain sceptical about Kims motives, suggesting it would not diminish the reclusive nations nuclear or military capabilities.Experts at the 38 North think-tank said the images represent a significant confidence-building measure on the part of North Korea.That is because the facilities are widely believed to have played an important role in the development of technologies for its intercontinental ballistic missile program.It follows other satellite images from May, which appeared to show the country had already begun dismantling its nuclear test site.These efforts may even have made its neighbours and historic enemies in the South less nervous: They recently reduced the number of guards along the demilitarised zone on the border.More sceptical experts fear Pyongyang could be using this token gesture to build trust with Washington to resolve the nuclear standoff and reduce sanctions.Other analysts said North Korea was giving up little in dismantling the rocket engine test site when it was clear the country was satisfied with its existing long-range weapons.It is also troubling the North has apparently been allowed to duck verification by dismantling facilities without the presence of international inspectors, according to defence analyst Adam Mount.In May, North Korea invited foreign journalists to observe the destruction of tunnels at its nuclear testing ground but did not invite independent experts capable of certifying what had been destroyed.North Korea claimed it carried out the planned demolition of its Punggye-ri nuclear test site in the presence of foreign journalists.The destruction of the infamous site, which lies deep in the mountains of the rogue states north-east, took place hours before before Kims meeting with Trump was cancelled by the US President.Dramatic footage showed smoke and debris exploding into the air as barracks buildings for guards and tunnel workers at the nuclear test site were blown up.The move was not irreversible and was expected to be followed by many more significant measures to meet Americas demands for denuclearisation.After their summit in Singapore on June 12, Trump said Kim told him the North was already destroying a major missile engine testing site without identifying which one.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the US would only accept complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation.He went on to say the US would offer unique security guarantees to provide North Korea with certainty... that denuclearisation is not something that ends badly for them.Kim vowed to destroy all his nukes, claiming the process would start very quickly, but no time frame was agreed, nor ironclad accord signed.The two leaders concluded their summit by declaring a vague aspirational goal of moving toward a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.Kim proudly declared his country has become a nuclear state after launching a new missile capable of hitting anywhere on earth in November.He boasted about the hermit nations military might after supervising the successful launch of a more powerful ICBM Hwasong-15.State-run TV described the nation as a responsible nuclear power, saying its strategic weapons were developed to defend itself from the nuclear blackmail policy of the US.Donald Trump reacted to that launch by attacking the Democrats and ranting about illegal immigration.It is unclear how many nukes North Korea actually has but US officials have estimated 60, while experts claim it has enough uranium to produce six new ones every year.In September, it carried out its sixth nuclear test by detonating what it claimed was a hydrogen bomb, which caused a 6.3-magnitude earthquake.The tremor from the bomb, which can be 1,000 times more powerful than the one US dropped on Hiroshima in WWII, could be felt 248 miles from the test site in China."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/07/2048x1152/skynews-lorry-gridlock_4369997.jpg?20180724102537 ","title":"businesses step up plans to avoid gridlocked ports after brexit","story":"However,

The Labour leader will say the plummeting value of the pound was a chance to help British exports - but the Tories squandered it. Mr Corbyn\u0027s remark risks a row with hard Remain-backers in his own party. In February they criticised his vow to spend funds returned from Brussels. Labour\u0027s leader will make the comments in a major speech today unveiling a party plan to boost British manufacturing.

But Mr Corbyn is also set to point out how the pound, worth $1.50 days before the EU referendum, fell to $1.32 overnight when the Brexit vote became clear.  He will add: Our exporters should be able to take proper advantage of the one benefit to them that Brexit has already brought - a more competitive pound.  After the EU referendum result, the pound became more competitive and that should have helped our exporters.  But they are being sold out by a lack of a Conservative Government industrial plan, which has left our economy far too reliant on imports. Mr Corbyn will hit back at Tory claims he wants a magic money tree by claiming magical thinking about the economy has dominated 40 years of government.

It is still not known exactly who made the request through a British casting agency - or whether the crowd was meant to be for or against the Emir of Qatar. But it led to part-time actors and movie extras being asked to fill space outside Downing Street for \u0026pound20 a head. Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani is due to meet Theresa May at No10 today to strengthen ties between the UK and the Gulf.

The company are looking for a large group of people to fill space outside Downing Street during the visit of the president of Quatar [sic]. You will not have to do or say anything, they just want to fill space. After a backlash yesterday, Extra People said a junior staff member had accepted the request from a separate firm in an error of judgement. The casting agency cancelled the request and informed its lawyers.   Extra People named the firm which made the original request as Neptune PR Ltd, which was only set up three months ago and is registered at the same address as a virtual office hub in London\u0027s Old Street. A person answering the phone at the virtual office firm told the Mirror there were no other companies based permanently in the building, and no companies signed up to its services would be physically based there.

Teachers, soldiers and prison officers were promised months ago that the 1% cap on public sector pay rises would finally end. But they\u0027ve had to wait until today, hours before MPs leave for their summer holiday, for the details to be rushed out by the government with no debate. Labour have summoned ministers to an urgent debate in the Commons, warning the sudden flurry could be a bid to escape criticism of the pay rises. After all, even if pay rises are above inflation - ranked as 2.3% including housing costs in June 2018 - they come after years of pay freezes, so wages won\u0027t have recovered yet in reality.  And first details emerging suggested ministers weren\u0027t quite providing everything their independent pay review bodies asked for. Rehana Azam of the GMB union said: One million public sector workers have been left in limbo by this cloak and dagger briefing on the last day of Parliament. “This is not the way to treat dedicated public sector workers who have already suffered eight years of real terms pay cuts. “They haven’t even made a proper announcement - it just shows how out of touch Theresa May is. “In another cynical bid to save her own skin, she is riding roughshod over the proper pay mechanisms - which should independently review public sector wages.

John Major’s Government made a $40billion bid to prop up the pound in the financial fiasco which saw interests rates hiked from 10% to 15% in a single day. Following the dramatic events of September 16 1992, Chancellor Norman Lamont was under pressure to spell out how much of Britain’s foreign currency reserves were pumped into the failed operation to prevent sterling crashing out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM). Publicly, he insisted no government would reveal such information. But papers released by the National Archives show that behind the scenes, he was “increasingly anxious” about the way the true state of the reserves was being concealed. The failure to prevent sterling plunging from the ERM - which pegged its value to the Deutschmark - was a personal humiliation for Mr Major. As Chancellor, he took Britain into the ERM just two years earlier.  Figures finally released by the Treasury in 2005 under the Freedom of Information Act showed that in the course of August and September 1992, the Bank of England sold almost $40billion dollars in foreign currency as the pound came under sustained attack from foreign speculators. The final cost of the operation was estimated at \u0026pound3.3billion. But while Treasury reserves dropped from $18 billion dollars to a negative balance of $16billion dollars, official figures at the time showed only a “minimal” loss of $2billion. Precise details of what happened were spelled out in a letter to No 10 from Mr Lamont’s private secretary Jeremy Heywood - now the Cabinet Secretary - dated November 26, 1992 outlining the Chancellor’s strategy for rebuilding the reserves. The government had disguised the amount of additional borrowing required, partly through creating a “secret negative forward book”, to buy back foreign exchange through “forward swaps” worth around $12.5billion. Once the crisis was over, the opaque manner in which the operation was conducted meant the only way of running down the forward book was through a “non-publicised” programme of using sterling to buy back foreign currency - known as “creaming off”. “In principle the forward book could be run down either by public borrowing or lower gross reserves but having consciously disguised this part of the September’s operations it would now be very difficult to explain the real reason why we were now undertaking further borrowing or revealing lower gross reserves,” the letter states. “That points to non-publicised ‘creaming off’ as the only acceptable approach - it is also the only way the net reserve position can be improved.” The Bank was “very cautious” about the tactic fearing it could lead to further falls in the pound, fuelling inflation. In an accompanying memo, Mary Francis in the No 10 private office notes: “He (Mr Lamont) is increasingly anxious about the way it is being used to conceal the actual state of the reserves.”  James Callaghan secretly urged officials to find ways of ousting left-wing trade union leaders causing trouble for the government “by one means or another”, according to bombshell official papers released today(TUES). Files show that as Home Secretary in Harold Wilson’s Labour government, Mr Callaghan was deeply concerned about the rise of a new generation of “politically motivated” workers’ chiefs. In particular he singled out Jack Jones, the general secretary of the giant Transport and General Workers Union, and Hugh Scanlon, the leader of the engineering workers. Senior officials suggested undermining those with suspected communist leanings through “inspired leakages” to the press. Officials were reluctant to act, fearing it could revive the controversy which erupted three years earlier when Mr Wilson denounced the leaders of a strike by seamen as “a tightly knit group of politically motivated men” - triggering claims ministers were using MI5 to spy on unions. They did however suggest one possible course of action, noting: “Sir Denis Barnes said, however, that detailed exposure of Jones’ behaviour from time to time, perhaps by way of inspired leakages to the press, might be useful and productive.” The details are disclosed in a note of a meeting between the Cabinet Secretary Sir Burke Trend, the head of the Department of Employment Sir Denis Barnes, and James Waddell, a senior Home Office official, headed “Communism in Industry”. Dated March 5, 1969, it is marked “Secret and Personal” with only one copy to be retained. It notes: “Sir Burke Trend recalled that the Home Secretary apparently had in mind that it might be possible by one means or another for the more ‘politically motivated’ trade union leaders - in particular Mr Scanlon and Mr Jack Jones - to be supplanted by others more orthodox and it had been envisaged that further consideration might perhaps be given to this possibility.” Mr Callaghan’s struggles with the unions were widely blamed for the fall of his government 10 years later following the strikes of the “winter of discontent” The file also includes a note from Foreign Secretary George Brown to Mr Wilson explaining how the English Section of the Foreign Office’s secretive Information Research Department (IRD) - set-up to counter Soviet Cold War propaganda - carried out such selective briefings. “By discreet dissemination of such papers to trusted contacts, eg to various Labour Party officials at Transport House over the years, and to selected journalists, the English Section has done much to expose the activities of Communist front organisations in Britain,” Mr Brown said. The files also show how, in 1974, the BBC director general Charles Curran invited the IRD to brief the Board of Governors on “the influence of subversive movements” in the field of broadcasting - although, with a general election looming, officials were doubtful about the idea. “A leak that HMG was briefing the BBC on subversion might rebound in some perverse way related to the ‘reds under beds’ aspects of the last election period, and at any time it could be distorted into allegations of attempts to bring political influence to bear on the impartiality of the BBC,” one warned. The files show that Mr Wilson was not the only prime minister concerned about subversive influence. In 1985 Margaret Thatcher authorised the revival of the secretive Whitehall Subversion in Public Life committee - including spies from MI5 - amid fears the Militant Tendency was trying to infiltrate the Civil Service. The PM was said to be “somewhat disquieted” to find there were an estimated 1,400 MT members in the Civil Service - some in the ranks of management. They showed themselves capable of causing disruption “out of all proportion to their numbers”, documents reveal. Mrs Thatcher’s private secretary Nigel Wicks wrote she believed managers needed to be “very ready to sack subversive troublemakers if they showed any cause under Civil Service rules”.

That\u0027s been a piece of advice passed around for years, with some arguing that a hot drink like tea or coffee can help to lower the body\u0027s temperature. But is it true, and it is more effective than what we\u0027re really in the mood for - a freezing cold beverage clinking with ice cubes? Public Health England advise people to avoid drinking too much caffeine or alcohol - or eating too much - during heatwaves as this can raise the body\u0027s temperature. Drink cold drinks regularly, such as water and diluted fruit juice. Avoid excess alcohol, caffeine - tea, coffee and cola - or drinks high in sugar, adds the NHS .  But it turns out that, while those are obviously sensible measures, a hot drink on a cool day really can cool you down. According to a study from the University of Ottawa’s School of Human Kinetics: “If you drink a hot drink, it does result in a lower amount of heat stored inside your body, provided the additional sweat that’s produced when you drink the hot drink can evaporate,” researcher Ollie Jay told Smithsonian . The study, carried out in 2012, revealed that when you drink a hot drink, because it\u0027s hotter than your body temperature, you sweat more.

In a video released by the Royal Family, the world famous building\u0027s labyrinth of corridors is showcased on an epic scale. It shows how staff navigate the winding hallways leading to the Chinese Drawling Room, where royal functions are often held. The clip also looks at Buckingham Palace\u0027s lift system and how revamp work currently underway plans on making travelling around the 515 metres of corridor to the drawing room eaiser. The palace has nine lifts, many of which are old and too small for purpose, according to lead architect Tony Barnard.  He claimed the updated lift system would allow staff more practical and efficient journeys to the Chinese Drawing Room in the future, as well as making the building more accessible for wheelchair users. The Royal Family tweeted the clip with a message reading: Many of the lifts at the Palace are old and impractical - here\u0027s how staff currently navigate from the kitchens to the palace\u0027s Chinese Drawing Room for functions. Along with a sneak peak inside the corridors and grand drawing room, the clip also featured scenes in less ornate parts of the palace, which was built in 1703. It showed where butlers spend time in the basement, preparing for events and functions upstairs.  Architects are also using laser technology to create hi-tech images of the palace\u0027s interior. Known as \u0027Point Cloud\u0027 technology, the cameras allow architects to see the palace without any of its interior walls - offering a clearer map how its 400 rooms relate to one another. The eye-watering \u0026pound369 million revamp project began in April 2017 and will be paid for by taxpayers via the Sovereign Grant - an annual fee paid to the monarch by the Government. While rewiring and lift work has already began, the entire project is expected to take 10 years - finishing in April 2017. A statement about the work posted on the Royal Family\u0027s website said: The Palace\u0027s electrical cabling, plumbing and heating have not been updated since the 1950s.

The heatwave is no fun for anyone, but there are a few things you can do to at least cool down your home. There\u0027s nothing worse than trying to nod off in your room, or trying to relax, while feeling like you\u0027re in the seventh circle of hell. Being in the midst of a heatwave is not as fun as it first sounds, especially without air con, but there are some things you can do to cool down your home and finally get some shut eye. Before we get to how to use a freezer to your advantage (not sticking your head in it) and getting as low as you can (no this isn\u0027t limbo), we have to acknowledge the quickest way is to get air con. Of course, the bad thing about getting air con is the cost - upfront and then running it - so here are a few quick tips and tricks to drop your home\u0027s temperature without spending too much.  Keep away from the satin and silk and opt for the cooler linen and cotton sheets. Light-coloured bed linen made of light fabrics (take Egyptian cotton for example) are breathable so better to sleep in. The Egyptians had it right, in fact, they even had their own method for keeping cool. Known as The Egyptian Method (original, we know) they\u0027d dampen a towel or sheet in cool water and use it as a blanket. It may be a good idea to lay the damp sheet on top of a towel first, no one likes a wet bed.  2. Freezer tricks Speaking of sheets, you can stick them in the freezer for a few minutes before you\u0027re about to go to sleep. No, we haven\u0027t lost our minds, just make sure you put them in something like a plastic bag before you pop them in. You don\u0027t want your sheets smelling of pizza and ice cream. The trick won\u0027t last all night but it will give you a breather so you can get to sleep. 3. Don\u0027t cook a roast  ...or any hot meal. Summer is never the time to be whipping up a casserole or hot meal. Put the slow cooker away, step away from the stove and have a salad.  4. Use that hot water bottle Buy yourself a hot water bottle. While we\u0027re used to filling them with hot water in the winter to keep toasty, in the summer sticking it in the freezer instead creates a lovely ice pack. 5. Turn your fan around Fans are great in the mild heat, but when it\u0027s cranked up they just blow hot air around so it\u0027s all about strategic placement. If you point them outside, slightly towards the windows, they push out the hot air. If you have a ceiling fan set them counter-clockwise to pull the hot air away.  We\u0027ve already mentioned fans, but there\u0027s so much more to be said. At school we used to use those little iceboxes to keep our food cool, so this idea comes from that. It\u0027s sort of a DIY aircon system. Use a roasting pan, or box and fill it with ice and put it in front of a fan. When the ice melts the breeze from the fan picks up the cool air coming from the ice\u0027s surface, creating a nice cool mist. 7. Cross breeze More of the fan tricks. Strategically place numerous fans around a room. Put a fan by the window, and then another further inside the room so they both push the cooler air around the room. 8. How low can you go Hot air rises so sleeping in a room on the ground floor means you\u0027ll feel cooler. If you\u0027re in a one-storey flat you can move your sheet to the ground to make life easier. 9. Don\u0027t get steamy  We imagine you\u0027re continually hopping in the shower to cool down, just make sure the water is tepid rather than warm/hot. Steam hangs about and makes a room that much hotter. 10. No lights This should make sense. Light bulbs - even if they\u0027re environmentally friendly - give off heat, so switch them off. The sun shines for longer now anyway so keeping the lights off not only saves on your energy bill, but cuts down on the extra heat. 11. Hang a wet sheet Yes, you read that right. Hanging a wet sheet in front of an open window will help bring down the room\u0027s temperature. 12. No electronic devices  The same applies here as the lights. Unplug your phone and devices, do not charge them when you are asleep. Everything radiates heat and you don\u0027t need that when you\u0027re trying to catch some zzzs. 13. Use grains Buckwheat pillows don\u0027t absorb heat like cotton does so getting one is a good investment for summer. 14. Closing curtains  In the daytime. If you think about when the sun is at its hottest those rays are coming through the window hotting everything up. Close the curtains and your room is instantly cooler.  15. Use your garden  If you plant the right trees and shrubs around the house they will provide you with much needed shade. Vines work well too. Of course that won\u0027t work for this summer, but next year you\u0027ll be thanking us. 16. Paint it white  Again, maybe one for next year, but painting your house white helps. The white colour reflects the light, cooling the house down. 17. Insulate  Long-term thinking again. When you think of insulation you probably think of keeping warm, but it can work the other way too. Good insulation keeps the heat out as well once the room is cooled down.

This heatwave doesn\u0027t seem to be letting up any time soon, but what\u0027s the best way to deal with it? You\u0027ve probably searched for all sorts of tips and tricks on coping with the warm weather, but have they been working for you? It\u0027s easy to fall for some of the most common heatwave myths as they often make a lot of sense.  To save you from falling for them, here\u0027s a look at some of the most common ones as shared by Public Health Matters , and the things you should try instead.   Opening windows will keep you cool inside In times of great heat, you might think the obvious solution is to throw open all the windows and create a breeze. However, if it\u0027s hotter outside than it is inside, you\u0027re probably just letting all the hot air into your home. The trick is to open the windows when the air outside feels cooler than the air inside your home, for example at night, but be aware of security concerns. To prevent heat entering your home through the windows, try covering those that are directly exposed to direct sunlight - you could do this with external shutters or shades.  If not, internal blinds or curtains are less effective but are cheaper and easier to install. You can also reduce heat accumulating indoors by turning off all non-essential electrical equipment. It\u0027s not always better to stay out of the sun Often during periods of high temperatures, we are told to stay indoors and out of the sun. But that\u0027s not always the best idea. Homes and buildings with air conditioning are likely to prove safer for some, but that doesn\u0027t mean other homes won\u0027t be overheating.  Top floor flats and single aspect flats are most at risk of this and residents may find it is cooler to go to a park where there is breeze and some shade, than stay at home. If you don\u0027t fancy going to the park, there are many air conditioned public buildings you can visit, such as museums or libraries. The best advice is to simply consider your own environment. There are various things you can do to keep your home as cool as possible and give yourself some respite from the heat. Sunburn is the biggest health worry in the sun Sunburn is definitely something we need to protect ourself from, but the heat itself poses a significant health risk.  People can become dehydrated very quickly and can develop other health related illnesses. The greatest health risks in hot weather are to those with underlying health problems (such as heart and lung conditions), older people and young children. This is because heat puts significant additional strains on their bodies and can cause major health problems, and can even kill. Only older people die in hot weather  Not true. Fit and healthy people can also succumb to heat illness in very high temperatures or when doing very strenuous activity, whether novices at the London marathon or professional cyclists in the Tour de France. There may also be hidden dangers you hadn\u0027t considered, for example risks of injury or drowning when swimming in rivers and reservoirs. White cotton is the best fabric to wear during a heatwave Natural fabrics such as linen and cotton are great during the heat as they absorb sweat and allow your skin to breathe. However it\u0027s not completely true you should always opt for white or light coloured clothing.  White is said to be a good choice if you\u0027re spending lots of time in direct sunlight as it will help reflect the heat, but if you\u0027re spending time in the shade black is the more effective colour to wear. This is because it radiates out heat into the environment, cooling you down. When you\u0027re hot drinking lots of cold water is a good idea It is a great idea to keep yourself hydrated, drinking lots of water. But if you down lots of icy water in a short period of time, you could make yourself ill.  Dr Sarah Jarvis, GP and clinical director of Patient.info, explained why to the Sun .   She said: If you drink something very cold, very quickly, the cold on the roof of your mouth stimulates the nerves around there. That in turn leads to rapid contraction, then expanding of the tiny blood vessels in your sinuses. The brain interrupts the messages from these nerves as coming from your forehead, because the same nerve supplies your forehead. She said this normally results in a sudden pain and it can make you feel lightheaded. Drinking hot drinks will help with the heat This one is an awkward one.  Drinking hot drinks will raise your body temperature making you sweat. Sweating cools you down because as the moisture evaporates it takes away some of the heat from your body. But sweating also means that you are losing liquid from your body, so you need to drink on more to stay hydrated. You should point your fan at yourself to cool down New Zealand-based eco design adviser, Nelson Lebo recommends turning the fan to face out the open window, instead of pointing it at yourself. The method works as the fan blows the warm air from your home outwards and pulls cooler air in.

The Met Office issued an amber warning, one off national emergency level, as the hot spell shows no sign of burning out with temperatures soaring towards 100F (38C). A plume of sweltering air dubbed the Mediterranean Melt is set to make Britain hotter than Jamaica by the end of the week. The blistering heat peaked at 92F (33.3C) at Santon Downham in Suffolk today – the hottest so far this year. But that is tipped to soar to at least 95F (35C) on Thursday and Friday in some parts. High temperatures are expected to stay for much of the school summer holiday. But as sunseekers flock to parks and beaches to enjoy the balmy weather, the heat is taking its toll as canals run dry, crops wilt and hosepipe bans begin.  Scorching sun was blamed for a grass fire near an airport runway today that threatened two empty planes nearby. No one was injured and fire crews quickly put out the flames at Bournemouth Airport in Dorset. The jets, believed to belong to Nigerian airline Azman Air, were being kept there for restoration work. The airport said: “The prolonged dry weather may well be a factor.” Some areas have had 54 dry days in a row, the Met Office said – a headache for farmers, who warn vegetable prices could rise as crops wilt. Carrot grower Rodger Hobson said his crop is down 30% on last year at his York farm – and warned of a shortage until next June. He added: “We normally plant in March and April, but because of the snow we didn’t get them planted until May. It’s not just the water shortage, it’s also the temperatures.It’s 25C and the carrots just wilt.” Other crops are suffering too, after recent warnings about lettuce and peas struggling to grow as they are unaccustomed to the heat.  Charles Bennett, of the family-run Sandy Lane Farm near Tiddington, Warwickshire, said: “Everyone is experiencing the same issues with certain crops. “I think it’s likely we’ll see the price of food go up and we’ll all end up paying a bit more.” The National Farmers’ Union has warned of crops “parched to the bone” and livestock farmers using winter rations – which will cause problems later in the year. Farmers have reported crops “shrivelling up” and dying in the heat. Temperatures are approximately 10C higher than average for the time of year.  Bookmaker Coral cut odds to 2-1 on breaking the 101.3F (38.5C) record set on August 10, 2003 at Brogdale, Kent. The Met Office tweeted today: “Our 6-30 day outlook for the UK suggests that for at least the next four weeks, temperatures will remain above average for most, with further spells of very warm or hot conditions probable.” It warned people to “either stay out of the sun or be sensible and don’t go out in the strongest sunshine hours (11am to 3pm)”.The warning applies mostly to southern and eastern England, where people are being urged to wear sun screen and lighter clothing, and to check on elderly relatives and neighbours. Health services are expecting a surge in sun stroke patients as advice to draw curtains and close windows was issued. The amber, or level three, warning comes when temperatures are predicted to hit 86F (30C) during the day, and 59F (15C) at night for at least two consecutive days. Many parts of the South and Midlands have had virtually no rainfall for almost two months.

The 19-year-old shot to fame on Instagram last year thanks to her bizarre selfies where she sported angular cheekbones, hollow cheeks and an extreme curving nose, that fans likened to the Hollywood actress. After going viral, Sahar reportedly claimed she had 50 surgeries and lost 40 kilos to get her distinctive look and mimic her idol. But she attracted lots of criticism with many people comparing her looks to Tim Burton\u0027s the Corpse Bride and many doubting if her looks were real, or just the result of digital trickery. After causing a flurry of internet speculation Sahar appeared to confirm she had had cosmetic surgery but insisted she never wanted to look like A-lister Jolie.   She told Russian website Sputnik News although she had some plastic surgeries, including rhinoplasty, liposuction and cosmetic procedures to give her fuller lips, her spooky looks were mostly down to make-up prosthetics and photoshop.  She also reportedly confirmed the suspicions of eagle-eyed social media users who claimed the photos were definitely digitally altered. She said: No. It is Photoshop and makeup. Every time I publish a photo I make my face more fun. It is my way of self-expression, a kind of art. My followers know that this is not my real face. I had no interest at all to be like Angelina Jolie, and I did not want to look like the character from \u0027Corpse Bride\u0027. I understand that I do have some similarities with them, but I am my own muse and I did not want to look like anyone. That was not my aim.

The founders of Panchavarnaswamy Temple, which was built during India\u0027s ancient Chola period, may have predicted the arrival of the bike by hundreds of years if these images are correct. Praveen Mohan, who found the carving and posted about it on his YouTube channel, said: In a dark corner on one of the walls we can see this amazing carving of a man riding a bicycle. Historians tell us the bicycle was invented in the 1800s, just 200 years ago, but how was this carved in this ancient temple which is about 2,000 years old? The world\u0027s first chain-driven bike was developed in around 1885.  Mr Mohan uploaded footage of the discovery online and, sure enough, the carving bears and uncanny resemblance to the kind of bike you\u0027d see today. But there is one possible explanation.

Two bears have been shot dead by hunters after a grieving father stumbled across the horrifying scene where at least 20 coffins had been ripped apart. The animals smashed through metal fences and ripped into the recently buried graves - which locals have claimed was down to lazy grave diggers not digging them deep enough. A video shows the carnage some five miles from Elizovo in remote Kamchatka region.  Hunters are now monitoring the graveyard amid fears that more bears were involved in the attack — and will return. Paw prints from the animals are visible at the site. Pavel Korotaev, who was visiting the graves of his children, said: “The bears even broke the metal fences. “Approximately 20 graves were ruined.  “I can’t be sure the total because I was afraid to go further. “A bear usually protects its prey, and does not leave it. “I was lucky, apparently, the animal was sleeping.” Local official Dmitry Shchipitsyn a team had been sent to assess the damage. “In our opinion, the reason that the bear unearthed the graves was that funeral agencies had done their work in a poor way.

Even Darren O’Dea has been helping me with my defending and Graham Gartland has helped a lot and every day I’m trying to learn.“If my chance comes I’ll back myself to do the best I can.”Curran came off the bench in the 4-0 win over Stirling last weekend and is hoping to make it appearance No 2 nice and quickly against the Pars on Sunday.He added: “Dunfermline have always been a strong team in the Championship, always competing to get promotion to the Premiership so it will be a good test after they beat Peterhead 3-0 the other night.“There was a great turnout to the Stirling game so, hopefully, we’ll get another good one this weekend.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b51aaeebafbd-480x564.jpg ","title":"betfred cup ties remain vital as dundee united work to get going","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFor Dundee United, this season’s Betfred Cup looks all but over but don’t trying telling stand-in skipper Stewart Murdoch the final two group fixtures are meaningless.The 28-year-old knows today\u0026#8217s Tannadice clash with Alloa and next week’s trip to Elgin will be vital games as the Tangerines work to make sure they are a force in the coming Championship campaign.And while the ties so far against Arbroath and Ross County have ended in disappointment in terms of results, he believes they provided proof they’re heading in the right direction.“I think the thing is it’s really early doors and the manager will tell you we are still building, that’s maybe why we haven’t had the results we wanted,” he said.“We are still basically in a pre-season phase, so, for us, Tuesday was a really good competitive game up at County and gave us an opportunity to see exactly where we are right now.“It was another 90 minutes for the lads together and to help get to know each other. When you get the penalty at 0-0 and late on, if you score you probably go on and see out the game.“We didn’t and it was disappointing to lose but at the same time everybody could see the other night that already we can compete and we can take that forward. Now we move on to the next game.”And that need to be ready for next month’s league kick-off against Dunfermline means, for Murdoch and his team-mates, the next two outings are massive.“It will be difficult to qualify from our group now but we will take every game the same way we’ve always done and that’s as big ones.“We probably need to win both games now to have any chance and that’s what we’ll aim to do.“And they are another two big games leading into the start of the season in the Championship. We can get match sharpness and we will have another few boys who’ve had wee injuries back available.“It’s also another opportunity as well for the gaffer to maybe tinker with the team a bit and get boys some game time.”And, despite what the Betfred group table suggests, his belief this rebuilt United side is going to be a force to be reckoned with in the second tier, is growing.“I think everyone is confident we are building a good team and the manager will be wanting a few more players – I’m sure he’d said that.“I think the more good players we add the better we’ll play and the more we play together the better we’ll become.“It gave us confidence going to a place like County and competing the way we did. It was a good performance, it was just the result that was poor.“We are all excited about the season ahead and I think it’s going to be a positive one.”In the absence of newly-appointed club captain Fraser Fyvie, who’s likely to be out for another month or so as he completes his recovery from knee surgery at the turn of the year, the games so far have seen Murdoch wear the captain’s armband.Well aware of United’s history and some of the greats who’ve undertaken the role, he regards even having it on a temporary basis as a big feather in his cap.“I was captain a couple of times towards the end of last season and to be handed it again while Fraser is still out is nice,” he added.“This is a massive club, so to lead Dundee United out in any game is a huge honour for me.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"csaba laszlo urging dundee united to speed up","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCsaba Laszlo wants Dundee United to speed up when their Betfred Cup campaign continues at home to Alloa today.Despite a draw and a penalty shoot-out loss against Arbroath and a narrow defeat at Ross County in the two group ties so far, Csaba has been pleased with the signs coming from his rebuilt Tangerines.The next step forward he wants to see, though, is quicker use of the ball leading to more chances being created.“If I watch the team, Matej Rakovan, Adam Barton, Christoph Rabitsch, Callum Booth and others, they are really good football players,” he said.“They keep the ball well and have some good ideas, but we have to do more in the offence.“You can’t just control the game, you also have to go and finish, bring more danger in front of the opponent’s goal, be quicker.“I told them that for the second half at Ross County, ‘OK we are comfortable with the ball but we have to bring more danger’.”Fraser Aird will be in the squad after he sat out the County trip.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"disappointed dundee united boss csaba focuses on dunfermline in league opener","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United boss Csaba Laszlo was disappointed by his team’s latest Betfred Cup disappointment at the weekend.But he’s reminded fans that it’s all about being ready to win matches when the Championship season kicks off against Dunfermline next week.For the third group stage tie in a row, Saturday saw the Tangerines fail to record a victory as they were held to a draw by Alloa over 90 minutes and then lost the bonus point penalty shootout.It means they have no chance of progressing to the knockout stages and Csaba admitted he was angered by aspects of the performance, particularly during a second half that saw United let the lead slip late on.He isn’t, though, losing sight of the bigger picture.“Again, like the last game, until 80 minutes we are even in front in the game and then make a stupid mistake,” he said.“In the first half I think generally the team played some good football but the second half, according to me, this was not what I want to see. Definitely not.“I think this was to do with the changes we had to make and because we didn’t keep the ball in the front and be more simple.“Nicky Clark was tired and James Keatings has just come back from an injury so he got tired. After that our attacking game was not there.“But I want a team who is ready for Dunfermline, that is ready for the league.

Still, with these tired legs you have to win the game one zero, or two zero and finish.”United now head for Elgin City on Saturday knowing they have no chance of qualifying.It will, however, be another vital game as the manager tries to knock his new-look side into shape in their last outing before the league business starts.United’s ‘Meet the fans day’ takes place at Tannadice on Sunday when supporters will get the chance to see the team train.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/DN7D1449.JPG-846x564.jpg ","title":"dundee fans and tottenham teammates turn out to pay respects to football legend alan gilzean","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFans and former teammates paid tribute to Dundee icon Alan Gilzean on Friday as the legendary striker made his final journey past Dens Park.Supporters young and old braved the rain as the hearse carrying the title-winning forward drove up Sandeman Street just before midday.The ex-Dark Blues and Tottenham Hotspur star died earlier this month aged 79, just weeks after being diagnosed with a brain tumour.Among those to attend his funeral at Dundee Crematorium were several of his ex-Spurs teammates, including Pat Jennings and Alan Mullery.About 80 supporters gathered outside the stadium to pay their respects.Mark Kerr, 64, originally from Lochee, travelled down from Inverness to bid farewell to Mr Gilzean, who he said was one of his heroes.He said: “I was at Dens when Dundee won the league.“I was seven years old and I remember it distinctly.“I watched him playing in Europe and it confirmed I wanted to be a Dundee supporter for life.“I saw Alan at a hall of fame dinner at the Invercarse recently, so I was shocked to hear of his passing.“I’m the chairman of the Highland Dark Blues. I’ve come down from Inverness to pay my respect, and I’ll be raising a drink in his memory tonight.”Born in Coupar Angus, Gilzean is considered one of the finest players to grace Dens Park and netted an unrivalled 169 goals during the halcyon days of the 1950s and 60s.His eye for a goal was a crucial factor in Dundee’s title-winning season in 1961-62, before the club went on to reach the semi-final of the European Cup.Season ticket holder George McLaren, 73, said: “He has been such a big part of Dundee FC. My favourite memories of him are probably the goals against Dundee United.“I was shocked to hear of his passing and wanted to come here today to pay my respects. He will never be forgotten. He proved himself here at Dens and at Spurs.“An absolute legend for both clubs.”Fellow fan Daniel Smith, 33, from Maryfield, added: “There’s been a good turnout of people paying their respects here today at Dens.“He is a Dundee legend. I grew up on stories about Gilzean through the years and the things he accomplished at Dens. He still holds a number of records at Dens Park.”A tribute on the Dundee FC website stated: “Everyone at Dundee Football Club was devastated to learn of the death of Dundee legend Alan Gilzean aged 79 after a short illness.“A true Dundee legend in every sense of the word, we may never see his goal scoring like again and the thoughts of everyone at Dens Park are with Alan’s family and friends at this difficult and sad time.”He made the jump from Tayside to Tottenham in 1964 for a £72,500 fee, lifting two League Cups, the FA Cup and the UEFA Cup.As well as the dark blue of Dundee, Hall of Famer Gilzean earned 22 Scotland caps between 1963 and 1971, bagging 12 goals.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee man swore and struck doors at his own home","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA man who committed a public order offence had sentence deferred.Paul Milne, 42, of Silver Link Avenue, Whitfield, admitted that on July 15 last year, at his home, he behaved in a threatening or abusive manner in that he shouted and swore, demanded entry to the premises and repeatedly struck doors and windows.Sentence was deferred until August 8 for a criminal justice social work report.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b51f13f2179a.jpg ","title":"dundee people all aboard thehms unicornfor family fun","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSwashbuckling pirates stormed the HMS Unicorn as people of all ages turned out for the vessel’s summer family fun day.Youngsters dressed up and got the chance to meet unofficial mascot Pirate Bob.Children also had their faces painted and took part in sand art activities.There was even a special curator’s tour of the Music of Maritime Life.Billy Rough, education officer at the Unicorn, said: “It was such a fantastic day.“It was incredibly busy despite it being a glorious sunny day.

We just captured events and places that we thought were significant,” he said.“There are photos of people, of events, the arts, dance activities, things such as the New Year’s Day Dook and a lot of buildings that we thought either were significant or would become significant.“I was given access to Dens Park, for example, because I imagine in 10 years or so it might no longer exist as we know it.“I’m quite surprised at what we’ve been able to achieve.”The Tele was given access to some of the archive and the differences in city life now and then are stark.The 1916 survey features street scenes in the city centre and atop the Hilltown – and couldn’t be any more different from the snaps from 1991.Many of the later images show the city at its post-industrial peak, complete with questionable fashion choices and a City Square yet to be pedestrianised.Red Sky’s modern day survey is packed with sights that are likely to be familiar now – the new railway station entrance under construction, rusted-in tram rails on the Murraygate and dance performances in front of Caird Hall.Rather topically, there are also photos of William Halley’s mill – now reduced to rubble.Alistair Wilson, of Dundee Libraries, said the relevance of these photographic surveys becomes very clear after just a few years, giving people a fresh perspective on a city that might have changed without them really noticing.“The 1991 survey was carried out by Dundee Photographic Society. It and the other surveys act like a social record of how the city was at that time,” he said.“Looking back at 1991, which doesn’t feel that long ago, you can see so many things have changed – the way people dress, the jobs they have, even the cars on the streets.“Once the exhibition finishes the plan is that it will move about so everyone can see it.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b51f0eac1ff6.jpg ","title":"dundee people pop up shop peps up charity","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA pop-up ladies boutique in Broughty Ferry has raised several thousand pounds for charity.The shop in Gray Street has raised £7,600 for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust (CFT) in just two weeks.Cystic fibrosis is a genetic condition that affects the lungs and other organs.Morag Beckett, who set up the shop, said: “It’s been brilliant.

The full eclipse will then end at 00.28am on Saturday.“Dundee Law will probably be the best place to watch the lunar eclipse.At moonrise, you will be able to see the start from the east, looking towards Broughty Ferry.“As the Dundee Law is the highest point in the city, you are bound to get great views of the total lunar eclipse.“Balgay Hill is another great place to watch the eclipse from.“I spoke with Mills Observatory and unfortunately they will not be opening for the lunar eclipse.“However, Balgay Hill will still be a great place to view it. You just need to look east and you should see it rise above Broughty Ferry.“The Tay Road Bridge or somewhere across the Tay would be another ideal spot although lower than the Law and Balgay Hill.“Observers should still have a great view as it continues to rise above the horizon.” A lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes directly behind the Earth and into its shadow.This can occur only when the sun, Earth and the moon are aligned exactly with the planet in between.It can occur only on the night of a full moon.The type and length of an eclipse depends on the moon’s proximity to either node of its orbit.During a total lunar eclipse, Earth completely blocks direct sunlight from reaching the moon.The only light reflected from the lunar surface has been refracted by Earth’s atmosphere.This light appears reddish for the same reason that a sunset or sunrise does.Due to this reddish colour, a totally eclipsed moon is sometimes called a blood moon.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b505bfa5c48b-737x564.jpg ","title":"give alan gilzean a proper dens park send off says dundee ace cammy kerr","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee favourite Cammy Kerr has called on the club’s supporters to give Alan Gilzean the send off the Dens legend deserves this weekend.The Dark Blues take on Dunfermline this Sunday in the first home game since Gilzean passed away at the age of 79.The club legend’s funeral takes place tomorrow and Sunday’s clash promises to be one full of emotion for everyone associated with Dundee.A special matchday programme will be available while there will be a minute’s silence and black armbands worn by the players but Kerr expects a bumper home crowd to give Gilzean a roaring send-off.The 22-year-old said: “It’s a terrible thing to happen.“Sadly, I never got to see him play or have the privilege of meeting him but what a figure to have played at this football club.“To know you are at the same football club as some of the greatest footballers have played at is fantastic.“I’d like to send my regards and best wishes to his family at this time, obviously a tough time.“In terms of the game, I think it will be emotional and, hopefully, the crowd turn out for a very special player for this football club.“I’ve read a few of things in the papers about the player he was and I actually remember watching the thing on TV at White Hart Lane when they closed the old stadium.“I knew he was a good player but I didn’t know how big he was for Tottenham.“When they said ‘The Original King of White Hart Lane, Alan Gilzean’ it just shows the regard he was held in down there.“Naming a lounge after him doesn’t do him justice because he was, obviously, a great talent.”Being a fan himself, Kerr knows the kind of supporters Dundee have and the loyalty they show their team – something he experienced in a very noisy welcome and send-off at last week’s friendly against Farense in Portugal.“We could hear them when we got off the bus in Albufeira but you can’t see how many there were,” Kerr added.“At the end I got a few photos and things and they were singing away.“The best bit was when we were leaving and they were all banging on the bus – it was great!“You see European games and all the fans waiting on the buses so it felt like that, it felt great.“For the fans to go across there just shows the loyalty that they’ll go across to Portugal for a friendly.

He gave a lot of guys their first shot in the game and signed me too.“The Kellys are synonymous with Lochee Harp. Everyone knew him as a gentleman. Not everyone agreed with him but he was respected.”The club tweeted: “He leaves a massive hole in the hearts of his family and everyone connected to the club. Our thoughts go out to them and his wife Anne.”Before working on the committee and coaching team at Lochee Harp, he played as a junior footballer for local clubs including St Josephs, Alyth United, Stobswell, Downfield and also Harp.Throughout his time as a player, he competed in the old Dundee Junior League in the Forfarshire, Courier, Loftus and Keddie Cups.Shortly after being given a long-service award from the Scottish Junior FA in 2014, he told the Tele: “From there, it just seemed a natural progression to secretary and then eventually chairman. In actual fact, I don’t mind being tagged with being just a general ‘dogsbody.’”He received a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Dundee City Council Sports Awards in 2016 for his service to Harp.Jim was treasurer of the Dundee Junior League and Tayside Junior League. Later, he served as finance and general committee member of the Scottish Junior FA.A passionate committee man with Lochee Harp, he initially resisted any attempt to regionalise the leagues: “Most local clubs were against it and myself, Downfield’s Alex Connelly, Charlie Fairfield of St Joseph, Broughty Athletic’s Eddie Whitton and others threatened to pull away and form our own league.“We could have done that as there were 12 teams in Dundee at the time. The SFA president came through to try to talk us round. We had a meeting with North End Park and were initially threatened with some form of blacklisting if we didn’t comply with the SJFA’s plans.”His son admitted his dad was modest about his achievements, saying: “He wanted Harp to be the best. He will be missed by us and the club.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/12/5a436bc1641c6.jpg ","title":"urgent dundee foodbank needs more donations

Auchterawe near Fort Augustus fear their idyllic homes\u0026rsquo value has been slashed and the peaceful area blighted as the Scottish and Southern Electricity (SSE) substation expands to become one of the biggest around.\"From a tiny substation it is going to become an industrial site,\" said Steve Lanning who is leading the fight for compensation from SSE.\"For years SSE has been developing the small substation into what promises to become a huge facility. It has completely blighted the community and many homes are now unsaleable.\"He said the proposed expansion would bring the substation boundary within 30 yards of the nearest property, and 75 yards of his home.He added: \"SSE refuses to acknowledge any fault or offer compensation of any kind.\"There appears to be no clearly established legal obligation for SSE to compensate, but there is a moral one, considering the substantial financial loss suffered by the residents and the spoiling of a peaceful rural atmosphere.\"He added that the planning authority, Highland Council, has expressed little interest in helping them.Mr Lanning said that in February he was forced to take his house off the market after a year because he could not sell it at \u0026pound40,000 below the market value.The substation began growing to accommodate the Beauly to Denny power line and the new renewable energy sources in the surrounding hills.Pensioner Mr Lanning, who has lived in the glen for 11 years, said: \"The substation has been enlarged about four times.\"There are liaison meetings but they are simply PR exercises.\"This is not just about me. The other residents are my friends and we are all in the same boat.\"A spokeswoman from SSE said: \"Our proposal has been developed in close consultation with the local community and other stakeholders based on a range of economic, environmental and technical considerations.\u0026nbsp\"As a responsible developer, we have listened carefully to the feedback during consultation, and to minimise the visual impact of the extension, we are proposing a gas-insulated switchgear solution, which significantly reduces the footprint of the site.\"We have also purchased additional land to allow for enhanced screening and bunding to further mitigate the visual impact.\"We remain committed to working constructively with the local community.\"She added that there have been two public consultations, and SSE also facilitate a dedicated community\u0026nbspliaison group in the area where senior management and project teams are on hand to engage directly with residents to address any concerns raised.A detailed planning application has been lodged and a council planning decision is expected in September.A Highland Council spokeswoman said: \"Our decision will take into account all relevant matters including the potential impact of the development on third parties.\"It is not the responsibility however of local government to provide compensation to third parties who may consider they have been impacted upon by developments as a result of a planning decision.\"Tuesday 24 Jul 2018 12:34

delighted to welcome them back to Inverness Town House this week.\"Lily is an excellent example of what our young people can achieve with commitment and sheer endeavour,\" she said.\"While I congratulate Lily on her personal achievements I also commend the role that she is playing through her participation in international Highland dance competitions as a young ambassador for Inverness

plot of landscaped land just a stone\u0027 throw from its premises in View Place.Owner Jane Wilson said efforts had been made to trace the owners of the land, to enquire about buying or leasing it, but ownership \"cannot be determined\".The area is currently maintained by Highland Council but she said staff at the pub also worked to keep it tidy and litter-free.In a statement to support the application, she says: \"This piece of land forms part of the adopted road and, as such, we have lodged an application for permission to occupy the road with a street caf\u0026eacute.\"Given its proximity to an area of the town that has so much tourist interest, we feel we could make use of the land and that this would benefit visitors to the town as well as our business.\"The Castle Tavern is located across from the end and beginning of the Great Glen Way and, as such, we have a large number of visitors - walkers and cyclists.\"The beer garden that we have is small and we are limited in how many cycles we can accommodate. The only other place for them is on the footpath. This can cause restricted use of the path for pedestrians and customers.\"Our plans for the area are to tidy it up and improve the landscaping, insert some tables and benches and a secure area for housing bicycles.\"The plot, she added, would be serviced by the Castle Tavern\u0027 CCTV and be maintained to a high standard.There are also possible longer-term plans to install a charging point for electric bikes.\"The use of this land would be mainly seasonal as we do not intend to put any building on it and it would be used primarily for visitors who currently cycle or walk the Great Glen Way,\" she said.Inverness Central councillor Bet McAllister said she thought it was a \"wonderful\" idea for tourists and residents alike.\"It will be perfect for when the weather is nice and people want to sit outside for their meals,\" she said.\"The Castle Tavern is always very busy, especially their outside area.\"Cllr McAllister wants to encourage more restaurants and bars to utilise outdoor areas as long as they are able to ensure that people with disabilities are not impacted.\"In Inverness our streets can be quite narrow, so it has to be done properly,\" she said.Glad to hear that the move by the Castle Tavern could benefit cyclists, she added: \"The more bikes on the roads in Inverness the better the quality of air for everyone.\"Tuesday 24 Jul 2018 12:35 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116730.jpg","title":"New 40k artwork unveiled for Ness Islands","story":"\u0026nbspA \u0026pound40,000 artwork which would enable children to paddle in and enjoy the water at the Ness Islands is the latest offering from the Inverness River Connections project.\u0026nbspIf approved by councillors, it will consist of patterned sculptural stepping stones made of granite, sitting in a stainless steel channel or lade.Water from the river will feed into this channel where some of the stones will be fitted with moveable sluice gates to allow children to control the flow of water themselves.The plan is for it to be located in the middle of the Ness Islands at a spot already popular with families.The proposal is just one element of the River Ness Public Art Project, worth a total of \u0026pound727,000.Inverness Provost Helen Carmichael was yesterday hopeful that the concept would find favour with councillors on Highland Council\u0027 south planning committee, especially since local schoolchildren had been consulted on what they would like to see there, and Inverness College UHI design students had input on the concept.She said: \"Children were very involved along with students at the university. Children love jumping from stone to stone and guddling about in water.\"It has all been looked at from the safety point of view, but let\u0027 face it, if you take children to the beach they jump from stone to stone. I think it is a good project and if necessary I will be the first to dip my toe in the water there.\"Inverness city manager David Haas said: \"This has had youth engagement all along and I think it is something that is going to sit well in the environment of a place that will become even more popular as people engage with the river.\"Masterminding the project is Bespoke Atelier, a Glasgow-based design studio.Its design statement, which will be discussed at a planning meeting later this summer, explains the lades and weirs already around the River Ness were used as inspiration. The stones would be patterned, partly to minimise slips and also to reflect foliage patterns from trees growing on the islands.A report from Inverness City Artworks Group states: \"While it was preferable to use natural stone, the cost might prove prohibitive and alternative materials might need to be considered.\"It was also minuted that if concerns were raised regarding the cost of this feature, the high cost of \"providing basic play equipment should be highlighted.\"The group was given assurances that the design would, when completed, look like part of the landscape, and members were told that Bespoke Atelier was confident that all aspects of the design could be met within the available budget.Path improvements in the vicinity are included in the application.Company director Yvonne Elliot-Kellighan said the stepping stone forms envisaged were inspired by the shape of the Ness Islands, and the stones themselves could be engraved with botanical patterns \"creating a ow and connection between stepping stones\".The children\u0027 feature is not far from MY Ness, a \u0026pound300,000 centrepiece which was unveiled as a concept in May and has still to receive planning permission.The River Ness Public Art Project is funded by Creative Scotland (\u0026pound305,000), Inverness Common Good Fund (\u0026pound250,000), HIE (\u0026pound66,000) and Highland Council (\u0026pound106,000).At a time of heightened concern about public spending, Highland Council has stressed that the vast majority of the money for the projects comes from third parties and cannot be used for other purposes, and the council\u0027 \u0026pound106k is from capital investment and not revenue spend.Tuesday 24 Jul 2018 12:35 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116731.jpg","title":"New cinema proposed for the Black Isle","story":"\u0026nbspA THRIVING film society on the Black Isle looks set to take its next big step after plans were submitted for a permanent cinema to cater for growing demand.The brand new cinema, which would be located on the seafront in Cromarty, will cater to Cromarty and Resolis Film Society events and serve as a base for the town\u0027 increasingly popular annual film festival.Cromarty Estate, which owns the land, has lodged the application in partnership the film society, which would act as its tenant.The plans feature two key elements. The first is the cinema, which would be built on land close to the ferry slipway and next to an existing boat storage shed.The cinema would seat roughly 30 people and host weekly screenings throughout the year, rising to twice a week in the summer. It would also be used to help house Cromarty\u0027 growing film festival, which attracts fans and famous faces from across the country late every autumn.Cromarty Estate also plans to build an office hub alongside the cinema in a bid to cater for growing business demand in the town.In a supporting statement submitted by the estate alongside its application, its agents said: \"A dedicated cinema space will allow screening all year which currently is not possible using existing buildings with poor black out facilities.\"The cinema may also be available for other users to hire for screenings, presentations and lectures.\"They added that the cinema would also \"ideally\" feature an outdoor area \"for summer screenings and festival events\".Making the case for new office space in the town, the estate said: \"Cromarty has a thriving entrepreneurial community but this is not matched by suitable office accommodation with the result that many find themselves having to move their business bases from Cromarty to Dingwall, Tore or Inverness when they outgrow their own homes, with the resulting loss of employment opportunities in the town.\"Addressing this need... will make Cromarty a more balanced and sustainable community.\"In a statement supporting the application, the film society said that a survey of Cromarty residents found that 82 per cent backed a cinema in the town and the same number would go to more screenings if the venue was better than what is currently on offer.Justifying the decision to proceed with an all-new site for the cinema, the estate\u0027 agents said the site\u0027 position close to adequate parking and its location away from homes were both positives, as was the existing vehicle access from the harbour.The buildings would feature dark metal cladding to the walls of the cinema, with timber cladding on the office hub.If the plans are approved construction could start as early as spring next year.Tuesday 24 Jul 2018 12:35 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116735.jpg","title":"Pamiloo to make its first visit to Black Isle Show","story":"\u0026nbspCAMPAIGNERS have welcomed news that accessible toilets will be installed at this year\u0027 Black Isle Show \u0026ndash allowing people with complex needs to enjoy the event.Fiona MacLeod-Chiarini, whose brother Ewan MacLeod is severely disabled, contacted the show\u0027 organisers to ask about the availability of a Pamiloo (right), a mobile facility for those with profound impairments.Rod Mackenzie, the Black Isle Show\u0027 company secretary, immediately got in touch with the charity Promoting a More Inclusive Scotland (Pamis), which owns the Pamiloo, in order to make the event accessible for the family.Mrs MacLeod-Chiarini hailed the move, and believes facilities such as the Pamiloo can be life-changing.She said: \"We are absolutely delighted that the Black Isle Show have taken our concerns on board and have booked the Pamiloo.

She said: “It’s just a shame he’s not alive to see it because it would have been his dream match Burnley against Aberdeen.“If he was still here I think he would have been supporting Burnley, it was his one and only love Burnley Football Club. But Aberdeen was always very strong in his heart and he was an Aberdonian through and through.“He was always very proud of being an Aberdonian and no one was left in any doubt about where he was from.”Craig believes his father would have wanted the tie to finish as a draw because he was so fond of both.He added: “He would be supporting Burnley and Aberdeen, a draw would probably suit him.“He was proud of being an Aberdonian and I couldn’t understand him for the first five years of my life!“He never lost the Scottish accent, that was for sure.”Sheila married Adam in August 1956 and she explained how he ended up joining Burnley.She said: “He went to Frederick Street School in Aberdeen and played football for the school.“He was spotted by a scout and he chose Burnley because he thought a small town would be easier to settle into because he’d never been out of Aberdeen.“When he came down the majority of lads at Burnley were either Scottish or Geordies. It was a very, very close-knit community Burnley Football Club and it was the same with the players’ wives.“The team Adam played in was very close and Adam has been dead for eight years and I’m still close with a lot of them.”One of the highlights of Adam’s career was the three caps he won for Scotland.He played for the Dark Blues in a 4-3 defeat to Norway in Bergen and a 6-2 win over Spain at Real Madrid’s Bernabeu in June 1963.Adam’s final cap came in December 1965 in a 3-0 defeat to Italy in Naples.The victory over Spain was a historic match for Scottish football because at the time it was Scotland’s highest-ever win in international football.While proud of playing for the national side, it was some years later before Adam received his caps because when he played international caps were only given out by the SFA for home matches.Sheila said: “He was really proud of playing for Scotland and he had to wait a long time for the cap.“In those days international caps were only given out for home games so it was years later that he got the cap.“He played against Norway away from home, Spain away from home and Italy away.“I remember the Spain game because that was a 6-2 win and that was their highest-scoring win.”Following his retirement Adam dipped his toes into management at non-league level and continued to follow Burnley.But one thing he disliked about modern football was the amount of money that has come into the game since the Premier League started in 1992.Craig said: “What used to annoy him about modern football was the money situation with players getting overpaid.“He played in the era of the maximum wage and then even after that was lifted the wages weren’t huge.“He was very proud of what he achieved with Burnley, and they haven’t won the English top flight since the team he played in.”Craig and Sheila still live in the Burnley area.And Craig said there is a lot of anticipation among the Clarets fans about the tie with the Dons because it has been so long since they last featured in continental competition.He said: “There’s a lot of excitement in Burnley because it’s been so long since they were in Europe.“For Burnley this couldn’t really have been a better game because we didn’t want a trip to Russia or something like that.“Burnley fans are quite confident of getting through as well.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dolphinwatch tells of

RSPB’s Dolphinwatch project at Torry Battery had the rare and unexpected spotting on Saturday just 15 minutes before they were due to pack up.The popular project gives people the chance to see and learn about the creatures.Laura Watson, RSPB officer for the area said it had caught everyone by surprise that they spotted the first minke whales of the season.It is rare for the animal to be spotted so close to the shore in Aberdeen as they are usually spotted further away.The crew were 15 minutes from finishing up when the whales were seen by a member of the public.Laura said: “It was very late in the day that they were spotted.“I was beginning to think about packing up and a lot of members of the public had already gone home.“There was roughly around eight people left and we were looking in the normal spots and it was a gentleman who said he had seen a fin.“It was quite close that you could see it in the distance without binoculars and the other officer and I who were there had the same thought that it was too big to be a dolphin.“When we got a look with the binoculars we saw this one fine which was then another two popped up and there was these three minke whales.“It was a special and cool moment for everyone that was there as we’ve had dolphins almost every day but hadn’t had any whales yet.”Laura added that due to the excitement of the whales by those still in attendance that they didn’t manage to get a picture of the rare occurrence.She said: “We were trying to make sure that everyone there had a chance to see them and was pointing them out to everyone.“We didn’t get a picture and even travelled along to the coast road trying to see if they were still there to get one.“However, these whales can hold their breath for a very long time so they can pop up and then you won’t see them again.“It is quite rare to see them this close, while they are most popular spotted in Scotland it is normally offshore when they are mostly seen.“It was a quiet day for dolphins that day but at least we managed to have the first whales spotted of the season.”Dolphinwatch is set to continue until August.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/07/ASV_games_052.jpg ","title":"get your kids inspired by sport this summer1","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSchool

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 25","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 23/06/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Labour and the Lib Dems must recognise and respect the recent vote in the Scottish Parliament and the views of their Scottish colleagues who refused to give consent to the damaging Brexit legislation proposed at Westminster.Labour amendments to former clause 11 of the bill require consent of the Scottish Parliament unless a UK Minister ‘has reasonable grounds for believing that regulations are required for the purpose of giving effect to any international obligations’.It would be catastrophic for Scotland if Labour left the door open for the Tory Government to breach the devolution settlement.Leaving Holyrood exposed to powers taken without consent in any area connected to an international trade agreement would be disastrous. This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

The pair were steady, neat and quick all day and broke the timing beam on stage eight, Bishop\u0026#8217s Glen, to complete the rally in 23rd overall and third in class four.Everything finally came together and the car and crew got the result they deserve. The collective sigh of relief could be heard in body shops and garages all across the land, with annual leave in  most of them on hold until Douglas\u0026#8217s result came in.Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker were out in the mighty Peugeot 106 once more and were having a decent day, with a few hairy moments when the intercom wasn\u0026#8217t working (or so Duncan tells it) and unfortunately breaking a gearbox mount which, though fixed between stages, saw them over their time limit and out of the rally.Mull ace Ally Currie and his Oban co-driver Grant MacNiven continued to chase the bigger more powerful machinery in his 150bhp Fiesta and was sitting third in the 2WD section when a problem that they had been experiencing for most of the day became worse \u0026#8211 and the passenger side front wheel decided to part company on the approach to the start line of stage seven.The family duo of Cara and Donald MacNeill made a welcome return to the stages, in new machinery this time, debuting their Subaru Impreza and bringing it home in one piece in 31st overall and second in class nine.Mull\u0026#8217s James Campbell and Claire Tilley also got their Mitsubishi Evo to the finish and will be happy with the result.The event was won by Kilmarnock\u0026#8217s Andrew Gallagher with Jane Nicol on the notes in the CobbleShop Ford Focus WRC.The next rally action for Argyll is the Mach 1 Stages on the weekend of July 14/15 at Machrihanish.\u0026nbspPICS:Photographs by West Coast PhotosAlly Currie and Grant MacNiven blasted it while their Fiesta was still on four wheels. no_a27ArgyllRally01no_a27ArgyllRally02Overall Winners Andrew Gallagher and Jane Nicol in their Ford Focus. no_a27ArgyllRally03Donald MacNeill from Furnace and Cara MacNeill, Glasgow, make light work of the hairpin in their Subaru.  no_a27ArgyllRally04James Campbell and Claire Tilley from Mull in their Mitsubishi. no_a27ArgyllRally05Kicking up dust in their Peogeot 106 are Lochgilphead team Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker. no_a27ArgyllRally06\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tv company seeks argyll adventurers","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 11:20 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowCould you travel to The Far East without stepping on a plane?If so, a television production company is looking for you.Studio Lambert, the company behind Gogglebox, is seeking folk from Argyll to take part in a trans-global race for a cash prize.Flightless is described as an \u0026#8216ambitious real-world adventure series\u0026#8217.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

His problems did not end there, though, as injury also ruled out Gordon Whyte, Thomas Whyte and Dunky Kerr although the latter was stripped as Kyles only substitute, while Robbie MacLeod was unavailable.Caberfeidh manager Jodi Gorski had Ally MacLennan back but he was also short of players, with Jamie Matheson and Colin MacLennan among his absentees and they lined-up with the Cabers with the second team.Kyles settled into the game with a goal on four minutes. There was a scramble in the goal area where Colin MacDonald fought for possession with Caberfeidh keeper Ewen Pilcher and defender Blair Morrison, and it was actually Luke Thornton who got the final touch to put the hosts ahead.Luke Thornton got Kyles and his second on eight minutes. Sandy MacKenzie played the ball across from the left wing forward position to Luke Thornton who smashed a shoulder-high volley past the Cabers keeper from 15 yards.Kevin Bartlett made it 2-1 on 13 minutes when he latched onto a loose ball in defence and carried the ball forward before thumping it past John Whyte from a central position.However Kyles restored their two-goal cushion on 42 minutes to make it 3-1 at the break. Former Skye Camanachd player Neil MacVicar, playing in attack, switched play from right wing forward to Sandy MacKenzie at left wing forward and he rifled the ball past keeper Pilcher from 18 yards.Grant Irvine got in on the act on 55 minutes. A ball forward from midfield was brought out of the air by Colin MacDonald, who slipped it out to the right wing forward position to the onrushing Grant Irvine, who swept the ball across the keeper into the right-hand side of the net.Sandy MacKenzie put gloss on the win with a rather fortuitous effort on 62 minutes. MacKenzie turned full back Blair Morrison and as keeper Pilcher came out to clear the ball, it rebounded off MacKenzie into the net.Donald Irvine was superb for Kyles, while Grant Irvine was an instrumental figure at full centre.Caberfeidh did not perform at the levels seen when they took shinty’s top flight by surprise in the earlier part of this season.\u0026nbspMarine Harvest South Division 1Title hopefuls the Kyles Athletic second team march on, beating Ballachulish 1-0 at the Jubilee Park.Balla’s Cain MacPhee was free of a one-match ban, while Kyles were without Luke Thornton who was on first team duty.The only goal of the game came on 19 minutes and it was a superb strike from Martin MacFadyen whose 25 yard piledriver from the middle of the park gave the keeper no chance.Balla’ had the chance to level on 35 minutes when referee Callum Duff awarded them a penalty, penalising a \u0026#8216kick\u0026#8217 inside the D.Lorne Brown took the penalty and he struck the ball well enough but his effort was superbly saved by Kyles keeper Douglas Nicolson. It was one of a number of great stops by the Kyles custodian.Kyles have a five point lead on second place Bute although they have played a game more.Bute 4 Bute scored three times in the final third of the game to defeat Aberdour 4-1 in their 12.30pm throw up at The Meadows.Bute’s Craig MacKay was unavailable as he served the second game of a two-match suspension.Aberdour travelled without Cameron McCue and David McDougal.James Craig gave Bute the lead after just five minutes and that proved to be the only goal of a tight first 45 minutes during which Bute goalie Kevin Queen saved well from David MacKenzie, tipping his effort over the bar.Referee Robert Baxter pointed to the penalty spot when Ruairidh Reid was wiped out inside the D, taking a stick across the knees, when he looked set to equalise. Angus Thorburn struck the penalty well but Kevin Queen made a brilliant save to keep his side in front.The visitors were awarded a second penalty shortly after when Roddy MacColl was felled inside the box. Angus Thorburn stepped up again but this time he did not catch the ball as he would have liked and his effort went past the post.The penalty misses were a blow for Aberdour and Bute took advantage and, with some good running and quick passing, they went on to score three more times.Robert Walker made it 2-0 on 65 minutes and Iain McDonald added a third with 15 minutes remaining.Chris Lawrence made it 4-0 on 80 minutes, although there was some consolation for Aberdour when Ruairidh Reid finished well a couple of minutes later. Angus Thorburn battled to get the ball to Reid and his powerful strike from just outside the D gave the keeper no chance.Bute were sharper on the day and they deserved the win but the final scoreline was a little harsh on Aberdour in what was only their second league defeat of the season.Bute now leap-frog Aberdour into second place in the league on goal difference and the Islanders have a game in hand.Kilmory 1 MacRae Park was in perfect condition to host the local derby between Kilmory and the Inveraray second team.A large crowd gathered to watch two teams filled with youth and experience.Kilmory started with top scorer Alister MacArthur in defence and they had young Andrew Innes up-front, supported by the more experienced Hal Jones.Inveraray went with a mature forward line which included Euan McMurdo, John MacKenzie and Neil Campbell but their back five were all aged under 18.But it was across the centre line where all the action happened in the first half.Referee Alex MacVicar had a busy afternoon and David Macpherson was first into the book for a cynical challenge on Sandy Leiper.It wasn’t long before Leiper joined him, yellow carded for a late swing on his fellow winger, young Ruaraidh Graham.Duncan MacBrayne was next to fall foul of the official for persistent fouling.In-between all the yellow cards, Alister MacArthur was dictating the play from the Kilmory defence, with young Hamish MacLennan doing the same for Inveraray and the first half ended scoreless.Inveraray came out the traps the quickest in the second half. A long range effort from David Macpherson was easily saved by the Kilmory keeper, but Neil Campbell was quickest to react and slot the rebound home to open the scoring on 48 minutes.Inveraray added a quick second following a well-worked set-piece routine on 56 minutes. Euan McMurdo’s free-hit found Campbell Watt, whose movement caused the Kilmory defence problems all afternoon, and he made 2-0 with fine finish.The goal sparked life into Kilmory who pulled one back on 65 minutes when Hal Jones blasted home an unstoppable shot from the edge of the penalty area to make it 2-1 and it was game on.After getting themselves back in the game, Kilmory’s discipline let them down soon after, with both Duncan MacBrayne and Sandy Leiper receiving their marching orders from referee MacVicar within minutes of one another.Inveraray capitalised on their two-man advantage and former Kilmory player David MacAllister scored his first goal for his new club on 69 minutes to make it 3-1.Euan McMurdo finished the day’s scoring off with a well-constructed goal to make it 4-1 with 15 minutes remaining.Inveraray will be happy with their league first win of the season, while Kilmory will be disappointed with the result and the fact that they will be missing two influential players over the weeks to come.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"cinema paradiso as screen machine parks up in lochgilphead","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/07/18, 1:31 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA familiar large blue lorry rolled into Lochgilphead recently, offering the latest movies to the public for two nights.The cinema on wheels parked itself outside Kilmory resource centre for movie buffs to enjoy on Tuesday July 10 and Wednesday July 11, with screenings of Gnomeo and Juliet sequel, Sherlock Gnomes superhero epic Avengers: Infinity War Part I and LGBT rom-com, Love, Simon.The Screen Machine has a busy few weeks ahead.

It is also the story of a family trying to reunite cousins on both sides of the Atlantic.Except this is not fiction. This is the mysterious story of James Campbell Hay Robertson, known as Jim, who was born and raised in Lochgilphead, and who was so determined to make a fresh start in America that he never saw or spoke to his Scottish family again.Why Jim would cut himself off from his family is something his granddaughter Morgan has been trying to find out and she has asked the Argyllshire Advertiser to help solve this mystery.James Campbell Hay Robertson was born in Lochgilphead and lived in Calman Villa in Ardrishaig. He was the son of the schoolmaster, a noted talent on the Lochgilphead football team and an aspiring doctor. Born in 1896, he had just turned 18 when the Great War began. He enlisted and, when the call for new officer candidates came, he signed up, becoming a \u0026#8216temporary gentleman\u0026#8217 rising to the rank of acting captain in charge of a battery of 4.5-inch Howitzers at the Ypres front. When the war ended, he spent six months in the army occupying Germany near Bonn.Jim was a smart boy, who loved his parents, and he was especially fond of his older sister Alexandria – a very talented pianist. She is often mentioned in the Advertiser as leading musical events in Lochgilphead, and was known as \u0026#8216Miss Lala Robertson\u0026#8217. According to Jim, she went off to study piano around 1910 in London or Edinburgh, but returned to Lochgilphead by the time the Great War broke out.After the war, Jim left for America and banished all of them from his life. It is here the mystery begins: what caused Jim to turn his back on his family and keep their existence hidden, from leaving Scotland in 1921 until his death in 1995 at the age of 99?Jim had a long and happy marriage and he and his wife Ruth had four boys who have grown up without extended family and under the impression that no relations existed in Scotland, which is not true. On a visit to Lochgilphead, Morgan found cousins in Furnace.Jim did share some clues about his family, but they were not all they seemed. He said his older brother William was in the Navy during the Great War, but had become an alcoholic, fallen overboard and drowned. This was not true. William\u0026#8217s signature was on their mother\u0026#8217s death certificate, signed in Aberdeen in 1943. William clearly lived a long life after Jim left Scotland and perhaps had his own family, themselves unaware of their American relatives.Jim\u0026#8217s telling of Alexandra\u0026#8217s story is even more tragic, saying she volunteered as a nurse in the war, fell in love with a South African soldier and left for Cape Town, only to die of food poisoning six months after arriving. This too was false, as the Advertiser\u0026#8217s obituary for their father in 1926 stated he \u0026#8216is survived by three children\u0026#8217, including Alexandra. Part of the story was true, however, as the Advertiser noted in 1920 that she married Henry Beck of Cape Town, in Dorset.Why Jim wanted to make a clean break with his family to such a degree he pretended his brother and sister had died will never be known. But it is possible his brother and sister lived long lives and had large families. Jim\u0026#8217s family in the United States now amounts to three surviving children, six grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.Jim\u0026#8217s father, William Robertson, came from a family of printers and dyers in Bonhill, Vale of Leven, and served as a schoolmaster from 1883 to 1920. He died in 1926, possibly in Kilmun, and, according to family records, was \u0026#8216buried in Dunoon\u0026#8217, but this may be another red herring from Jim.His mother, Wilhelmina, came from a farming family in Aberdeenshire. She moved to Lochgilphead in 1874 when she was 14, to live with her uncle, Alexander Cameron Robertson, the new minister of Lochgilphead Parish Church, a position he held for more than 50 years, from 1876-1933.There is one picture which could help crack part of the mystery. It shows Jim\u0026#8217s mother with two girls and appears to have been sent to him after his move to America. Part of the handwriting on the back is obscured but reads: \u0026#8216Hannan\u0026#8217s daughter, mom and myself taken last summer.\u0026#8217\u0026#8216Mom\u0026#8217 would refer to Jim\u0026#8217s mum, \u0026#8216myself\u0026#8217 the teenage girl whose age meant she could not be the daughter of Wilhelmina or the sister of Jim. Who was she and was she part of the story which caused Jim to cut himself off from his Scottish roots?If you have any information which could help solve this mystery please email the Argyllshire Advertiser editorial team at editor@argyllshireadvertiser\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"delighted scott reclaims toss title","story":"\t\tJoanne SimmsUpdated: 23/07/18, 12:00 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowScott Rider is once again World Caber Champion, after he had to toss for it at Inveraray Games on Tuesday.The former Commonwealth Games shot-putter and Olympic four-man bobsleigh team member won in 2013, 2014 and 2016.Judges at Winterton Park declared it was too close to call between the Englishman and Peter Bouma from Holland and it was down to a single toss of the caber each to decide the honour.The field of 10 was whittled down to a final five which also included Jamie Gunn, from Falkirk Lukasz Wenta, East Kilbride and Stuart Anderson, Lochearnhead.The event is sponsored by The George Hotel, Inveraray. Donald Clark from The George said: ‘It’s good on games’ day to see so many well-kent faces and to see new faces doing well in the games.’Once face missing from the games this year was the Duke himself he and his family are currently in India celebrating his 50th birthday.The honour of chieftain of the games was given to Rear Admiral John Weale OBE RASM, FOSNI, ACNS(SM) who heads the Royal Navy in Scotland and Northern Ireland.Amongst the guests this year was a contingent of members of the German branch of the Clan Campbell Society.More than 4,000 people attended the games the numbers held up well against other years and the visitors were rewarded with fine weather.They saw two records broken on the track this year: Jax Thoirs from Glasgow set a new open ground record for the long jump at 21 ft 7 inches and Aiden Quinn of Glasgow took the open hop, step and jump to 47ft 2½ inches.Numbers entering the solo piping contests were, like many other games, slightly down. Opinion in piping circles is that resurgence in pipe bands is seeing more pipers choose bands instead of pursuing solo careers.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12951950.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_300618station_10JPG.jpg","title":"ayrs station hotel faces 3","story":"NewsAyr\u0027s Station Hotel faces £3 million demolition bill as South Ayrshire Council fear dangerous building is beyond repairCouncil bosses fear a multi-million pound job is on to bring down the crumbling Station Hotel.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson11:50, 20 JUL 2018NewsAyr\u0027s Station Hotel (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailDemolition of the crumbling Station Hotel will cost \u0026pound3million, we can reveal. Council bosses have sized up the task, fearing the iconic structure has reached the end of the line. Large parts of Ayr railway station are closed to the public as safety teams comb the site. But the Post has learned that even a short-term salvage mission will cost more than \u0026pound300,000. Senior councillors have been briefed to expect a hefty hit to the wallet. South Ayrshire bosses will bid to retrieve whatever they spend from the hotel’s absentee Malaysian owner. But a senior adminsitration source said: “We have to face the reality of the situation. “The cost of refurbishing the hotel would be well in excess of \u0026pound10m, so that’s a non-starter. “I think that knocking it down is quickly becoming our only option.” That prospect is likely to face a strong challenge from groups such as Historic Scotland. And political tensions could further complicate the picture.  It comes as the hotel’s safety cordon was extended to take in part of the road over the railway. Teams are inspecting the condition of the building’s gable end amid concerns it could collapse on to people and cars below. Trains continue to run as normal, but access for commuters has now become fraught with difficulty. And worried rail chiefs are now said to be hatching contingency plans, should Ayr become become a no-go zone. But council bosses this week refused to confirm whether an official briefing on demolition had taken place. In a statement, they said: “Work to fully assess the condition of the former Station Hotel is continuing on site. “However, a decision on any future action will be dependent on the findings of the ongoing works and surveys.” But the council’s opposition group claim they are being kept in the dark over developments. Tory boss, Martin Dowey, said the public need to be kept informed. “I’m surprised this figure appears to be being quoted by members of the administration,” he added. “The SNP’s claim of inclusion and transparency is just one more empty promise. “The public need to be kept informed about the hotel and the council’s plans for its future, if that does indeed involve demolition.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnHistoric ScotlandScottish National PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilTransportAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"fed up residents called action","story":"NewsFed-up residents have called for action to put the brakes on speeding drivers before someone is killedNeighbours hit out at fast drivers who are using the street like a racetrack.\u0026nbspShareByGary Fanning07:00, 24 JUL 2018NewsCumnock.

Neighbours hit out at fast drivers who are using the town’s Emrys Avenue like a racetrack. The issue has been discussed several times at Cumnock Community Council. Community councillors say that an accident is waiting to happen unless something is done about the speeding motorists. Residents claimed that some motorists were driving at break neck speeds coming out of Emrys Avenue onto Ayr Road. One said: “Somebody is going to get killed. “They have 20mph signs in the street. “You would be better putting 200mph signs up. “They come out of Ayr Road. “It is getting beyond a joke and police say they are monitoring it. I have never seen them. “The speed is unbelievable.” A police spokesman who attended the meeting insisted officers have been targeting the area for speeding drivers. One said: “Two officers were out there from 5.40am to 6am. “They stopped 15 drivers and spoken to them regarding their driving. “The night shift officers were out and there was variety of folk going to work. “We were using education but we will still using enforcement. “A lot of the drivers weren’t aware of how fast they were driving at that time of the day. “I would rather use education first.” One resident added: “What concerns me is that at 4 or 5 in the afternoon come out of Ayr Road is like a race track and they are racing each other.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnCumnockAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"former wwe star hurricane tops","story":"NewsFormer WWE star The Hurricane tops bill as Pro Wrestling Elite stages anniversary show at Ayr CitadelPWE will stage their latest extravaganza - and are promising fans one of their biggest and best shows yet.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet16:03, 19 JUL 2018NewsPWE will stage their big event this weekend (Image: Copyright Unknown)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailGrappling fans are in for a treat this weekend as a host of wrestling stars will descend on Ayr.

The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12935909.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_080618maragret_12JPG.jpg","title":"meet this weeks class act","story":"NewsMeet this week\u0027s Class ActAyr United striker Michael Moffat popped along to Queen Margaret Academy to visit the youngsters who were holding a Soccer Aid event.\u0026nbspShareByAbi Smillie15:12, 17 JUL 2018NewsMichael Moffat of Ayr United pictured with the senior sports leaders (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFooty fans and soccer stars joined together for a special charity event last month.

The pair met on a night out in November 2013 in Irvine town. Catherine said: “We exchanged numbers and the rest was history. “We dated for several months before Jamie settled into family life with my little boy David and since then the two of them have been inseparable.” The couple tied the knot on Friday, June 8 at the Gailes Hotel.  “We had a Rugby Glam theme with lots of sparkle,” said Catherine. “We had centre pieces with feathers, rugby balls going down the aisle and silver sparkly table covers. “My son David wrote and shared a reading at the ceremony, which no one knew about, for Jamie about how he has made his mum so happy and how he is proud that this man is his step dad. The bride wore a strapless princess ballgown with cathedral train and sparkly cathedral veil. The 32 layered dress was MoriLee from J’Taime Bridal in Stevenston. The groom and groomsmen wore full kilt attire from Kilts4U in Kilmarnock.

Catherine said: “We were lucky enough that both sets of grandparents looked after the kids and we got a full seven nights in the Luxury Moon Palace Resort in Cancun, Mexico. “We were treated like royalty from the moment we walked off the plane - butler service, 24hr room service, chauffeur driven everywhere. “But, it rained 22 hours a day for almost six days out of seven so we were stuck inside felling like we were at Irvine beach not the Caribbean Coast! Hugh McFedries Photography and Magic Memories Videography captured the couple’s big day, leaving them with fond memories to look back on.

His team worked very hard to give us exactly what we wanted. “We can not thank all our suppliers enough - but to the venue Gailes Hotel, the effort the staff put in down to every detail and ensuring everything ran on time and smoothly . “Also, our Venue dresser John at LG Wedding and events he made everything look so magical and sparkly, this guy is a miracle worker. “As I work in the industry and have met many brides over time, it was such a strange feeling having the day being about me and having my very own photobooth and marryoke that my boss Marc from Foxy Photobooth provided. “All my guests loved it and the marryoke video ‘She is a belter’ has hit 5k views.” For more photos of Catherine and Jamie\u0027s wedding, pick up your copy of this week\u0027s Ayrshire Post.

And United proved that underdogs can upset the odds by finishing sixth and leaving Aberdeen, Dundee United, Dundee and St Johnstone in their wake. It was a stunning effort but McSherry, who was signed by Ally MacLeod on a free from Kilmarnock, reckons Ayr can once again confound the pundits and enjoy a great season. United kick off the league at home to Partick Thistle on August 4 and midfielder turned publican McSherry expects them to be up for the challenge. He said: “Consolidation should be the aim but there is no reason why Ayr can’t rise again and enjoy the good times that we enjoyed in the 70s.” An old team picture that surfaced in McSherry’s Wee Windaes got punters rewinding the years and reliving past glories. It was taken at the start of season 1975-76 and showed Ayr in their change kit of Barcelona strips. Proudly standing tall are, back row – Davie Wells, Alex McAnespie, Ally MacLean, Hugh Sproat, Rikki Fleming, John Murphy. Middle row – Alex Ingram, Gerry Phillips, Johnny Graham, Johnny Doyle, Hugh Cameron, Jim McSherry. Front row – John Dickson, Danny MacDonald, Davie McCulloch.   Jim recalled: “No one could work out why the team weren’t in their usual black and white if it was an official  team picture.  “We were also puzzled why there were 15 players in it, including two goalkeepers. “Then one of my regulars, Stephen Robb, came up with the answer – it was taken before a pre-season friendly.  “We wore it in a 7-2 defeat at home to Celtic and it was never seen  again. I think it was binned as a bad omen.  “These were good times at Ayr and the team was loaded with some great players. “We were the only part-time team in the Top Ten and were quoted at 66/1, which seemed about right given the teams we were up against. “I remember Ally signing me on the wall at Central Station and then telling me to look out my passport. “He told me ‘You’re going on tour to Canada next week’. It was quite a start to my Ayr career.” Only three months into that season, Ally was lured to Aberdeen and replaced at the helm by Alex Stuart who quickly appointed McSherry as captain. Ayr sealed safety with a last-day 2-1 win over Motherwell, who were bossed by Willie McLean and Craig Brown. Gerry Phillips got a dramatic late winner to spark euphoric scenes at a packed Somerset. The second season of top-flight football saw Ayr again more than hold their own.  They finished eighth in the table on 30 points, three ahead of Hearts and a distant 13 more than rock-bottom  rivals Kilmarnock.  Season 1977-78 marked Ayr’s third campaign in the top flight, a remarkable achievement considering they stayed part-time. Robert Connor, Ian McAllister, Derek McCutcheon and Iain Sim were called up from Ayr United Boys’ Club. But Ayr were always up against it and their life in the Premier League ended when they finished second-bottom on 24 points and were relegated along with Clydebank. Now as a new league season beckons with renewed optimism and a totally full-time structure, it’s time to dream again.

Prestwick Airport were delighted that the UK Space Agency (UKSA) continued to support their plans to be one of the UK’s three horizontal space launch sites. This follows the Space Agency’s announcement that Sutherland will be the UK’s first vertical spaceport, a significant step for the UK space industry. Prestwick bosses believe they are by far the most suitable spot for horizontal space launch in the UK in terms of location, capability and the thriving satellite manufacturing industry that exists on their doorstep. An independent assessment said most of the anticipated infrastructure required for space launch capability is already in place at the site, meaning that they could move speedily to achieve a licence once the legislation is defined. Airport bosses say the development of a spaceport at Prestwick is a real opportunity for the Scottish and Ayrshire economies. The spaceport project is an integral part of the Ayrshire Growth Deal and supporters say it would attract new investment to the aerospace cluster located around the airport, safeguarding existing jobs and creating many new ones. Stewart Adams, chief executive of Glasgow Prestwick Airport, said: “We are extremely grateful for the support we have from South Ayrshire Council and look forward to our continued collaboration with them and our other partners as we look to successfully deliver on our joint vision, a vision that places Glasgow Prestwick Spaceport as a centre of excellence for the space and aerospace industries. “We will be having further discussions with all our stakeholders to review our strategy and how to take our plans forward in light of the additional funding available. “We will also be talking to potential customers and launch partners willing to support operations at Prestwick.” South Ayrshire Council leader Douglas Campbell said: “Prestwick is still the most advanced site currently in the running for the UK’s first horizontal space launch and we’ll seek to use the development fund to cement our position. “Our focus will continue to be on supporting our partners to ensure Prestwick can deliver the significant levels of jobs and investment that we know can be realised.” Ayr MSP, John Scott, said: “The case for Prestwick hosting this facility is a strong one, including the availability of a 2,987m runway and many aerospace businesses already on site with and land to accommodate more.” And MP Bill Grant added: “I am delighted that Sutherland in North East Scotland has been selected for the UKs first vertical take-off Spaceport facility and equally important is the fact that Glasgow Prestwick is still in the running for a Spaceport licence for horizontal take off facilities.” The commercial space sector is worth an estimated \u0026pound3.8billion to the UK economy over the next 10 years.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnPrestwick AirportSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12953553.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Craig-Ferguson-Promotes-American-On-Purpose.jpg","title":"talk show host holds giant","story":"NewsTalk show host holds giant showbiz party at his South Ayrshire mansionAnd the telly alter egos of two of the guests were certainly more at home in a council tower block.\u0026nbspShareByStephen Houston15:23, 20 JUL 2018NewsStill Game stars Isa, Jane McCarry, and Tam, Mark Cox (Image: AYRSHIRE POST)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFamed American talk show host Craig Ferguson has staged a giant showbiz party at his South Ayrshire mansion. And the telly alter egos of two of the guests were certainly more at home in a council tower block. For Tam and Isa actors in Still Game - Mark Cox and Jane McCarry - were among those clinking champagne glasses. It was staged at his country mansion near Dailly which has become the Scottish seat of Ferguson. The party follows shooting of his new movie has been filmed in Argyll. Along with 140 cast and crew he was staying near Arochar while filming for ‘Love You To Death’ at locations around Argyll and Bute.  Stars include male lead Craig, Craiglang favourite Ford Kiernan and Liz Hurley Producer Matthew Weiner - the creator of the hit TV series Mad Men, said: “Our experience of filming in Argyll and Scotland as a whole has been phenomenal, we have never felt so welcomed and supported as Americans.” Sources say the party was a grand affair, with “lots of great people.” One guest said: “Craig really put on a show and his house is incredible. “As well as actors some of the Ayrshire gentry were there. They had a ball . . . and it was so funny to see ‘Tam and Isa’ there. “Craig is a huge fan of Still Game and appeared in it alongside Jane and Mark. “While Jane and Mark had no problem fitting in to the glamour surroundings, Tam and Isa would have been completely overawed.”  Craig bought his Ayrshire property for \u0026pound2million cash six years ago, bidding over the \u0026pound1.85m asking price. The 56-year-old was once the highest earning talk show host in the US, taking home \u0026pound8m a year. He fell in love with the mansion in the Girvan Valley and was keen to have a Scots base for his three sons. The house is 336 years old and has 14 receptions and 15 bedrooms over four floors. But it also boasts facilities fit for a Hollywood superstar with cinema, games room, billiard room, gym and tennis court. Craig has kept a low profile since, but four years ago popped up to watch the panto at the Ayr Gaiety with the family and wife Megan. Amazingly he actually trod the Gaiety boards 20 years ago in a touring show, starring with the late Gerard Kelly in ‘The Odd Couple.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"true-blue-mollie-honoured-on-her-99th-birthday","story":"PEEBLESSHIRE\u0027S longest-serving political campaigner has celebrated her 99th birthday this week.\nAnd Mollie McIntosh, who is also an active of her Walkerburn community, was sent a card and flowers by the Secretary of State for Scotland.\nMollie, who was awarded an MBE for services to her community in 2009 and was named Tweeddale Citizen of the Year the year before, has never allowed age to stop he working for both Tweeddale and her beloved Conservative party.\nBorn and bred in Walkerburn, she became an active member of the Conservatives when she was just 18 years old.\nPaying tribute on her birthday this week was MP David Mundell.\nThe Secretary of State for Scotland said: \"I enjoy saying to Mollie that she is one of our most active \u0027Young Conservatives\u0027 and she still volunteers her services to her local branch at every opportunity.\n\"She\u0027s a remarkable lady who has never missed an election in her adult life, both as a party volunteer and a voter.

Galashiels has been especially hard hit, with its proportion of vacant retail units now standing at 15% representing a total of 37 empty stores.\nHawick and Selkirk lag not far behind, with 14% apiece of their shops lying empty, and 13% of Jedburgh\u0026rsquos shops are also going spare.\nPeebles, Kelso, Duns, Melrose and Eyemouth have all kept their proportion of empty shops in their town centres at 8% or below, though.\nThe purpose of the town centre core activity area pilot study is to suggest updating the council\u0026rsquos planning policy in a bid to save the region\u0026rsquos high streets.\nIn it, lead planning officer Charles Johnston says: \u0026ldquoRetailing patterns continue to fluctuate, and the role of town centres is changing\u0026nbsp for example, the increase of online shopping and competition from larger national retailers.\n\u0026ldquoThe impacts of the current challenging economic climate are being felt across the country, and these trends are not unique to the Scottish Borders.\n\u0026ldquoPlanning policy must adapt to these changing circumstances.\n\u0026ldquoIn recent years, the council has amended its town centre policy in its local development plan to adapt to such changes, and whilst these changes have helped, it is acknowledged that a further review of relevant planning policy could be tested via this pilot study.\n\u0026ldquoThere are specific immediate concerns regarding Hawick and Galashiels, where reduced footfall and vacancy rates have had a detrimental impact on how these town centres have performed.\n\u0026ldquoThis is of particular concern as Hawick and Galashiels are the two largest towns within the Borders and have a strategic economic and social significance for the region.\nThe report recommends the council tries out pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels, either scrapping or altering their core activity area status marking out the boundaries of their commercial centres to allow a greater range of activity to take place within them.\nPlanning permission is usually only granted in such town centres if proposals are for business use in keeping with the surroundings of the sites in question, but\u0026nbspabolishing core activity area status would allow non-commercial enterprises to occupy empty high street properties.\nIn Hawick, the report says, a radical approach is needed, so it recommends councillors to vote to abolish the core activity centre there altogether.\n\u0026ldquoReducing the core area completely would, in essence, allow a greater number of other uses within the town centre, it says.\n\u0026ldquoWhilst there is the threat that complete removal of the core activity area may cause longer-term footfall issues, it is considered that some significant action is required in Hawick.\n\u0026ldquoTo implement this as a test case via a pilot scheme would seem an appropriate course of action in the circumstances.\nIn Galashiels, it is recommended that core activity area is retained but that the scope of activity allowed be expanded to include professional service businesses, non-profitable institutions and leisure activities.\nThe outcomes of those proposed pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels would then be used to draw up similar proposals for other towns.\nFootfall figures % change from 2007 to 2017:\nHawick

During this time there were three railway stations in Peebles \u0026ndash one where Tesco now stands, which was then extended to create a line to Galashiels the second in Dean Park and the third on Caledonian Road, serving travel to the west and Glasgow.\nThe rail link not only encouraged thousands of visitors, with The Hydro having its own spur, but underpinned the huge expansion of the weaving industry by providing fast, cheap links to world markets.\nUntil now there has been little recognition of the influence of the railway on the development of Peebles and, while some evidence can still be found in the Viaduct Bridge over the River Tweed and the railway tunnel connecting the bridge to the town, much has been lost.\nBut now railway enthusiasts are steaming ahead with plans to establish a museum which will house artefacts and photographs of historic trains during their journeys through Peebles.\nThe PCT is now hoping to gauge if there is an appetite amongst the people of Peebles for the museum.\nFurther investigations will have to be carried out, as it is believed the building is owned by Scottish Borders Council.\nIf the railway museum is given the green light, funding will be sought for the renovation of the old railway building. PCT chairman Lawrie Hayworth said: \u0026ldquoThis a really exciting project which can help us all have access to this important period in the town\u0026rsquos history, a period of rapid local transformation akin to the wider impact we see today with global internet access.\n\u0026ldquoThis should also boost visitor numbers to Peebles and provide economic benefit to the town. It is important to safeguard our heritage for future generations, and recognise the influential role the railway has played over the years.\nIf you would like to be involved in the project, contact

More of the same please.It was a good day for the Argyll favourites. A positive start which should continue at Kintyre Park against Pollock under 19s tomorrow with a 2pm kick off.

A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.

Boasting one of the oldest golf courses in the world \u0026ndash Musselburgh Links, The Old Course \u0026ndash the town was once home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who now play at Muirfield, near Gullane.  The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.

They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.

Angela revealed that Paul was a pupil at Musselburgh Grammar School when his condition was first diagnosed.  She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.

The artwork will be completed with a series of stainless steel arrows installed at different locations around Musselburgh. They are expected to be installed later this summer and will form a trail around the town to areas of cultural, historical, natural and community significance, supported by a Global Treasure App organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership.

Dunbar and East Linton ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire encouraged members of the public to go along and have their say.  He said: \u0026ldquoThere is a high demand for the parks that we have in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoAs the town grows in size, we have got to make sure we make best use of every bit of green space that we have.  A proposed theme for the park would be to celebrate the varied geology of the county.  Information cairns and distance markers could be created around a circular path.  The creation of paths, additional trim trail equipment and the retention of the putting green are among the ideas highlighted, as well as a new football area with permanent goals.  However, potentially the most ambitious aspect of the scheme is the creation of a new pavilion with access to public toilets.  The potential of a pavilion comes after Winterfield Pagoda, which dated back to the 1920s, was torn down in March last year.  Capital investment could also be made in a tree shelter belt, rural parkour \u0026ndash or free-running \u0026ndash elements in timber and additional benches and seating.  Another major project could be the creation of \u0026ldquoa low-key but iconic \u0026lsquogateway\u0026rsquo feature which would welcome walkers off the John Muir Way and into the park. That would require special funding applications.  Stuart Gibb, area manager of Dunbar and East Linton Area Partnership (DELAP), said that consultation had already taken place with groups such as DELAP and the town\u0026rsquos community council, as well as various departments of East Lothian Council.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe area partnership is supporting the acknowledgement that the town is getting bigger.  \u0026ldquoFacilities and amenities need to be on the ball in terms of that growth to ensure that we have suitable and sustainable facilities moving forward."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8055467.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"scottish-open-the-renaissance-club-to-stage-2019-tournament","story":"  This year\u0027s tournament is due to get under way tomorrow (Thursday) at Gullane Golf Club and, in 12 months\u0027 time,\u0026nbspwill move just three miles along the coast as it is played at the Renaissance Club, at Archerfield.

Five of those who lost weight suffered a \u0026ldquosignificant loss, according to the report by the Care Inspectorate officers who visited the home during an unannounced three-day inspection in May.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership confirmed it had suspended admission to the home following the report, which has now been fully revealed, after it emerged last month the home had been ordered to make urgent improvements after inspectors raised \u0026ldquoserious concerns.  HC-One, which operates the home, says it has introduced a new home manager and it pointed to some of the more \u0026ldquopositive comments in the report which acknowledged staff were praised for their approach to residents.  A spokesperson for HC-One said: \u0026ldquoThe health and wellbeing of our residents is our highest priority and we take all feedback from the Care Inspectorate extremely seriously. We are pleased their full report included some positive comments about the home, particularly noting our staff team are \u0026lsquokind and caring\u0026rsquo in their approach to residents.  \u0026ldquoWe also recognise we need to do better in some other areas. To do this, we have a new home manager in place who is being supported by the wider management team, and we continue to work closely with the Care Inspectorate and relevant authorities as we implement our improvement plan.  \u0026ldquoWe are pleased significant positive progress has already been made, and are confident the home is in a better place than at the time of the original inspection.  \u0026ldquoWe will continue working hard each and every day so that we are consistently providing the standard of care that Residents deserve.  \u0026ldquoThe Care Inspectorate have recently returned to the home to commence a new inspection, and we look forward to demonstrating the positive changes to them.  Drummohr is the second nursing home in East Lothian operated by HC-One to have admissions suspended in two years.  In 2016, Tranent Care Home was temporarily stopped from admitting new residents by the partnership, which oversees adult care services, after reports of residents being ignored as they asked for help to eat, with others eating with their fingers because of a lack of cutlery or being unable to cut their food themselves, while others were seen wearing clothes soiled or left unchanged after spilling food on themselves.  The report into Drummohr said: \u0026ldquoThere was a lack of oversight and management of food and fluid intake in the home. Nineteen residents were recorded as having lost weight in March 2018. Five had significant weight loss.  \u0026ldquoWe observed instances where residents did not take their meal and nothing else was offered, teas were often left cold and untouched and one resident walked around taking others\u0026rsquo meals and drinks.  \u0026ldquoWe also noted that there was specific guidance in a care file from the dietician in respect of food and fluids that one resident could have. The instructions were not followed. These issues, together with the lack of guidance to staff in respect of monitoring, recording and evaluating intake, is concerning.  The report added that \u0026ldquosome of this lack of care could be attributed to a lack of staff.  Drummohr scored a 2 out of 5 on all four areas inspected, a score regarded as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo. The four areas were quality of care and support environment staffing and management and leadership.  An East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe wellbeing of residents is always our paramount concern and in this case we will continue working closely with Care Inspectorate to ensure that HC-One delivers the required improvements as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoAs an interim measure, we have decided to suspend new admissions to Drummohr to enable staff there to focus on what needs to be done. They will be supported in this by a multi-disciplinary team from the partnership."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8061096.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"bus-mounts-pavement-in-tranent","story":"  The 62-year-old, who was driving an empty Prentice coach at the time of the incident, is understood to have taken ill at the wheel as it pulled out from a bus stop.

WHAT do we remember of our childhood in our later days? Think for a moment of the key happy memories which have framed your childhood. They are often simple ones involving play outside. Sadly, research is showing that children are increasingly less able to explore and play in the outdoors.  There are various reasons for this and there is a horrible irony at the centre of it. We have become far more obsessed with material things, it\u0026rsquos all around us. We are literally buying into the idea that happiness is about purchase and we are passing this on to our children.  It\u0026rsquos in our brains that the economy needs us to spend our money on things we don\u0026rsquot need. We are fed an ideology that spending money on stuff is not just a pleasure but a civic duty. It keeps the economy going and makes us all prosperous. That\u0026rsquos what we are made to believe.  But the result is that more than ever, for our children and ourselves, we are enslaved to the interests of corporate profit at the expense of what really matters: simple time to be and enjoy free pleasures.  These were my thoughts as I set off for the second of this summer\u0026rsquos journeys of discovery. I didn\u0026rsquot share them at the time, and of course I stopped thinking about them as the magic of the wood engulfed us.  We began our journey amongst yew trees which surrounded the ancient kirk of Garvald. It was a scorching day and the shade of trees was such a relief. The plan was to spend the day exploring the wood and discover Stoneypath Castle.  Garvald Kirk has a simple beauty. While parts of its wall are 800 years old, it has been subject to renovation and alteration over the last 200 years. There is a welcoming atmosphere inside and I reflected that when not being used for services it would make a perfect storytelling venue.  By the door there is a reminder of how religion can change its spots. A set of jougs hangs on the wall: an iron collar and chain once used to humiliate and degrade \u0026lsquosinners\u0026rsquo by chaining them up. The victims of this would have been mainly young women who became pregnant out of wedlock.  It\u0026rsquos right that it remains there, I think, as a reminder that religion can be used as a justification for intolerance, hate and cruelty as well as a source for love and compassion. The choice of which version to adhere to is a human one.  We followed the rabbits which scattered from the kirkyard into the wood. I was surprised that the Papana Water, which flows through the wood, was so full given there had been no real rain for weeks  It\u0026rsquos impossible to be bored in a wood. Hours were soaked up under the cooling shade of the tree canopy. It was quite simply a day of utter magic. We had our picnic under the shade of two giant Scots pine trees with the sound of running water in the background. It was the only real quiet moment in what would be hours of constant play. The kids just sat for a while, listening to the running water, and looking up at the trees. It was a communion of simple joy.  The walk isn\u0026rsquot so long in distance but it took us around five hours to complete. It could be done in 20 minutes or less if you just walk. But we didn\u0026rsquot just walk, we explored. There are three bridges which cross the Papana. Each one had a different attraction. Shoes were soon off and clothes got wet but the heat meant none of this mattered. A new game was devised when our youngest, Lewis, tried to use a piece of half-eaten banana as a substitute for a stick while playing \u0026lsquoPoohsticks\u0026rsquo . The girls rushed into the river to reclaim it, but then came up with a new game \u0026lsquohunt the banana\u0026rsquo.  After spending time at various points by the river, getting wet and discovering lots of things, we finally reached the walk\u0026rsquos end: Stoneypath Tower. It suddenly appears above the trees as if out of a fairy tale, its newly restored red walls and parapets a contrast to the green we were surrounded by.  There is much history in the castle, but then again there is history in the woods and hills.  As we headed back to Garvald the kids were quieter, tired by adventure, but in a joyful way. The image of my kids standing in the water, playing and searching for fish seemed to symbolise something immemorial: a powerful and simple truth that what we really need is an immersion in nature, not stuff that hijacks our wellbeing in the name of profit.  We surely stepped on the footprints of Robert Neillans on our return. He was a well-known cooper who lived in Garvald over 200 years ago. Perhaps he came foraging here, I thought. As the water sparkled in the sunshine I reflected that the making of \u0026lsquoillicit whisky\u0026rsquo was once common hereabouts and that Robert was, according to local historian Irene Anderson, one of those involved.  We walked past the house he built on the banks of the Papana when we returned to Garvald. What tales this village could tell!  We\u0026rsquod been \u0026lsquoaway\u0026rsquo for a total of nearly six hours in a magic place. But we\u0026rsquod met only one person walking her dog. In one sense that was a joy, and the absence of litter was another.  But it was tinged with a sense of sadness that the magic is something being lost to so many of us, and indeed that so many of the magic places are themselves being lost.  But my melancholy did not last long. It was a day of joy and we thanked the wood as we left."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8067093.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"day-two-of-the-aberdeen-standard-investments-scottish-open-at-gullane-golf-club","story":"  Rock is 13-under-par, two shots better off ellow countryman Tyrell Hatton.

The early proposals, which will be unveiled to the public later this year, show about 300 homes, with a quarter of those being affordable.  Included in the plans are provision for roads and drainage infrastructure, off-site road improvements, as well as land being set aside for play areas and open space.  The Proposal of Application Notice (PAN) is the first step in the planning process, with the idea of housing on the site, off the A6093.  The land outlined for the development is identified for housing in the new Local Development Plan and, according to the developers, will be designed to integrate with the Letham Mains development.  The public exhibition will give both housebuilders the opportunity to share their proposals for the development with members of the public and other interested parties, and for feedback to be passed to the developer.  A detailed planning application is expected later this year.

The 63-year-old passed away on March 2, having been minister at St Mary\u0026rsquos Parish Church for more than a decade.  Now her sister Susan Gibson, along with daughters Laura Burgess and Elaine Macrae, will be joined by nieces Clare Furze and Kara Wallace and granddaughters Ciara Burgess and Isla Burgess in the running-themed fundraisers.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom the runner in the family and I have always done a fundraising event every year.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was a great supporter, she was not a runner herself but she would tease me about the time I had done at the event.  \u0026ldquoShe was a huge supporter and always contributed generously to what I was running for.  \u0026ldquoAfter she had the terminal diagnosis, one thing we talked about was that I would organise some kind of running thing for the family.  \u0026ldquoIt was her choice to go with Edinburgh Maggie\u0026rsquos Centre because she had such amazing support there.  The charity, which has been based in Edinburgh since 1996, offers support to people with cancer and their family and friends.  The centres offer not only practical advice about benefits and eating well but qualified experts provide emotional support and the centres offer a chance to meet people or simply sit quietly with a cup of tea.  Team Jenny, which includes seven-year-old Isla, will in varying combinations be clocking up nearly 200 kilometres of timed runs throughout the summer.  Originally, the plan was for the seven family members to take part together in the same event.  However, with the family spread out in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Coleraine, it proved impossible.  Instead they are taking on half a dozen different events before combining both the distance and fundraising totals together.  Elaine, 32, has already completed the Baker Hughes 10k in Aberdeen, while Kara, 28, and her husband, Duncan, will be joined by Clare, 32, Elaine and Susan at the Run the Blades event at Whitelee Wind Farm, near Eaglesham, this month.  Meanwhile in Portrush, Northern Ireland, Susan will join Laura, 36, together with her daughters Ciara, 13, and Isla, at the Portrush Park Run.  Clare, Elaine, Kara and Susan will all take part in the Great Aberdeen Run 10k next month before Susan\u0026rsquos attention turns to the Scottish 10k, which starts and finishes at Musselburgh Racecourse in September.  Finally, Elaine and Susan will take on the Great Scottish Run Half Marathon in Glasgow, with Laura\u0026rsquos husband Barry competing in the Belfast City Half Marathon in September.  The family set an initial fundraising target of \u0026pound1,000 before increasing that to \u0026pound3,000 but both have already been smashed, with nearly \u0026pound5,000 already raised.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoIt is amazing.  \u0026ldquoPeople are just so incredibly generous and I think that is a measure of Jennifer and Maggie\u0026rsquos and the affection and respect people have for Maggie\u0026rsquos.  \u0026ldquoWe are very fortunate it is a very close family.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was very caring, had a great sense of humour and she was honest.  \u0026ldquoYou could always depend on her \u0026ndash it might not be what you wanted to hear but what you needed to hear.  \u0026ldquoShe had that ability to be completely honest without ever being harsh or unkind.  \u0026ldquoShe was incredibly supportive of the family and everybody in it.

Mrs Reid, known as Kit, told how she exchanged early memories of her nursing career and the transition into the NHS with the royal guest.  She said: \u0026ldquoMy first pay was two pound notes and a 10 shilling note. The week before national health it was seven (shillings) and six (pence).  Mrs Reid, of Haddington worked as a nurse from 1946 until 1952 and spent some of her career at Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Royal Hospital for Sick Children. The grandmother of five, with triplets in Seattle and a grandson in Saskatchewan, Canada, and a further grandson at the University of Edinburgh, said: \u0026ldquoThe Duke was absolutely normal.  \u0026ldquoHe spoke to me and asked various things about the work I had done.  \u0026ldquoObviously he had been briefed because he asked me about the pay and for what felt like a long time he spoke to me.  \u0026ldquoHe was just so charming \u0026ndash it was the thrill of a lifetime, the whole thing.  \u0026ldquoI met so many wonderfully interesting people \u0026ndash people from Orkney and Shetland, from all over Scotland, with their own stories to tell.  \u0026ldquoIt was just absolutely wonderful \u0026ndash I even got to walk on a red carpet.  Mrs Reid said that the NHS had made a massive difference to the way of life across Scotland and said she was \u0026ldquoall for the NHS.  The 90-year-old, who also met Scotland\u0026rsquos new Health Secretary Jeane Freeman MSP, added: \u0026ldquoMy first memory of work was the knowledge that the hospital was getting much busier and there were more children coming in and going out cured. Before that, the parents couldn\u0026rsquot afford medical help and were leaving it too late for their children to come in and many of them didn\u0026rsquot make it.  \u0026ldquoAlso I remember saying to the sister I was working with at the time: \u0026lsquoThe parents coming in now have lost their terribly haunted look because they know now they can bring their children in.\u0026rsquo  She told how the nurses had to live on-site in those days and would therefore tend to give up work when they became married.  Mrs Reid added: \u0026ldquoWe weren\u0026rsquot allowed to live out of hospital, we had to stay in the nurses\u0026rsquo homes.  \u0026ldquoI loved it \u0026ndash I loved the camaraderie, I loved the company, I loved everything about it.  \u0026ldquoIt wasn\u0026rsquot all drudgery and hard work, we had lots of fun into the bargain.  The evening reception, attended by 700 people, was one of a series of events taking place around the UK to mark 70 years since the health service was founded.  During the engagement, Prince William watched a short film about the history of the NHS and listened to singing by the NHS Forth Valley Nurses Choir."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8064994.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"rugby-stars-take-on-golfers-at-gullane-ahead-of-scottish-open","story":"  Scotland caps Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings faced off against South African Dean Burmester and New Zealander Ryan Fox in a \u0027rugby vs golf\u0027 challenge.\u0026nbsp  Kinghorn and Hastings kicked rugby balls around the championship course, while Fox and Burmester got some practice in earlier this week, with the rugby stars coming out on top 2-1.\u0026nbsp  Below is a video of the challenge. . .\u0026nbsp      Rugby \u0026#127386 Golf    With @LeuchieHouse and @MNDoddie5 as the official charities this week, we decided to have fun with a little #RugbyGolf challenge \u0026#127945\u0026#9971 pic.twitter/eCH0KBEjin  The Scottish Open\u0027s two charity partners this year are the My Name\u00275 Doddie Foundation, set-up by former Scotland rugby star Doddie Weir following his diagnosis with Motor Neurone Disease and Leuchie House, the North Berwick-based national respite charity of which Adam\u0027s dad Gavin Hastings is patron."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8070351.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"all-the-latest-from-day-three-of-the-scottish-open-at-gullane","story":"  He carded a two-under-par 68 in his third round today (Saturday) to lead the tournament at Gullane Golf Club.\u0026nbsp  He\u0026rsquos a shot clear of a six-strong group that includes American Rickie Fowler, the 2015 Scottish Open\u0026nbspchampion at Gullane.

Mr Cameron, who first visited the Titanic wreck site in 1995 and has since made 33 dives over a 10-year period, also believes an international agreement between the US and the United Kingdom would help conserve and preserve\u0026nbspthe site.  \u0026ldquoThe feasibility of raising the wreck itself is pretty much zero unless one were to throw enough money at the problem to start a colony on Mars, Mr Cameron said.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore talking billions of dollars, it\u0026rsquos a very daunting task working two miles under the surface of the ocean.  \u0026ldquoWhat is feasible is cutting big chunks off the wreck, for example taking the iconic bow section which I featured in the film.  \u0026ldquoThey could cut that off and bring a big chunk to the surface leaving behind a horrible disfigured piece of wreckage.  \u0026ldquoThe wreck is deteriorating as one would expect and the rust forms part of a bacterial colony, there is a strange beauty to the wreck.

It\u0027s all Remoaner fantasies and Brussels scaremongering to try to get Britain to submit to the heel of the European Court of Justice and cough up the \u0026pound40 billion divorce bill. Except that this scaremongering isn\u0027t coming from Brussels, but from the British civil service whose job it is make contingencies. And they are right to do so. A no-deal Brexit is looking more and more likely, following the effective demise of Theresa May\u0026rsquos compromise White Paper last week.  Her attempt to remain in the EU regulatory environment by adopting a \u0026ldquocommon rule book \u0026ndash in other words, agreeing to replicate all the terms of our current membership while not actually being a member of the EU \u0026ndash pleased no one. It was condemned as \u0026ldquovassalage by Boris Johnson in his resignation speech, and a \u0026ldquonational humiliation even by pro-Europeans like the former Labour EU Commissioner, Lord Mandelson. The trade bills scraped through parliament last week on the back of a handful of rebel Labour MPs and the indolence of the current and former Liberal Democrat leaders who failed to show for a crucial vote on Monday. But amendments from hard Brexiteers have made May\u0026rsquos White Paper unworkable.  The Scottish Government hasn\u0027t commented on the no deal preparations, but it, too, will have to think the unthinkable. This week the Supreme Court will rule on whether the Scottish parliament had the right to pass a Continuity Bill, seeking to retain control over devolved powers like food, fishing and environment repatriated from Brussels. But this has been comprehensively overtaken by events. The Scottish Parliament was reduced to the status of a parish council last week by legislation that ran roughshod over Holyrood\u0027s legal right to withhold consent if it disagrees with aspects of the new trade agreements. No Sewel convention is going to prevent Scotland disappearing down the Brexit sink hole.  Now, when people talk of a no-deal Brexit they usually mean something like Britain \u0026ldquoreverting to World Trade Organisation terms, or a Canada-style free trade agreement. Wrong. No deal means no deal \u0026ndash it means no trade agreement, no two-year transition period in which things remain largely as they do today. No rights to travel in Europe for work or leisure without a visa, no common standards for medicines, nuclear material or air safety. Everyone will do their best to prevent relations with Europe breaking down completely, and people being hurt \u0026ndash but accidents can happen.  A no deal would be Britain\u0026rsquos biggest economic dislocation since the Second World War. Even a bog standard, free trade deal has to be negotiated and the one struck last week between the EU and Japan took eight years. And even when we have one, it will not be anything like Britain\u0027s current \u0026ldquofriction-free access to the customs union and the single market. There will be tariffs of 10 per cent on cars (so goodbye Nissan and Honda) and 15 per cent on average on food. But much worse will be all the non-tariff barriers to trade: like sanitary and \u0026ldquophytosanitary\" regulations [protective measures against contaminants] which could make much produce unsellable. Service industries, which make up 80 per cent of the British economy will find that they are not automatically authorised to trade in the EU. Banks and financial services will lose their \u0026ldquopassporting rights \u0026ndash though many have already jumped ship.  There will be a hard border in Ireland, or the Irish Sea, because there has to be one, despite what Theresa May said in Ireland last week. No dealers, like the Tory MP John Redwood, insist this is not necessary. \u0026ldquoWe don\u0027t want to set up any borders he says.  This is a new dimension in post-truth politics verging on the theatre of the absurd. The whole point about Brexit was to set up borders \u0026ndash that is what leaving the European Union means. And the UK\u0027s only land border with Europe runs right through the Emerald Isle. It\u0026rsquos 500 km long and has 300-odd crossing points. Moreover the Good Friday Agreement requires regulatory harmonisation north and south. Brexiteers seem to believe that everything will just continue as it does now, and that all those multilateral agreements Britain has entered into over the last 40 years will somehow still apply even as we leave the EU.  Right wing economists like Professor Patrick Minford insist that Britain will be so efficient, freed from Brussels red tape, and so low cost, that we we\u0026rsquoll still be able to flood their markets with our cheap goods and services. But that kind of Vietnamisation of the UK economy is not something that British people are quite prepared for. Brexiteers expect the \u0026ldquoanglosphere \u0026ndash the Commonwealth plus America \u0026ndash to give preferential terms to the UK. But countries like Canada and India are all much more interested in trade deals with the EU, not their former imperial master.  Remain-voting Scotland has been watching the slide to a no deal Brexit with mounting alarm. There was chaos in Westminster last week, as pairing arrangements were abandoned, Tory anti-Brexit rebels were threatened, and a clutch of die-hard pro-Brexit Labour MPs saved the day for Theresa May. It felt like being chained to a lunatic. Every constituency in Scotland voted to remain and the consequences of a no-deal Brexit for Scotland will be dire.  But not nearly as dire as it will be for the future of the United Kingdom.  Descent into no-deal chaos, or even the imminent threat of such, will surely lead to the collapse of the UK Government. Theresa May has been a \u0026ldquodead woman walking, to use the former Chancellor\u0026rsquos phrase, for over a year, and now she isn\u0026rsquot even doing that. With parliament deadlocked, and both the major UK parties opposed to a repeat referendum on Brexit, her departure should mean a General Election, as the Tory party spirals into a state of civil war.  In any General Election against the background of a no deal Brexit we can expect the SNP to return another super-landslide even greater than in 2015. Labour will be condemned for failing to defend the Scottish Parliament\u0027s powers, and for Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s refusal even to contemplate a soft Brexit solution involving continued membership of the customs union and single market. The Scottish Tory revival is already stone dead, and the Liberal Democrats are irrelevant. Scots will vote with fury for the party that has consistently opposed Brexit: the SNP. That could mean curtains for the Union, as Scots realise that they made a mistake in 2014. The Tory right better believe it: no deal means no more UK."},{"url":null,"title":"no-deal-brexit-would-plunge-uk-into-state-of-emergency","story":"  Dominic Grieve, the former Attorney General and a leading Remainer, insisted crashing out of the European Union with no deal would be \"absolutely catastrophic\" for the UK.

He accused the EU of \"irresponsibly\" ramping up pressure in withdrawal negotiations, and confirmed preparations are underway for a no deal outcome.  Official analysis previously warned Scotland\u0026rsquos economy would suffer a \u0026pound12.7 billion a year blow if no deal was struck.  Experts have also raised fears over spiralling food costs, huge queues at the Port of Dover, tens of thousands of job losses and disruption in the supply of medicines.  Kirsty Hughes, director of the Scottish Centre on European Relations, branded the increasingly fraught rhetoric around the possibility of no deal \u0026ldquocompletely insane.  But she said she was still optimistic an agreement will be struck, adding: \u0026ldquoI think no deal is getting more likely, but equally, I don\u0026rsquot think either side want it.  Speaking to the BBC, Mr Raab indicated he was still trying to persuade all members of the Cabinet that Theresa May\u0026rsquos Chequers compromise agreement was \u0026ldquothe best plan to get the best deal.  He insisted a deal with the EU can be reached by October, but signalled Britain could withhold its \u0026pound39 billion divorce bill if it did not get a trade deal in return.  Chancellor Philip Hammond previously said it would be \u0026ldquoinconceivable to walk away from such an obligation.  Mr Raab also rejected comments from Brussels suggesting a no deal scenario would mean there would be no specific arrangements in place for UK citizens living on the continent, or for EU migrants in Britain after withdrawal.  He told the Andrew Marr Show said: \"Well, I think that\u0027s a rather irresponsible thing to be coming from the other side.  \"We ought to be trying to reassure citizens on the continent and also here. There is obviously an attempt to try and ramp up the pressure.\"  Asked about reports the Government is preparing to stockpile food, Mr Raab at first denied it, but then added: \u0026ldquoThat kind of selective snippet that makes it into the media I think is \u0026ndash to the extent that the public pay attention to it \u0026ndash I think is unhelpful.\"  He insisted it would be \u0026ldquofrankly irrational for the EU to pursue the \u0026ldquoworst case scenario of a no deal outcome.  Former Tory education secretary Nicky Morgan, a leading Remainer, said she believed a majority in Westminster and on the Conservative benches would not accept leaving the EU without an agreement in place.  Meanwhile, former Brexit secretary David Davis urged the Prime Minister to \"reset\" her negotiating strategy and start again.  UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the Tory Government appeared to be prioritising \u0026ldquostepping up preparations for a no deal instead of concentrating on negotiations.  He said: \"I just get the feeling that the tail is wagging the dog in the Conservative Party and those that want no deal seem to be ruling the roost and they are pushing for that.\"  The SNP warned a no deal Brexit would betray the interests of ordinary people.

A programme set up to teach children how to swim has revealed that more than 5600 of the little ones taking part are aged between three and five - ten per cent of the total children involved.  Parents and babies have also been getting into the pool, thanks to the Learn to Swim National Framework for Swimming, which also runs introductory classes to give even the youngest children a feel for the water.  The Learn to Swim Framework is aimed at youngsters from birth to 11-years-old and provides high-quality teaching at least once a week through a series of lessons and levels over a number of years.  Currently programmes are being run at more than 100 swimming pools in 19 separate Leisure Trusts across Scotland, with 53,451 youngsters receiving lessons under the framework.    Duncan Scott  Athlete Duncan Scott, winner of six medals at the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games in Australia in April, has given the programme his backing, saying it was important to start simmers off young.  He said: \u0026ldquoGetting children into the pool as early is possible is best way to start to love swimming.  \u0026ldquoIt is fantastic to hear so many kids at such a young age are learning to swim.  Scottish Swimming, supported by Scottish Water, now plans get more young children learning to swim under the framework by encouraging them to start before they begin school.

Safety both around and in the water is the paramount reason we\u0026rsquore involved in the Learn the Swim partnership with Scottish Swimming.  \u0026ldquoWe are looking forward to seeing the programme go from strength-to-strength, encouraging even more children and young people into the country\u0026rsquos swimming pools.    Scottish Swimming, the national governing body for a number of aquatic disciplines, is working towards the ultimate goal of ensuring everyone in Scotland can swim.  Local Authorities and Leisure Trusts have embraced the ethos of the programme, which aims to create more opportunities for children to learn to swim in a quality environment.  Another success of the framework has been the collaboration between local authorities, organisations and Scottish Swimming, made possible and enhanced through the support of Scottish Water.  Forbes Dunlop, CEO of Scottish Swimming, said: \u0026ldquoIntroducing young children to swimming at an early age brings a whole host of benefits for children.  \"The pool is a water based adventure playground for children to have fun, build confidence and learn new skills which they can use now and in future life.  \u0026ldquoWe want to try to ensure every child has a memorable, fun and enjoyable experience whilst learning to swim.

Mr Nairn announced yesterday that Nick\u0026rsquos Pizza Bar, which launched in Aberdeen in December 2016, would close with immediate effect and that liquidators have been called in to wind up the business.  The decision to close the doors of the popular pizza parlour comes just a month after Nairn\u0027s Cook School in the city was also shut, and now means that Nairn \u0026ndash who found fame on the popular BBC programme Ready Steady Cook \u0026ndash no longer has a presence in Aberdeen.  Five permanent staff members and a number of waiting staff have been let go, with Nairn personally breaking the news to them during a visit to the bar yesterday morning.    Celebrity chef Nick Nairn  The closure marks the end of a dismal time in the Granite City for the 58-year-old, who suffered facial injuries when he was attacked in Union Street while walking home during the early hours of the morning last December.  He spoke of his regret at bringing the shutters down on the pizza bar, which was set up in the same listed building as the Cook School in Back Wynd, formerly St Nicholas Kirk\u0026rsquos old church hall.  The decision was blamed on the economic downturn in the city since the collapse of the oil and gas industry, which Mr Nairn said had led to fewer people eating out.  Attempts to save the business by extending its opening hours and increasing marketing and investment failed to have the desired effect, and it was said that the bar was not viable as a standalone operation following the closure of the Cook School.  Mr Nairn explained: \"I had always wanted to expand into Aberdeen and the business had years of success with a loyal customer base.\u0026nbsp  \"However, the downturn in the oil and gas industry hit the economy in the north east leaving people with less money to spend on eating out.\u0026nbsp  \u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos with regret that I\u0026rsquove had to make the decision to close my business in Aberdeen where I have enjoyed having a presence.\"  He added: \"I\u0026rsquod like to thank everyone who has worked with us in Aberdeen, and all our customers and suppliers with whom we have had an excellent relationship.  Johnston Carmichael and Morison\u0026rsquos Solicitors have been called in to manage the voluntary liquidation process.    Mr Nairn has been a champion of Scotland\u0027s \u0027natural larder\u0027  A self-taught cook, Nick Nairn was awarded a Michelin star for his restaurant Braeval, near Aberfoyle, when he was 32.  He later want on to front a number of TV series, including Wild Harvest, Wild Harvest 2 and Island Harvest, and represented Scotland in the finals of Great British Menu, winning the opportunity to cook his Scottish venison dish for The Queen\u0026rsquos 80th birthday banquet.  He currently splits his time between his cook school in his home town of Port of Menteith in Stirlingshire, demonstrations and consultancy work.  He devised the menu and lent his name to the Kailyard restaurant in the Dunblane Hydro hotel, and occasionally cooks there.  The chef said his enthusiasm for Aberdeen was undimmed after he was attacked last December.  He suffered a black eye and a cut mouth when he was punched in the face, and was knocked to the ground.  His publicist Julia Forster fended the attackers off with her handbag while members of the public helped make Mr Nairn comfortable. He was treated for his injuries at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.\u0026nbsp  Afterwards, he said:\u0026nbsp \"I am sure it has been a painful experience for everybody involved and I am keen to put it behind me. All credit to everybody who helped at the time.\"  Oil worker Scott Smith, 35, was traced police appealed for witnesses and admitted the assault at Aberdeen Sheriff Court. He was fined \u0026pound900.  A spokeswoman for Mr Nairn insisted that the decision to close had been made purely on a financial basis.  She said that the pizza bar had been a successful business model, which had come under pressure because of the unique circumstances in Aberdeen.  She said: \"Nick will be back after this.

Mr Smith ordered Tory Party chairman Brandon Lewis to break a pairing agreement with an MP on maternity leave during a crucial Brexit vote last week, but Mrs May said he had made an \"honest mistake\" and had apologised.  He had been \"paired\" with Liberal Democrat deputy leader Jo Swinson, meaning neither would walk through the voting lobbies.  Ms Vaz, speaking during an urgent question on pairing arrangements, told the Commons: \"The answers and the statements made by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the House on the 18th July confirmed that the Government Chief Whip was less than candid with his fellow ministers, including the Prime Minister, by not declaring that he actively instructed Conservative MPs to break pairing arrangements.  \"It\u0027s clear that the Prime Minister and the Leader of the House have unwittingly misled the House by characterising the Government Chief Whip\u0027s action as an honest mistake.  \"This is a serious breach of the ministerial code.\"  Earlier, Liberal Democrat Chief Whip Alistair Carmichael, asking the urgent question, said he was \"disappointed\" Mr Smith was not responding.  He said: \"There are serious questions still outstanding about the events of last Tuesday evening and the only person who knows the truth about them is the Chief Whip himself.  \"There is a serious lack of confidence today in the system by which we run our business, and the only person who can restore that confidence is the Chief Whip.\"  Mr Carmichael added: \"It may have been a mistake to cancel the pair, but it was not an inadvertence - it was a deliberate act.\"  Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington said it was \"perfectly appropriate\" that he answer the question, and told the Commons the Government was \"committed\" to providing a pairing system as he sought to reassure MPs that \"the errors of last week will not be repeated\".  And he said Mr Lewis did not know he was paired with Ms Swinson, adding: \"He should not have been asked to vote, an error was made within the Government whips\u0027 office, for which (Mr Smith) has taken responsibility - hence his public apology to (Mr Carmichael) and to (Ms Swinson).\"  Mr Lidington said there was not \"some sort of deep-laid plot to deny the pairing arrangement\", and told MPs: \"Neither the Prime Minister nor the Leader of the House were consulted about the matter and the Government policy remains that pairing is an informal and voluntary arrangement between the political parties - we do take the issue of pregnancy pairing particularly seriously for the very reasons that have led both the business committee and then the procedure committee to highlight this as something which the House ought to address, and that is why we will be taking forward the debate on proxy voting in September.\"  Peter Bone, Conservative MP for Wellingborough, demanded greater transparency and called for a public list of pairing arrangements.  \"The problem is that until I came to this chamber today I had no idea there had been 2,000 pairs since the general election,\" he said. \"It\u0027s done behind closed doors and in secret.  \"If this pairing system was public and each day the people who were paired were listed - and in fact maybe even removed from the possibility of voting - then this would never occur again.  \"What we need is transparency and I hope the Deputy Prime Minister will look into this matter.\"  However, Mr Lidington flagged up the need for privacy for MPs who may be suffering health issues and insisted it was \"not always right\" for the arrangements to be made public, adding: \"I do think, despite what he says, it is best for these matters to be left for informal agreement between the usual channels.\"  Meanwhile, Labour MP for St Helens North Conor McGinn unsuccessfully called for the vote to be re-run, citing the precedent of a similar pairing breach when James Callaghan was prime minister in 1976.  \"He and the then leader of the opposition decided the only way to resolve matters was for the chief whips to meet and the vote to be re-run,\" he said.  \"Precedent has been set. When will the Government show the integrity I know he and many colleagues opposite possess in abundance?\""},{"url":null,"title":"andrew-mckie-the-so-called-liberalism-of-the-left-is-intolerance-in-reality","story":"  Actually, let\u0026rsquos stop there. The problem is always what comes after the \u0026ldquobut. \u0026ldquoI believe in free speech, but is almost always followed by some statement which demonstrates that the speaker doesn\u0026rsquot, in fact. Similarly, no one ever says \u0026ldquoI am a racist, but I think we should let them all in.  True, the Labour leader uses a variant on the \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom no racist, but technique, reaching instead for the apparently more inclusive conjunction \u0026ldquoand. His preferred formulation is \u0026ldquoI condemn anti-Semitism and all forms of racism. It\u0026rsquos difficult to see why the first four words of that sentence wouldn\u0026rsquot do perfectly well on their own, were it not apparent that a great many of Mr Corbyn\u0026rsquos supporters see the next bit of the statement not as an amplification, but as a qualification.  If you doubt this, have a look at Twitter, where any suggestion that the Labour Party has any sort of an issue with anti-Semitism is met by howls of protest and abuse from Mr Corbyn\u0026rsquos fans. These protestations often prove what they are trying to deny, because they frequently move rapidly from specious distinctions between Jews and the political stance of the state of Israel into wild claims that political parties, the banks, the media, or the capitalist system in general are run by a cabal of Zionists.  Mr Corbyn keeps assuring us that he would obviously like to distance himself from these racists, but\u0026hellip There we are again, you see. He never does so without some addendum.  So let\u0026rsquos judge the party\u0026rsquos problem by its actions under his leadership. Labour appointed Shami Chakrabarti to look into whether anti-Semitism was a problem, and she very quickly said it wasn\u0026rsquot. Then Mr Corbyn very quickly gave her a peerage.  The National Executive Committee suspended Ken Livingstone for saying Hitler \u0026ldquowas a Zionist until he went mad, then decided not to expel him (until he spared their blushes by resigning).  Mr Corbyn makes regular statements condemning Israeli government action, but has never condemned Hamas for firing rockets at the country less than a decade ago, as well as describing them as \u0026ldquofriends, he was calling for the group to be removed from Britain\u0026rsquos list of banned terrorist organisations, and appearing on Iranian state-funded TV after it had been censured by Ofcom.  A lot of Jewish Labour supporters, unimpressed by all this, staged a protest outside Parliament recently. And the party\u0026rsquos response last week? To draw up a policy that deliberately changes the usual definition of anti-Semitism drawn up by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, which is accepted almost universally.  It deliberately omits or rewords such standard anti-Semitic tropes as claiming that the state of Israel is intrinsically racist, accusing Jews of being more loyal to Israel that their own country, comparing Israeli policy to the Nazis, and judging Israel (the Middle East\u0026rsquos only democracy) by different standards from other countries. Such as, say, the 18 Arab League countries which don\u0026rsquot recognise Israel\u0026rsquos right to exist at all.  For some, including the Chief Rabbi and many Labour members, that confirms the problem, and the failure to tackle it. It ought to strike every reasonable person as bizarre. Bluntly, if the Corbynite wing of the Labour Party isn\u0026rsquot racist, why does it keep weaseling away from the issue?  Part of the answer lies in the certainty of the Left that it is intrinsically virtuous. This belief is so deep-rooted that it persists in spite of any evidence to the contrary, which is what makes it so difficult to correct.  It\u0026rsquos hard to imagine people openly describing themselves as Nazis, and arguing that the Third Reich was a misapplication of fascism, which would otherwise have worked splendidly, yet Communists make this argument all the time. The fact that every one of the numerous attempts to implement Communism have led to economic failure, suppression of human rights and mass murder doesn\u0026rsquot seem to matter, because their intentions are pure, so it wouldn\u0026rsquot happen if only it were implemented properly.  This accounts for the hard Left\u0026rsquos notorious tendency to split into smaller and smaller factions, and readiness to accuse other groups of having strayed from the One True Way. It also explains the way in which Momentum activists, convinced of their own rectitude, can concentrate on attacking the perceived shortcomings of liberal democracies, while turning a blind eye to the actual racism and oppression of many non-Western regimes. Stairhead Marxists of the kind who think that Tony Blair is on the far right of the political spectrum are now in charge of the party.  But the assumption of virtue is pervasive even amongst less extreme figures who identify with Leftist causes. It has created the cult of the NHS, where what matters is its structure, rather than its results or wide provision of free care, the avoidance of \u0026ldquoelitism in schools and universities, and the insistence on public ownership of industries, even when it\u0026rsquos obviously counter-productive.  Liberal or \u0026ldquoprogressive causes which suffer from the same problem include well-meaning measures intended for our own good, such as the sugar tax or bans on the advertising of junk food.  It\u0026rsquos at first sight paradoxical that what often calls itself liberalism should so often be illiberal, but it is the natural conclusion of a smug certainty in one\u0026rsquos own political virtue. The belief that you are morally in the right very seldom has anything to do with politics, which is mostly a matter of entertaining doubts, weighing up the practical evidence, and trying to see the other person\u0026rsquos point of view.  The attitude that you can\u0026rsquot be racist because you define yourself as an anti-racist, or that human rights and economic realities can be disregarded if your motives are pure is the opposite of the genuinely liberal virtue of tolerance. Tolerance implies judgment it\u0026rsquos just that it doesn\u0026rsquot assume that the belief that someone is wrong creates a corresponding right \u0026ndash or worse still, a duty \u0026ndash to put them right.  It was CS Lewis who pointed out that \u0026ldquoa tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive, because the \u0026ldquoomnipotent moral busybodies imposing it \u0026ldquodo so with the approval of their own conscience. Coincidentally, it was Susanna Centlivre\u0026rsquos play of 1709, The Busie Body, which was the first to produce the rebuke: \u0026ldquoBut me no buts."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7704523.jpg?type=article-full","title":"demand-to-save-our-high-streets-as-scotland-loses-16000-retail-jobs-in-seven-years","story":"  The Scottish Retail Consortium (SRC) made the discovey having tracked changes in job numbers, shops and retail turnover between 2008 and 2015, using Scottish Government data.  They found 16,000 jobs were lost across Scotland with just five out of 32 local authorities reporting an increase.  The SRC has called on local and national government to take rapid action to influence the pace of change and buy time for new investments.  CBI Scotland director Tracy Black said said more needs to be done to support business growth and long term investment to breathe new life into town centres including a \"more competitive\" business rates regime.    \u0026ldquoThe figures obviously give cause for concern, with many of the firms affected having a large economic footprint in local communities \u0026ndash particularly in terms of jobs. Not only are we seeing the sustained impact of tough conditions for retailers but also major changes in the way that people shop,\" she said.  Stuart Mackinnon, external affairs manager for the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) in Scotland, said it was time to re-examine the Scottish Government\u0027s town centre review to find out if public bodies are abiding by the \u0027town centre first\u0027 principle agreed four years ago.    \u0026ldquoScotland\u0026rsquos independent shops on our high streets are under pressure, mostly due to changing shopping habits, the collapse of many big retail chains, and the withdrawal of many big private and public organisations from our town centres,\" he said.  \u0026ldquoTo ensure that our local places are a success in the years to come we need more diverse local high streets with a broad base of retail and non-retail, big business and small business, and private and public.  \u0026ldquoIn some areas, there\u0026rsquos a glut of now empty chain stores but a shortage of housing or offices. We need to examine what the barriers are to putting these premises to better.\"  Among those bucking the trend were Midlothian and East Dunbartonshire with retail employment rises of 14.71 per cent and 2.78% respectively.  The average drop in shop jobs across Scotland was 6.3%, which Edinburgh and Aberdeen were above but Dundee and Glasgow fell below.  The worst falls were in Inverclyde, which lost of quarter of its retail workforce, and Falkirk, which fell by 27.27%.  The SRC found some link between falling shop numbers and a reduction in retail employment, with Falkirk having the highest reduction in shop numbers at 15.24% and Inverclyde shortly behind at 14%.  Across Scotland, only three local authorities - East Lothian, East Dunbartonshire and Midlothian - recorded a rising number of shops.  Ewan MacDonald-Russell, SRC head of policy, called for more action, including scrapping plans to charge extra business rates on out-of-town shopping centresand for more councils to use a discretionary rates relief system.  \"This analysis demonstrates how retail change is affecting the whole of Scotland, but in very different ways,\" he said.    \"For some communities this is leading to new opportunities with investment in new jobs, more productive and interesting work, and different business models.  \"However, we should not be blind to the serious repercussions these changes can have for local communities.  \"We are seeing shop closures and job losses which will reduce retail involvement in some town centres.  \"That change is inevitable, and presents a real challenge to government and local authorities.  \"They have the power to influence the pace of change, buying time for new investment and developments, but only if the scale of this transformation is recognised, and swift and coordinated action taken.\"  Scottish Labour\u0027s economy spokesperson Jackie Baillie said the figures were \"troubling\" and that it would look to support more retail apprenticeships and create a dedicated minister for small business as part of a plan to \"make the economy work for the man, not the few\".  \"The SNP has failed to support Scotland\u0027s high streets and small businesses for too long, damaging our wider economy and employment levels. That is unacceptable.  \"Scottish Labour has been calling for a retail strategy for some time now and the SNP has responded at a glacial pace. This level of complacency is shocking.\"  Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie added: \u0026ldquoWe need a transformational investment in education to deliver the highly skilled high wage Scottish economy of the future.  A Scottish Government spokesman said: \"We want local authorities to do all that they can to support businesses in their high streets, including giving full consideration to any request to use their powers to create local business rates relief or using any additional income they generate through the Business Rates Incentivisation Scheme.  \"We are doing all we can to support the Scottish economy, including maintaining a competitive non-domestic rates regime for businesses in Scotland and we provide the most competitive rates relief in the UK, worth around \u0026pound720 million, including the Small Business Bonus Scheme, which alone lifts 100,000 properties out of rates altogether.\"  The study also showed that Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Glasgow had fewer shop closures than the Scottish average of a 7.55% reduction while Stirling recorded a 9.23% drop.  Retail turnover analysis proved slightly more positive, with Edinburgh and the Lothians recording strong growth over the seven years of between 23% and 56%.  The Scottish average was a 8.8% increase but turnover fell in 11 local authorities, with Inverclyde the worse, down by almost half (48.76%)."},{"url":null,"title":"scotland-set-to-enjoy-new-renewable-energy-boom","story":"  UK Ministers yesterday announced that wind power projects on some of Scotland\u0027s furthest-flung outposts will be able to apply for subsidies which would remove the element of financial risk that comes with building away from the mainland.  The amount of offshore wind around the UK is also set to double in the next decade after the Government confirmed support for the industry.  A new auction for companies to bid for subsidies for offshore wind farms will take place in May next year, with auctions every two years, providing up to \u0026pound557 million in support.  Island schemes will become eligible for a \"Contract for Difference\" (CfD) with the UK Government, which covers the shortfall between the cost of investing in infrastructure in remote locations and the average market price for electricity in the UK market.  This ensures electricity generators have stable revenues while customers are insulated against rising bills.  Many Scottish islands are ideal locations for the development of wind power given their naturally stormy environments.  Now ministers have announced that for the first time, onshore wind farms on remote islands such as Shetland and Orkney will also be able to compete in the auctions.  The move could deliver up to an additional two gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind per year in the 2020s, to bring total capacity up to 30GW by 2030 from current levels of 7GW in operation, and 7GW in construction or with contracts.  That will be enough to meet more than a third of the UK\u0027s power needs, boosting jobs and cutting costs for consumers, industry bosses said  Industry body RenewableUK\u0027s chief executive Hugh McNeal said: \"Boosting our ambitions for offshore wind is win-win for consumers, as the industry\u0027s success at cutting costs mean that offshore wind is now one of the cheapest options for new power in the UK.  \"Today\u0027s announcement confirming the budget and timing of new auctions, sets us on the path to deliver the tens of billions of pounds of investment that will be needed to meet our ambition of at least 30 gigawatts by 2030.  \"This is good news for domestic supply chain which can look forward to a pipeline of new offshore wind projects that will support tens of thousands of jobs across the UK.\"  The auction system has seen the price for electricity from offshore wind more than halve in just a few years to as low as \u0026pound57.50 per megawatt hour of power.  One scheme which could see a huge benefit from securing a CfD is the proposed Viking windfarm on Shetland, a 103 turbine windfarm being built by the community in partnership with power company SSE.  Shetland\u0026rsquos vast oil fund which was set up in the late 1970\u0026rsquos has a half stake in a planned 103 turbine wind farm on the islands which would raise around \u0026pound10 million a year for the local community.  UK Government Minister for Scotland Lord Duncan said: \"Wind projects in the remote islands of Scotland have the potential to generate substantial amounts of electricity and cut emissions, supporting economic growth and delivering lasting benefits for communities.  \"Enabling these projects to compete in future auctions will reinforce the UK\u0027s position as a world leader in renewable generation, as well as providing Scottish jobs in any projects supported.  \"I urge local communities, developers and other stakeholders to work together to ensure that such projects deliver lasting benefits to the islands.\"  Energy and Clean Growth Minister Claire Perry said: \"The UK renewables sector is thriving, with more offshore wind capacity here than anywhere else in the world and 50% of electricity coming from low-carbon sources last year in what was our greenest year ever.  \"For the last decade the Offshore wind industry has been a great British success story: increasing productivity, raising earnings and improving lives in communities across the UK and today the sector gets the certainty it needs to build on this success through the next 10 years.\"  Sir John Armitt, the chairman of the Government\u0027s independent advisory National Infrastructure Commission, welcomed the announcement of a long-term pipeline of support for offshore wind, which he said would help give investors confidence in the market and maintain the UK\u0027s leading position in the sector.  But he urged: \"But if renewables are to make up at least 50% of our energy mix by 2030, I would urge ministers to go even further and extend this support to other technologies including onshore wind and solar power.\""},{"url":null,"title":"return-of-buoyancy-seats-gives-maid-of-the-loch-a-lift","story":"  The seats were part of the ship\u0026rsquos original lifesaving apparatus and were designed to float if the boat were to sink, giving passengers something to grab onto until help arrived.  Because of the impact of years of continuous exposure to the weather, the benches were determined to be in need of restoration as part of the Maid\u0026rsquos extensive refurbishment project. They were taken to the Scottish Maritime Museum in Irvine where they were fully transformed.  The seats have been put back on board the Maid alongside a \"lost\" seat that was discovered by a diver in 2014 and restored by a Maid volunteer. They are joined together on the rooftop deck, where they can seat up to eight people.

In September 1987, Bob Kingston in No 10 wrote to inform her private office: \"I am concerned that, when the PM dozes in the official car, the design of the headrests is such that, far from supporting her head and neck, they cause her head to drop forward.  \"This is in itself hazardous, but when the car is braked or turned, or there is some other disturbance, she lifts her head very quickly, and this I am sure will one day cause at least minor injury.\"  He added: \"I told the PM of my concern at Chequers last weekend. She agreed to the matter of a better design of headrest being pursued.\"  The files also reveal the consternation among executives at Jaguar Daimler when Mrs Thatcher\u0027s successor John Major, who suffered from an old knee injury, suggested replacing the armoured Daimler, which he found too cramped.  In contrast, the official Rovers used by the Government Car Service were \"definitely more roomy\" and he jumped at the prospect of a \"stretched\" version which \"could add another four inches to its length\".  Hearing the news, Gavin Thompson at Jaguar Daimler wrote to a sympathetic MP, warning it would deal a \"catastrophic blow\" to the company.  \"The popular press would have a field day. Everybody in the country and around the world has become used to seeing our Prime Minister in a Daimler,\" he wrote.  Meanwhile, executives at Rolls-Royce sensed an opportunity.  Marketing director Malcolm Hart wrote to No 10 offering to supply up to three Bentley Mulsanne S at a \"nominal\" price of \u0026pound10,000 each - compared with a list price of \u0026pound80,000 - plus \u0026pound70,000 for the cost of armouring.  \"Our cars are exceptionally well suited to such use as they have plenty of interior space, can be entered and exited easily, are well suited to armouring, are capable of long-distance high-speed cruising and are, above all, essentially British in character,\" he boasted.  Officials noted that, at a total cost of \u0026pound80,000 per car, the deal offered a \"significant cash saving\" compared with \u0026pound110,000 for a fully armoured stretch Rover or for a \u0026pound128,000 Daimler.  However, there were concerns for Mr Major\u0027s famously down-to-earth image if they went ahead.  Robin Catford in No 10 wrote: \"The obvious snags are the implications of accepting a cut-price deal and the possible repercussions, in terms of the Prime Minister\u0027s image, of moving up the quality car range. The latter has been rejected in the past: the former is likely to be a very slippery slope.\"  In the event, Mr Major decided to stick with what he had, writing in a handwritten note: \"Pl(ease) express thanks but no change for now at least.\""},{"url":null,"title":"james-callaghan-wanted-left-wing-trade-union-barons-ousted-secret-papers-reveal","story":"  Files released by the National Archives show that as home secretary in Harold Wilson\u0026rsquos Labour government, Mr Callaghan was deeply concerned about the rise of a new generation of \u0026ldquopolitically motivated union leaders.  In particular he singled out Jack Jones, the general secretary of the giant Transport and General Workers Union, and Hugh Scanlon, the leader of the engineering workers.  In response to his call, senior officials suggested undermining those with suspected communist leanings through \u0026ldquoinspired leakages to the press.  The details are disclosed in a note of a meeting between the cabinet secretary Sir Burke Trend, the head of the Department of Employment Sir Denis Barnes, and James Waddell, a senior Home Office official, headed \u0026ldquoCommunism in Industry.  Dated March 5 1969, it is marked \u0026ldquoSecret and Personal with only one copy to be retained.  It notes: \u0026ldquoSir Burke Trend recalled that the Home Secretary apparently had in mind that it might be possible by one means or another for the more \u0026lsquopolitically motivated\u0026rsquo trade union leaders \u0026ndash in particular Mr Scanlon and Mr Jack Jones \u0026ndash to be supplanted by others more orthodox and it had been envisaged that further consideration might perhaps be given to this possibility.  The officials were reluctant to act, fearing it could revive the controversy which erupted three years earlier when Mr Wilson denounced the leaders of a strike by seamen as \u0026ldquoa tightly knit group of politically motivated men leading to accusations ministers were using MI5 to spy on unions.  They did however suggest one possible course of action, noting: \u0026ldquoSir Denis Barnes said, however, that detailed exposure of Jones\u0026rsquo behaviour from time to time, perhaps by way of inspired leakages to the press, might be useful and productive.  The proposal appears to have come to nothing \u0026ndash something Mr Callaghan may have looked back on with regret when, 10 years later, the strikes of the \u0026ldquowinter of discontent were widely blamed for the fall of his government.  The file also includes a note from foreign secretary George Brown to Mr Wilson explaining how the English Section of the Foreign Office\u0026rsquos secretive Information Research Department (IRD) \u0026ndash set-up to counter Soviet Cold War propaganda \u0026ndash carried out such selective briefings.  \u0026ldquoBy discreet dissemination of such papers to trusted contacts, eg to various Labour Party officials at Transport House over the years, and to selected journalists, the English Section has done much to expose the activities of Communist front organisations in Britain, Mr Brown said.  The files also show how, in 1974, the BBC director general Charles Curran invited the IRD to brief the Board of Governors on \u0026ldquothe influence of subversive movements in the field of broadcasting \u0026ndash although,\u0026nbsp with a general election looming, officials were doubtful about the idea.  \u0026ldquoA leak that HMG was briefing the BBC on subversion might rebound in some perverse way related to the \u0026lsquoreds under beds\u0026rsquo aspects of the last election period, and at any time it could be distorted into allegations of attempts to bring political influence to bear on the impartiality of the BBC, one warned.  The files show that Mr Wilson was not the only prime minister concerned about subversive influence.  In 1985 Margaret Thatcher authorised the revival of the secretive Whitehall Subversion in Public Life committee \u0026ndash including representatives of MI5 \u0026ndash amid fears that the far left Militant Tendency (MT) was trying to infiltrate the Civil Service.

Publicly, Mr (now Lord) Lamont insisted no government would reveal such information, but papers released by the National Archives show that behind the scenes, he was \"increasingly anxious\" about the way the true state of the reserves was being concealed.  The failure to prevent the pound falling out of the ERM - which pegged its value to the deutschmark - was a personal humiliation for Mr Major, who, as chancellor, had taken Britain into the ERM just two years earlier.  As interest rates rose from 10% to 12% and then 15% on a single day, it dealt a devastating blow to the Conservatives\u0027 reputation for economic competence.  Figures finally released by the Treasury in 2005 under the Freedom of Information Act showed that in the course of August and September 1992, the Bank of England sold almost 40 billion dollars in foreign currency as the pound came under sustained attack from foreign speculators.  The final cost of the operation was estimated at \u0026pound3.3 billion.  The details of what exactly happened are spelled out in a letter to No 10 from Mr Lamont\u0027s private secretary Jeremy Heywood (now the Cabinet Secretary), dated November 26 1992 setting out the chancellor\u0027s strategy for rebuilding the reserves.  He explained the government had been able to disguise the amount of additional borrowing required, in part through the creation of what was described as a \"secret negative forward book\", to re-acquire foreign exchange through \"forward swaps\" worth around 12.5 billion dollars.  However, once the crisis was over, the opaque manner in which the operation was conducted meant the only way of running down the forward book was through a \"non-publicised\" programme of using sterling to buy back foreign currency - known as \"creaming off\".  \"In principle the forward book could be run down either by public borrowing or lower gross reserves but having consciously disguised this part of the September\u0027s operations it would now be very difficult to explain the real reason why we were now undertaking further borrowing or revealing lower gross reserves,\" the letter states.  \"That points to non-publicised \u0027creaming off\u0027 as the only acceptable approach - it is also the only way the net reserve position can be improved.\"  The letter notes that the Bank was \"very cautious\" about the tactic fearing it could lead to further falls in the pound, fuelling inflation.

Most other people have a speaking style which comes out horribly in print,\" he wrote.

Glasgow is now, with Bristol and Cardiff, in the running for one of two new \"creative hubs\" that the channel is to establish.  Channel 4 said the next phase of the process is to enter \"advanced negotiations\" with each of the cities in the running.  The creative hubs will include programme commissioning powers, hold up to 50 staff, and could be based in existing office spaces, although a new building is not, at the moment, being ruled out.  Glasgow is likely to consider the existing media quarter at Pacific Quay, where STV and BBC Scotland are based, a city centre space, or a regeneration area such as the Barras or Dalmarnock as potential locations for the creative hub.  It is understood that Channel 4 were impressed with Glasgow\u0027s bid, but noted that the city\u0027s bid had, among other issues, geographical \"proximity\" problems.  Although the broadcaster was apparently not strongly concerned about Glasgow\u0027s distance from London, where Channel 4 is to retain a major presence and which can be reached by air from Glasgow frequently, the channel is understood to have felt it was too far away from other potential \u0027 creative hub\u0027 cities if it became the national HQ.  Liverpool, which was short listed for both the national HQ and creative hub, lost out completely, being ultimately in the running for neither.  The Channel 4 guidelines for the national HQ said it should have a \"travel time to London up to 3 hours.\"  Stuart Cosgrove, the chair of the Glasgow bid said: \"Obviously we\u0026rsquore really disappointed not to be shortlisted for the National HQ, but the creative hubs are still a substantial prize and one that we\u0026rsquoll be working hard for.  \"We\u0026rsquove loved showcasing Glasgow\u0026rsquos great TV, design and music talent.  \"We already know Glasgow\u0026rsquos one of the UK\u0026rsquos cultural powerhouses and this has been a great opportunity to remind people of that.\"  Glasgow\u0027s bid for the main new HQ emphasised the city\u0027s independent production and digital sectors, the links between higher and further education and the creative industries, and the city\u0026rsquos social diversity, as well as the city\u0027s oft-quoted irreverent attitude.  The announcement follows the second stage of the pitch process over June and July.  Channel 4\u0027s chief executive, Alex Mahon, its chief commercial officer, Jonathan Allan, and chief marketing and communications officer, Dan Brooke, visited the 13 shortlisted cities for presentations and discussions.  Now the broadcaster will begin negotiations with the final six cities involved.  The locations for the new national base, which will have about 200 staff, and two creative hubs will be announced in the autumn.  Jonathan Allan, chief commercial officer of Channel 4, said: \"Our visits to the 13 shortlisted cities over the last month were incredibly inspiring and I\u0026rsquod like to thank all of those involved for the huge amounts of creativity they demonstrated and the excitement for Channel 4 and what we could achieve together.  \"We have again had to take some very difficult decisions on which cities to take forward to the next stage, but we believe the six cities we have selected are best able to deliver against our vision and requirements for the new National HQ and Creative Hubs.  Mr Allan said that the new facilities were part of its plan to spend \u0026pound250m more in the \u0027Nations and Regions\u0027 in the next five years.  He added: \"We therefore look forward to working closely with all those cities and regions that have been involved in the pitch process, as we look to catalyse that spend and support digital and production companies right across the UK.\"  Joe Anderson, Mayor of Liverpool, tweeted that the city had not been shortlisted and a \"big problem\" was it \"not being connected transport wise\"."},{"url":null,"title":"bbc-plans-to-provide-a-fantastic-showcase-of-talent-from-edinburgh-festivals","story":"  BBC chiefs said their coverage would allow audiences from all corners of the UK to \"feel the festival buzz\", showcasing top comedy, arts, writing and music.

It comes after it emerged SNP ministers had been operating a secret twin-track FoI regime, making it tougher for those most likely to embarrass them - such as journalists and political opponents.  Mr McAllister, who is Education Secretary John Swinney\u0027s most senior adviser, was interviewed by Scottish Information Commissioner Daren Fitzhenry as part of his recent probe into the Government\u0027s handling of FoIs.  While discussing the quantity of requests cleared by special advisers (SpAds), he singled out Education Scotland, a branch of the Scottish Government whose role is to support \"quality and improvement\" in education.  He said: \"Reviewing an FoI is often just a five minute job, but it takes up a lot of five minutes.  \"We see a lot of traffic from Education Scotland. Generally the quality can be patchy - issues with formatting, use of templates etc. We also see statements of fact which are clearly not true.\"  Mr McAllister went on to highlight one occasion when the agency issued a response claiming that they \"hold a copy of every inspection report\" for Scottish schools despite this being untrue.  Asked why the quality of FoI responses is \"patchy\", he said: \"For SpAds FoIs are routine and regular. For case handlers they\u0027re not. Often it\u0027s a rare, nerve-wracking, or unusual thing to do. They\u0027re often not doing it well.\"  He also said he demanded to see the \"actual request\" made when FoIs were passed on to him for review, and not a summary drawn up by case handlers working for agencies such as Education Scotland.  \"There are too many mistakes made in summaries,\" he said.  In another interview as part of the investigation Liz Lloyd - Nicola Sturgeon\u0027s Chief of Staff - also implicitly criticised the quality of work being completed by government officials, stating that \"SpAds get involved [in FOI] to get material up to scratch.\"  It comes amid an ongoing row over the Scottish Government\u0027s handling of FoI requests and the involvements of politically appointed advisers in what should be a legal process.  During his investigation, Mr Fitzhenry\u0027s team also interviewed a group of frontline FoI handlers.  Just 29 per cent said they had completed the Government\u0027s own online training programme.  The Scottish Government did not comment on the criticism of government officials by special advisers, instead highlighting its commitment to increased \"openness and transparency.\"  A spokeswoman said: \"We are producing an action plan to take forward all the recommendations.\""},{"url":null,"title":"expansion for young entrepreneur joss","story":"        A young entrepreneur has announced an expansion of his holistic crystals business with a move to a new location twice the size of the previous premises.

While I appreciate that Inverness is the larger and most busy airport, there is a real public perception that, at present, Inverness gets a lot of public money spent on it in terms of development and jobs, to the detriment of other regional airports.The Caithness, Sutherland and Ross MSP added: \u0026ldquoI have consistently made the case that Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport should be considered as a real possibility for the future of the air traffic control service in the Highlands, not least because of the real benefit and impact it would have on the socio-economic climate of the county.\u0026ldquoWe need sustainable, quality jobs and I am worried that this decision will limit many who have seen themselves as having a career in the aviation industry in the Highlands to only being based in Inverness.Mrs Ross added: \u0026ldquoIn May, the rural economy and connectivity committee, of which I am vice-chair, took evidence on this issue and were assured by the then minister, Humza Yousaf, that a full consultation and scoping exercise would take place and that there would be no decisions made until this work was carried out.\u0026ldquoI was very disappointed to learn of the decision to base the new service in Inverness, which seems like a real kick in the teeth to smaller airports that have been working hard to train, support and develop the expertise in their ATC staff.Trudy Morris, chief executive of the Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was also unhappy with the decision.She said: \u0026ldquoWe were extremely disappointed by the Hial board\u0026rsquos decision to select Inverness in principle as the location for a planned centralised air traffic management facility. Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport would have made an excellent base for this facility, and would have offered an opportunity for Hial to reverse the trend of centralisation of public services in Inverness.\u0026ldquoIt is our understanding that Inverness offered significant benefits to Hial with regard to retention of existing and recruitment of new staff, and we can appreciate why this proved to be a significant factor in the decision-making process. Unfortunately the end result will be a loss of skilled jobs from the rural communities which most need them.Ms Morris added: \u0026ldquoAt a time when the future for the north Highlands is looking bright, with significant investments in oil and gas, renewables, tourism and indeed the airport itself, we feel this is a missed opportunity to maximise these. We will be working closely with Hial, public agencies and local businesses over the coming years to understand and address the impact that this decision will have on the north Highlands.Inverness was picked as the preferred location for a new state-of-the art air traffic control centre following a study by consultants.Tuesday 24 Jul 2018 12:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"New record set for Lands End to John OGroats cycle run","story":"THE record for cycling from Land\u0026rsquos End to John O\u0026rsquoGroats has been broken by Michael Broadwith.The 40-year-old from Hertfordshire did the marathon bike run in 43 hours, 25 minutes and 13 seconds \u0026ndash more than 30 minutes faster than the previous record held by Gethin Butler.His record of 44 hours, four minutes and 19 seconds had stood for 17 years.Veteran local cyclist Alasdair Washington was a record-keeper for the Road Records Association (RRA) at the north end of the trip.Mr Broadwith, a maths teacher, joins a select number of people to break the record since George Mills, riding a penny-farthing, made the first successful end-to-end attempt in 1886.Broadwith also broke the RRA 24-hour record with 507.511 miles covered at an average speed of 21.1 miles per hour.Bill Mowat, vice-chairman of the Dunnet and Canisbay Community Council, congratulated Mr Broadwith on his remarkable achievement.The women\u0026rsquos record holder is Lynne Taylor who lives in the West Midlands. \u0026ldquoShe is the only one with a Canisbay parish relative to do so, said Mr Mowat, who pointed out that the RRA only recognised female racers in the late 1930s.

Its expertise is thought to have formed part of the case for siting the facility at the Moine, which is about 40 miles west of Dounreay.Cavendish Dounreay Partnership (CDP) and its subsidiary Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd (DSRL) have invested resources in the spaceport proposal as part of its bid to identify and develop new jobs after the closure of the plant.Mr Craig said: \u0026ldquoEvery single one of us here at Dounreay recognises the importance of seizing opportunities like these to create new job opportunities, not just for this generation but the one that follows when Dounreay is gone.He added: \u0026ldquoOur skill sets in engineering, environmental science, programme management and a range of technical disciplines are easily transferable to industries such as the space sector and I am committed to working closely with the developer and operator to make the most of this amazing opportunity for our people.CDP chairman Simon Bowen said: \u0026ldquoDecommissioning a complex nuclear site like Dounreay is about more than getting it into a state that is safe for future generations \u0026ndash it is also about securing the social and economic prosperity of future generations.\u0026ldquoThe UK vertical launch facility is a key priority, with the potential to deliver high-value employment and supply chain opportunities.Sutherland was one of three potential spaceport locations to submit outline business cases to Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) earlier this year. The others were Scolpaig on North Uist and Unst in Shetland.All three were assessed by independent consultants with specialist knowledge of the space sector.Each one met key criteria, including the ability to stage north facing launches over the sea into both polar and sun-synchronous orbit.However, the business case for Sutherland was judged stronger overall, including being successfully awarded UK Space Agency funding for its proposals in collaboration with potential launch operators.HIE chief executive Charlotte Wright said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore very clear that we want to work with others to ensure the benefits of a spaceport in the Highlands and Islands are not confined to Sutherland, but extend well beyond.\u0026ldquoA central part of our approach as we develop this project will be to explore opportunities throughout our region.Tuesday 24 Jul 2018 12:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Vet finds Major mess on record paddle run","story":"A VET caused a bit of a splash when she swapped her stethoscope for a paddleboard to complete a memorable Land\u0026rsquos End to John O\u0026rsquoGroats journey.Cal Major was paddling along the seas, rivers and canals of Britain in order to raise awareness of plastic pollution in our waters and to also raise money for mental health charities the Samaritans and Vetlife.The 30-year-old completed her momentous journey inside 59 days \u0026ndash as she\u0026rsquos the first to do this by paddleboard, she is now the official world-record holder.Cal, who hails from North Devon, is keen to highlight not only the untidiness of plastic litter left on our beaches and in our seas but also the damage it can do to both the sea wildlife and the environment.She found many examples of plastic pollution along the way to John O\u0026rsquoGroats and hopes people will give more though to their use and disposal of plastic products.\u0026ldquoThere was plastic wherever I went. I found countless deserted and remote beaches piled high with it \u0026ndash plastic bottles, cotton-bud sticks, fishing gear, plastic bags, she said.\u0026ldquoThe worst-affected beaches in Scotland were on the west coast. On the east coast there was noticeably less on the beaches, but I was still paddling past beaches with nesting birds that had multicoloured plastic littering them.\u0026ldquoPaddling up the north-east coast, and particularly around Duncansby Head, I picked up several large plastic bags.\u0026ldquoThe inland canals were the worst affected. One morning in Wigan I counted 691 plastic bottles just in the first hour of paddling.Cal admitted that the marathon paddle was not without a scary moment or two.She added: \u0026ldquoThe Mull of Galloway paddle was one of the more terrifying moments. Storm Hector was approaching, so I had just one window to get around the Mull.\u0026ldquoI set off at 11.30pm, just as it had got dark, and paddled 14 miles across Luce Bay.\u0026ldquoThe darkness made it very hard to navigate so I used GPS and, once I could see lights on the opposite landmass and the lighthouse at the Mull, I focused on that.\u0026ldquoWith the Isle of Arran, I set off with a five-hour window to get to Arran before a storm was due to come in.\u0026ldquoThe winds were strong the entire time, mostly behind me but enough of a crosswind to make the paddling incredibly challenging and painful. When I was 12 miles across, the waves were almost as big as me and the storm came in early. I was very scared and felt very alone \u0026ndash panic was starting to set in.\u0026ldquoOnce I was within a mile of the island, and knew I was safe, fear turned to exhilaration, and the feeling of being propelled along by 20-30 knot winds was incredible.Tuesday 24 Jul 2018 12:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Wick River green slime passed safe for canines","story":"THE Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) has allayed fears that an algae that has appeared on the surface of Wick River is harmful.Dog walkers in Wick had voiced concerns about the \u0026ldquogreen slime following the poisoning death of a dog by blue-green algae in the River Conon in Ross-shire last week.A spokesman from Sepa said that officers had confirmed the presence of enteromorpha in Wick River.\u0026ldquoEnteromorpha is a type of green algae\u0026nbspwhich, unlike blue-green algae, is not harmful.

This means 42 per cent of all eligible LFASS 2017 claims have now been paid, with more payments to follow in the coming weeks.Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing said: “Given the pressures that farmers and crofters continue to face, due in part to the extreme weather conditions during the winter and summer periods, I’m glad to see these important payments starting two months earlier than last year.“Earlier in the year we provided a loan option for farmers in advance of these payments, to help provide cashflow and financial certainty. Farmers are the backbone of Scotland’s rural economy and the Scottish Government is committed to supporting them wherever possible.\u0026#8221On behalf of the Scottish Farmers Union, NFU Scotland, LFA Committee Chairman, Robert Macdonald, welcomed the news saying: “The news that LFASS payments will be reaching farmers and crofters is welcome, particularly for those who did not apply for or receive an LFASS loan of 90 per cent through the LFASS loan scheme. The current prolonged period of extraordinary weather, and the economic impact that it brings, once again underlines the importance of these payments to business stability.“As we look ahead its vital that support for the less favoured areas, for hill farms and crofts, continues. NFU Scotland continues to press the Scottish Government for a timetable for payments, delivered in a timely manner to allow farmers and crofters to efficiently plan their cashflow.“Whilst these payments will bring relief for some, NFUS continues to highlight to farmers and crofters the importance of planning ahead for straw and feed supplies with three key messages — Plan ahead, Be flexible and collaborate.”\u0026nbsp\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We created the FitHomes concept to help Highland residents take charge of their own wellbeing and health needs through innovative technology and design.\"Thanks to the support we\u0026rsquove had from Centrica, both financially and advisory, we will be able to deliver digital health and assisted living technologies in a way that has not been possible before.\"The investment has been made by Centrica\u0026rsquos Ignite social impact investment fund. Established in 2017, Centrica Innovations aims to invest \u0026pound100 million by 2022 in new technologies that will transform the way people live, work and move.Sam Salisbury, Centrica Innovations labs director, said: \"As a market leader in connected home products, we are always on the lookout for opportunities to solve real world problems with new technology and innovation. The lack of affordable, energy efficient, desirable homes is one that is affecting families across the country so we\u0026rsquore delighted to be able to support an initiative that shows such potential in transforming how people, young and old, live in their homes.\"The origins of the FitHome go back to 2008 when a tenant was found dead in his home, having lain unnoticed for over a year. Vowing to put new preventative systems in place, Albyn commissioned research exploring potential solutions. As a result, the society decided to develop its own system that could be adopted across its growing portfolio of homes.Matt Stevenson of Carbon Dynamic said of FitHomes: \"I truly believe that this housing method can change the way that we view construction of new housing developments as well as feeding into the wider healthcare and societal issues.\"Tuesday 24 Jul 2018 12:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It has been credited with helping some people to turn their lives around.Confirmation that Mr Harper, who has also sold on the streets of Inverness, had found a successful new niche for himself came when he was handed a Scotland\u0026rsquos Top Seller accolade.Mr Harper, who has overcome major health challenges, averages around 160 copies a week. He has been selling the magazine on and off since it was launched back in 1991.The secret to his success is fairly straightfoward, he believes: \"I speak to everybody who walks past me.

I feel like a part of the community here. People bring me stuff all the time \u0026ndash recently I was given a bag of clothes \u0026ndash not all of them fitted me, so I took the rest to a charity shop so they could use them. And recently one of my customers bought me lunch.\"The staff at Tesco always ask how I\u0026rsquom doing \u0026ndash I get on really well with Steve, the manager, he tells me I\u0026rsquom good with the punters.

As a result, Newton Road will be closed from July 19 at 7am to July 22 at 11am. And Dingwall No.1 in Craig Road will be shut from 7am on August 2 to 11am on August 5.Final installation and testing of the new barriers will also require fortnight-long road closures at both sites \u0026ndash Dingwall Middle from October 15 to 29 and Dingwall No.1 from October 29 to November 12.David Dickson, infrastructure director for Network Rail Scotland, said: \"These level crossing upgrades represent a significant improvement for rail and road safety.\"Our consultation work with the local community earlier this year indicated support for these improvements and we look forward to seeing them delivered.\"Our aim is to deliver this work with as little disruption as possible, however, we will require two short closures this summer plus two week road closures for each crossing to install and test the new equipment this autumn.\"Train services are not expected to be affected by any of the works.Tuesday 24 Jul 2018 12:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

A spokesperson for the judges said:\"He is someone who thoroughly deserves to be recognised for the great contribution he has made to both the industry and the community. A wonderful role model and ambassador.\"Stories shared by his colleagues when nominating him, included times when he dug out roads during a storm to deliver bottled gas and a generator to a terminally-ill customer delivering flowers to a customer who had recently lost her husband, and caring for a customer who had suffered a severe stroke.\"For me, it isn\u0026rsquot about going above and beyond, it\u0026rsquos about doing what I feel is the right thing to do and making sure our customers are cared for and supported when they need us most,\" said a modest Mr Sutherland, who said the award was as much recognition for the Highland team as for himself. \"I\u0026rsquom delighted to take this award home to my wife and girls, who have supported me along the way as I disappeared for days during storms, sometimes missing important events and occasions at home. It\u0026rsquos all worth it as I\u0026rsquom glad to say I still love my job as much as I did when I joined 44 years ago as an apprentice.\"Colin Pirie, SSEN\u0026rsquos head of Region for the Highlands and Islands, added: \"Mike is without doubt the most dedicated, conscientious person I have ever met in my 28 years with SSEN.\"He genuinely cares for everyone he meets. His selfless attitude and his devotion to customers, colleagues (especially young people and trainees) and his family is well known. He is an example to us all.\"Mike is a great colleague but more importantly a great friend to all of us in the Highlands.\"Since their launch of the Utility Week Stars Awards in 2014, the annual event has grown to become the de facto celebration of dedication, ingenuity and teamwork in the UK utilities sector.SSEN picked up another gong, as the SSEN Safety, Health and Environment team won the Health and Safety Initiative award for the roll-out of an influencing behaviours training programme and safety licence across the division.Tuesday 24 Jul 2018 12:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The first is the cinema, which would be built on land close to the ferry slipway and next to an existing boat storage shed.It would seat roughly 30 people and host weekly screenings throughout the year, rising to twice a week in the summer. It would also be used to help house Cromarty\u0026rsquos growing film festival, which attracts fans and famous faces from across the country every autumn.Cromarty Estate also plans to build an office hub alongside the cinema in a bid to cater for growing business demand in the town.A statement submitted by Cromarty Estate said: \"Cromarty has a thriving entrepreneurial community but this is not matched by suitable office accommodation, with the result that many find themselves having to move their business bases from Cromarty to Dingwall, Tore or Inverness when they outgrow their own homes, with the resulting loss of employment opportunities in the town.\"Addressing this need... will make Cromarty a more balanced and sustainable community.\"Film society trustee Tanya Karlebach said the group was \"really excited\" to reach this milestone and the move would help increase the frequency of screenings in Cromarty.She added that there is still some fundraising to do before the \u0026pound240,000 cost of the venue is covered, but that by lodging the application now, they are hopeful permission will be in place to begin as soon as the target is met.They hope to hear about their remaining grant applications and other fundraising by late autumn.She added the society had opted for a new-build because none of the existing sites in Cromarty were suitable for conversion. They would also have cost more to take on than building a cinema from scratch.\"We hope the community is supportive,\" she said. \"We\u0026rsquove had positive feedback so far and it\u0026rsquos in a great location down by the ferry.\"A survey of Cromarty residents found that 82 per cent backed a cinema in the town and the same number would go to more screenings if the venue was better than what is currently on offer.The plans for the cinema and office hub have won support from a leading Highland business figure.David Richardson, the Federation of Small Businesses\u0026rsquo Highlands and Islands development manager, said the organisation \"wholeheartedly supports locally-managed collaborative ventures that make our small rural communities even better places to live, especially for the young people and families that we desperately need to retain and attract.\"Cinemas appeal to all ages and to locals and visitors alike, and they can also be great social hubs.\"Equally, the presence of purpose-designed office space can do much to encourage would-be entrepreneurs to take the plunge and start new businesses existing small business to expand and to attract businesses from outside to relocate.\"It approved the buildings would feature dark metal cladding to the walls of the cinema, with timber cladding on the office hub.Construction could start as early as spring next year.To donate to the cinema project go to www.justgiving/crowdfunding/cromartycommunitycinemaTuesday 24 Jul 2018 12:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

People living near Edinburgh Airport or under the flight path say planes leaving and arriving late at night or in the early hours of the morning are disturbing their sleep.            The airport has admitted the noise nuisance from night flights was an issue.            After meeting airport bosses Edinburgh West Liberal Democrat MP Christine Jardine said she had received assurances that they would be taking action to reduce night-time flights.She said: “There has been a marked effort by the airport to engage with the public and I am glad they are taking positive steps. Night flights and the disturbance they cause are an issue frequently brought to me by constituents. I look forward to seeing the package of measures the airport propose.”READ MORE: Glasgow man ‘humiliated’ during body search at Edinburgh AirportMs Jardine conducted a survey earlier this year, which showed 295 out of 710 people who responded said they were affected by night flights and 449 said they would support restrictions on further night flights. She said: “I am delighted the airport has taken on board the findings of my survey and the complaints of those who live near the airport and under the flight paths.Helena Paul, of campaign group Edinburgh Airport Watch, pointed out the new flights to and from Beijing, which started last month, were effectively night flights, leaving from Edinburgh at 11.10pm and arriving from Beijing at 5am.            She said: “Edinburgh is unusual as an airport in that it doesn’t have any operating hours restrictions. There are multiple flights taking off and landing between 11pm and 7am. Many of them are charter flights because it’s normally cheaper at these times. And a lot of cargo goes out at night.“People are being wakened up at 4.30am and once your sleep in interrupted that’s it.”She claimed a majority of residents would support a ban on flights during the night. “If Edinburgh Airport is serious about listening to the community they would listen to that. They could choose to operate their airport slightly differently  and not disturb people at night.”            A comparison of statistics on the number of night flights now and four years ago shows a steep increase in their frequency.The figures show a total of 138 take-offs and landings at Edinburgh between 11pm and 6am - the airport’s definition of night flights - during one week in July 2014.The equivalent week this month saw a total of 191 such movements between these times.READ MORE: Edinburgh Airport chief slams reader for written ‘attack’ on teamAn airport spokesman said: “We welcome Christine Jardine’s support as we examine how best to deal with community feedback on night noise.             “Edinburgh Airport consulted on the impacts of noise earlier this year as part of the updating of its five-year Noise Action Plan.“It was clear that noise at night is an area of concern in some local communities and we’re working with our airlines to explore how best to mitigate any impacts.“We should be in a position to discuss plans in more depth later this year.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4772982.1532420956!/image/image.jpg","title":"edinburgh rated one of europe s best cruise destinations for 2018","story":"        Edinburgh is renowned for its medieval Old Town, historic castle and playing host to world famous events such as the Fringe and Tattoo.

We’re really proud of Edinburgh’s beauty, heritage, culture and many other attractions – but it’s always good to have that officially recognised.“Tourism is incredibly important to our economy providing around 35,000 jobs – so the news that we are a top cruise destination is very welcome.”            Plans have also been floated to build a new cruise liner terminal at the site of the former Cockenzie power station.Backers say the move would open the door to new ferry services to northern Europe, create much-needed jobs for young people in the area and boost the economy by attracting thousands of tourists.Rob Mason, head of cruise for Capital Cruising in Scotland said: “This is a significant global recognition for Edinburgh and we are thrilled with the award especially as this is feedback directly from cruise passengers.“Our cruise business is thriving and we are seeing our cruise calls grow each year.“We are the only operator to offer the closest cruise connection to the beautiful city of Edinburgh and we have invested significantly over the past few years to provide the most direct access for liners of all sizes to Scotland’s Capital.

We are delighted that Edinburgh has pipped so many other wonderful Western European ports to the post to be crowned the best destination in the British Isles \u0026amp Western Europe. Not only does this highlight the rise in popularity of destinations more known for their immersive, educational and experiential offerings, rather than just their temperate climate or great beaches, but also shows just how attractive Scotland is proving to travellers across the globe.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4771842.1532286669!/image/image.jpg","title":"andrew blick history shows how may could form grand coalition","story":"        Conservative MP Anna Soubry recently floated a idea that to some might seem radical: establish some kind of all-party \u0026#8220national unity government\u0026#8221 to avoid a no-deal Brexit. But what are the prospects for such a project, what form might it take, and what would be the political implications?                To help answer these questions, it is useful to consider some historical precedents. On occasions over the last century or so, at moments of national crisis, politicians of the main parties at Westminster have come together to form governments intended specifically to address the threat.            There are three particular examples that stand out. In World War I, a coalition formed first under Herbert Henry Asquith in 1915 and then David Lloyd George in 1916. Then, in 1931, faced with a sterling crisis, the Labour government of Ramsay MacDonald collapsed and was replaced by a national government under his leadership. And in 1940, Winston Churchill came to power during World War II as head of a newly formed coalition.            Based on these examples and other aspects of the constitution, a number of observations about the current prospects are possible. First, the most important principle for the formation and maintenance of any government is that it possesses the confidence of the House of Commons (though that need not entail winning every single vote). The House of Commons can, if determined enough, bring about the establishment of a coalition government. And so long as such a government possesses that confidence, it can continue to function.Alternatively – and perhaps more likely – rather than the House of Commons taking a direct initiative, a deal between senior politicians could command that confidence. A national unity government against a no-deal Brexit, then, is plausible in as far as a majority of MPs appear to be opposed to exit without a deal coming about. Indeed, such an administration, if it were backed by all of the “anti-no-deal” MPs, could well enjoy an absolute majority in the House of Commons, unlike the current Conservative government, which is in a Commons minority and reliant on support from the Democratic Unionist Party.READ MORE: Joyce McMillan: New political alliance vital to stop Brexit disasterThe formation of a national unity coalition may also involve an existing prime minister ending one government and forming a new one (as, for instance, MacDonald did in 1931). Alternatively, it may entail a change of prime minister (as when Churchill first came to the premiership in 1940). In other words, this coalition, if it came about, could be led by Theresa May or by someone else. That person might come from the party providing the most MPs (like Churchill in 1940) but need not do so (Lloyd George from 1916 MacDonald from 1931). They could be a party leader (Asquith in 1916) but might not (Churchill in 1940). Much would depend on the circumstances of the time and the personalities involved: who was willing to serve under whom, whether a suitable leader other than the premier was judged to have emerged whether the existing prime minister was regarded as tainted and if so was willing to step down quietly, and so on.Then there is the more problematic aspect: party. The reason a national unity government is being discussed at all is that, though a majority of MPs appear to be opposed to a no-deal Brexit, they are spread across different parties. However strongly they feel about avoiding what they see as a disastrous outcome, they are influenced by other factors as well. The prospects for the formation of any coalition inevitably turn on relations within and between different parties.            Under the adversarial political system of the UK, and given a parliamentary voting system that can often lead to single-party governments, there is a greater resistance to this kind of collaboration than in many other European systems. In the period since 1945, there has been only one full coalition, that of 2010-2015, and it did not include the Labour party so doesn’t qualify as a national unity government.When they have come into being, national unity coalitions have sometimes been associated with serious party political splits, such as that which occurred in 1916 when Lloyd George supplanted his Liberal colleague Asquith as prime minister, or in 1931 when MacDonald opted to form a National government, breaking with Labour.READ MORE: Leader comment: ‘Sensible Party’ must take control of BrexitThe coalescence of the “anti-no-deal” MPs behind a national unity government, either at the request of May or as part of her replacement with a different prime minister, would seem to involve some kind of fissure in at least one of the Conservative and Labour parties. While much would depend on the precise circumstances that triggered such an event, is seems likely that a sizeable proportion of Conservative MPs would oppose the initiative. It’s also unlikely that the present Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, would be the figure around whom pro-European Conservative (or indeed Labour) MPs could rally.            A government intended to achieve unity for the UK would therefore involve disunity for both the main parties (though smaller parties such as the Liberal Democrats might potentially be able to join with less difficulty, though their recent experience of coalitions might be discouraging). The historical portents are again worth considering here. The Liberal Party was severely divided by the coalitions of World War I, after which it ceased to be one of the two main political parties. Labour was seriously damaged by the split of 1931 created by the formation of the MacDonald National government. Indeed, it took participation in the Churchill coalition from 1940 for it to return to office.The lesson for today would seem to be that national unity governments are difficult to create. And when they do come together, the party political consequences can be divisive, extensive, and lasting. However, if an issue becomes pressing enough, even these considerations can be put to one side.• Dr Andrew Blick is a lecturer in politics and contemporary history at King’s College London.

Shocking, I know. It\u0026#8217s been ages since I\u0026#8217ve gotten any abuse from Scottish nationalists.                 Even longer since I dished it out. It’s been nice not waking up and immediately plunging into a state of panic if I have more than 20 notifications on Twitter.            But I was given a brief reminder of what some of my comrades continue to face last week, when former Commonspace trailblazer-turned-Sunday Herald news editor Angela Haggerty made the mistake of tweeting a New York Times profile in which I was, for the first time in my nearly 20 years in music, described as a “British” rapper.            The second I saw it, I immediately retweeted it, adding “I’ve never been called a ‘British’ rapper before”. Because it’s been so long since I’ve been in a scrape with anyone of an ultra-Scottish nationalist persuasion, I thought nothing of it. Then followed the inevitable misinterpretation that my tweet, about being referred to as “British”, was also attributing that reference to Haggerty – as opposed to the automatically generated New York Times headline. Confirming, at least in the minds of a few Scottish nationalists, something they had long suspected: Angela Haggerty is, in fact, a mole, working for the British State. Comedy ensued.There are a few layers to this that I must carefully unpack. The first is the fact I am, at least in part, British. I have a British passport, a British provisional driving licence and am guaranteed security by a British military. I live in a city where many of my fellows regard themselves as British. The UK dash in my Scottishness is not something that either bothers me or that I would dispute. Nor is it something I feel a need to either revoke or performatively purge myself of. If England pillaged the world during the years of the British Empire, then Scotland was looking on, holding her jacket. As I snapped out of a nationalist dwam, mid-2014, in which we valiant Scots were a uniquely oppressed class of maverick renegades, incapable of racism, it struck me that we may have entered our historically fiendish union with England in 1707 because we were too pished to carve out an empire of our own. Rather than some caged lion, we were more like the Richard Hammond end of a poorly balanced Top Gear equation.READ MORE: Rap tutorials help troubled Scots school pupils turn the pageHaving spent the last few months travelling the UK, I’m positive there are no significant cultural differences to speak of between Scotland and most of England or Wales. My commitment to Scottish independence is based solely on gaining proximity to the decision-making processes that impact my community and family. London has proven time and time again that it’s incapable of taking incoming calls. Interestingly, this cultural lop-sidedness, where London is concerned, also finds expression in the arts and why suddenly being referred to as a “British” rapper was strange. Understanding why requires a brief history of Hip Hop culture itself.             Hip Hop culture originated in The Bronx, New York, in the early 1970s. Comprising four pillars of DJ, Breakdancing, Graffiti and Emceeing, it emerged out of African American poverty and political exclusion. DJs would connect two turntables and, using identical records, create drum loops from the funk and soul hits of the day. These records often had sections where the song would “break down” singing ceased, guitars pulled out and focus would turn to percussion and horns, usually for around eight bars.This section was referred to as the “break”. By spinning concurrent records backwards, consecutively, DJs created “beats” for break-dancers to perform or do battle. These beats soon became audio-canvases to which emcees would rhyme or face off in tense, often hilarious and exhilarating verbal jousts. Hip Hop, at its core, was – and remains – about community, artistic expression and creativity and, ultimately, violence reduction creating a space for anger, conflict and aggression to exist without spilling over into something more serious.READ MORE: Watch SNP MP perform Brexit rap in WestminsterAfter the release of Wild Style and later Beat Street – cult films documenting Hip Hop as it swept the States – it wasn’t long before Hip Hop arrived here electrifying kids in lower-class communities, who identified strongly with its irreverent aesthetics, all-inclusive participatory ethic and pulsating sociocultural resonance. By the mid-80s, there were hundreds of ‘breaking’ crews operating in Glasgow housing-schemes alone.            After a brief pioneering period, when regional UK acts were more closely aligned – in part because so many imitated the Americans and there was no money involved – the UK Hip Hop community largely shunned its Scottish iteration. Which is why “Scottish Hip Hop” – specifically rap – became a separate genre. Not because it wanted to annexe itself from the UK (the opposite in fact) but because it was widely rejected by it.The idea of people rapping in a Scottish dialect was more laughable the further south you went. The idea Scotland could “do” Hip Hop was preposterous, despite being home to some of the best Hip Hop artists the UK has ever produced.In the context of music, I regard myself as Scottish because I’ve been conditioned to. And not by nationalists either – many of whom, ironically, berate me for being a “rapper” – but by an all-encompassing London-centric culture that subsumes not only the Celtic nations, but also many English regions, from which countless stunning contributions to Hip Hop have emerged – consistently dismissed or ignored for over 20 years. Hip Hop is about representing not only yourself, but also your “hood”. Which is why so many regional artists retain impenetrable dialects and obscure slang, despite commercial and cultural pressure to conceal or renounce them. I’m a “Scottish” rapper, not because I want to deny Britishness, but because I live in Scotland and perform in a thick, Glaswegian accent. It would be unthinkable to suddenly rebrand, throwing the very community that gave me a voice under the bus, simply because I’m enjoying some mainstream recognition.I’m a British citizen, tax-payer and feel a strong sense of connection to British culture, but I’m Scottish – something British Hip Hop won’t let people like me forget. And, as well as my dual national identity, I also identify strongly with Hip Hop culture a young, global movement which has its own unique and ever-shifting norms and values. Central to which is the thorough, fearless authentic expression of where you come from. Being called “British” isn’t anything to make a song or dance about. I’m at ease with it and understand why international media would refer to an unknown like me as such. But, when it comes to Hip Hop, I’ve always been (and always will be) a “Scottish” rapper."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4772843.1532375112!/image/image.jpg","title":"ilona amos climate change response is now officially absurd","story":"        No sniggering at the back \u0026#8211 think of the emissions, writes Ilona Amos                Apparently we are due to reach Earth Overshoot Day on 1 August this year. That’s the day when humankind has used up our entire annual ecological budget, the point where our guzzling of natural resources goes beyond the planet’s ability to restock and regenerate.            This year we will have used up our quota two days sooner than previously, by the earliest date ever recorded.            For a bit of perspective, the overdraft point was 29 December in 1970. Unsurprisingly, though, it has been steadily coming around quicker as the population increases and we clear more forests, catch more fish and burn more fossil fuels. By 1988, the overshoot date had jumped to 15 October, and to 15 August ten years ago. The UK busted its own eco budget on 8 May this year, while the US went into the red on 15 March. This compares to Vietnam’s 21 December. Overall, we are now collectively using the equivalent of 1.7 Earths. If that’s not worrying enough, researchers are this week warning that the world’s oceans will be more acidic by 2100 than at any time in the past 14 million years if we continue to pump out greenhouse gases at the current rate, with dire consequences for marine life.

Climate change has been named as the biggest threat ever to face mankind. There’s no getting away from the fact that we must step up global action to cut emissions and reduce our impact on the world’s ecosystems if we are to stave off irreversible climate change.In the meantime, perhaps we can enjoy a little light relief with a surreal new Scottish-Swedish comedy collaboration coming to this year’s Edinburgh Festival Fringe.

Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call (01595) 744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships.

I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone.

Any avoidable delay in receiving essential treatment is unacceptable.\n\u0026#8220Many of these passengers have been waiting for their appointments for months if not years, and have no way to access the treatment and specialists they need at home.\n\u0026#8220Travelling out with the isles for medical treatment is already stressful for vulnerable isles residents without the added anxiety caused by cancellations. Rescheduling appointments is not easy for those living in remote communities and patients may have a lengthy wait for another opportunity to travel.\n\u0026#8220The right to strike is an important one and I understand that strikes have to cause disruption in order to be effective.\n\u0026#8220But, I urge your members to carefully consider this compromise: Loganair flights from the North Isles use smaller aircraft which require a lower level of fire service cover.\n\u0026#8220Therefore, Unite members could guarantee a minimum level of fire and security coverage on the proposed strike dates, allowing life-line Orkney and Shetland flights to continue for essential medical travel.\n\u0026#8220I hope further discussions will resolve the dispute before any strike action goes ahead and that the needs of North Isles passengers are at the forefront of your decision making.\u0026#8221\nMeanwhile, Loganair is giving passengers in Shetland the chance to change their flights.\nAbout 170 members, including key airport staff, security workers and firefighters have voted in favour of striking – with more talks expected next week involving conciliation service Acas.\nTwenty-four-hour strikes are planned for Friday 20th July as well as on Thursday 2nd August and Thursday16th August.\nLoganair managing director Jonathan Hinkles said passengers could change their flights free of charge.\nHe said: “Although there is still time for the strike to be averted and we hope it will be, we are offering customers booked to fly to or from Aberdeen on the strike dates the opportunity to change their travel date or route if they wish.\n\u0026#8220This is free of charge and designed to offer certainty of alternatives for those booked to travel.\n\u0026#8220We also have contingency plans to operate Aberdeen flights to alternate airports on strike days if this does go ahead, and will announce details of those if this action cannot be averted. Our website is up to date with the latest information.”\nUnite regional officer Wullie Wallace expected talks with Acas next week. The dispute is over pay for airport workers. A total of 88 per cent of workers rejected the latest pay offer.\nThe union said members had rejected two below-inflation wage offers on the back of below inflation increases over the last two years.\nMr Wallace said: \u0026#8220Aberdeen International Airport’s latest derisory pay offer has been emphatically rejected by Unite members. The workforce for several years now has received below inflation increases and the company’s idea of rewarding its hard working employees is by offering more real terms pay cuts.\n\u0026#8220Aberdeen Airport has been investing heavily into improving the airport facilities and amenities. It’s high time for the company to invest in its employees. Unite remains open to further discussions with a view to resolving the dispute.\u0026#8221\nAn unattributed quote from an Aberdeen spokesman stated: \u0026#8220We have been informed by Unite of their intention to take industrial action on Friday 20th July.\n\u0026#8220This follows the rejection of our proposed pay offer. We believe we have made an offer that is entirely fair and reasonable and we are committed to continuing discussions to reach a resolution acceptable to all parties.\n\u0026#8220We have made contact with Acas which has agreed to mediate between both parties. We are seeking a suitable date to continue our discussions in an attempt to reach a mutually agreeable position.\n\u0026#8220We will, as a matter of course, ensure contingency plans are in place in the event of any planned industrial action.”\nI am amazed that the Scottish Government will allow a union to hold hostage urgent healthcare for 45,000 citizens in Shetland and Orkney. It is reasonable to suspect that the SNP is in the unions’ pockets.\nI can only suggest that if Christopher wants to find out who is in the ‘unions pockets’ he should investigate the connection between the Labour Party and Unite,  and while he’s at it perhaps he should refresh his memory as to what powers are reserved at Westminster and which are devolved to Holyrood.\nThere are so many reds under beds these days \u0026#8230\n My primary concern is that Shetland and Orkney folk will be at risk for a number of August days while this irresponsible union strikes.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"vacancy kitchen assistant and dispatch assistant with sandwick baking co ","story":" We currently have a vacancy in our kitchen department assisting in making our range of filled products and also selected confectionery lines.\n We also have a vacancy in our dispatch department wrapping, labelling products and making up customers orders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"blue green algae found in tingwall ","story":"Another loch has been found to contain blue green algae, this time the Loch of Griesta in Tingwall.\nNotices will be posted next to the loch warning against contact with the algal scum.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s environmental health department received notification of the discovery from the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency.

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish Government will be free to make its own arrangements regarding the design and collection of any replacement tax\u0026rsquo, yet, as we have seen time and time again with this Government, the arrangements on offer, limits the ability of the Scottish Government to make changes to benefit the Scottish economy.\u0026nbsp\nIn his response to the Highland MP, Mr Jenrick confirmed that his department was willing to work closer with the Scottish Government to find a solution to the problem, recognising the commitment outlined in the Smith Commission.\nResponding after the debate, Mr Hendry said: \u0026ldquoI am glad that the UK Government recognises it has failed to hand over APD in a workable way, and that Airport Departure Tax cannot be implemented by the Scottish Government without a solution to this problem.\n\u0026ldquoI hope that the assurances from Mr Jenrick today, are followed up by meaningful action from the UK Government, to enable the Scottish Government to introduce its reduced Airport Departure Tax, while protecting the Highlands and Islands exemption.\"\nTuesday 24 Jul 2018 12:39 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_0946-e1530785665580.jpg","title":"harold davis 1933 2018 from the korean front line to footballing glory and a spot of fishing in wester","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\n\nHis surname should in fact better reflect the Wester Ross area he’s called home for almost 40 years.\n“I like that to be known up here in MacKenzie country,” he notes from his home near Badachro, on the shores of Gairloch. “My mother was Catherine MacQueen Kirk, and my father was Angus Davis, though originally he was born Angus MacKenzie. The change came when my grandmother remarried, and so then the family name became Davis.”\nFor 37 years “MacKenzie country” has been his base, and these days it’s fishing rather than football which is his passion. Yet before making the move north with wife Vi to build the Craigmore Hotel in Gairloch, Harry Davis had enjoyed a remarkable sporting life — recovering from multiple bullet wounds in the Korean War to carve out a glittering football career with Rangers.\nTalk about “dual contracts” may have loomed large over Scottish football in recent months, but here was one ex-professional who really knew what it was like to serve two paymasters.\nA native Fifer, but brought up in Perth, Harry was an emerging talent with East Fife when he signed up as part of his national service to join the Black Watch. He soon found himself in the thick of the bloody, but often forgotten, Korean War where in the midst of conflict he suffered injuries from which it would take him over two years to recover.\nRemarkably, not only did he return to full health, he resumed his football career with gusto — signing for Rangers in 1956. He would enjoy a memorable eight-year spell with the Ibrox club, winning three league titles, two league cups and a Scottish Cup, as well as playing in the first Scottish side to reach a European final.\nA fearsome defender known as the “Iron Man”, he was never one to shirk a tackle on the pitch, and he’s not afraid to offer an opinion off it either — as he documents in a compelling autobiography which recently hit the bookshelves.\nHis is a tale far removed from the anodyne offerings served up by today’s breed of pampered millionaires. Having witnessed and experienced what he did on the battlefield, it’s hardly surprising that Davis had little time for those less appreciative of their sporting talents.\nTake, for example, the Rangers and Scotland great Jim Baxter.\n“I don’t dispute Baxter’s talent — he was a class player, but he wasted it,” he says ruefully. “He got privileges no one else got and it upset a lot of players in the team. He only turned it on once every three games and for the rest of the time, when your backs were to the wall, Baxter was nowhere to be seen.”\nHe describes Willie Waddell, the man who led Rangers to their only European trophy, as a “lucky manager” who had used his position as a sportswriter to undermine predecessor David White — a man Harry Davis had returned to Ibrox to assist.\n\nIT SEEMS CLEAR that wartime experience — and the discipline and work ethic it instilled — would leave a lasting imprint on everything Harry Davis did thereafter. But, ironically, his prowess on the football field might actually have spared him from active service altogether.\nHis military call came just after he had broken into East Fife’s excellent post-war team under Scott Symon — the man who would later bring him to Ibrox. And he adds: “I had a couple of opportunities, one to be a PTI in the army, and the other to take an airborne course.\n“It was all a scam to get you to play in the army team and I turned them all down. I was quite happy to go and thought it was all a bit of an adventure.”\nThat sense of wide-eyed wonder would soon give way to the full-blooded horrors of war, as he found himself fighting off Chinese forces intent on advancing further south on the Korean peninsula.\nHe remembers that many caught in the thick of the fighting were simple conscripts — scarcely prepared for the brutality they would encounter. Indelibly marked in his memory is the image of one desperate soldier running deliberately into enemy fire and to his death.\n“He was away with the birds,” he added. “I tried to stop him, but just at that moment a shell landed on top of our trench — all the hairs on the back of my hand were singed, but we were sheltered and escaped the full impact. But by the time I got up he was off again, and disappeared.\n“I couldn’t do anything about it, but that stayed with me. You can’t blame the guy — he was just a conscript as well.\n“There was always a little bit of ill feeling in that these conscripts were shipped out to the battlefield, yet regular, more experienced soldiers from the Black Watch were left behind in Germany.”\nHarry’s contribution to the war effort ended in the spring of 1953, though to this day he has no idea where the bullets which left him wounded actually came from. Years later, a former colleague contacted him to say he believed he had been responsible.\n“I said to him it might have been him, it might not have been. Who knows? But everyone was in a state of panic, and again we go back to conscripts. I certainly wouldn’t place any blame on him.”\nThe stray bullets had caught him on the back of the foot — fracturing his heel, but mercifully just missing the Achilles tendon. Having also suffered abdominal damage, Harry Davis would spend months recuperating in a Japanese hospital before returning to the UK to continue a slow road to recovery.\nIn the far east a nursing sister from Stornoway would become something of an inspiration, but it is Harry’s biggest regret that on leaving Japan he would never see the woman again.\n“She was marvellous and encouraged me so much through all the operations, the bad nights and bad days,” he added. “I made a point that I would go and see her, and when I built the hotel up here I thought I’d be able to find her. I only knew her as Sister MacKenzie, but she was from Stornoway and I believe she had something to do with the Post Office over there.\n“But then I did hear from one source that she had died — I never got to make contact with her. It’s one of the great disappointments of my lifetime.”\nON HARRY’S RETURN HOME doctors gave him little hope of ever playing top-level football again — sometimes in fairly graphic terms.\n“One doctor at the military hospital in London told me that my only hope was that my bowels were in such a state, defenders were likely to slip on what would come out! It didn’t look very encouraging.”\nYet after being helped back to fitness by David Kinnear — a physiotherapist and former Ibrox player — Harry Davis would eventually get his career back on track.\nHe resumed action for East Fife, and in 1956 got the call from Symon to follow him to Ibrox.\nIn Glasgow, he initially learned the ropes in the reserve side — one of his memorable early encounters bringing him into direct contact with the Celtic legend Charlie Tully, who by this time was at the opposite stage of his career.\nBefore too long Davis would join a first-team pool that included vintage names likes George Young, George Niven, Sammy Baird and Alex Scott, and Rangers lifted the league at the end of his first full season in 1957.\nIn something of a golden era for the Scottish game, Davis regularly played in front of crowds topping the 100,000 mark, and he remembers a vibrant and competitive league where in his first few years the main challenge came from a Hearts team which claimed two league titles.\n“If we had fewer than 40,000 at a game it was a disaster,” he said. “But regularly the crowds were 60-70,000 and for big games the 100,000-mark wasn’t unusual.”\nA degree of European success followed, as Rangers reached the European Cup Winners Cup Final in 1961. There they would be outclassed by a fine Fiorentina side, and tellingly Harry feels the Scots simply refused to heed their continental lesson. Half a century on, and the same basic mistakes continue to be made.\n“They were ahead of us,” he said. “Scott Symon was a great manager, no question, but he didn’t keep up with modern techniques. He still said get the ball to the winger, get the winger up the field and cross it and get the centre forward to head it into the net. That worked in the old days, but it didn’t work when you played these continental teams.”\nAfter winding down his playing career with a season at Partick Thistle, Harry took the manager’s job at the grand old institution of Queens Park. It was a time he enjoyed immensely, though the lure of Ibrox once again tempted him back across the city — this time to hook up with White.\nThat spell in the dugout was to prove less successful than his playing days, with Rangers then in the shadow of Jock Stein’s great Celtic side. Yet some redemption would arrive at Dundee where White and Davis led the Dens Park club to a memorable league cup final triumph over Celtic in 1973. A few months later the pair gained revenge over their old nemesis Waddell, dumping Rangers out of the Scottish Cup at Ibrox.\nDundee would prove to be Harry’s last staging post in football — and thereafter he set his sights on the quiet life in the north west Highlands.\nTHESE DAYS his football involvement is limited to appearing alongside former team-mates at charity fundraisers for the Erskine Trust, for which he is also to donate most of the proceeds from his book. However, he still keeps one eye on developments at Ibrox, even if he struggles to comprehend the team’s recent high-profile fall from grace.\n“The honest answer is that I just don’t know what to make of it all,” he said. “One conclusion is reached one week, and a week later it’s turned around again. But I do believe a number of teams were quite happy to get rid of them because they were strong competition. I don’t think that was right.”\nAsked for his personal highlights in the game, his answer is a simple one.  He just reels off a list of the players he played with, and it reads like a who’s who of greats for fans of the Ibrox club.\n“I joined Rangers and played with George Young, George Niven, Baird, Billy Simpson, Bobby Shearer, Alex Scott, Jim McColl — a great team. And then by the end I had also played with John Greig, Ronnie MacKinnon, Ian MacMillan, Millar, Brand, Baxter and Wilson. How many people can say that?”\nA Scotland cap may have proved elusive — “in those days they only picked 11” — with a place on the reserve list as close as he got to pulling on the dark blue.\nNevertheless, Harry Davis had long since proved his mettle on the international stage — and he still has the scars to prove it.\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/7s.jpg","title":"comhairle must replace barra housing","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nComhairle nan Eilean Siar must replace land they gave away for housing in Castlebay, Barra, because it was meant to be kept in perpetuity for recreational use.\nLast month, Housing Minister Kevin Stewart cut the turf on the Corran Ciosmul development at Horve. However, the six houses are to be built on what was a King George V Playing Field, which was set aside and protected in 1962.\nFor anyone to build on this land they must notify and obtain the consent of Fields in Trust, a charity that acts to protect all KGV land. Even though the comhairle took over the management of the land in 1984 they must still obtain the trust’s consent.\nThe Barra Sports Forum have been pressing the comhairle for years to transfer a piece of derelict land near the Co-op, which is adjacent to the KGV area, for use as an all-weather pitch.\nA spokesman said: “The sports forum urge the comhairle to fulfil their legal and moral obligations to the people of Barra and Vatersay to protect the sports and recreation land in Horve by righting this wrong: firstly, by filing for a change of land use to Fields in Trust from ‘sports and recreation’ to ‘housing’ and secondly, by transferring an equivalent area of land to the KGV playing field in compensation for land lost to housing. Only by doing this will the comhairle avoid the danger of stalling the desperately needed new housing that helps secure the future of our islands.”\nRichard McKeever of Fields in Trust the charity recognised that that “sometimes it may be necessary” to change the use of recreational land.\nHe added: “As part of our protection, we have a responsibility to ensure the local owners and managers of these spaces seek our consent to undertake any changes regarding land ownership, land transactions, erection of buildings and structures \u0026#8211 and that proposed changes fit with the purpose of the protected space and benefit its recreational use. We are currently in constructive dialogue with the council and await their proposals for replacement recreational land of an equal or better standard which will be protected for the local community to enjoy in perpetuity.”\nThe housing development at Corran Ciosmul is being undertaken by the Hebridean Housing Partnership, which has owned the land since 2006.\nKatrina Rowlands, HHP development manager, said: “Due to the nature of how the titles were transferred to HHP, the burden in relation to the Fields in Trust was not recorded therefore the responsibility to meet the Fields in Trust conditions remains with the comhairle. We are aware that the comhairle’s legal team are in discussions with Fields In Trust to resolve the matter.”\nA spokesman for the comhairle said discussion with Fields in Trust were continuing.\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PORTREE-V-VNW-SKYE-1.jpg","title":"top four prepare to lock horns in ross cup","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nThe top four teams in the Skye and Lochalsh League will meet this weekend with two places in the Ross Cup Final up for grabs.\nLast season\u0026#8217s league champions Kyleakin will travel to Broadford to play Sleat and Strath, while Mallaig host Portree Juniors in the early kick-off.\n\n In what is their debut season in the Skye and Lochalsh Football Association, Mallaig have made a marked impression in the league \u0026#8211  where they currently sit fourth \u0026#8211 and in the associated cup competitions \u0026#8211 in which they are seeking to reach their second final today.\nWith six wins from their eight league fixtures so far, the Lochaber side are keeping pace with the top teams in the league. Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/david-mundell.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

parties and organisations, at Fahan Street/Butcher Gate. \nIt follows several nights of disturbances in the area which included a gun attack on PSNI officers, several blast bombs and dozens of petrol bombs. \nSome of those involved in the disturbances have been young children. \nThe Sinn Féin leader encouraged as many people as possible to attend tonight\u0027s rally to show solidarity with the people of the Bogside and Fountain and to send a clear message that there is no support for the violence witnessed over the last week. \nMary Lou McDonald made the comments in the Bogside this afternoon alongside Sinn Féin Deputy Leader Michelle O\u0027Neill as they met with local residents and community leaders and ahead of a meeting with PSNI Chief Constable, George Hamilton, to discuss the violence. \n\nSpeaking to the media at the Gasyard Centre in the Bogside, Mary Lou McDonald said those behind the violence had a \"warped agenda\" and \"cynical, calculated manipulation of young people.\" \n\"What we have witnessed here is a sustained and a calculated attack on the community of the Bogside, spilling into the Fountain and the whole of the city of Derry,\" she said. \n\"What we have seen here is a deliberate strategy by those who would style themselves as dissidents to misuse, mislead and manipulate children and to cause fear, hardship and anger across this community. \n\"But they have also created a sense of determination, Because this is Derry and because the Bogside is the Bogside and the people here aren\u0027t having it. This is the city of Martin McGuinness, of John Hume, of civil rights, this is the maiden city, these are proud communities and this evening the people of the Bogside and beyond will come on to the street and stand shoulder to shoulder to face the thuggery, the criminality, the manipulation and the warped thinking of a small, small minority of people who would wish to cause damage here,\" the Sinn Féin leader added. \nMary Lou McDonald also said the local community are angry and that what has happened is not a reflection of the vast majority of local people. \n\"This is every reflection on warped, negative, regressive , dangerous people who think it is OK to manipulate young people and young children to throw petrol bombs and the like for an agenda that is nothing but a road to absolutely nowhere bar anger, fear and destruction,\" she explained. \nThe Sinn Féin President also said the PSNI have a responsibility to keep people safe but laid the blame for the disturbances squarely on dissident groupings. \n\"There is a sense in the community that the police need to do more, that there needs to be a more effective engagement but let me be clear about this, we will talk to George Hamilton about all of those things but be clear here who the instigator of this hardship is, let\u0027s be clear on that. That problem here emanates from so-called dissident elements who are behaving in a manner that no person could describe at any stage to be a republican behaviour,\" she said. \nShe also called on those orchestrating the violence to listen to the voice of the local community and stop immediately. \n\"The important thing is that they listen to the people of Derry because these street, this place is their home, this is where they have grown up, generation after generation, raised their kids, made good lives in what is a fantastic city often in very difficult circumstances and I tell you this, particularly the older residents, have said \u0027we are not having this, nobody every broke us and the dissidents and their sick approach will not break us either\u0027 so I hope they hear that, not from me, but from the people of the Bog.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27416  ","story":" Caolán McGinley\n\n“I welcome acknowledgement by RTÉ of the growing frustration among people in the north at the constant blockage of sports programmes on satellite TV.  - Sinéad Ennis\nSinn Féin MLA Sinéad Ennis has called on RTÉ’s new Head of Sport to take the concerns and growing frustration among northern viewers on board when negotiating deals for GAA coverage with satellite providers. \nThe block on major sports programmes for northern viewers is continuously causing anger among sports fans, this was increased with the recent geo-blocking of The Sunday Game on RTÉ. \nThis frustration is matched by a recent cut in coverage by the BBC to the 2018 GAA Ulster Championship from seven live games to two has causing huge anger among GAA members and fans in the north. \nGAA fans expressed their frustration on social media as BBC provided no live coverage of Super 8 games, despite a clear public interest for coverage with three Ulster teams competing in the competition.\nWriting in the Gaelic Life, RTÉ’s new Head of Sport said they “don’t geo-block” citing that your internet service provider address governs whether or not you have access to a particular outlet. \nSinn Féin’s Culture, Arts \u0026amp Sports spokesperson Sinéad Ennis said she recognises the complexities in licensing and broadcasting rights, but that there is a responsibility on RTÉ to address the “digital partition” of Ireland. \n“I welcome an acknowledgement by RTÉ of the growing frustration among people in the north at the constant blockage of sports programmes on satellite TV. \n“RTÉ negotiate deals with satellite providers such as SKY, therefore they are in a position to renegotiate the terms to meet the needs of northern viewers,” she said. \nThe South Down Gael recently launched the ‘Fair Play For Ulster Gaels’ campaign to ensure that the 250,000 Gaels in the north would no longer be left behind when it comes to viewing rights. \nThe campaign, which included a Twitter poll, was endorsed by 95% of those who voted. This was subsequently delivered in a letter to the Belfast Headquarters of BBC and RTÉ. \nSinéad Ennis said she will be meeting with RTÉ’s new Head of Sport in the coming days and has called on them to “put measures in place” to end the disenfranchisement of sports fans in the north.”\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27417  ","story":"Declan Kearney addressing The Ard Fheis.\n Declan Kearney\nSinn Féin National Chairperson\nMutual respect and parity of esteem apply equally to our shared Orange and Gaelic cultures, unionist and Republican traditions, and British and Irish identities. - Declan Kearney\nEnsuring that facts should not get in the way of repeating misrepresentationswas a thought which struck forcefully when I read Nelson McCausland’s recentarticle on Orange culture.\nNelson repeated his view that Sinn Féin is prejudiced against the Orange Order,and again ridiculed our commitment to equality, respect and reconciliation.\nHe deliberately and falsely characterised the actions and words of myself andother Sinn Féin leaders.\nThe fact is Orange culture is an integral part of Irish society.

Incidentally, both of those claims were the highest in the 40-member chamber.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a02f.jpg","title":"65207  ","story":"    \nTHE Department of Agriculture, the Environment and Rural Affairs believes that the recent sustained spell of hot weather - rather than pollution - has led to the deaths of a number of fish in a section of the Dunore River near Antrim.\nLocal man, James Cousley - who has lived on the Drennans Road\u0026#160 for more than 70 years - was distressed when he discovered the fish in the river, which runs alongside his property.\n\u0026#8220That river has been polluted before, less than two years ago, he said.\nBut after two visits by officials, DAERA was able to confirm that pollution had not caused the fish to die on this occasion.\nA\u0026#160 spokesperson said: The recent warm weather has led to high water temperatures in conjunction with lower base river flows in many waterways and this can have an adverse impact on the fishery and river ecology. \n\u0026#8220It is not unusual for dissolved oxygen levels to drop to critically low levels, particularly at night, which can result in fish mortalities.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a01f.jpg","title":"65208  ","story":"    \nSINISTER footage has emerged of a masked man pointing a gun out the window of a house at a pre-Twelfth Church parade in Randalstown.\nSunday\u0027s annual parade saw brethren from Randalstown District LOL No 22 and members of two local bands taking part in a church service and act of Remembrance.\nAs the bands and the brethren - including young children - made their way down Station Road, watched by spectators, they were unaware of a more sinister set of eyes trained upon them.\nVideo footage, which has spread on social media, shows a man in a beret and camouflage jacket with his face obscured by a scarf and sunglasses, raising what looks like an assault rifle before training it on those marching.\nWatching from a house on the route, he is being filmed as he appears to cock the rifle.\nAs the camera pans back towards the parade going past the house, he points the weapon in its direction before a disturbing \u0027click\u0027 - believed to be the trigger being pulled - can be heard off-camera.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a06f1.jpg","title":"65301  ","story":"    \nMUCKAMORE Seconds have reached the Ulster Plate final against Ardmore Seconds or Donemana Seconds on August 19.\nAnd the club\u0027s First XI gained more valuable points when they travelled to Stormont on Saturday to play CSNI in their latest Premier League match and completed the double over their arch-rivals in a vitally important game. \nThe fixture marked the debut of new signing Adam McDaid, who has joined this week from North West Club, Eglinton. \nThis weekend Muckamore travel to Armagh seeking a win against the bottom team, which would almost certainly secure the Antrim club\u0027s position in the Premier League next season.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a05f1.jpg","title":"65302  ","story":"    \nANOTHER break between rugby seasons draws to an end this week as Randalstown Rugby Club\u0027s pre-season training begins.\nAfter a 10-week period in which the senior squad had the opportunity to get some excellent strength and conditioning work completed at Ballymena Academy under the guidance of Ryan Keating, the players now return to the pitch.\nThis season, Randalstown will field three senior sides in the Ulster Branch leagues with the First XV in Qualifying League 2, the Second XV in Junior League 3 and the Third XV in Junior League 6.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a04f.jpg","title":"65303  ","story":"    \nTHE Opening Ceremony for the Atlantic Challenge International Contest of Seamanship will take place in Antrim this weekend.\nTwo hundred young people representing USA, Russia, Belgium, Great Britain, Republic of Ireland, France, Denmark, Canada and Northern Ireland will compete, live and learn together in the town as part of the Atlantic Challenge. \nDuring the week-long contest, 38-foot wooden gigs will be sailed and rowed on Lough Neagh.

She was devoted to the needs of the less fortunate in Romania.  Both her and Samuel travelled many times to Romania thus allowing Barbara to speak passionately at home in Northern Ireland at many events and meetings. At the same time Barbara was busy fundraising, filling and organising containers to be transported out to Romania with all kinds of essential supplies and gifts and was still finding time to help Samuel on their farm.\n\nBarbara inspired many others in the community to travel out to Romania to help the people there in any way they could and see for themselves the need that Barbara so passionately spoke of back home.\n\nBarbara was a people’s person and this was certainly borne out by the large attendance at her funeral at Toberdoney Presbyterian Church last Monday and all those who paid their fitting tributes having travelled from near and far.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nBarbara’s passing has left a huge void for her husband Samuel, her father Jim, brother Robin and sister Alison, nephews, nieces, wider family and all who knew her.

Ballymena needs jobs not empty words.\n  \nHe also spoke of the great sadness of members as they watched the Michelin factory being stripped of the machinery that once provided so many local people with employment.\n  \nThe aim of the group is to discuss the challenges posed by a declining industrial economy, lack of opportunities for young unemployed people and the serious concerns that are being raised over Brexit.\n  \nLucy O’Hagan, a local NIPSA representative, and secretary to the group expressed the views of the group saying that there was a real feeling of despondency among local people as they tried to deal with the increasing pressure of the rising cost of goods and services while pay remained static.\n  \nThe group are encouraging local people to support the ICTU campaign “Better Work Better Lives”.\n  \nLexie Scott, Ulster Teachers’ Union representative on the Council, urged people to go to the campaign website www.betterworkbetterlives.\n  \norg/pledge-support and

It was the first time he had competed since withdrawing from the Isle of Man TT Races back in May.\nDunlop was a revered competitor who had more than one hundred wins to his name at both national and international level. 15 of those came at the County Dublin circuit which ultimately claimed his life on Saturday afternoon during practice for the Open Race.\nWhyte said that after some lacklustre seasons where fans only got to see sporadic glimpses of his ability shine through, 2018 looked set to be the start of something special as Dunlop joined forces with Tim Martin in the Superstock and Superbike classes. \nThe team was being built around Dunlop, with Martin ending his sabbatical from the sport after just one year.\n\u0026#8220Tim threw everything he had at it for William, Whyte told Chronicle Sport.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying: \n\u0026#8220People use food banks for many and varied reasons and it would be misleading to link them to any single cause.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://ssl.\" : \"http://www.\")    document.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src=\u0027\" + gaJsHost + \"google-analytics/ga.js\u0027 type=\u0027text/javascript\u0027%3E%3C/script%3E\"))    \n    \n    var pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(\"UA-4764369-20\")    pageTracker._initData()    pageTracker._trackPageview()    \n      \n\n      \n              \n  \n    \n  \n\n      \n  \n\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/jbllegiofdoolfna1.jpg","title":"65370  ","story":"    \nARMOY Road Races Clerk of the Course Bill Kennedy says this weekend\u0027s 10th anniversary event is a \u0027massive milestone\u0027 for organisers.\nRace Week continues apace until this weekend with practice on Friday and Race Day taking place on Saturday.\nIt\u0027s been a massive achievement for the club, said Kennedy.
