And while there is evidence of broad disparities in the quality of education these pupils are receiving, the majority are unlikely to return to school before September. For certain age groups though, the school gates opened again earlier this month, meaning that students at pivotal points in their learning could have face-to-face access to their teachers for the first time since March.Before reopening the doors of Bonneville primary school to reception, year 1 and year 6 pupils on 3 June, headteacher Andrea Parker spent weeks preparing pupils, staff and the school building itself for a safe and productive end to the summer term.From installing hand sanitisers and distance markers to iding children into “bubbles” with their own classrooms, equipment and playtimes, Parker took pains to keep staff, pupils and teachers safe.Before her doors were opened to the children, she communicated the changes to everyone involved, including in weekly newsletters and a video hosted by teachers showing pupils what to expect on their return.“To see everyone sticking to the timetable – to see parents coming in and lining up on the 2-metre lines as you planned them to do, bubbles of children moving at the right times, and everything running smoothly, makes me exceedingly proud,” says Parker.“It’s been a community effort, and has taken a lot of hard work from education professionals who’ve spent hours perfecting what we need to do in order to get children back to school – we’ve been living and breathing it.“But the result was that there was no reluctance on the children’s part when they came back – they’re thrilled to see their friends and be able to play with each other. The parents have been very grateful too, and our teachers are really happy to be back.”The safety measures put in place at Bonneville have run as planned, with the addition of Friday afternoon “induction days” for any staff who are returning to school for the first time the following week.“Any teachers who were anxious before coming back were reassured as soon as they saw how everything worked,” Parker says. “So we introduced the induction days to give them the opportunity to walk through and see the school in action for themselves before returning.”“We were apprehensive, obviously, but I was desperate for my daughter to go back to Bonneville because she was getting a bit down at home,” says Miriam Paridjanian, whose 10-year-old daughter Rosa was one of those returning. Paridjanian, who is a qualified teacher, found home schooling “very challenging”, and jumped at the chance for her daughter to be able to work alongside her friends again.“Rosa is normally very bright and bubbly, but she just wasn’t feeling happy,” says Paridjanian. “I had a really hard time motivating her – she was getting a bit despondent and unmotivated, and she didn’t want to do the work.“The school seemed to have prepared for reopening very well – there was lots of communication, and I knew if I had any queries they’d be answered – so whenthe offer came to send her back, I took it.“Psychologically, I think children need that routine of getting ready and leaving the house in the morning, and since we sent Rosa back after half term she’s perked up so much – she’s like a different child. It’s made a difference to the whole family.”Despite some initial misgivings, Rosa is equally happy to be back at Bonneville.“I was excited when Mum told me I’d be going back to school but nervous too, in case it didn’t work and we’d have to go back to being home schooled,” she says. “Some parts aren’t great – we have to eat lunch in our classrooms, then go out to play, whereas we’d usually just all eat together in the dinner hall, which is better.“But I’ve made some new friends, because we all play together in our bubble in the playground now, and lessons are easier to do in school because we’ve got help from our teachers. I also like seeing my friends – everything’s more fun with friends.”With primary schools such as Bonneville reopening, the next stage of the UK government’s plans to bring children gradually back into formal education began on 15 June. Years 10 and 12 are encouraged to receive some “contact time” in advance of the summer break, and exams taking place in 2021.Hinchingbrooke school in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, is one of the secondary schools that has reopened its doors to years 10 and 12.“I’m extremely proud of our teachers and the whole army of support staff who’ve worked really hard to make the school safe,” says Andrew Goulding, chief executive of a four-school academy trust that incorporates Hinchingbrooke school.“Teaching is a lot more than just imparting knowledge and giving pupils the opportunity to develop their skills. It’s about supporting iniduals and their complex emotions.“Although Hinchingbrooke and many others have done a great job with online learning, there’s no real substitute for being face-to-face with a teacher, because a good teacher motivates students in ways online learning can’t. Fundamentally, teaching is about human interaction.”To prepare for its new arrivals, the school has split its year 12 pupils into two groups, who attend one day a week on Monday and Tuesday. Similarly, the larger year 10 has been ided into three groups, each attending on Wednesday, Thursday or Friday.Between the year groups, some children will attend school every day of the week, and the system allows the school to manage a large number of students across each week during what are key educational years.“It’s really clear from the feedback we’ve had from parents that they’re desperate for their children to get back to school,” says Hinchingbrooke’s school principal, Mark Patterson. “They need that safety net and routine.“Quite a lot of the students, particularly the younger ones, are struggling with self-discipline. But while it’s important for everyone to be back at school, you have to prioritise those students who are nearer to their national exams, because they’re the first ones who’ll be tested externally next year. Giving them some time in person before the summer, so we can direct their learning, is crucial.”Like Parker, Patterson has prioritised communication to reassure students and ease them back into lessons, via weekly virtual assemblies and video call sessions for each tutor group.“We’re one community, and have had to rise to the challenge of keeping that sense of identity through the crisis,” he says. “But when students come back, it’s a dramatically changed picture from the one they left before lockdown. Familiarising them with school again shouldn’t be underestimated.”Returning children have received a set of safety guidelines, and both students and parents have been asked to sign a contract agreeing to abide by them.Safety measures put in place at the time include red circles marked on the ground 2 metres apart to help with queueing, reorganised classrooms with distanced desks and chairs, and one-way systems to ensure students don’t have to pass each other in close proximity. There’s also signage around the school reminding everyone of the importance of hygiene, frequent hand-washing and keeping their distance.Year 12 Hinchingbrooke student Rheeya Makwana, 17, had to learn how to adapt when she returned to school on 15 June – and so far, she’s pleased to be back.“I can study quite well independently anyway, but it’s better to be back at school,” she says. “We’ve been having online lessons and voiceover PowerPoints, but it’s not really the same as being in a classroom – and although it was obviously quite different being 2 metres away from the teacher, they still tried to teach as normal.“Seeing my friends again was so great, too. During lockdown, I FaceTimed them every day, but it’s different seeing them at school.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

And among the wide range of contagions out there, it has always looked fairly appealing. Whingeing, our betters tell us, is bad for the health. It brings on general decline, as well as a headache. And, of course, we are all looking forward to “bouncing back” for Britain, whether we manage it to order this weekend, or at some later date. The message is clear: anyone dragging their feet should feel ashamed.Positive energy is our new social and political currency. In any cross-examination on the radio or television, all interviewees seem to feel honour-bound to first reply, “That is a very good question”, even if they are a government minister who has just been asked why their decisions have made so many people fatally ill. And are they pleased with the outlook? “One hundred per cent” comes the inevitable bouncy response. No equivocation is countenanced.It would be nice to believe that the nation has been generally infected with a positive, can-do attitude, but it is sadly often easy to glimpse a lurking desperation behind all the new glass-half-foolery in modern parlance.So, perversely, how about reading a really despairing novel this weekend, or perhaps a bleak play script, in lieu of live theatre? Perhaps Pinter’s No Man’s Land? Conrad’s Heart of Darkness? Or some hours spent listening to Strauss’s Four Last Songs or Bowie’s ghostly last album, Blackstar?

But why not create a ‘new normal’, fuelled by lessons learned in lockdown?I don’t want schools to “get back to normal”.It’s tempting to crave a return to life before this horrible pandemic struck. There’s no doubt that those of us who love the buzz of a school community, the thrill of teaching, the boundless energy of children, have missed those compelling and life-affirming interactions.So, yes, I want school to reopen safely to every child in the country. But getting back to “normal” is not what we need.Many school leaders and teachers are of a similar mind. There has been a change of mood, born out of a cocktail of anger, frustration, commitment to social justice and resolve. Headteachers and teachers have worked under immense stress to provide simultaneously an on-site provision for key workers and the most vulnerable and online distance learning (some having to rapidly learn how to do this from scratch). It has entailed confronting real hardship, delivering food parcels, children’s toys, laptops and regularly checking in and providing much-needed social and emotional support for families.The breaking of trust between government and the frontline at this crucial time (the result of too many insensitive, late or contradictory announcements) has perhaps strangely resulted in a growing sense of empowerment in the profession, a desire to take control of our own destiny.At Big Education (a growing social enterprise and group of schools committed to providing a more expansive education), we have been bringing together ideas and insights for renewal from a powerful range of passionate, thoughtful and dynamic people in the sector. Our new website has a mission to use this period wisely to improve how schools are run. Key strands for future reform are emerging.First: rebalancing our schools. Covid-19 has made us reflect on what makes us centred as human beings. It has become clearer to us, as parents and teachers, that academic ability is not enough. To flourish, we need a balance between what we call “head, heart and hand” – knowledge, wellbeing, problem-solving and creativity. That is why an obsession with academic “catch up” in the coming months at the expense of student wellbeing would be the wrong approach. We need every child’s voice – the full range of ersity – to be heard and valued in the classroom and each child’s learning properly supported. The Observer’s manifesto rightly stressed this point and there is an obvious need for extra government funding for mental health services and enrichment activities and not just one-to-one tutors.Second: we need smarter assessment and intelligent accountability. Ofsted inspections have rightly been suspended, as have league tables (neither of which produces the breadth of information parents need), and it would be wrong to have them return next year as schools are picking up the pieces after the pandemic. Schools need time to breathe. And the consensus is now overwhelming that Ofsted needs an overhaul, with the possibility of it being repurposed, from the crude labelling of schools, to sharing good practice across the system.Many are also taking this opportunity rightly to rethink exams. Lord Baker, one of the architects of GCSEs, has joined a growing call for them to be replaced, with a number of groups, including a stateindependent coalition, thinking hard about crafting a better system that measures the full range of student achievements.Third: skilful use of technology. Until this extraordinary forced experiment, where the world’s teachers had to learn to teach online overnight, technology has often been underused or badly used in schools. Now, all but the deliberately contrary can see its many benefits: collaborative tools to aid student learning flipped learning, where students consume the knowledge first and then discuss it with teachers.Parents now have more options to support their children, though the choice can become bewildering at times. Video conferencing can be used when people cannot turn up to parents’ evenings. Professionals from dispersed multi-agency teams can support learners with special educational needs more easily on video calls. Teacher resources have been made available online to students, for them to work on in a more self-directed way. Digital portfolios can showcase student work and emerging skills, and make young people more accountable for their learning.Fourth: a different type of school leadership, a different kind of teacher. Many teachers have been liberated by being off the exam treadmill, some describing having far more in-depth curriculum discussions and the ability to spend proper time collaborating. This is a glimpse of a more sustainable and enriching teaching profession. Many school leaders have found a new voice and new priorities, including giving attention to staff wellbeing and rethinking the micro-management that characterises so many schools. Our new Big Leadership Adventure programme is designed to nurture leaders who want to build a more balanced, agile and expansive education system.In the future, one more quality, finally, is needed in abundance – not just from schools but government, too: imagination. As we come out of the crisis, we must urgently ask whether what we are doing is fit for purpose, particularly given the bleak post-pandemic economic world. We need to imagine afresh what a great education, a big education, looks like, so we can come back stronger. It would be sad if, next June, we were back in a “normal” that no one really liked.In the words of Emily Dickinson: “The possible’s slow fuse is lit by the imagination.”• Peter Hyman is co-director of Big Education and co-founder of School 21.

But they also need to win on principles ‘We look towards the other England and wonder how it could be so provincial, so backward, so completely out of step with the times. And then we turn our backs on it… That is the really alarming thing about this national ision.”That might have been written yesterday, ending some journalistic dispatch from “Brexitland”. In fact, it’s from Geoffrey Moorhouse’s 1964 book, The Other England, which exposes in tones of fascinated condescension the reality of life outside the “golden circle” of the home counties.Five years later, the Tory leader, Edward Heath, drove through the north-east of England. “If I lived here,” he remarked to a friend, as Dominic Sandbrook recounts in his book White Heat, “I wouldn’t vote for Harold Wilson. And I wouldn’t vote for myself either.” “Who would you vote for?” asked his friend. “Robespierre,” Heath replied.It’s a reminder that many of the themes that dominate British politics today – the cleavage between London and the provinces, the chasm between the working class and the elite, the contempt and pity for the “left behind” – run deep into our political history.Last week, the academic research initiative The UK in a Changing Europe published a study showing how both Labour and the Tories are out of touch with their voters, though in different ways. Tory MPs are well to the right of the electorate on economic matters. Tory voters are closer to Labour MPs on such issues than to Conservative ones.Labour MPs are far more liberal than the electorate when it comes to social values. On some questions, Labour voters seem more conservative than Tory MPs.This “values gap” has engaged much debate in recent years, especially in response to Labour’s faltering fortunes. The party, many argue, needs to rein back its cultural liberalism, seen as the mark of the metropolitan elite, and adopt a more conservative tone to attract back its lost voters.Yet it’s not so simple. For a start, Britain is already socially highly liberal, as I recently observed. The debate about social values today is really about two distinct kinds of issue. The first relates to questions of history and identity, such as the controversy over statues. The second, the issues at the heart of the “values gap” report, are concerns linked to a sense of community – crime, discipline or patriotism, for example.In neither case are people’s differing views best defined along a liberalismconservatism measure. Is it meaningful, for instance, to describe someone who supports equal pay and laws against racial discrimination but also opposes the taking down of statues or demands more school discipline as “illiberal”?The second reason to think more carefully about the values gap is that it’s not new. Between 1965 and 1970, parliament passed a series of laws that have come to define social liberalism – the decriminalisation of abortion and homosexuality, the outlawing of racial discrimination, and equal pay for women.What’s new today is not the values gap, but the way we relate to it. Traditional political affiliations have dissolved. As a report for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, also published last week, observes: “The Conservatives are now more popular with people on low incomes than high incomes. Labour is as popular with the wealthy as with those on low incomes.”At the same time, questions of culture and identity have come to colonise politics. Whereas in the 1960s, class politics was anchored by material issues – struggles over wages or housing – today, the values gap itself has become the focus of class ision.As a consequence, its significance has become exaggerated. And people have been pushed into taking more polarised positions, whether on statues or on immigration, as a means of placing themselves on the values map.A final thought. Politics is about both standing on a set of principles and trying to win people over, and about shaping policies so as to build the largest coalition of support. But, as traditional relationships between parties and their voters have dissolved, so principles and persuasion have become subordinated to the art of cutting one’s ideological cloth to fit the public mood. The discussion of the values gap is almost entirely about how the parties – Labour or Tory – should change to fit popular sentiment, rather than being also about how to shape public opinion in a different direction. That, for a democracy, is not a healthy place to be."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c30b0b62a25d9aeaca1c5e9277faa8b48c9265a/8_0_5333_3202/master/5333.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8d419786351d87db7ec22cdd35b1e0a","title":"the heat back on the insiders guide to 2020 best summer culture","story":"From art to architecture, from festivals to films, our expert guests spotlight the hottest cultural events and share their own summer touchstonesLuna CinemaChosen by Carol Morley, film-maker I’m really looking forward to Luna Cinema, which will be hosting outdoor and drive-in cinemas all around the UK, showing old films such as Singin’ in the Rain, Sister Act, Cool Runnings and newer films such as Rocketman and Joker. Growing up seeing depictions of drive-in cinemas in American movies always made me long to go to one, and as an adult the first time I did, it didn’t disappoint. There is a freedom, a frisson – a sense of joy in watching a film outside with others.This summer I will be finishing up my screenplay Typist Artist Pirate King, inspired by the life of overlooked artist Audrey Amiss. Recently, on a walk in the City of London, I stumbled upon Gift of Cain – a brilliant statue by Michael Visocchi and Lemn Sissay that commemorates the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade. It has inspired me to do a lot more discovering in London this summer – no passport required.Mandy, BBC Two (August)Chosen by Daisy Haggard, writeractorI can’t wait to see Mandy by the excellent Diane Morgan (of Philomena Cunk and Motherland fame). She always makes me giggle in everything she does, and as she wrote, directed and stars in this – it’ll be brilliant. David Hockney’s Portrait of an Artist (Pool With Two Figures) always makes me think of summer. That and any image of Greece – any postcard, calendar, tacky magnet. I’m obsessed with Greece so it triggers deep summer holiday excitement and I want to eat a tomato in my bikini immediately. This summer I am finishing writing the next series of Back to Life, then filming the second series of Breeders, but if I can somehow safely leave my house and jump in the sea, I will. I long for a good swim.I’m also very excited about the release of my first ever CD – Alwyn’s Miss Julie (Chandos) – which I recorded last year with the conductor Sakari Oramo and the BBC Symphony Orchestra and, rather unexpectedly, my husband, Benedict Nelson. Ben wasn’t initially meant to be involved but stepped in last minute. It’s our first ever opera together as professionals.Hamilton, Disney+ Chosen by Lynette Linton, artistic director, Bush theatreI love Disney+ so much… it’s been really keeping me going! And now Hamilton with the original Broadway cast has come to the service. Hamilton is one of the best things I’ve seen in years. It’s stunning. The London cast were exceptional, but I’m looking forward to seeing the originals and how the show translates to screen. I am very proud to say that I know every word to every song. I will be playing the soundtrack loudly throughout the summer too. Here at the Bush we’re working hard to get our doors open as soon as we can. In a few weeks I hope to be working with our community partners to be useful within our local area – with a particular focus on developing young people’s creativity.Meat Rack documentaryChosen by The Black Madonna, DJ (AKA Marea Stamper)I can’t wait to see this new documentary about NYC Downlow, a pop-up club inside Block9 at Glastonbury that is – for its short existence – always the best club on the planet. The Downlow has been such a part of my life. I have made a lot of dear friends there and I danced my ass off. It’s going to hurt to watch, but it will also make me feel warm and fuzzy. As we speak I’m living vicariously through all the Glastonbury sets that are popping up, as so many of us communally long to be out in that field with mud on our boots. Weirdly, horror movies are one of my summer touchstones. I spent a lot of my young life in the summer soaking up ice-cold air conditioning and seeing horror movies with my dad.I’ll Be Gone in the Dark, Sky CrimeNow TV (late August)Chosen by Lucy Prebble, writerproducer (Succession, A Very Expensive Poison)Well, of course I want to pick I Hate Suzie, the show I’ve created with my best friend, Billie Piper. But I’m also hugely excited for I’ll Be Gone in the Dark, the HBOSky docuseries about the Golden State Killer based on Michelle McNamara’s dark and dazzling book. It’s a horrifying story, with an ending that Michelle never lived to see. I am fascinated by things that frighten me. I love it when true crime is done well and respectfully, rather than thrashed out trashily, and HBO are the masters of doing it properly. The Before Sunrise trilogy by Richard Linklater always makes me think of summers gone by and lovers, missed and taken, but this summer I’ll be doing post-production on I Hate Suzie and mostly trying not to perish in a pandemic, or to cause others to perish in a pandemic.ENO’s Live La Bohème (19-27 September)Chosen by Suba Das, artistic director, HighTide festivalI was hugely impressed that, for a form so often seen as our dustiest, ENO got out there first back in April, thinking about how live performance could adapt for the era of social distancing. Their Drive \u0026amp Live La Bohème at Alexandra Palace in north London is a cut-down 90-minute version of the opera that will be staged as a drive-in experience for punters in cars and on motorbikes with – we’re told – a cast of brilliant young singers. It should reintroduce an element of punk to a tale of struggling Parisian artists inventing their own rules, and it’s going to be amazing to hear a live orchestra again!Of course, it won’t be the same, but the performing arts across the board need to embrace innovation – too much of the conversation so far has felt like a plea for a state of suspended animation until “normal” can be restored. During lockdown I’ve been enjoying the frankly extraordinary reboot of Dynasty on Netflix (which somehow manages to be simultaneously trashy and hyper-woke). And work-wise, HighTide launched its “Lighthouse Programme” in the first week, as we were profoundly concerned that it is our most marginalised voices who we risk losing first through the sheer economic uncertainty of these times. To date we’ve supported more than 150 writers with commissions, free training, script reading and mentorship. We want to show our artists and audiences we’re here for them now, and for the long term.Jessica Fostekew, Next Up festival (7 July)Chosen by Tim Key, standup poet, actor and writerJessica Fostekew was nominated for the Edinburgh Comedy award last summer. She’s funny as hell. She’s doing a gig as part of Next Up’s online festival, which I’ll be watching. You have to support online gigs because our industry is currently buggerooed! Jess and John Kearns were my favourite shows at Edinburgh last year. Both are powerful, distinctive voices on the live circuit, envied by peers. John’s got a comedy album coming out on vinyl, a recording of his Edinburgh show. It’s fantastic. Workwise this summer I am continuing to reinvent myself as a writer because doing 10 minutes as a dishevelled poet figure in front of 100 people looks unlikely for a bit. Leisurewise, I have a barbecue and a hammock and I know an off-licence and a back-up off-licence.Tim Key’s Poetical Playing Cards, Utter and Press (£15) Central Somers Town, Camden, north LondonChosen by Cathy Hawley, winner of Stirling prize 2019I will be swimming as much as possible in rivers, lakes and the sea this summer – and missing the joy of live music at festivals, but I can’t wait to visit this small community housing project by Adam Khan Architects that is close to completion. It is wonderfully expressive architecture, designed with close community involvement, which sits alongside an existing park and consists of a small block of housing and a series of playrooms and courtyard gardens for the children. Well-considered provision for young people alongside new housing is vanishingly rare in development projects, and this modestly scaled but sophisticated and generous architecture achieved in one of London’s least privileged neighbourhoods is so heartening to see.The Harpy by Megan Hunter (3 September)Chosen by Evie Wyld, author and co-founder of Review bookshop in Peckham, south LondonThe Harpy by Megan Hunter is a short novel – told in Hunter’s restrained and beautiful style – about a woman who is a wife and a mother, and who has discovered her husband’s affair and starts to turn into an actual harpy. Hunter hits so many different notes of rage in the book I’m rooting for the protagonist the whole way through, as she rips her life to shreds. When the weather is really hot, I think about Prince’s album Parade. I spent a summer cleaning toilets around Bondi beach and this was one of the only tapes I had. This summer I’m planning on catching up on all the stuff I should have read over the past few years and revisiting some childhood favourites with my son. I’d also like to do something physical, like dig a big hole or move some rocks about.The Bristol Balloon Fiesta (6-9 August)Chosen by Tom Morris, artistic director, Bristol Old VicImagine all of Bristol as a theatre, with perches and viewpoints from the tower at Temple Meads to south-facing slopes of Montpelier, from the escarpment of Totterdown to the rugged cliffs of the Clifton Gorge. Above is the safest performance space in Europe: the sky. And into that space, over a gorgeous August weekend, a magical slow-motion dance will gently unfold, performed by over 100 hot air balloons. The famous “night glows” are viewable in close-up at Ashton Court (if crowds are permitted). The daily ascents can be seen from the safest seats in any theatre – your own roof terrace, window, garden, park or pavement. There is nothing like a flight of hot air balloons to lift the human heart... and in these tormented times my imagination runs riot with the choreographic possibilities of this most gorgeous theatrical event.Make Up (31 July)Chosen by Rose Garnett, director of BBC FilmsAndrea Arnold’s American Honey always makes me feel summery. You can feel the heat of a long, hot summer in every shot. What a film, what a film-maker. I can’t wait to go back to the cinema – the pleasure of watching films with an audience, and of a space dedicated to presenting them in all their glory. Claire Oakley’s excellent debut film, Make Up, is a pioneer release as theatres reopen. Molly Windsor gives a charismatic central performance in a film that’s equal parts queer love story, realist drama, and thrilling body horror. Also, online, watch Fyzal Boulifa’s startling feature Lynn + Lucy. Both films play confidently with the tradition of British kitchen-sink naturalism, and yet feel fresh. As well as getting back to the cinema, I’ll be spending time this summer in Platonic Juices in Kentish Town, north London – a new space set up by a group of 18-year-olds (including my son) who were catapulted out of school to an uncertain future. I love its spirit and its energy.Salzburg festival, 1-30 AugustChosen by Daniel Harding, conductorSummer music-making is irreplaceable and important for young and established musicians, as well as for audiences. This summer risks being barren and devastating for many, given the necessary measures being taken to keep people safe, and the seeming lack of urgency to protect our enormous cultural sector. A festival such as Salzburg, which recently published its ambitious, albeit reduced programme – including Elektra and Così fan tutte – gives us some hope. I suspect the most inspiring and meaningful events this summer will be the spontaneous ones that manage to flourish in the cracks where opportunity presents itself.Ramy, Starzplay (starts 6 August)Chosen by Ash Atalla, TV producer (The Office, Stath Lets Flats)My choice is season two of the Hulu series Ramy – a sharp, culture-clash show about an Egyptian living in America not quite fitting in it’s brilliant and awkward, how I like my comedy. I’m Egyptian myself and there aren’t many of us in television, so I’m supporting the homeland. Old-school Belle and Sebastian tracks are the sound of summer for me.Floaty melodic guitars: perfect for a summer’s day. I’ll be spending the months ahead trying to figure out how to shoot TV shows in the post-Covid era. And as soon as cinemas open again, we’ll be audience-testing our new People Just Do Nothing movie, which is released next year.Féile an Phobail (Festival of the People), West BelfastChosen by Ronan Bennett, writerThis annual festival will have to go virtual this year, but among the events I’m looking forward to are Indian-Irish writer Cauvery Madhaven discussing her novel The Tainted, about the mutiny by the British Army’s Connaught Rangers in India in 1920, and singer-songwriter Imelda May reading her poem You Don’t Get to Be Racist and Irish (the title says it all). Local boy Adrian Dunbar – Line of Duty’s Superintendent Ted Hastings – will be reading poems by Seamus Heaney.I’ve been going off and on to Féile for 25 years, sometimes to do readings and talks, but more often as a festival-goer. It is always lively, always fun. I will spend summer finishing the scripts for the new Netflix season of Top Boy – we were in pre-production when lockdown hit and had to put everything on ice – but have just started prep again and will start production in October. I’ve also been working on a novel, long overdue. Leisure has mostly been exercise and reading. Irene Vallejo’s extraordinary love letter to the book, El infinito en un junco, which will be appearing in translation soon, made the first weeks of lockdown almost enjoyable.Buñuel in the Labyrinth of the Turtles, BFI Player (16 July)Chosen by Jason Wood, creative director of Home, ManchesterSpike Lee’s Do the Right Thing is the film we need at the moment. It’s set during a blistering summer day, but also carries the message of the need for recognition and change. Of this summer’s new releases though, my pick is Salvador Simó’s Buñuel in the Labyrinth of the Turtles. An animated synthesis of fact and fiction, it tells the true story behind a fascinating episode in cinematic history, using excerpts from Buñuel’s filmography to present a deeply affecting portrait of an artist hunting for his purpose. It’s a gift to cinephiles and has wider family appeal. This is a purple patch for animated film-making, with Netflix having helped bring Studio Ghibli to new family audiences held captive together during lockdown.Gordon Parks at Alison Jacques Gallery, London (until 1 August)Chosen by Brett Rogers, director, Photographers’ GalleryI can’t think of a more timely and resonant show to see now than this exhibition of defining work from American photographer Gordon Parks (1912-2006). The intimate, often serene images within his series Segregation in the South (1956) and Black Muslims (1963) illustrate Parks’s interest in producing photographs that would create meaningful change: “I saw that the camera could be a weapon against poverty, against racism and all sorts of social wrongs.”Summer plus photography usually means only one thing to me – the Arles photography festival in France. Instead, I will be hanging out in King’s Cross, London, where from mid-July the Photographers’ Gallery presents a new photographic exhibition, Games We Play, as part of Outside Art Project, a free open-air exhibition of photographic works. You can discover work by Julie Cockburn, Luke Stephenson and Weronika Gesicka, which will intrigue, amuse and unsettle.There Will Always Be Nights Like This, short story collectionChosen by Sharmaine Lovegrove, publisher, Dialogue BooksMy family and I are going to Berlin this summer and so I can imagine we’ll be heading to lakes just outside of the city with a hotdog and beer in hand and books in my tote. I’m really looking forward to cracking the spine of the first short story collection by new queer-identified indie press Cipher There Will Always Be Nights Like This. Reading is such an essential activity to build empathy and understanding of the world. I will be publishing award-winning titles from North America: The Residue Years by Mitchell S Jackson, Reproduction by Ian Williams and a wonderful short story collection, Frying Plantain by Zalika Reid Benta.Sun Ra Arkestra album, Strut recordsChosen by Gilles Peterson, DJ and label bossSun Ra Arkestra have just announced a new album to be released in the coming weeks. Last year I saw the band perform several times and can honestly say they are among the greatest in the world. They are led by Marshall Allen, who at 96 has never been more vital and relevant. He still lives in the Sun Ra house in Germantown Philadelphia with many members of the band, including Knoel Scott.The album was recorded and mixed by Dill Harris who has also been at the forefront of so much interesting British music, including King Krule and Sons of Kemet. The festival I run, Way Out Here, was supposed to happen 17-19 August, but instead we will be broadcasting live performances (and films and talks) on two radio stations and online. Some of my favourite musicians are confirmed, including Gogo Penguin, DJ Paulette, Theon Cross, Louie Vega, Mr Scruff and Colleen Murphy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca582e743f2f7134b3f52c8b6048d27662ae91ae/0_28_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab93d7bfa1060786dfadfbedd88f86cf","title":"teachers urge suspension of english school league tables in 2021","story":"Unions and headteachers say it would be unfair to compare performance next year because of lockdown’s effects on pupilsTeachers and headteachers are calling on the government to suspend league tables for schools in England next year, arguing they are unfair and will place too much pressure on staff and pupils whose routine has been disrupted by lockdown.It would be meaningless and counterproductive to compare the performance of schools based on tests taken at the end of primary and secondary education next year, the National Education Union (NEU) the National Association of Headteachers (NAHT) and the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) have warned.“The education of the children taking these assessments has already been disrupted by the coronavirus lockdown, and it is likely that there will be further disruption next academic year with children having to self-isolate if they show symptoms of the infection, and the possibility of local lockdowns in response to infection spikes,” said Geoff Barton, general secretary of the ASCL.League tables, he said, could be damaging to schools through no fault of their own and in spite of the best efforts they had made for their pupils. “We think it is important that schools are able to focus on reintegrating children back into the classroom, and supporting their wellbeing and learning, free from the worry of being penalised in performance tables.”Simon Kidwell, head of Hartford Manor primary in Cheshire and a spokesperson for the NAHT, said: “It’s really unfair to be using this one measure for all schools when next year we are likely to have schools having different experiences due to local lockdowns, such as the one that has occurred in Leicester. Home learning is a poor substitute for learning in the classroom.”He added that disadvantaged pupils, who may not have had access to the education being provided online during lockdown, were more likely to attend schools in deprived areas in large numbers, putting these schools at a disadvantage in terms of league tables compared with those in wealthier places.Many children returning to school – particularly those in deprived areas – would also have suffered bereavements and need extra emotional support. Others would have experienced domestic violence, isolation and anxiety during lockdown. “I think every headteacher would want league tables suspended for another year, so schools can focus on what’s really important and not just exams,” said Kidwell. “We want to plug academic gaps and see where children are, but we don’t want to be put under pressure from an unfair accountability measure.”Routine Ofsted inspections have been suspended until January, but in its latest guidance for schools, issued last week, the government ignored calls by headteachers to suspend league tables too.Sean Maher, head of Richard Challoner School in Kingston upon Thames, said he was worried schools would be pressured to address academic gaps immediately, without being given time to understand what children had been through during lockdown. “We’re going to be unpicking things for months about what’s happened – where there have been abusive relationships, family fall-outs, mental health issues. I’m also concerned about staff struggling with reintegrating back into the school environment and families feeling financial pressure.”The government should allow schools more time to support communities and use the opportunity to engage in a national debate with school leaders about how schools are measured, he suggested. “Don’t rush back to Ofsted inspections. Don’t rush back to league tables. Let’s have a conversation, as a country, about how we really want to judge our schools.”Meanwhile, two leading early-years charities told the Observer they were advising parents of four- and five-year-olds to delay starting school in reception in the autumn. Both Early Education and TACTYC say children will benefit from the continuity of returning to their existing nursery or childcare provider in September, encouraging parents to remember that children do not need to start school until a term after they reach the statutory school age of five. The Department for Education said: “Performance tables are suspended for the 2019-20 academic year, and no school or college will be judged on data based on exams and assessments from 2020. We will announce more details on accountability arrangements for the 202021 academic year shortly.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd8d529e8d25fff9510d9ffd11d4b6f965164520/168_153_3264_1960/master/3264.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb3eb83d0b37d056e4317d29253dfeb2","title":"teachers and parents how do you feel about schools reopening","story":"We’d like to hear from parents and teachers about the government’s announcement that all schools and colleges in England will be reopening in full at the start of the next academic yearThe government have today announced that all schools and colleges in England will be reopening in full in September.Current limitations on the number of students that can be in school at once will be lifted, but schools will be expected to keep children in ‘bubbles’ according to their class or year group.

Whether freezing courtiers with a single glare in Elizabeth, the 1998 film that made her name, or hinting at a burning passion waiting to be released by the right touch from the right person in 2015’s Carol, Blanchett has a talent – and a presence – that is impossible to ignore.This week, that range is on show in two very different television roles. On BBC Two on Wednesday she demonstrates charisma to burn as the conservative icon Phyllis Schlafly in the 1970s-set period drama Mrs America. Then, on Friday, she appears in an eye-catching supporting role in Netflix’s Stateless, playing the frumpy co-leader of an Australian cult, who claims to be able to transform lives through the power of song.Put like that, it sounds almost humorous, an Australian version of Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, but Stateless, which was co-created by Blanchett alongside Tony Ayres and Elise McCredie, is far from a comedy. The six-part series is a complex tale of immigration, mental illness and detention, and Blanchett is a menacing presence in the life of protagonist Sophie (Yvonne Strahovski).Stateless, with its dark, intertwining stories and refusal to offer up easy answers, showcases Blanchett’s willingness to immerse herself so fully in a role as to become almost unrecognisable. And Mrs America – in which she steals the show from such formidable actors as Rose Byrne, Uzo Aduba and Tracey Ullman (playing second-wave feminists Gloria Steinem, Shirley Chisholm and Betty Friedan, respectively) – highlights why, despite a refusal to court the system or spend much time in Los Angeles, Blanchett remains one of Hollywood’s biggest stars.Schlafly, a self-described housewife and mother of six from Missouri, was in reality a highly educated activist who had already made waves in Republican circles thanks to A Choice Not an Echo, her 1964 polemic about the then Republican leader, Nelson Rockefeller. Determinedly anti-feminist, she rose to further fame in the 1970s thanks to a cleverly orchestrated campaign against the Equal Rights Act, which saw her convince American housewives that second-wave feminists were intent on denigrating their values and destroying their lives.She was particularly intrigued by the way Schlafly manoeuvred her way through Capitol Hill’s male-dominated world. “I was gobsmacked by her ability to inspire, galvanise and mobilise people through various different tactics she was an absolute force of nature.”Where a lesser actor might be tempted to turn Schlafly, with her pastel twinsets and immaculate coiffeur, into a parody of conservative womanhood, Blanchett chooses instead to subtly hint at the ways in which the activist’s tough outer skin was formed by the slights she encountered as a woman operating in a masculine world.Her Schlafly is the steeliest of magnolias, creamy smile permanently in place, even as she plots exactly where to slide the knife in, but she is also visibly hurt when asked to take notes at a meeting on a topic she knows more about than the men sitting beside her. It’s a beautifully calibrated performance, equal parts syrupy charm and fierce ambition, which never lets its subject off the hook, yet which is also rooted in compassion and understanding.“I’m always interested in drama that explores the grey areas of life,” she told the Radio Times. “This is a non-judgmental series that asks myriad generations, ‘What do you think about this? How do you feel about that figure or that policy or that movement?’ It’s all about the conversation, and it’s so relevant. This show is like Groundhog Day – the discussions we were having back in 1971 and 1972 are constantly popping up in the media today.”The writer of that piece, John Lahr, went on to note that Blanchett was “both candid and private, gregarious and solitary, self-doubting and daring, witty and melancholy”.It is a theme that has been repeated throughout Blanchett’s career. In interviews, she appears warm and welcoming – happy to open her home to journalists and to talk engagingly about family life, from lockdown schooling to unexpected chainsaw accidents – yet also reserved.Her reticence was formed in part during her childhood. The middle of three children raised in a close-knit family in Melbourne, Australia, Blanchett’s life was transformed following the death of her father, Robert, when she was 10. It was a tragedy that would reshape the family dynamic – her grandmother moved in to help her mother, Jane, a teacher, with childcare – and have a lasting effect on Blanchett. She has talked movingly about how she waved goodbye to her father, an advertising executive, on the day he died. In 2015, she told the  that while she was loathe to make too much of his premature death, it had been a “very dark” time.Her interest in acting was formed early, although she initially planned to become a museum curator, deciding to study drama while on a gap year in Egypt. “Acting had become like this terrible addiction. I felt I needed to give it five years and see where it took me.” It took her to the very top as a successful stage career turned into eye-catching roles on Australian TV, and eventually film. She has won two Oscars, one for her pitch-perfect turn as Katharine Hepburn in The Aviator, the other for her portrayal of an unstable socialite in Woody Allen’s Blue Jasmine, and been nominated for several more.Happily married since her mid-20s to playwright Andrew Upton, with whom she has four children, she appears to have struck the perfect balance between work and rest, regularly switching between film and stage and taking extended sabbaticals when needed.Her film CV reads like a blueprint for how to have it all: a mixture of classy awards-bait, such as Notes on a Scandal, Veronica Guerin and Carol, and big-budget blockbusters such as The Lord of the Rings trilogy. For all her seriousness about the “craft”, she also has the ability to embrace the unexpected, stealing scenes as the evil stepmother in Cinderella, and making for a gloriously camp Hela in Thor: Ragnarok.In part, that willingness to go over the top comes from the fact that she is a naturally generous actor, as attuned to the performances of those around her as to her own. Over time, and thanks in part to that role in Carol and her own fashion sense, she has gone from regal ice queen to Cate the great. The sense that she remains unknowable at heart only fuels the appeal. Perhaps that is why she is able to be both star and ensemble player. She has always performed on her own terms and for her own needs. As Kapur told the New Yorker over a decade ago: “Cate’s ruthlessness is with herself.” It is why she stands apart."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9c61819a83f46526646755a070340d879d10fa0/0_266_7952_4771/master/7952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=735b22c9f23bca49bd5a4118980fb995","title":"dinner at home was a complete triumph but jay rayners kitchen was wrecked","story":"The place looked like a battleground, but on the other hand, the battle was wonThere’s a good reason why the cooks in a restaurant kitchen are called a brigade. It’s not just the hierarchical structure working under one commanding officer. It’s the military precision required to complete dishes of many parts prepared by different people. I do not have a brigade. I have me. That’s why, at the end of a dinner compiled from kits supplied by Elite Bistros in the English northwest, my kitchen looked like a war zone. There were sauce-slicked pans tottering over each other, sheaths of packaging lying hither and yon like the fallen, and slumped around them every tea towel and oven glove I possess.If a battle had indeed been fought, there was no doubt I had won. I had got to eat Gary Usher’s crowd-pleasing food, while sitting at my table at home in south London. Usher will want you to know that the menu was actually devised by his executive chef Richard Sharples, but Usher leads from the front so he takes the blame for the mess in my kitchen. Usher and I have spoken a number of times during the current crisis about its impact on the hospitality industry. His group of neighbourhood bistros, the likes of Sticky Walnut in Chester, Burnt Truffle on the Wirral, and Wreckfish in Liverpool, serve muscular food drawing on the French classics without being beholden to them.Their success is a better marker for the quality of British restaurants than any blinged-up, sushi-wrangling, pan-Asian gastronomic sink hole could ever be. Usher’s mini empire must survive, but to do so, they need a business model. And lo: a full menu of dishes in kit form available for national delivery. Orders open at 9am each Friday and are selling out within a few hours. Starters are around £6, with mains at between £10 and £19.This is a complex moment for restaurants. As I write, all the talk is of them being able to open in some form right now. A few have been taking bookings since mid-June. It’s been an outburst of sweet hope and optimism, because they hadn’t been given any approval to do so. Added to that, this column is delivered two weeks in advance. It’s like the light from a star, a snapshot of the past. That’s my story and I’m sticking to it. All of which explains why restaurants might now be open, but I’m still writing about food kits at home. Expect chaos for a little longer.Those Elite Bistro kits bring both very lovely things to eat and a lesson in what plating up restaurant food requires. For those now mentally heaving their mighty bosom with their forearms like some northern matriarch by Les Dawson while muttering, “About bloody time that filthy, entitled food-hoover learned a thing or two”: I know how restaurant food works. Now it was happening in my own kitchen.As per last week, do not order this if you want a break from the kitchen. It’s the opposite. What’s more, trying to feed more than two of you on many different dishes might prove a stretch if cooking by yourself. I found feeding three courses to four people at times challenging. It does, however, come with beautifully designed instruction sheets. Read them. Then come up with a robust plan of action. Perhaps call a therapist for support. Each dish is made up of bagged parts, all of them in-turn, in a sealed bag. My dozen dishes had at least 60 elements. All that plastic is recyclable though some of it, being sauce-smeared, is unlikely to be eligible.A starter of burrata is straightforward. Put the globe of creamy infant cheese in a bowl, drench it in the smoky burnt spring onion dressing, then scoop away with the fennel seed and chilli crisps and feel pleased with yourself. A thick plank of smoked belly bacon, pre-braised and pressed, must be fried until golden, then given three minutes in the oven. There’s a pot of podded broad beans and another of lemon oil. Introduce one to the other, add salt and the chopped parsley. Dress the bacon with the green beans. Add the sauce gribiche, a pokey mayo-style affair full of Dijon mustard, capers and intent. It’s a piggy starter I’d be very happy to eat anywhere, let alone at home.The mains require a big pot of boiling water. Almost all the key ingredients are pre-cooked and vac-packed. Into that pot, in their bags, go the confited duck leg, the braised half-cylinder of beef featherblade, alongside the truffle mash for that beef, the saffron sauce for the lamb, the butterbean mash for the roasted cauliflower and so on. Watch the labels peel off in the water. Now I have three bags of purées in varying shades of beige. It’s an edible Farrow \u0026amp Ball colour chart.I worked it out. I did not get every ingredient in the right place. I started the lamb rump and the cauliflower in the same pan as they both had to go through the oven. This became problematic when I clocked I had to anoint the lamb with a Turkish-inspired sauce of red peppers, chillies and garlic in the frying pan without getting it on the cauliflower. Argh. And none of those purées were whipped in a saucepan after being heated in the water as advised because I have only two hands, six hob rings, and limited patience.Still, dinner. And a very good one. There was duck confit with a sprightly red cabbage and mango salad and a punchy BBQ sauce, which was like HP that’s been to finishing school. The roasted cauliflower with sumac and toasted almonds on the nutty butterbean mash was a brilliantly strident piece of non-meat cookery. But the star was the slumping featherblade of beef with a lip-smacking red wine sauce and outrageously rich truffle mash. It was the kind of classy bistro cooking you can never be bothered to do yourself.Among the desserts was the spiced Yorkshire parkin, in a pond of salted butterscotch sauce with clotted cream, which I reviewed at Kala in Manchester. It was just as good at my table as at Usher’s.We have a rule in my house. If you’ve cooked you don’t clean up. I voluntarily broke the rule. I felt I ought to own this mess. Not least because the end result had been worth it. These are not normal times. We are fighting our way back to normal. In the meantime, what better way to pass an hour or two than with a little gastronomic chaos? That’s a rhetorical question, by the way. Don’t feel the need to answer.For details and the full menu, including the wine list, visit elitebistros delivery is £12.95Although some restaurants are starting to reopen this weekend, delivery services are not coming to an end.

Who among us hasn’t tried to resist the lure of the cake aisle? The connection between food and wellbeing seems particularly salient when it comes to gut health. And, it turns out, by making simple changes to our diet, we can start to take care of our tummies. Try popping some of the items listed below into your shopping basket and see if you notice a difference.Potatoes Pile plenty of potatoes into your shopping bag, but resist peeling them because their skins contain fibre. Fibre helps to maintain a healthy digestive system, passing through our small intestine without being broken down. The UK government recommends we aim for 30g of fibre a day although British adults manage to eat only around 19g on average. Potatoes are also a source of resistant starch, a form of starch that can’t be digested in the small intestine and so is classified as a type of fibre. This, too, may aid gut health.WholegrainsChoosing wholegrain varieties of bread and pasta is an easy way of boosting your fibre intake. Unlike the refined grains used in white bread and pasta, whole grains include the bran, the fibre-rich outer layer that gets stripped when grain is refined. Remember to check the label on any packets you buy so you can be sure about the ingredients, fibre content and nutritional values. European regulations state that a product claiming to be a source of fibre should contain at least 3g of fibre per 100g or at least 1.5g of fibre per 100 kcal, while a product claiming to be high fibre should contain double those figures.Wheat bran A daily intake of 10g of wheat-bran fibre is known to support your gut health by helping to accelerate the transit of food through your intestines. An easy way to boost your intake is by eating breakfast cereals high in wheat-bran fibre, such as the Kellogg’s high fibre range, which includes Bran Flakes, All-Bran Original and Fruit \u0026amp Fibre.Oats These are another handy breakfast option. Oats are known to provide a type of fibre often referred to as soluble fibre. This fibre dissolves in water and forms a gel in the gut, which can beneficially impact digestion and metabolism. Remember oats aren’t just used to make porridge but are the basis of muesli, oatcakes and oat bread.Leafy vegetables Parents down the generations have told children to “eat up your greens”, and it turns out they were right. For example, broccoli and kale can provide a source of fibre.Probiotics and fermented foods We can enrich the ersity of our gut microbiome by eating probiotics – technically defined as live bacteria that, when consumed in a viable form and adequate amounts, are beneficial to health. Kefir, a fermented milk drink, is an example of a food providing a probiotic source. Such foods may complement a fibre-rich diet, in the context of gut health. Other fermented foods such as certain yoghurts, sauerkraut, miso and kimchi are examples of probiotic sources.Bulgur wheatIf you’re bored of potatoes but need something on the side, this wholewheat grain is your friend. It comes in four sizes, from fine to very coarse, and is great as a basis for salads. Mix it with anything from tomatoes and cucumber to parsley and lettuce, for a tasty side dish.PulsesThese come in all sorts of varieties, with some of the most familiar being lentils, chickpeas and kidney beans. All three contain fibre, as well as resistant starch, and can be added to soups, stews, curries or salads.Nuts and seedsPumpkin, sunflower and flax seeds are handy if you’re looking for a fibre snack while on the go. Nuts and seeds can be sprinkled on stir fries, blitzed into curries, stirred into homemade cereal bars, or added to breakfast cereals. And don’t forget nut butters, which come in varieties such as cashew and almond as well as peanut.Assorted fruitsIf you fancy something sweeter, remember that plenty of fruits contain fibre, such as strawberries, blackberries and pomegranates. Avocados might be savoury but they are a fruit, and another good option.BananasWhen green, these are a good source of resistant starch. As a rule of thumb, the greener the banana, the more resistant starch it contains, so try to eat them before they turn completely yellow.PrebioticsFibre reaches the large intestine undigested. Once there, some types of fibre become “food” for the good bacteria in our gut. These types of fibre are referred to as prebiotics. Small amounts can be found in foods such as chicory root, onions, garlic and artichokes. But you can also opt for foods with added prebiotic fibre."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2af9134e9767d0028d1bb66fe2b2810c9fa7c70f/46_0_5380_3229/master/5380.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cfdeaced7b8dbdd8b7c34de1a393efbc","title":"doing the dusting and other strange new lockdown pleasures emma beddington","story":"We’ve had nothing to do and nowhere to go, and sought our pleasures wherever we found them…Where are you getting your pleasures these days? I know it’s our patriotic duty to have (economically productive) fun now, but I’m struggling. Perhaps it’s time for a dopamine fast. In this dubious biohack, you avoid anything that might give you a bump of hormonal satisfaction for a while in the hope of “resetting” your jaded brain. The Silicone Valley tech bros were excited about it for five minutes last year before they moved on to, I don’t know, microdosing with horse semen or something. Dopamine’s role is vastly more complicated than this implies – and if pleasure “fasting” works at all, it may not be strictly for dopamine-related reasons – but abstaining from what you crave for a limited time is ancient and uncontroversial.Arguably the pandemic era is an all-you-can-eat dopamine buffet: we’re sucking every speck of stimulation from food, sex and screens. But – and bear with me here as I contort the facts to fit my argument – it also feels like we’ve been through a patch of dopamine fasting already. March and April brought a sharp paring-down of pleasures: there was nowhere to go, almost nothing to do and we couldn’t get a Tunnock’s Teacake for love nor money.It definitely “worked” on some level: I was genuinely elated when we found an apple pie in the Co-op. Observing this spring unfurling day by beautiful day was dizzying and I remember watching birds for full half-hours without feeling compelled to post “My mealworms bring all the birds to the yard” and a fuzzy picture of a dunnock. Our first takeaway was a sensual overload: poppadoms, wondrous crispy orbs! It was an oddly wholesome time, despite, or because of, the dread and the grief.But now, as we enter a grisly “new normal” of the government gaily reopening anything that might conceivably pay business rates, leaving us to conduct inidual risk assessments for a trip to Lakeland for a spatula, I’m as jaded as any tech billionaire. Mouth-bored and screen-addled, I’m sick of the things I can have and maddened with longing for those I can’t. I don’t want to visit a model village: I want to plan ahead, visit my sister in Paris, or just give my sons some hope of getting their lives back on track.None of that is happening, so I’m resorting to ever more esoteric pleasures: I have become a discount Jean des Esseintes, the hero of Huysman’s Against Nature. In Against Nature, the definitive text of fin-de-siècle decadence, an ennui-sodden aristocratic aesthete tries to pique himself into feeling something, anything, with elaborate sensory experiments: I’m the same now. It would probably be healthier to take a day or two away from the dopamine roller coaster, but where’s the fun in that? I don’t have the budget to bejazzle (shelljazzle?) the tortoise like des Esseintes, but this is what worked this week.Housework is terrible and endlessly necessary: like Linda in Nancy Mitford’s The Pursuit of Love, I am indignant it is not rewarded with eggs for tea and being “made to rest for hours”. However, it does deliver one intense sensual pleasure: letting our tiled floor get exceptionally dusty over several weeks then hoovering the filthy corners with the powerful vacuum cleaner nozzle. The perfect effort-reward ratio delivers a powerful high that lasts for hours.Related but distinct is the gleeful process of unclogging the slow-draining bathroom sink. I have scaled up through several grades of chemical witchcraft to a multi-potion solution strong enough to dissolve bones that has to be mixed in a specific order (possibly under the full moon). The thrill at finally getting a lazy glug and backwash of black unspeakableness as it did its work was indescribable. I might clog another one just to do it again.I’m also deriving a perverse kick from saying something provocative and bad-tempered just loud enough that the person at whom it is directed might hear. Usually deployed in a domestic setting, for an extra frisson, I’m now trying it outdoors. “Why don’t you just lick my face, you’re close enough,” I mutter as someone brushes past. Will it degenerate into a pavement rage incident or will I get away with it? It’s neither healthy nor advisable, but delivers a pulse-quickening buzz.When the municipal dump is more over-subscribed than Glastonbury, securing a slot to dispose of a mountain of packaging and a deceased printer this week was a heady rush. Sadly, the timed entry was so efficient the whole experience was over in minutes, leaving me with a fistful of printer cartridges (refused), my memories and an adrenalin hangover.Friends are reporting similar highs from wallpaper stripping, bin maintenance, tracking the recycling truck and “pretending to run a plant spa”. This is what happens when you make people stay home for three months: we have become a nation in thrall to our weirdest impulses. I’m not sure “the pub” is going to cut it now.

As an ethnobotanist, I am obsessed by the evolutionary theories that have attempted to explain what appear to be universal rules underpinning garden design. Once you understand the underlying instincts, becoming a better garden designer is suddenly far more straightforward.We talk about gardens as natural spaces, but they’re the exact opposite: human-made environments engineered using natural ingredients. If they were truly “natural”, we could leave the ecosystem to take its course, letting our plots revert to a wild state – twisted brambles, boggy puddles and all. Ironically, the second we do that these plots stop being real “gardens”. For when you set out to try and define the word “garden”, management is one of the defining features they all have in common.Evolutionary anthropologists and landscape psychologists have theorised that in creating gardens we are attempting to recreate the ideal habitat for our species. According to this, the richest habitat for the foods we eat are forest edges, including a protected area of tree cover and open area with views and sunlight. These contrasting elements have been coined “prospect and refuge”, offering the psychological safety of a space where you can hide from predators, and have a view of an open landscape for the prospect of hunting prey or gathering plants. Google the words “garden” and “seating area”, and I promise you the vast majority will match this basic blueprint.If you want to instantly grab attention, there isn’t a better feature than a water source, in particular running water, which in our past would have been safer to drink. Not only will our eyes be drawn to water, thanks to instinctive programming, but our path of travel will be, too. This ability to control the visual attention of the visitor and to dictate the route they take to travel is invaluable when it comes to the illusion of perfect nature. It allows planning of blind spots (where you can hide the compost bin), and to accentuate focal points for your proudest plant achievements.Aside from human and animal forms, flowers are probably the only other universal motif in art. Anthropologists have postulated that our ability to be excited about flowers helps us remember the location of fruiting plants, so we can return later for harvest. When we create flower-filled gardens, we are engineering an exaggerated vision of nature to satisfy our instincts.I am of the view that flowers are so exciting that they work best when used sparingly as focal points to draw the attention or surprise the viewer when they appear in the undergrowth, as in the wild. I think they are far more effective that way than using wall-to wall blocks of brash bedding, like drowning a cake in sprinkles. In gardening, like all art, there do appear to be underlying universal rules baked into our DNA, but how those are interpreted by us is as unique as each one of us. So bending, or breaking, these rules is as important as learning them.

You mean, in the Before Times? I was travelling a great deal on a book tour, staying at hotels, trying to remember which city I was in. If I was at home, my husband and I would start the day slowly, reading the paper in the usual order: the arts coverage, the books coverage. I would often write on Sundays, and I like to cook. Before the pandemic, there was a different rhythm to it.How have things changed? Well, if I didn’t look at my phone I’m not sure I’d know what day of the week it was the days blur from one to the next. Weekdays have taken on this slower quality, so Sundays don’t feel particularly different. I receive more work emails on Sundays, and I send them as well. It’s as if we’re all limping along.Have you learned anything new? My cooking skills have greatly improved, as has my interest in cooking. I’m inhabiting my home in a different way now – there’s something different about being at home with nowhere to go. I was so used to looking at the calendar: what’s next, what’s next? But for the time being, there is no next.Are you enjoying the downtime? I’m starting to embrace it to say, ‘I really am just going to sit here and stare out the window and not feel I have to be productive.’ There’s been a lot of productivity porn, everybody posting things they’ve accomplished. ‘I’m learning Italian.’ ‘I’ve perfected my frittata.’ It’s too easy to think that’s how it really is, and not just the parts of ourselves we’re showing to others. I have perfected my frittata though.What were Sundays like growing up? I was raised in an observant Jewish home. Saturdays were the Sabbath and I wasn’t allowed to do anything: ride my bike, play the piano, see my friends. Sundays were more uplifting. My father would pick up delicious food: bagels, lox, whitefish – the kind of food I now only eat once a year.Guilty Sunday pleasures? The best TV is on Sunday nights. What else? We bought an instapot.

What does our ability to stand patiently say about us?The line snaked ominously around the forecourt. I knew B\u0026ampQ mid-lockdown would be bad, but I hadn’t quite appreciated how bad. “They should call it Q\u0026ampQ,” my son remarked. There were at least 50 people in a socially distanced trolley conga, braving airborne particles and suspicious glances to lay their hands on shelf brackets, parasols, titanium-tipped screws.What was my excuse? Just as a driver complains about being “in traffic” when they are in fact, traffic, so the queuer laments the phenomenon they create. I was painting my kitchen, I had run out of paint, a retail park just off the M5 was the only place where I could lay my hands on the right brand and shade, the government had said it was OK and we were wearing masks. But I also wanted to subject the queue to the sort of study that the anthropologist Kate Fox pioneered while researching her 2004 classic, Watching the English, which spends a lot of time discussing the commonly held notion that we are a nation of queuers. “An Englishman, even if he is alone, forms an orderly queue of one,” noted the Hungarian émigré George Mikes in his bestselling 1946 book, How to be an Alien. In his 1944 essay The English People, George Orwell remarked on “the orderly behaviour of English crowds, the lack of pushing and quarrelling, the willingness to form queues.”Fox saw in the English queue (Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish queues are no doubt available) a “microcosmic minidrama”, full of “scheming and intrigue, moral dilemmas, shame, face-saving, shifting alliances, anger and reconciliation.” The English, she says, are one of the only people who will spontaneously arrange themselves into a single queue when faced with the two-cashier problem. “Many of the foreign visitors I interviewed regard these processes with open-mouthed amazement,” she notes.But Fox also found an interesting paradox. While the English are hyper-alert to infractions of queue etiquette – such as the “chat and cut”, that bugbear of Larry David in Curb Your Enthusiasm – hardly anyone dares object when it happens (as Larry David always would). So nowhere in the world is it easier to break queueing rules than it is in the UK. I now know this to be true, as my son and I busted B\u0026ampQ simply by strolling confidently in through the exit. I know, I know, I know… I merely hoped to demonstrate that queues are not necessarily the impregnable bastions of fairness that they are made out to be. No one said a word.But the coronavirus lockdown has brought many unexamined features of British life to the surface. Much of our queueing these days takes place virtually. “You are currently 25th in the queue,” said the automated voice when I phoned the council to ask whether there was much of a queue for the recycling centre that day. But during lockdown, queues have become far more visible as they have been moved outside shops to aid social distancing. It’s a daily pantomime of supposedly British notions of fair play and mustn’t grumble, and one of the few things to unite the nation other than a TikTok video of an American making tea in a microwave.But just maybe, the queue is also a symbol of decline, inefficiency, docility, passivity and snobbery. When “non-essential” shops were allowed to open in mid-June, the scenes of queues outside Primark prompted a bizarre outburst of class-shaming on social media. I haven’t seen too many people doing that to the queues outside Waitrose – whose goods (unlike Primark’s) are available online. Meanwhile, the scenes of MPs snaking around Westminster thanks to Jacob Rees-Mogg’s archaic insistence on voting in person were a potent symbol of a government failing to move with the time. “It was a breeding ground for infection. Supermarkets have better Covid management in place,” one MP complained.But there was a brief golden period of the lockdown queue – before the prime minister took ill, in the days when it really did seem as if we were in it together – and I don’t mind admitting that a particularly well-marshalled queue in the Horfield branch of Tesco moved me to tears. What at first appeared to be an ominous sign of misery and privation soon revealed itself to be a model of practical good sense and community spirit.A Tesco spokesperson informs me that company policy is for all stores to start queues 6m from shop fronts, ensuring that 2m markers are clearly visible. There are signs alerting customers to the queues and, in the larger stores, “helpful colleagues” to marshal the queues – and “most importantly” to thank customers for their patience. A one-way system within stores and a “one in, one out” policy ensures that social distancing is observed. Longer hours minimise the need for queues and NHS, healthcare and emergency services workers, vulnerable and elderly customers are invited to identify themselves and move to the front.All this can make for a far more efficient shopping experience than usual. A socially distanced queue moves far quicker than a normal queue – what was previously a step forward is now a 2m stride. If you have a single queue for all checkouts, it eliminates any potential checkout envy. And if you have a nice Bristolian granny saying: “Thank you for waiting my lover, checkout number 15 there,” the whole experience can be quite spirit-lifting.But how English – how British – is this experience? The orderly lines outside voting booths in the US state of Georgia, where the Republicans brazenly attempted to stop black people from voting in this month’s primary, are a clear demonstration that, yes, other people can queue, too. The Japanese apparently view us as amateurs. A viral Reddit image shows customers at a Thai bank forming a virtual queue with their flip flops and sitting out the wait on a bench. In small shops in Spain, it is common to call out: “¿Quién es el último?” to find out who is last in line, a system that allows you to nip out for a cigarette without losing your place in the queue. It also relies on addressing a room of strangers and is therefore unlikely to catch on in the UK anytime soon.Joe Moran, social historian at Liverpool John Moores University and author of Queuing for Beginners, notes that queues are by their nature temporary so don’t really lend themselves to comparative studies. “It’s really hard to say whether the British have been better at queuing than other nations, just because a queue doesn’t leave behind any evidence,” he says. “You can’t look into an archive to find out how well-mannered people were in queues in 1950. And manners are incredibly subjective, anyway.”Still, there was a definite uptick in observations about the BritishEnglish and queueing when rationing took hold during the Second World War. This was the time when you might join a queue without knowing what it was you were lining up for. “Queuing was not a trivial thing, but a fraught feature of everyday life,” says Moran. “My hunch is that the myth developed as a necessary fiction. We had to convince ourselves that this was something we were good at, and could take pride in, because times were so difficult.” Pregnant women were given a stamp in their ration book that allowed them to jump queues – a little like NHS workers today. This gave rise to a popular joke. Shopkeeper: “Excuse me, Miss, are you pregnant?” Woman: “Well, I wasn’t when I joined the queue!”To some extent, the notion that we are a nation of queuers becomes a self-seeding myth. The idea that the British are a uniquely fair-minded people may not be based on any objective truth – but the more we tell the story, the more alert we are to infractions, especially from people who don’t look like us. As the historian of empire, Charlotte Lydia Riley notes, the story helps reinforce the idea that the British are a deeply law-abiding people who will wait patiently and respect hierarchy. “The counterpoint of the careful British queuer is the colonial mob,” she says. “The idea that foreigners don’t know how to queue also fits into the broader co-opting of very normal and universal things as ‘British values’.”Moran further notes that people have been complaining about the decline of the British queue for as long as the British queue has been a notable phenomenon. A 1957 Times leader on the death of the bus queue lamented: “It is nowadays hard to have a relationship with a subordinate which rests on mutual consideration based on acknowledged authority.” But bus queues are seldom seen now for a far more practical reason: they don’t make sense when there are different buses serving the same stop.“There’s always this nostalgia for the moment we were better queuers,” notes Moran. “As with a lot of nostalgia, that moment can never be located. It exists alongside the myth. But that’s what sustains myths. They need to be constantly maintained and we need to be vigilant.”It was Winston Churchill who made the most political hay out of queues – but as ever with Churchill, the reality is a little different from how it is remembered. After the Labour landslide of 1945, he conflated the queues with the new un-British strain of socialism. “Why should queues become a permanent, continuous feature of our life?” he thundered on the campaign trail for the 1950 general election. “The Socialist dream is no longer Utopia, but Queuetopia.” Clement Attlee’s Labour won that contest but lost in a snap election held the following year, having lost the support of middle-class women, who resented the amount of time they now spent queuing.In his book Militant Housewives, James Hinton quotes the Labour Party Women’s Organisation complaining that “the last election was lost mainly in the queue at the butcher’s or the grocer’s”. Labour’s Ed Miliband noted on his podcast Reasons to be Cheerful that Rees-Mogg’s Parliament queue itself became a site of insurrection, as MPs had plenty of time to scheme and grumble while waiting to cast their vote – even while observing the 2m social distancing.Queues are often less fair than they first appear. A day pass for Alton Towers – reopening in early July – is £34 in advance. A Fastrack Platinum ticket that allows you to jump all the queues is £100. We are not equally able to spend hours waiting in queues either. The rules governing holding someone else’s place in the queue are far from set in stone. And as much as we love to perpetuate an idea of fairness, we’re usually open to exploiting advantage. Think of all the politicians who have promised that Britain will be “first in the queue” when it comes to trade deals or vaccines in the future.“It’s about clarity,” says Moran. “If people know the rules, they tend to follow them. The good thing about a coronavirus queue is that it’s ordered – it has to be – so it’s visibly fair. When people see that it makes it much easier to be patient.” But the queue itself is not enough – it relies on iniduals within it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef771e178a2b56fd648883572b87eb803135cdb9/0_373_7360_4414/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=835e4b9aed9c0dfa67450e0d5d5e2237","title":"weird but true lockdown has made many families happier","story":"Almost a third of mothers tell a survey that despite home schooling and financial worries they feel closer to their familiesSome people may disagree, but a new study suggests that lockdown has strengthened many parents’ relationships with their children.Its previous studies have reported that mothers are bearing a disproportionate amount of the extra work involved in looking after children who would normally be at school. But the new findings suggest this has not negatively affected their relationships with their children.“Many recent studies have pointed out the increasing economic and caring burden for women,” said Prof Brienna Perelli-Harris from the ESRC Centre for Population Change at the University of Southampton, who led the study with Sandra Walzenbach from the University of Essex.She pointed to the April Covid-19 survey which indicated that, on average, mothers were spending nine more hours per week during lockdown on childcare and home schooling than fathers.“The survey has shown that working from home and having the time to home school seems to improve parent-child relationships,” Perelli-Harris said. “However, those who can work from home are most likely to have higher incomes and education.

Nixon, like thousands of others, had been informed by her travel agent that her package tour of Morocco could not go ahead because of coronavirus restrictions.Also, like thousands of others, her request for a refund was refused. The agent, TourRadar, claimed it was a “suspension”, not a cancellation, and that she would have to accept a credit note. The tour operator, Intrepid Travel, insisted that a credit note was the only option.Nixon, who is on furlough and fears for the future of her job, issued a chargeback claim for her £600 via her card company, Amex. That’s when the voicemail message was left.A TourRadar operative said it was successfully contesting credit card claims and that if she did not drop her case, it would deem her to have cancelled the holiday and breached the contract. She would, therefore, be left without a refund and lose her entitlement to the credit note.“TourRadar has continued to advise me every day by email that if I don’t withdraw the dispute within 24 hours it will remove the offer of credit and I’ll receive nothing,” she says. “It claims that it doesn’t have long to file paperwork with Amex to fight its side, but Amex tells me that dispute windows have been lengthened to 60 days. I believe they’re trying to put pressure on me by creating a false deadline. I now have no idea what to do.”The travel industry is facing ruin as Covid-19 continues to wreak havoc on the holiday market. Although consumer law requires firms to refund customers if they cannot provide the goods and services purchased, many are instead offering protected credit notes in a bid to remain solvent. Some appear to be trying to manipulate the law to deter those who are unable or unwilling to rebook their cancelled holidays.The Observer has been contacted about half a dozen agents who have retrospectively added exemption clauses to their terms and conditions, renamed cancellations “postponements” to avoid payouts or threatened customers who seek to enforce their right to a refund.The approach by TourRadar, which sells holidays arranged by a range of package tour operators including Intrepid, is troubling.Customers who do not receive the goods or services they have paid for have the right to make a claim via their card issuer. They can do this either through the voluntary chargeback scheme operated by Visa, Mastercard and Amex – which retrieves the money from the trader’s bank – or, if they used a credit card, under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act, which requires the card issuer to cover the cost.Nixon’s booking had already been cancelled by the tour operator before she sought redress from Amex, so it’s absurd for TourRadar to threaten to hold her liable for cancelling it herself.Nonetheless, an email from customer services informed her that the booking terms and conditions had been amended after the coronavirus outbreak to redefine cancellations as “suspensions”. Amended terms and conditions can’t be retrospectively applied to a contract and the original terms promised a refund if the operator had to cancel.Moreover, the Package Travel and Linked Travel Arrangements Regulations require operators to issue refunds within 14 days for cancelled trips. Nixon was eventually refunded after approaching Intrepid for a second time.The Financial Ombudsman Service says it was unaware of companies trying to pressure customers to drop claims. “Consumers have the right to make a complaint about section 75 with their bank and we’ll expect businesses to investigate these complaints thoroughly and treat consumers fairly,” it says.Amex told the Observer that it took into account the terms and conditions that were in place at the time of the transaction if a card holder raised a dispute. “Our card acceptance agreements require merchants to comply with the laws applicable to their businesses,” it says.TourRadar claimed that the voice messages were merely a recommendation that Nixon seek a refund directly from the tour operator, despite the fact that its subsequent emails insisted that Intrepid’s refusal was non-negotiable, and none suggested she approach Intrepid again.“Looking back, we do acknowledge that communication between our team and Ms Nixon was not very clear in explaining this recommendation as typically the most successful route,” says Vanessa Subramaniam, global director of customer support at TourRadar. “We take full responsibility for this. Moving forward, we’ll continue to work on our training to ensure processes like these are carried out in line with best practices and standards in place.” Intrepid Travel was contacted for a comment.Sheila Pearce was also told that her tour operator’s terms and conditions had been changed retrospectively, denying her the refund promised for her cancelled package holiday. When she attempted to recover the money through the small claims court, she was warned that the company would use pending insolvency legislation to thwart it.Pearce had booked a £3,640 tour of Pompeii with an award-winning specialist travel company, Andante Travel. She was notified that the trip would have to be cancelled due to the pandemic and was twice promised a refund within six weeks. Instead of her money, she received a message informing her that the booking terms and conditions had been changed and she was only due a credit note.“We objected on the grounds that we are pensioners with an underlying medical condition, so we will almost certainly never travel abroad again,” says Pearce.Andante refused to budge and, when she began legal action, its lawyer sent a letter advising that the company could not afford to pay refunds to all its customers. It warned that the directors would not defend her claim so a default judgment would be issued by the court and have to be enforced.Enforcement is usually done through a petition to wind up a company and, the letter stated, the pending corporate insolvency and governance bill, designed to protect struggling companies during the pandemic, would prevent Pearce doing that.“It will therefore be the case that in the event that you proceed with your claim and are successful in obtaining judgment, the company will not make payment and will be protected from further enforcement measures by you,” the letter concluded.The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy told the Observer that the new rules do not prevent creditors appointing bailiffs to enforce a county court judgment, and that winding up petitions can still be brought once the temporary new insolvency legislation has expired.“The measures are not a licence for a company not to pay debts which remain legally due and enforceable,” says a government spokesperson. “Where cancellations occur, companies have a legal obligation to ensure their consumers are fairly compensated.”Jackie Willis, CEO of Andante Travel, says the purpose of the letter is “simply to set the legal position from the company’s viewpoint, having received appropriate professional advice”.Pearce is still without her £3,640. Andante Travel promised customers that they can claim a refund if they do not use their credit notes before they expire at the end of March 2021, but Pearce does not want to wait a further nine months.“I feel they are, in effect, using our money as an interest-free loan without any agreement on our part,” she says. “This is causing us considerable stress, to say nothing of the disappointment from losing the chance to visit Pompeii which we have planned for 40 years.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f7161259a5950eabf076fb4dfba2a127b607b3d/0_334_7200_4320/master/7200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34aa470bdd0f24a436efd5b072b34484","title":"we never ran out of toilet roll the edinburgh eco store thats thriving in lockdown","story":"The husband and wife team running The Eco Larder have been stranded in different parts of Scotland in lockdown, but that’s not stopping them from keeping their zero-waste store openOn 5 June, The Eco Larder co-owner Matthew Foulds had his first day off work for 90 days. Making the most of his free time, he picked up a hire bike and went for a ride. An apt choice, given that when lockdown began, The Eco Larder started offering bicycle deliveries for the first time.This new option is one of the ways that Matthew and his co-owner and wife, Stephanie Foulds, have adapted their business during the coronavirus pandemic. “We started offering a delivery service as soon as the lockdown came into place because of how difficult it was for people to get hold of groceries,” says Stephanie. “And because we’re an environmental company, we decided to do this by cargo bike.”The Eco Larder is a zero-waste social enterprise food store in the Haymarket area of Edinburgh. It opened in November 2018 after a successful crowdfunding campaign helped the couple to raise £23,000. Their vision was inspired by their daughter, who was only six months old at the time. “She’s a really big driver for why we do what we do,” explains Stephanie. “We just wanted to bring her up in a world that takes better care of the planet than we have been seeing over our lifetime.”Juggling a newly established business and a small child is a challenge. Add a global pandemic into this mix? “It was total chaos”, laughs Stephanie, who is currently staying on the Isle of Bute with her mother and daughter. They travelled there before any of the lockdown restrictions came into force so that her mother, who shares their flat in Edinburgh, could recover from a period of ill health, which included a week in intensive care.Until she is able to return to Edinburgh, Stephanie is handling ordering for the store remotely while Matthew keeps the shop doors open with the help of assistant Charlotte Wood.Yet despite the physical ide, they have worked together to adapt their business model as circumstances changed. As soon as the store’s local Post Office shut, for example, they stopped orders of lifestyle products through the website. They also reduced the store’s opening hours to manage deliveries and the extra cleaning now required.The couple are both qualified yoga instructors and have a studio at the back of the store. While the physical classes have had to come to an end for now, Matthew is managing to find time on Sundays to offer a Zoom class for their regular yogis who are still keen for their weekly fix.The lockdown has resulted in more positive innovations too. As well as introducing cargo bike deliveries, The Eco Larder now offers click-and-collect. “It’s a contactless service,” says Stephanie. “We leave the goods outside the shop for people. That’s been really popular now that lockdown is easing.”Stephanie is keen to highlight Matthew’s hard work over the last few months (“I’m really proud of him for everything he’s doing and showing up every single day”), but it is thanks to both of them that their business has done so well. “We never ran out of toilet roll,” says Stephanie with pride.The couple have also been able to draw on support from various sources. Thanks to an existing relationship with a walking and cycling charity, they were able to borrow two cargo bikes and find two volunteers to do their deliveries. Being part of the Visa network has helped too. “Having the support of bigger companies is necessary for smaller businesses,” says Stephanie. “They have the resources to raise the profile of a small business like ours.”The couple have been keen to give back to others, too. Rather than charging for their deliveries, they asked for a £5 donation and put a food box together every week, based on how many deliveries they had, and delivered it to the foodbank at Tollcross community hub, which is close to the shop.Looking to the future, Stephanie and Matthew would like to open another store in Edinburgh as this would expand their zero-waste mission and allow them to reduce prices. “Being the type of shop we are, it’s all small suppliers,” states Stephanie. “It’s just an issue of supply and demand. The more demand that there is, then the lower we can provide prices.Until that is possible, the couple are focused on buying their own cargo bike and offering deliveries on all weekdays, not just three days a week – so Matthew had better get more practice miles in on his next day off too.Shop local.

JK Rowling was a single mother who used to sit in a cafe writing magical stories.The campaign for fairer pricing is backed by MPs and charities who share fears that while children in two-parent families will begin to return to visitor attractions as lockdown eases, children of single parents will suffer culturally and educationally.Marsha de Cordova, shadow secretary of state for women and equalities, said the prices were “discriminatory” and “unfair”. “All families should be able to enjoy days out,” she said. “More must be done urgently to support single-parent families, who are already more likely to be trapped in low-paid work.”Rubie Harrington, campaigns officer at the charity Gingerbread, said: “A quarter of families with children in the UK are headed by a single parent. Yet they all too often miss out on ‘family’ deals and pay a premium for days out.“We call on businesses to embed fairer family offers that do not discriminate against single-parent families. Now more than ever, all sectors must work towards rebuilding a fairer economy.”Jacqui Dicker, who lives with her six-year-old son Daniel in Warwickshire, said the price structure “feels like discrimination”. “There is often a ‘family ticket’ that only offers a discount to a family with two adults, but not to my family,” she said. “Days out are really expensive, with snacks, souvenirs and travel. There should be a family saving for all families and not ones of a specific shape.The Eden Project in Cornwall, which currently costs £75 for a two-parent family or £58 with a single parent, told the single mothers’ campaign it is discussing family pricing as part of its Covid-19 ticketing review.In contrast, the National Trust already has a fairer pricing model, with a single-parent family paying £78, a substantial reduction on the £126 paid by two-parent families."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f34de6e428184052e3e1a7d91d9293ae12ce95b/2_0_3021_1814/master/3021.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3452d04fe5563dc7f8ef0b3a76fa658f","title":"who is the greatest male tennis player of the last 50 years","story":"Last week we reminisced about the great female players of the last half century.

He taught photography to the kids, but he also captured those moments when children discovered the strangeness and possibility of independence for the first time. Summers in bunk beds and cabins and woods stretched ahead of them, communal and lonely by turns. Part of the photographer’s motivation was to recapture the intensity of the periods he had spent away from his own family as a boy.His pictures are from different camps and different years but they share an emotional trajectory. The children arrive singly, clutching sleeping bags, they slowly overcome fears in ritualised games and campfire bonding, and they leave changed. In this picture the time away is coming to a close. The bus is waiting to return teenagers to the routine of home and school and TV. But as Steinmetz’s says: “Even if they’re miserable and bitching to one another throughout, by the end they’re like: ‘Oh my God, this is ending, you’re my best friend, and this has been the most intense thing I’ve ever done in my life!’”One of the things that strikes you most about these images – now collected in a book, Summer Camp – is how unselfconscious the children seem in the presence of the camera they don’t yet know all the angles. It is probably no coincidence Steinmetz gave up his project with the arrival of ubiquitous digital photography. He has persisted in working with film, and in black-and-white, over the years since because he “prefers the way film describes the light”. His summer camp pictures make that argument, which is less about nostalgia than a kind of emotional connection. “With digital,” Steinmetz has said, “every object in the frame seems slightly distinct and separate from every other element in the frame whereas silver prints have more internal harmony – they feel less nervous.” Summer Camp by Mark Steinmetz is published by Nazraeli Press (£50)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7699479650fcb7bc25f0ac8ebee1b23ff4c6ba80/0_107_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dbf6df434389ed3230b5295667150731","title":"our time is now review stacey abrams attorney general vice president joe biden","story":"An eloquent and moving call for voting rights reform shows the former Georgia House minority leader is ready for higher officeIf intelligence, thoughtfulness, an encyclopedic knowledge of voter suppression techniques and an elegant writing style were the main qualifications for the vice-presidency, Stacey Abrams would be odds-on-favorite to be Joe Biden’s running mate.Tragically, the voter suppression tactics of her Republican opponent disenfranchised hundreds of thousands and almost certainly determined the outcome, giving Brian Kemp a tainted victory.As a result, minority leader of the Georgia House is still the highest political office on Abrams’ CV, a fact I’m guessing may give California senator Kamala Harris a crucial edge if Biden does the right thing and picks an African American woman.Regardless of her immediate political fate, the good news from Abrams’ beautiful new book is that the Democratic party has the perfect candidate to restore decency and probity at the Department of Justice, as the next US attorney general.Our Time is Now is part-memoir, part-history and most of all a roaring call to arms for the decent American majority to take the country back from the racists and xenophobes who are the president’s only reliable supporters.Since the end of the second world war, more than anything else the example of the courage of African Americans has made it possible for women, gay people and trans people, Native Americans and every other oppressed group to demand the constitutional protections that are supposed to be the birthright of every American.Abrams explains why black Americans have been the natural trailblazers in this fight for justice: “At its inception, our nation served as a refuge to those whose difference placed them in danger but the same newcomers stole land from and murdered the original inhabitants, enslaved blacks, and stripped them of their humanity, and denied basic rights to women and nonwhites from abroad.“This history means we understand what is at stake, how our opponents will try to block change, and, most important, our obligation to realize our destiny … a multiracial, multiethnic, youth-driven majority has grown over the last 20 years as a result, we’ve seen nothing less than a sea change toward progress … Obama was not a fluke but a foreshadowing of how we can win even more.”Instead of giving primacy to the “working-class white man in Ohio who voted for Reagan in 1980”, as American political reporters do over and over again, Abrams urges us to remember that the daughter of that white voter may now “be married to a Kenyan woman who is waiting for permanent residence and their first child in Arkansas”.To Abrams, the massive gains in 2018 which saw Democrats retake the House of Representatives demonstrate that “demographic changes have come to fruition and are ready to become a political road map to sustained progress.“But to do so, we must understand the hard work of civic engagement. We can’t wait for election time to come around … Americans must understand the compelling nihilism of authoritarian populism to avoid a permanent breakdown in democracy …Our obligation is to fortify democracy’s infrastructure … Demography is not destiny it is opportunity. We have internalized the worst lessons of our opponents … by catering to the backbiting, loathing and timidity of fear.”Abrams is particularly moving when she writes about the experiences of her parents, civil rights activists who grew up learning the severe limitations of the Brown v Board of Education supreme court decision, which was supposed to end school segregation in 1954, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which theoretically guaranteed the right to vote.“We often see these historical moments as flash points with instant gratification,” she writes. “However, with most movements … the new rules only herald possibility …Without a state system forced to accept the federal edicts, racial oppression continued for years after change had supposedly come.”Three years after the Voting Rights Act, Abrams’ grandparents got their first chance to cast their ballots. But when the great moment came, her grandmother froze in her bedroom.“I’m afraid, Jim,” she told her husband. “I’m afraid of the dogs and the police. I don’t want to vote.”She told Abrams her husband was furious, and “reminded me about your daddy and our aunts and uncles. All those young black children who fought so hard to get these rights.” So Abrams’ grandmother gathered up her courage, her purse and her coat, and told her husband “she was ready to go”.This year, if we are to face down the forces of hatred and ignorance and restore America “as an exemplar of the competency of democratically led governments”, we will all need to show that same determination and courage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f616a57fa59d157df5bbfa56d8e3611411c64253/0_104_4731_2839/master/4731.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9fbf513a7f58c2a5bfa3682b8ccbcde","title":"living in hong kong are you thinking about settling in the uk","story":"We would like to hear from those eligible for the right to settle in the UK on whether they are thinking of leaving Hong KongIn response to the UK prime minister offering nearly 3 million residents in Hong Kong the right to settle in the UK, China has said it would take “corresponding measures” to stop it from happening.We would like to hear from people as to whether they are thinking of relocating to the UK or any other country.You can get in touch by filling in the form below or via WhatsApp by clicking here or adding the contact +44(0)7867825056..

He is a member of Independent Sage, a group of experts set up to provide “robust, independent advice” in regard to the UK’s coronavirus policies, and former director of the Institute for Global Health at University College London. He has worked in a number of low-income nations, developing effective strategies for cutting newborn and maternal mortality rates. He also served as director of maternal, child and adolescent health at the World Health Organization (WHO) in Geneva.What do you think about the decision to open pubs yesterday?Well it’s very odd in Britain that we’re opening pubs before schools. It says something about our priorities. Being outdoors the risks are pretty low – 19 times lower risk according to a Japanese study. I would have said open pubs as long as you serve outside. The worry is that people will be crowding together to get drinks, and that as they’ll be drinking, they’ll lose their inhibitions. And in an indoor space there’s lots of potential to be a super-spreader. So I’m a bit opposed to pubs opening, but I understand the reasons why they’ve done it.Do you agree with Sir David King, chair of Independent Sage, that the government has lost all moral authority?Did the government ever have much moral authority? The whole English response, almost from the beginning, has been an unfolding tale of inidualism and new Conservatism, which has damaged public health. Now you have this bizarre situation where you’ve suddenly got this mysterious body called the joint biosecurity centre, which is going to be in charge of data and nobody knows who they are or where they’re getting it from. You’ve got Public Health England (PHE) being marginalised and, I would think, abolished, and the Sage (Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies), which is now wary of the politicians, not really being listened to. So it’s a very odd situation.PHE was blamed for restricting the coronavirus testing process to its own labs. Was that a fair criticism?Yes, I think it is. If they’ve got any defence it’s that the whole public health system was turned on its head about seven years ago with the Lansley reforms. We had a structure in place that allowed regional public health people to take control of something like an epidemic, and that was dismantled. They’ve degraded the public health system. You could also argue the problem was Sage. In early February, they should have known that this was a pandemic that was coming and the first thing you would want to do was test – and they had a test. Why didn’t they go to the 44 molecular biology laboratories around the country that were all geared up to do this? There was no public health person on Sage. No one who was independent who could say: “Come on guys, this is what you’ve got to do.”Should the Black Lives Matter protests have been allowed to go ahead?Given that protests are outdoors, and if they’re well managed and the people organising the protests make a serious attempt to control them, you could argue that democracy overrides the risk at the moment because we’re on the downward part of the curve. The problem is if protests get very big, there is a risk there. But pubs are much more risky than a protest or even Bournemouth beach, which got slightly unfairly criticised.What do you say to the criticism that Independent Sage muddies the message and undermines Sage’s authority?David King always says Indie Sage has got to be relevant to the pandemic and constructive in suggesting areas that can be improved on. Obviously, there are people with axes to grind, me included, about aspects of what the government or Sage have done. The problem with Sage is that it is unbalanced. They’ve got some very good modellers and some good behavioural scientists, but a lot of them have now come over to us because they were very frustrated that they weren’t being listened to. Science should be open and discursive.It’s widely thought the lockdown should have started earlier. Why do you think it didn’t and what difference would it have made in terms of deaths?The first reason it didn’t happen is because they decided early on that testing wasn’t going to be done. That was bizarre. That led on to them really planning a response to the wrong virus – flu. Flu is a very different virus. You don’t test for it because it spreads so quickly. The influenza mindset then led them on to this herd immunity idea – that it’s a pandemic and you can’t stop it. They had 230 contact tracers for 67 million people. In Wuhan, they brought in 9,000 for around 10 million people and they had a full lockdown... I fell off my chair when I watched that 12 March announcement from Johnson. Almost everything they said was wrong. Can you name a virus where you let it run through the population to get herd immunity? Herd immunity is what you get from a vaccine. At the moment we’re at about 65,000 excess deaths, according the Financial Times. I honestly think we could have prevented about 50,000 of them, if we’d gone early like South Korea. I think Sage got it wrong, PHE got it wrong, and Boris Johnson got it wrong.What is your assessment of a vaccine development and when, realistically, is the earliest one will arrive?The good news is that you’ve got more labs in the world looking for a vaccine for this virus than any other. They’ve got better techniques for designing vaccines and there’s a lot of money going into it. Having said that, they’ve never had a vaccine to a coronavirus. Vaccines usually take several years to develop because you’ve got to test the safety of it. And most worrying, it seems the immune response to the virus is not very good, and fades. That suggests any vaccine you come up with may have only short lasting immunity. For all those reasons I’m cautious. The people I respect say two years would be a possible time. My guess is that we may get a partially effective one a bit quicker.Is it possible that, as Sunetra Gupta of Oxford University suggests, many people have come into contact with the virus but not developed antibodies?Yes, it is possible. When I first looked at Sunetra’s stuff and I spoke to epidemiologists I respect, they said she can’t possibly be right. She overestimated the spread of the disease and underestimated its strength. Having said that, there’s some element of truth in what she thinks.What do you think of Matt Hancock’s performance as health secretary?I tweeted recently that he should resign. At first I thought he was probably the most authoritative of the ministers in the briefings. Then he became obsessed by testing without understanding why you do it, from the finding, testing, isolation and support – you need all of that for it to work. But latterly, I think the decisions to go with private companies such as Serco and Deloitte, and with this total mess in Leicester where they can’t get the data because the private sector doesn’t share it – I think that’s almost criminally negligent. And the decision to bypass PHE rather than strengthen it, and strengthen links with primary care, has been lamentable.There has been much speculation about societal change following Covid-19. Do you think that will happen and how would you like it to manifest?I hope so. Although I’m a paediatrician and most of my work is doing community health in low-income countries, in the past 10 years I’ve been quite involved in climate change. I’m co-chair of the Lancet countdown on climate change and health. I used to do too much flying and I always felt when I was at the WHO that you didn’t need to do so much of it.

Another vaguely worded provision bans inciting hatred towards the Chinese or Hong Kong government.On the Chinese mainland, similar national security laws are routinely used to crush dissent.The new security law and the removal of books raised questions of whether academic freedom still exists.Hong Kong has some of Asia’s best universities and a campus culture where topics that would be taboo on the mainland are still discussed and written about.But Beijing has made clear it wants education in the city to become more “patriotic” especially after a year of huge, often violent and largely youth-led pro-democracy protests."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39ae5e66432f009630410252b8832e92ab20d983/220_540_4451_2671/master/4451.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6370f4df7abc85f6c8675282f233f7df","title":"shielding in england how do you feel about coming out of lockdown","story":"As lockdown restrictions ease we want to hear how you feel about itFrom this weekend, pubs and restaurants, cinemas, museums, galleries and hairdressers in England will be allowed to reopen their doors.On Monday, people in England with underlying health issues who have been shielding since March will be allowed to leave their homes.They will be able to meet up outside in groups of up to six people from different households, provided they keep 2 metres apart, and they will no longer have to remain 2 metres apart from the rest of their household at home.If you have been shielding since March we would like to hear how you feel about lockdown restrictions easing.You can get in touch by filling in the form below or via WhatsApp by clicking here or adding the contact +44(0)7867825056.

She examines how housing pressures, in-work poverty and racial inequalities contributed to the deaths of 36 residents from Covid-19 journalist Aamna Modhin tells Rachel Humphreys about reporting from Church End, a small neighbourhood in Brent, north London, which has a large Somali population. In early March, residents began to fall ill from coronavirus, eventually resulting in 36 deaths. Locals believe the cluster, which is the second worst in England and Wales according to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics, does not account for the true scale of the devastation, as it does not factor in people who work in Church End but live nearby.  Aamna met Rhoda Ibrahim, a 57-year old community leader who has been left devastated by the deaths of so many people she knew. The virus thrived on the structural inequalities that Ibrahim has spent much of her life fighting against. It flourished in a housing crisis that was 40 years in the making, stark in-work poverty that left many struggling to put food on the table, and deeply entrenched racial inequalities. The council leader, Muhammed Butt, believes the government’s failure to provide tailored support to communities such as those in Brent worsened the situation, and that the country should have gone into lockdown earlier.

The health ministry said that many messages had been sent to Israelis following the renewed involvement of the Shin Bet domestic security agency. Israeli daily Haaretz reported that more than 30,000 people were notified they must enter quarantine since Thursday.After imposing strict measures early on during a first wave of infections, Israel and the Palestinian territories appeared to have contained their outbreaks, with each reporting only a few dozen new cases a day in May. But an easing of restrictions led to a steady uptick in cases over the past month.Israel Police have said their operations to enforce coronavirus regulations will be expanded countrywide - with thousands of police officers inspecting restaurants, event venues, shops, buses and trains.

Visitors will have to wear masks at all times, keep their distance, and not touch its glistening marble surfaces when the 17th-century monument to love reopens on Monday after a three-month shutdown.Only 5,000 tourists will be allowed in a day, split into two groups, which is a far cry from the peak levels of 80,000 a day you could expect to see at the mausoleum built in the northern city of Agra by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan for his wife.“All centrally protected monuments \u0026amp sites shall be bound by the protocols like sanitization, social distancing and other health protocols,” the federal tourism ministry said in a tweet yesterday.The move is not without controversy though. Authorities are reopening the Taj and other monuments, such as New Delhi’s historic Red Fort, just as India’s coronavirus infections are rising at the fastest pace in three months.On Sunday, the health ministry reported a record single-day spike of 24,850 new cases and more than 600 deaths, pushing the overall case tally to 673,165.The government has been lifting a vast lockdown of India’s 1.3 billion people that has left tens of thousands without work and shuttered businesses.Agra, one of India’s first big clusters of the virus, remains the worst-affected city in Uttar Pradesh, the country’s most populous state.“All around the Taj are containment zones,” a local district administration official told Reuters’ Neha Arora, requesting anonymity, ahead of the monument’s planned reopening.Containment zones, areas identified as most affected by the virus, remain under strict lockdown, with restricted access and movement of only essential goods and services.“We don’t expect visitors here because clusters around the Taj, including shops and hotels, are closed,” the official said.India’s defence minister, Rajnath Singh, has been tweeting pictures of his visit to the country’s new Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Covid hospital in New Delhi, alongside home affairs minister Amit Shah and health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan.India’s Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has built the temporary structure in 11 days.

They have banned from leaving their homes for at least five days, and hundreds of police turning up to enforce the order.Elhadi Abass lives in the Flemington estate in one of the towers affected, and has written for us about the experience - and what needs to be done next.We see kids playing and riding their bicycles and doing whatever they want to do. And our kids are stuck at home, inside. Imagine how hard that is for our children, to be locked in the flats and looking out of the windows at those other kids.What we need is more testing, lots of testing, but not lockdowns. Yesterday they sent 500 police. Why? I want to ask Daniel Andrews why he sent us the police, but no medical help. This is not a police issue. Why didn’t they send us 500 nurses?You can read it in full here: Elhadi Abass - The government sent 500 police to the towers instead of 500 nurses.

Sunak refused to provide a £10bn cash injection to avoid the health service being crippled by a second wave of the coronavirus. He had previously pledged to give the NHS “whatever it needs.” The World Health Organization has reported a record increase in global coronavirus cases with 212,326 being recorded in just 24 hours, amid a surge in the United States, Brazil and India.The WHO’s situation report showed that just under 130,000 of those new cases were in the Americas, including the US, Brazil and Mexico, but the WHO said South-East Asia, including India stood at just under new 28,000 new cases on Saturday.The previous biggest daily global increase had been 189,00, on Tuesday.Read the ’s latest report on the global coronavirus pandemic here.Idris Hassan, 35, lives with his wife and three young children in one of the public housing towers that has been locked down in North Melbourne.As of 3pm on Sunday, he said he was yet to receive any care packages or food deliveries. No one had visited the family to provide information about what to expect.“It feels unfair that particular buildings are being locked down while across the street, people are just allowed to go to work and do their other necessities,” he told the . Hassan works at Melbourne airport in the export industry and is frustrated he will not be able to go to work tomorrow. He was unimpressed by the $1,500 hardship payments announced by the government, saying he will still be disadvantaged by missing at least a week of work. “You can’t throw me peanuts and then say, ‘We’re going to take your liberties and freedom and even the right to buy food,’” he said. “As a minority group, it feels like we are soft targets,” added Hassan, whose background is Somali.In his building, Hassan said residents were able to leave their unit, but could not leave the tower itself. He went down to the foyer to speak to the police on Saturday night, but found they had little information. No police are stationed on his floor, he said. “They just relayed to me what the press release was,” Hassan said. “I mean, I don’t want to hear that. I read it. Everybody’s read it.”While he did not support the “hard” lockdown, he was also frustrated by the fact it was implemented immediately. He was angry about what he called the “lack of information, the lack of communication, the lack of respect we are being given”.“Right now, as we’re speaking, we don’t have milk for the kids,” he said. Hiba Shanino, a law student, is among thousands of people who have been locked down in housing estates in Melbourne.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillJuly 4th is a celebration of independence for millions of people in the US. This year, the residents of the Wolfe Tone Close complex in Dublin 1 also celebrated freedom, but the independence they celebrated was their own.The residents of the north-inner city complex, most of whom are over 70, congregated in the community area with their families for a summer barbecue to toast to the easing of coronavirus restrictions and no longer having to cocoon.They had pink and blue balloons hung up – similar to what you would see at a baby shower – to celebrate their “rebirth”, while a DJ played music and everyone drank and ate burgers.Maura Cudden (81) sat at a table with her dog Angel, sipping a glass of red wine. What was she most looking forward to now that she was allowed to mingle with other people? “Getting drunk, of course,” she said with a cheeky laugh, before adding: “I’m only messing, I’m only messing.”Cudden has lived in her apartment for the past 20 years, but she said having to cocoon had created a community among the residents, who used to only say hello in passing.“There were phone numbers being put in my letterbox for if I need anything, there was food left on my table, there would be knocks on the door asking if I needed anything because they were going to the shop,” Cudden said. “It was like I adopted a whole new family. It took the edge off cocooning.”It was not just the community spirit that made the distressing period easier. Her dog did, too.“I used to take her up when the news was on, I used to listen to it because I wanted to know what was going on. When I’d heard the deaths were very high in the beginning, I used to squeeze her to death because I had nobody else to touch or hold so I used to just squeeze her. She gave me such relief,” she added.Imelda Dodrill, who proudly declared that she was the oldest resident in the complex, said she found staying still very difficult.“The lockdown was very hard on me. I celebrated my 90th birthday in May and my family had organised a surprise party, but that never materialised. I worked from when I was 14 until 70, and I like to keep busy. I’m not the type to sit around and stay in,” Dodrill said.She was not terribly excited about restaurants or bars reopening because she is “well past that now”. However, being able to bring her dog Charlie out for walks again was the best part of society reopening.“I brought him out straight away, so I did. I love walking. I walk everywhere, I walk for miles. This, now, being able to move again, is marvellous. It’s like another life.”Margaret Murphy (79) said listening to Joe Dolan was the only way she was able to get through the lockdown, and she was glad she could “get back to normal”.“They told me not to go out so I did what I was told. My daughter lives in west Cork, the other one lives in Carlow and another in Galway. I missed the grandkids,” she said.Now that she no longer has to stay cooped up in her apartment, she has a long list of things she wants to do.“I think I might go on a cruise and travel the world.

Pictured, Zaida Reyes  cleaning glass in one of the snugs. Photograph: Clare KeoghA publican in Cork has said he is not re-opening under Covid-19 restrictions because they would turn his bar “into a crime scene” and believes he would alienate customers. Con Dennehy, who owns the Venue in Ballintemple, is one of the 60 per cent of Cork publicans who opted not to re-open until July 20th, saying that he didn’t believe the current regulations where customers must book a slot and have a meal were particularly practical.“No, I haven’t reopened -I didn’t want to turn the bar into a crime scene with tape and screens everywhere and I didn’t want to alienate people I know and respect by telling them that they have to leave after 90 minutes or 105 minutes,” he told The . “To my mind, it’s only civil servants who could have made up these regulations because they are totally impractical and totally unenforceable - I’d rather stay closed until September if needs be to open properly for my locals and not end up alienating them with these regulations.”Mr Dennehy said that he expects to open on July 20th and when he does, he trusts his customers to be responsible regarding social distance and keeping one metre apart of their own volition, rather than he or his staff having to go around and asking people to keep apart.“Who is going to police social distancing? The gardaí hardly want to get involved in it, that’s a HSE job and do they have the personnel to police it? I think people should look after their own interest and do the sensible thing and keep their distance without having to be told.“If any fellow is iffy about going into a pub, he shouldn’t go in - I saw fellows coming in March before we closed down and they were taking their pint off the counter and stepping back and they were keeping their own social distance, they didn’t have to be asked so it was working back then.”‘Very co-operative’The majority of pubs in Cork have opted not to re-open until July 20th but those that have re-opened and are serving food in line with Government guidelines are generally expressing satisfaction with business, according to the Chair of the Cork Vintners Federation of Ireland, Michael O’Donovan.Mr O’Donovan said that approximately 40 per cent of the 208 pubs in the city and suburbs re-opened last Monday, serving substantial meals to customers who have to make a booking at the pub and generally it seemed to be working out reasonably well.“A few bars had some teething problems with people coming in and asking for a drink and the bar staff or management having to explain to them that they are really operating as a restaurant and they have to have food and they then can have a drink to accompany it.”Mr O’Donovan said the majority of customers have been very co-operative even though some of the bars are finding the 105-minute limit too restrictive, particularly when they are serving customers a three course meal which is being made to order in the pub.He said there did not appear to be any major problem with people turning up without bookings even though inidual pubs operated different systems with some pubs having set times that people can book while others are allowing the customers to choose a time and then booking a slot at that time.“All the bars have people at the door particularly in the evening so when people come to the door if they have capacity, they take them but if they are full they are moving on - what is noticeable that people are having multiple bookings, some in the same venue or some in other venues.”He said that all bars are operating social distancing and most people are being very co-operative even though he has heard of one or two cases where people have tried to pull tables together but once management explained that this wasn’t allowed, they accepted it.Mr O’Donovan, who runs the Castle Inn on South Main Street in the heart of Cork city, said that he would be waiting until July 20th as he does not serve food in the bar and like many of the 60pc of bars who have opted to wait until July 20th, he does not have a booking service.“We will have capacity for 28 people with one metre social distancing when we re-open on July 20th but if the Government introduce a booking system on July 20th, a lot of bars will remain close because they don’t have a booking engine.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4296549.1593872336!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach disappointed he only learned of barry cowen s driving ban on friday","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Agriculture Barry Cowen said he was ‘profoundly sorry’ about the incident.

The law on drink-driving for learner drivers four years ago meant a concentration 10mg-35mg of alcohol per 100ml of breath was considered over the limit.Mr Cowen’s case did not go to court as the level of alcohol in his system was on the lower scale and did not reach the level required for prosecution.Mr Cowen said he was “profoundly sorry” about the incident, adding that it was “an appalling lapse and one which I have to accept and learn from”.In a statement on Saturday morning, the Taoiseach said he was first made aware of the “issue” on Friday afternoon.“I have spoken to Minister Cowen and I accept that his remorse about this incident is genuine,” he said. “I am disappointed that I learned about it in this way and have made that clear to him.”Mr Cowen was appointed Minister for Agriculture last week by the Taoiseach and was a member of the Fianna Fáil negotiating team in the coalition talks.The Minister has been a TD since 2011 and served as the party’s public expenditure spokesman for the past two years.He comes from a long line of Fianna Fáil politicians, with his brother Brian a former taoiseach and their late father Ber a former TD."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4290693.1593296152!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"who is in the new cabinet members in profile","story":"Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has been elected Taoiseach by 93 votes to 63, with three abstentions, in a historic Dáil vote which has taken place in Dublin’s Convention Centre.

The four years since were spent building up a still volatile parliamentary party but Fianna Fáil suffered further losses in the 2020 election and dropped six seats, partially blamed on the party’s confidence and supply agreement with Fine Gael.The 2020 election had become do or die for Martin, whose Cork South-Central constituency will now be home to three Cabinet members - himself as Taoiseach, his party colleague Michael McGrath and former tánaiste Simon Coveney.The first Cork Taoiseach for 41 years since Jack Lynch, he has been a TD since 1989, served on Fianna Fáil’s front bench since 1995 and held four senior government portfolios during the party’s time in office - foreign affairs, health, education and enterprise.Single-minded and driven with a huge work ethic, the pragmatic Martin can be sensitive to criticism. A good media performer he is however seen by some within the party as distant and colleagues are hoping that communications within the party will improve.Health conscious and very proud of introducing the smoking ban in Ireland, he has pushed the Public Health (Alcohol) Act despite the reluctance of rural TDs within the party.Leo Varadkar, Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and EmploymentAfter a terrible election result and what appeared initially to be a guaranteed trip across the Dáil to the opposition benches, Leo Varadkar’s fortunes have been transformed along with those of his party.His calm and assured leadership performance through the coronavirus pandemic combined with a lengthy stalemate over coalition formation talks have resulted in Fine Gael soaring from losers to clear victors in the opinion polls and with Varadkar moving from spent political force back to key player.Nobody has batted an eyelid at the fact that he will preside over the party’s abandonment of its Civil War stance after a century and move into a historic government coalition with Fianna Fáil and the Green Party.Even less remarked on has been his demotion to Tánaiste for over two years as Fine Gael participates in the previously vilified notion of rotating taoiseach. But he also leads his party into an unprecedented third term in office.A social agenda trailblazer, he is Ireland’s first openly gay minister, the State’s youngest taoiseach and is now Tánaiste. The son of an Irish mother and Indian father, his qualification as a doctor helped during the pandemic and assured him of good publicity when he decided to re-register as a medic and said he would do half a day a week on the helpline for people who suspected they had the Covid-19 virus.Never one to shy away from a photo opportunity, the 41-year-old was also the first taoiseach to assiduously use social media to push his message and his carefully cultivated image. And he got into the much discussed habit during lockdown of quoting a variety of books, films and other media in his speeches.He has also used his speeches to throw out provocative messages reflecting his economic views including his oft quoted controversial remark that Fine Gael should represent those who “get up early in the morning”.He previously served as minister for social protection, for transport and for health and now moves into the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. But it remains to be seen if he will innovate rather than merely manage as he was perceived to have done in his previous portfolios.Michael McGrath - Minister for Public Expenditure and ReformWhen political heavy hitter Michael McGrath (43) became Fianna Fáil’s finance spokesman, then minister for finance Michael Noonan pronounced that the accountant had a big future ahead of him in politics.That future has finally arrived for the Cork South-Central TD who has been finance spokesman since 2011, when Fine Gael was in coalition with Labour and again when Fine Gael relied on Independents and Fianna Fáil’s confidence and supply arrangement.First elected to the Dáil in 2007 he has retained his seat at each subsequent election. It has been a long road for the man who will finally take the helm at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.A constituency rival and colleague of his party leader he is seen as a potential successor, is well liked by his party colleagues and has a well-oiled constituency machine.Originally from Passage West but now living in Carrigaline with his wife Sarah O’Brien and seven children, he secured a first-class honours commerce degree in UCC and qualified as a chartered accountant with KPMG in Cork City.A central member of the party’s negotiating team in the government formation talks, he is a low-key, calm and effective spokesman.Stephen Donnelly - Minister for HealthThe appointment of Stephen Donnelly to Cabinet makes it two Ministers for Health in a row for his Wicklow constituency taking the baton from Simon Harris. It is a job often seen as a political crucifixion for the holder.Elected to the Dáil as an Independent on his first attempt in 2011, he went on to form the Social Democrats with Róisín Shortall and Catherine Murphy in 2015 and surged to a poll-topping performance in Wicklow in 2016.Shortly afterwards however, he left the party following disagreements with his co-leaders.In the Dáil he has since had a number of disagreements with the Social Democrats on the much lauded Sláintecare plan and all eyes will be keenly watching how he deals with the much debated health roadmap.After a short second  as an Independent he joined Fianna Fáil in 2017. While party leader Micheál Martin saw his recruitment as a major coup, his arrival left many noses out of joint in Fianna Fáil. Those tensions and the move, appeared to dent his 2020 election chances but he was elected on the 15th count.Darragh O’Brien, Minister for Housing, Local Government and HeritageAnother member of the Fianna Fáil negotiating team to get a seat at the big table Darragh O’Brien (45) becomes Minister for Housing in the new three-party Government.Party spokesman on housing, planning and local government in the last Dáil, he was first elected to the Dáil in 2007. He lost out in the 2011 decimation of the party in the economic recession. He became one of 51 party TDs to be defeated at the hands of angry voters. He successfully ran for the Seanad that year on the Labour panel and became Seanad leader, keeping a place in the Oireachtas.But his Dáil defeat had a salutary effect, resulting in him building up a strong constituency base with his brother as a local councillor. It may have contributed to local party tensions with Dublin Fingal colleague Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee.He went on to top the poll in Dublin Fingal in the 2016 general election.Before entering politics he worked in the financial services sector for 15 years as an area manager with Life Assurance Company.He was elected to Fingal County Council in 2004 before successfully contesting a Dáil seat in 2007.He is married with a young family.Barry Cowen, Minister for Agriculture and the MarineThe no-nonsense Fianna Fáil spokesman on public expenditure and reform Barry Cowen (52) has been appointed Minister for Agriculture. The man who sealed the fate of the water charges in the 2016 government formation negotiations, was again a key member of the negotiating team this time round.The 2016 talks led to the confidence and supply arrangement with Fine Gael but left Fianna Fáil out of government. The intense five-week\u0026nbspcampaign in 2020 led to government and the reward of a seat at the top table for the Clara, Co Offaly native.A brother of former taoiseach Brian Cowen he has been spokesman in a number of portfolios since his election to the Dáil in 2011. As well as spokesman on public expenditure and reform he also held the position of spokesman on environment and local government and on social protection.A married father of four, he was first elected to Offaly county council in 1999, where he served until his election to the Dáil to the seat vacated by his brother.A member of the Cowen family has represented Offaly in the Dáil continuously since 1977. His father Bernard Cowen was elected in 1969 but lost his seat in 1973. He regained it in 1977 and held it until his death in 1984.Norma Foley, Minister for EducationKerry TD Norma Foley, who nominated her party leader Micheál Martin to be Taoiseach has been appointed Minister for Education, five months after her election to the Dáil for the first time.Martin is said to prefer TDs to have done at least a term on the backbenches but the new TD who is a teacher by profession, has shown herself to be an impressive performer and has been effective at the Covid-19 committee in the questioning of witnesses. Calm, courteous and well prepared, she has a great grasp of detail and the bigger picture.The Tralee native took the fifth and final seat in the general election in Kerry, edging out her running mate and outgoing TD John Brassil.It is her second run at the Dáil, having been on the Fianna Fáil ticket in the 2007 election, when she was selected over Brassil.Since 2004, Foley has represented the people of Tralee Municipal District on Kerry County Council, topping the poll in last May’s local elections.She has also served on Tralee Town Council, and held the position of mayor of Tralee on three occasions, most recently in 20172018. In 20182019 she served as mayor of Kerry.She is the daughter of the late Denis Foley, who served as a TD for the constituency for 18 years, broken up by a three-year stint as a senator. He was named as the holder of an undisclosed offshore Ansbacher account.She is married to fellow teacher Denis Maguire.Simon Coveney, Minister for Foreign Affairs and DefenceHe may have lost his role as tánaiste but Simon Coveney (48) has retained the much coveted position of Minister for Foreign Affairs. Greatly admired by departmental staff as probably the hardest working minister in that portfolio, he has received much acclaim for his efforts in dealing with Brexit and is seen as the driving political force in Ireland securing its temporary seat on the United Nations Security Council.Loved by the party’s grassroots and accessible to TDs and Senators, he still retains ambitions to be party leader and is seen as likely to get there. A cautious and moderate politician, his tearaway teenage years when he was expelled from Clongowes school for drinking and partying, before being asked back – are at odds with his later serious image.From Cork’s so-called merchant class and a keen rugby and sailing fan, he has a degree in agriculture and land management and was catapulted into the world of politics following the death of his father Hugh, a TD and former minister, in 1998.He later successfully ran for the European Parliament in 2004 but returned to Ireland for the 2007 general election and he has successfully retained his seat since. He served as minister for agriculture for all five years of the Enda Kenny-led administration from 2011 later adding defence to his portfolio when Eamon Gilmore resigned as tánaiste.From 2016 he spent just a year as minister for housing, when his pledge to end all emergency hotel and B\u0026ampB\u0026nbspaccommodation backfired, before he moved to the hallowed halls of the Department of Foreign Affairs.Seen as open in his approach and meticulous in his work practices, he has risen solidly and steadily through the party’s ranks and his experience in Brexit talks paved the way for his central role in the government formation talks.Paschal Donohoe, Minister for FinanceAs soon as Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe confirmed he was putting his name forward as a unity candidate for the presidency of the Eurogroup, it was clear he was confident of returning to his office in Merrion Street.Ever cautious and highly political he would have been slow to put his reputation on the line without some assurance of keeping his own job while he applied for the top spot in the influential club of finance ministers from countries that use the euro.The deadline for that role came a day before the outcome of the vote on the programme for government.He is highly popular within the party although less so after his poison chalice position as director of elections for both the Dáil and Seanad elections.The electorate proved less than happy with the party’s budgetary and spending policies and Fine Gael lost 12 Dáil seats. It was also embarrassed by the failure to have any women elected to the Upper House.Nine years a TD for Dublin Central, the 45-year-old has held the finance portfolio since 2017. He previously served as a minister of state and then as minister for transport.A central member of the party’s leadership and key to the government formation talks he is viewed as culturally one of the more rounded Cabinet members with an interest in books, film and theatre.The former sales manager with a multinational firm will need all his skills as a party persuader and negotiator to navigate the traumatic economic conditions facing the State while keeping faith with his wary Fianna Fáil and suspicious Green Party colleagues.He will be happy to leave his one stated regret – not managing to control the costs of the new national children’s hospital – to Fianna Fáil’s Michael McGrath who takes up the re-ided Department of Public Expenditure and Reform portfolio.He is married with two children and lives in Phibsborough, Dublin.Heather Humphreys, Minister for Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the IslandsOne of the Ministers always seen as sure of keeping her seat at the cabinet table, Heather Humphreys fits the criteria for geography, gender and ability.A border-county TD, she was the first woman elected to the Cavan-Monaghan constituency in 2011, when she took over from fellow Presbyterian Fine Gael colleague Seymour Crawford.Now in her third Dáil term and one of three female TDs in the five-seat constituency, she is highly regarded within Fine Gael and viewed as capable and a safe pair of hands.A first-term backbench TD when she was appointed to cabinet in 2011 as minister for arts, heritage and the Gaeltacht she won plaudits for her stewardship of the successful 1916 Rising centenary commemorations.A loyal ally of former taoiseach Enda Kenny she was re-appointed to the portfolio by him in 2016 but was one of the first Ministers to declare her support for Leo Varadkar in the 2017 leadership contest.He promoted her to the Business, Enterprise and Innovation portfolio in 2017 following the resignation of tánaiste Frances Fitzgerald.A business background through her work with Ulster Bank and as manager of Cootehill Credit Union also helped secure her appointment. The coronavirus pandemic brought her biggest political challenge with the crisis facing thousands of businesses and leaving a 25 per cent unemployment rate. Grant and income support schemes, loans and other initiatives have helped cushion the initial blow.The Government will now have to deal with the fallout from a controversial High Court judgment striking out a sectoral employment order and ruling that she had acted outside her powers in making the order for the electrical industry.Her career in finance, experience as minister for business and farming background in Co Monaghan, where she is married with two adult daughters, make her a good candidate for the rural development portfolio.Elected for the first time in the 2011 general election, she lives in Aghabog, near Monaghan town, and her family is from the Cavan-Monaghan border area.Helen McEntee, Minister for JusticeA reserved but smart politician Helen McEntee (33) from Castletown, Co Meath, has been a TD since 2013 when she won the byelection following the death of her father Shane McEntee.Minister of State for European Affairs since 2017, the Meath East TD proved her mettle in the ever present and fraught Brexit crisis, leading the Government’s response on a number of related issues.She has been described as Leo Varadkar’s “secret weapon” and is considered level-headed and a very good negotiator. Former president of the European Council Donald Tusk called her “diligent” and an “exceptional diplomat”. She is one of 10 vice-presidents of the European People’s Party, Fine Gael’s centre-right representative grouping in the EU.Graduating from DCU in 2007 having studied law, politics and economics, she worked briefly in a Citibank subsidiary. She later completed a masters in journalism and communications and worked with her father in Leinster House, first in opposition and then when he was appointed minister of state.A supporter of Varadkar’s from the start she has been by his side throughout the Brexit crisis and has a keen understanding of its intricacies and complexities.Simon Harris, Minister for Higher Education, Innovation and ScienceDespite his increased stature during the coronavirus pandemic as minister for health Simon Harris (33) became a focus of increasing speculation in recent days that he would be demoted from Cabinet.In the fateful 2017 Fine Gael leadership campaign he took sides early on in favour of Simon Coveney as opposed to Varadkar but held onto the health portfolio Kenny appointed him to in 2016.Described as the “teenage” minister when first appointed to the hugely significant but poison chalice department, he has visibly aged in the past three months through the stresses of the Covid-19 crisis.He remained a popular choice in his Wicklow constituency in the election despite concerns about a shortage of hospital beds, the spiralling cost of the new national children’s hospital and the recruitment and retention difficulties around healthcare staff.Those issues disappeared during the pandemic with the unprecedented takeover of all private hospitals and the return home of emigrant doctors and nurses to assist with the crisis.These problems have re-emerged but are no longer an issue for Harris as he moves on from the department described as a war zone.A social media expert, he is one of the party’s top media performers, assured and persuasive in his delivery, accessible and generally guaranteed to avoid political gaffes.He first became engaged in politics while campaigning for his younger brother and other children with autism. He topped the poll in the local elections and secured the highest vote in the country through his social media campaign.While a councillor, he approached then Seanad leader Frances Fitzgerald, became her parliamentary assistant and moved into Leinster House politics from there.Viewed as having an uneasy relationship with his party leader he is far from the inner circle. He is married with one child and lives in Greystones, Co Wicklow.Eamon Ryan - Minister for Climate Action, Communications Networks and TransportIt has been a torrid few months for Green Party leader Eamon Ryan (56) as he enters Government with a deeply scarred and ided party.In all the controversy the spectacular success in winning 12 seats in the general election has been all but forgotten.Now appointed to his long sought role in climate action and transport he will have little time to relish the challenge as he bids to heal the schism within the party.It is a reflection of the party’s isions that when he was mired in controversy after repeating a racial slur in the Dáil that it took a minister from another party, Charlie Flanagan of Fine Gael to publicly defend the Dublin Bay South TD by saying he did not have a racist bone in his body.But through all the accusations, insults and recriminations he has been calm, conciliatory and with party deputy leader Catherine Martin has persuaded the party’s membership to decisively back an unprecedented government with Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.He now faces a leadership contest against his deputy leader but has remained sanguine about the prospect.An impassioned speaker prone to gaffes, including a call during the election campaign for the re-introduction of wolves, he nonetheless led a team to rebuild the party after its disastrous first foray into coalition government after which it lost all six Dáil seats.A councillor before his 2007 election to the Dáil he previously ran a bicycle shop and cycling holiday business.He is married to journalist Victoria White and they have four sons.Catherine Martin - Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the GaeltachtDublin Rathdown TD and deputy Green party leader Catherine Martin (47) emerged as a surprising contender for the top job in the party.Her stance on coalition has strained the previously close working relationship with Eamon Ryan but his move to appoint her as lead negotiator in the coalition talks was seen as an inspired move.Cautious by nature, she is said to seek advice widely and does not say things lightly. Some in her party are said to find it hard to gauge where she stands and those on the other side of the negotiating table have described her as an enigma.As an influential voice in the party she will have a significant role in attempting to heal the party’s schism.From her first days in the Dáil she forged good relations across all parties and founded the Irish Women’s Parliamentary Caucus in the Oireachtas, pressed for anti-bullying protocols in the Leinster House campus.From Carrickmacross, Co Monaghan she trained as a classical singer and after graduating from NUI Maynooth, she taught music and English at St Tiernan’s Community School in Ballinteer.Her initial foray into politics was when she was co-opted to her brother Vincent P Martin’s council seat in Monaghan in the 1990s. She returned to politics in Dublin, was elected as a councillor in 2014 and came from nowhere to win a Dáil seat in 2016.Her husband Francis Noel Duffy became a TD in 2020 and took an opposing view in rejecting the coalition deal. The couple has three children.Roderic O’Gorman - Minister for Children, Disability, Equality and IntegrationLong predicted to make the high table Roderic O’Gorman (38) is one of the Green party’s most experienced politicians. His victory in the 2020 general election marked his 10th foray in 15 years including four general elections, two byelections and four local elections. The party’s justice and equality spokesman he was on the negotiating team and insisted in the talks that the coalition must make a commitment to end direct provision.A former chairman of the party he served from 2011 to 2019.From Tyrellstown he lives with his partner Ray Healy in Blanchardstown. A lecturer at the Brexit Institute and School of Law and Government in DCU he is a graduate of Trinity College and the London School of Economics.Close to both party leader Ryan and deputy leader Martin he is courteous, considered and reflective in his deliberations and well regarded across the party. He is a fan of TV shows West Wing, Game of Thrones and Arrested Development.Hildegarde Naughton - Minister of State at the Department of Climate Action, she will be attending CabinetOne of the survivors of the electoral cull of Fine Gael TDs, Hildegarde Naughton (43) has consistently grown in experience and stature since she first arrived on the political stage in 2009.That was the year the former schoolteacher was first elected to Galway City Council, becoming mayor two years later. Mentored and promoted by then taoiseach Enda Kenny, the Galway West TD was appointed to the Seanad in 2013.In 2016 she seized the chance to get on the Fine Gael ticket in the general election after Barry Walsh stepped aside from politics on health grounds.Chair of the Oireachtas Committee for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment in the last Dáil she fought the green fight in an uphill and forthright battle to persuade many reluctant party colleagues to the cause and has been Fine Gael’s leading environmentalist.That role, that experience and her capability has brought her to the Cabinet table - along with the need to have some gender balance at cabinet and take account of geographical considerations.Outside politics she is a talented singer who has performed and won awards for her roles in musical theatre. While a senator she established a group called Bel Canto with two other sopranos, who sang at charity events. She has described her musical interest as “my golf”.Pippa Hackett, “Super Junior” Minister of StateGreen Party Senator Pippa Hackett’s appointment as a “Super Junior” Minister of State is the first appointment of a Senator to Cabinet since the early 1980s.She takes on the role of Minister of State for Agriculture with responsibility for land use and bioersity.Her appointment has taken some by surprise amid speculation that someone among the party’s TDs might be selected.A farmer from Offaly and the party’s agriculture spokeswoman, she was elected to the Seanad in a byelection in November when a vacancy arose following the election of then Senator Grace O’Sullivan to the European parliament.But the move is as much a surprise because it is virtually unprecedented.The last time a Senator took on a ministerial role was in 1981 when then taoiseach Garrett FitzGerald nominated Senator James Dooge as minister for foreign affairs, a portfolio he held for a year.A vocal supporter of the programme for government, Hackett was elected unopposed to the agricultural panel in the Seanad when the other parties opted not to contest the seat.Formerly an Offaly county councillor she lost out in the general election for the Laois-Offaly constituency when she was eliminated in the final round.Originally from Ballandine, Co Mayo she is married with four children and lives in Edenderry, Co Offaly.Dara Calleary - Chief whipNew Government chief whip Dara Calleary has Fianna Fáil in his DNA. The Mayo TD who has been in the Dáil since 2007 and is the son of late TD and former minister of state Sean Calleary who served in the Dáil from 1973 to 1992. His grandfather Phelim was TD for Mayo from 1952 to 1969.Affable and steady, popular with party colleagues he is deputy leader and viewed as a safe pair of hands.He has had a previous taste of government when he served as minister of state for labour affairs and public service transformation from 2009 to 2011 in the Fianna Fáil, Green Party coalition.A graduate of Trinity College with a degree in business and politics he has served as the party’s spokesman on justice, equality and defence, as well as spokesman on jobs, enterprise and innovation.Paul Gallagher SC, Attorney GeneralThis will be Paul Gallagher’s second time in the job, having previously served from 2007 to 2011. During his first term, he was called to offer legal advice on some of the biggest issues ever to face an Irish government, including the bank guarantee scheme, the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency and the International Monetary Fund Troika programme.He is regarded as one of Ireland’s top barristers, with a fearsome work ethic."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"More than 75,000 evacuated in southern region after landslides and torrential rainZheng Yanxiong will work with police to stamp out pro-democracy demonstrationsNorth Korea claims to have no cases of Covid-19 despite links with ChinaBeijing enraged at plan to help up to 3m residents in fallout over national security lawAt least nine charged under Chinese law that critics say strips Hong Kong of rights and freedomsLaw will punish crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusionHot and bothered commuters refuse to wear masks on public transportTesting blitz as recent jump in infections in Australia stokes fears of second waveHistoric move will allow authorities to crack down on subversive and secessionist activityRisks of viruses crossing species barrier into humans in densely populated regions highlightedWashington plans to target Chinese officials undermining Asian financial hub autonomyJustin Trudeau called on Beijing to cease the \u0026lsquoarbitrary detention\u0026rsquo of two CanadiansMany were struck as they were planting seeds across Bihar state in east of countryThe decades-long project sees a constellation of 35 satellites circling the Earth to rival the US-owned Global Positioning System (GPS)Regime rows back on threat to deploy troops near border amid rising tensionsOfficials prepare \u0026lsquoretaliatory punishment\u0026rsquo after anti-North balloons arrived from SouthBan on cruise ships extended beyond June 30th cases increase as more citizens return homeCovid-19 outbreak in staff at Tyson foods in Arkansas sparks Beijing U-turn on policyChina says draft law is aimed at separatist activity, subversion, terrorism and collusion abroadSamira Imin\u0026rsquos father was incarcerated for three years in XinjiangStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4296620.1593938124!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus iran makes wearing masks compulsory","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIranian President Hassan Rouhani (C) wearing face mask while talking to Iranian officials. Photograph: EPAIranians who do not wear masks will be denied state services and workplaces that fail to comply with health protocols will be shut for a week, Iranian president Hassan Rouhani said on Saturday as he launched new measures to try to curb the coronavirus.Iran has been battling the spread of the coronavirus, with the total number of cases hitting 237,878 on Saturday and a further 148 deaths bringing the country’s toll to 11,408, Health Ministry spokeswoman Sima Sadat Lari said on state television.It comes as the number of cases worldwide have passed 11.2 million, according to Johns Hopkins University. Wearing masks becomes mandatory from Sunday in covered public places, Mr Rouhani said on state television after tougher curbs were imposed in cities and towns in five provinces where the outbreak is rising after an easing of lockdowns from mid-April.“Government employees should not serve people who do not wear masks and employees who do not wear them should be considered absentees and sent home,” said Mr Rouhani.And a government website published photos of Rouhani, who is rarely seen wearing a mask, with a face covering. Those infected have a “religious duty” to notify others, Rouhani said, adding: “Keeping your infection a secret violates the rights of other people”.BoliviaThe rising toll of Covid-19 deaths is overwhelming the Bolivian city of Cochabamba, where desperate relatives of one apparent victim of the pandemic left his coffin in the street for several hours to protest against difficulties in getting him buried.Neighbour Remberto Arnez said the 62-year-old man had died on Sunday and his body had been in his home ever since, “but that’s risky because of the possible contagion”.After a few hours, funeral workers turned up and took the coffin to a cemetery.Police Colonel Ivan Rojas told a news conference that the city is collecting “about 17 bodies a day.“This is collapsing the police personnel and funeral workers” in the city of some 630,000 people.“The crematorium oven is small, that that is where the bodies are collecting,” said national Labour Minister Oscar Mercado, who told reporters that officials were preparing 250 new burial plots in the city’s main cemetery.The Andean nation has reported 36,818 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 1,320 deaths.United StatesFlorida has reported a record number of coronavirus cases in the latest sign that the virus is surging in many parts of the United States, casting a pall over Fourth of July celebrations.Officials and health authorities warned people to take precautions or simply stay home on Independence Day, as confirmed cases are climbing in 40 states.The US set another daily record on Friday with 52,300 newly reported infections, according to the tally kept by Johns Hopkins University that is widely thought to be an undercount.Florida reported 11,445 confirmed infections on Saturday, bringing the statewide total to more than 190,000.Alabama this week also set a record for infections reported in a day, with more than 1,700 new confirmed cases recorded on Thursday, and state health officials worried that the holiday weekend could lead to the type of spike that followed Memorial Day weekend.The sobering updates came as local officials and health experts across the country tried to minimise opportunities for the virus to continue spreading on a holiday weekend typically spent swimming, eating at garden gatherings or crowding elbow-to-elbow to view parades and fireworks shows.Many communities cancelled those events and cautioned people against gathering on their own.In Florida, bars statewide are shut down and some regional attractions, such as Zoo Miami and Jungle Island, have closed.Officials in south Florida — including in Miami-Dade County and the Florida Keys — closed beaches through the weekend.In Britain on Saturday, some signs of normalcy returned with pubs and barbers reopening for the first time in months.But other countries continued to report record highs in new confirmed cases, including South Africa and India.

Some hairdressers were reported to have opened at the stroke of midnight.The Holland Tringham pub in south London, part of the JD Wetherspoon chain, opened at 8am and was about three-quarters full by 11.20am.“It’s beautiful just to get back and have a pint,” said Jim Martin, a 56-year-old carpenter.Julie Scott, a 43-year-old teacher, was there with her family for drinks and food.“I think it’s just where everyone gets to socialise and catch up with people that they haven’t seen...it’s nice to just get together,” she said.Others complained that the lockdown, which began in late March and has been gradually eased in recent weeks, had lasted too long.“It’s about time they opened them up,” said pensioner Ron Lock.Police chiefs are worried the reopening of pubs could fuel drunken and irresponsible behaviour, while hospitals have been warned to prepare for a New Year’s Eve-style weekend.“There’s an element of decompression going on, particularly with younger people who’ve had some very responsible parents keeping them in over recent weeks,” Marc Jones, Police and Crime Commissioner for Lincolnshire, told BBC radio.One pub near Ashford in Kent opened despite a car crashing into its front in the early hours of Saturday morning.The Swan Inn at Little Chart, near Ashford in Kent, was still serving pints to customers outside despite the landlord being woken by the devastation at around 2am on Saturday. Ray Perkins told the PA news agency: “It was absolutely devastating because obviously we were opening today. “We’ve had everybody rally round and clear up the bar, every single glass has had to be washed again.” He added: “We’ve got open, we’ve managed to open the pub – not inside, only outside.”In another relaxation of lockdown rules two households can now meet indoors as long as social distancing is maintained, and overnight stays are allowed.The rule changes apply only to England as Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have been setting their own timetables for easing lockdown restrictions.On Saturday evening, the UK’s department of health and social care said a further 67 people had died having tested positive for Covid-19.British prime minister Boris Johnson called on people to behave responsibly and respect social distancing regulations as the risk of a resurgence of coronavirus remains. Mindful of an economy that has taken a hammering because of the lockdown, he also stressed the importance of supporting businesses.“The success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly,” he said at a news conference on Friday. “We must not let them down.”Pub-goers will find the atmosphere rather different from the usual Saturday-night scrum.Numbers are limited, no one can stand at the bar and there will be no live music. Patrons will also have to give their details to allow tracers to identify them if anyone later tests positive.Wetherspoons, which is one of the UK’s biggest chains, said it had invested £11 million (€12.2m) in safety measures.It is not taking bookings, but said at busy times numbers would be controlled by staff. – ReutersEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4294866.1593715662!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the abrupt end to brexit talks is not only surprising but perplexing","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBoris Johnson: Has the immediate political scope to move either way on the negotiations. Photograph:   Will OliverEPABut the language on both sides was restrained and Frost’s had none of the belligerence that often characterises his rhetoric towards Brussels. The fact that Barnier chose not to give a press conference was seen by some as another happy augury but it was in fact simply an act of deference towards Angela Merkel and Ursula von der Leyen, who were giving a joint press conference later.Before this week’s talks began, the EU told Britain it was ready to compromise in order to accommodate the red lines Boris Johnson identified in a video conference last month with the presidents of the European institutions.“The EU side had listened carefully to UK prime minister Boris Johnson’s statements in recent weeks, in particular, his request to reach a political agreement quickly, and his red lines: no role for the European Court of Justice in the UK no obligation for the UK to continue to be bound by EU law and an agreement on fisheries that shows Brexit makes a real difference,” Barnier said on Thursday.The Europeans hoped that Britain would respond with a step towards compromise of its own but by the time the talks ended on Thursday, Frost had produced no such offer. During the course of the week, it became clear that unless Britain makes a substantial move within days, there will be no significant progress this month.Judgment callJohnson this week named Frost as his next national security adviser and the chief negotiator’s word carries a rare level of authority in Downing Street. Last October, he successfully urged Johnson to accept the revised withdrawal agreement as the best available deal. He faces a similar judgment call today.The British red lines Barnier spoke about on Thursday are those Johnson identified in last month’s conference call. The two sides are also at odds over the governance structure but Johnson did not mention it on the call and British misgivings about signing up to a single overarching agreement have diminished. Some within the government recognise that it offers opportunities as well as risks.The issue of fisheries is highly charged politically on both sides but neither views a compromise as impossible. Although Britain rejects the concept of binding “level playing field” commitments, it will agree to maintain current employment, environmental and consumer standards.The toughest issue is state aid, with the EU calling for Britain to continue to follow EU rules on a continuing basis. This is problematic for Britain both because it limits the country’s freedom to subsidise indigenous industry and because it would give the ECJ a role in British economic policy.One obstacle in the way of a compromise is the fact that Britain has not yet set out plans for how it wants its own state aid regime to operate after the end of the transition period on December 31st. This leaves the EU unable to evaluate how a system of parallel state aid regimes would work, with both sides agreeing guidelines but regulating separately.While the British accuse the Europeans of being too legalistic, the Europeans complain about British amateurishness. But both sides agree that Johnson wants a deal and that he would like to get it as soon as possible.At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, there was talk around Westminster and Whitehall about how the crisis could reduce – or at least obscure – the impact of failure to agree a deal with the EU. But few now talk about the disruption of a no-deal outcome being lost within the greater disruption caused by coronavirus.Cost of no-dealBank of England governor Andrew Bailey said last week that the British government could have struggled to fund itself if the bank had not intervened with £200 billion of quantitative easing to buy government debt. The cost of a no-deal outcome to the EU talks, on top of the ballooning cost of the coronavirus crisis, would test either Bailey’s patience\u0026nbspor his credibility when he insists the bank is not underwriting the British government’s debt.Donald Trump’s declining political fortunes are also driving Johnson towards an EU deal as he prepares to deal with Joe Biden, a multilateralist whose advisers see Brexit as an expression of right-wing populism. As Suzanne Lynch has reported, Biden and his team are also acutely sensitive to any risk to the peace process and will monitor closely Britain’s implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol.Despite the fall in his approval ratings, Johnson remains in a very strong position with an 80-seat majority in parliament and no prospect of a general election until 2024. He has the immediate political scope to move either way on the negotiations but failure to reach a deal with the EU will make it harder for him to fulfil his government’s domestic agenda and to make a success of Brexit.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this. The issue may become a headache for the Democratic Party as the primary process progresses."},{"url":null,"title":"local lockdown qa put questions daniel capurro paul nuki","story":"As Leicester became the first city to be placed under a local lockdown on Monday, many have been left wondering whether other areas of the UK could also be heading towards renewed lockdown restrictions.Government sources have told The  that the northern towns of Barnsley, Oldham and Rochdale and the city of Bradford, along with Bedford, are all at risk of being placed under a local lockdown to help reduce rising infection rates. But how does the Government identify which regions could be placed under a local lockdown?

Can I see some BBC researchers waving at the back of the room? Welcome to the world as some of us have known it for a long time.There is nothing at all surprising here: this is just what happens to pretty much any protest that grabs the public imagination. All it takes is a flurry of headlines and a few choice spots on the broadcast news and your cause is a prime candidate for infiltration by the people who attach the same label to everything that attracts socially acceptable opprobrium: all forms of injustice, suffering or potential damage can be attributed to the original sin of capitalism (or imperialism which is just an export version of the profit motive).This process of infiltration has been the deliberate policy of Leftwing militancy since my grandmother’s day. She was a Communist party member in the 1930s. As a sewing machine operator in the Jewish rag trade during the American Depression, she became a trade unionist and then a party activist. When my father was a boy, he was sent along to meetings of book clubs and community organisations with innocent-sounding apolitical names which were actually front groups designed to educate the young in the proper doctrine.He stopped attending, he once told me, when he realised that it was the same handful of people running all these various activities - and that the arguments they were pitching were pretty much identical in every context. Most of these organisations had, almost certainly, once been what their names still proclaimed them to be - promoters of local interests or pastimes - before they were hollowed out and turned into propaganda organs for what was then the Stalinst Soviet regime.By the time I reached my own youthful stage of political activism, the practice was called “entryism” and it was Trotsky who was the hero, not Stalin. But the principle was the same: not only were we advised to join and influence the direction of any influential new movement that appeared on the scene but even, if we were really up for lifelong dedication, to make a permanent professional commitment to the process.In New Left circles in the late 1960s and early 70s, it was commonplace for members of International Socialism (IS) which was the earlier incarnation of the Socialist Workers’ Party, to resign their membership in order to join Labour – because in those days, before James Callaghan changed the rules on entryism, you could not be a member of both at the same time. They would then run for the local council and exert as much control as possible over their borough’s political stance. (You may recall the Vietcong flags that occasionally flew over Labour town halls.)Other IS members we knew took on jobs as trade union officials, some of whom I believe remain in post. But most committed activists just stayed in whatever employment they could find that was reasonably congenial (there were lots of them in the print trades and in academic life) and gave over their spare time to the radical cause in any number of guises. So when I heard that Joshua Virasami, a leader and vociferous spokesman of the UK BLM movement, had declared that capitalism was terrorism, and that the police who represented state terrorism, should be defunded – and further, that he had previously chained himself to fellow activists outside a London airport on the grounds that global climate change was racist, I thought, ah yes... here we are again.Then came the scramble of various organisations that should have been less naive (or might at least have spent ten minutes doing some intensive Googling) to disassociate themselves from the more absurd demands being put forward in the name of BLM. The BBC – obviously – was most prominent, advising its presenters to est themselves of BLM badges on air. Then there were various Premier League football teams and some sports commentators from Sky television... well you know the rest.The whole phenomenon managed in the end to be both ludicrous and sad. It had begun with a genuinely tragic event which was eminently worthy of protest: the killing of an unarmed black man by a white policeman while fellow officers stood by and watched, even though it took place in another country, was so horrifying that public demonstrations of outrage seemed perfectly understandable. There was nothing unreasonable about George Floyd’s death being used as a symbol of bigotry and racial injustice throughout the world.It all went horribly wrong when the agitators moved in and started shooting their mouths off. But stupidity and incoherence and opportunism are always with us. The truly culpable players in this game are the tag-along media and celebrity hangers-on who are so guileless that they facilitate the corrupting of a legitimate protest movement by political manipulation. So what is this all about in the minds of those amateur – or professional – infiltrators?Surely they are not consciously malign: simply subverting good causes for the sheer hell of it? No reader, this is not just nihilism or puerile mischief. If you have bought the Marxist package (or the faux Marxist one that now seems to be the only version available) you actually, sincerely believe that capitalism – the profit motive – is the cause of every social tragedy.Instead of seeing free market economics as a great liberator – having delivered mass prosperity, and the self-determination which follows from it, on a scale that is unprecedented in human history – you regard it as the enslavement of one class (or race) by another. And if you honestly believe that, then you see it as your moral duty to make use of every vehicle available for telling this story to the benighted mob who have been tricked into a state of false consciousness by their exploiters. This is the great lie that made possible one of the most successful tyrannies in modern history. It still needs to be challenged and deconstructed over and over again.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid must not derail efforts tackle climate change","story":"The Covid-19 pandemic showed us that, when an emergency strikes suddenly, we can and should join forces – for example, to develop a new vaccine.While the climate emergency is one that has built up over time and cannot be addressed with a single treatment, countries around the World will need to work together to find solutions - because this is a global challenge.This week I participated in the first part of London Climate Action Week – a foretaste of what we can expect from COP26 in Glasgow, whose presidency the UK will be assuming in partnership with Italy, an EU member state.The London Climate Action Week showed us that, when there is a will, even a global pandemic cannot stop us from addressing other existential challenges.The participants did not all agree on everything. But they acknowledged the scale of the problems and many understand today that to overcome them, we need to work together.For the United Kingdom, the climate emergency is not new. Already as an EU member state, the UK was leading by example – it was the first major economy to enshrine in law the objective of ending its contribution to global warming by 2050.It always supported ambitious targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. And massive demonstrations , led by young people, showed the strength of grassroots’ engagement in this country and elsewhere.The UK’s foundational contribution to the EU’s Single Market, its excellence in research and its innovation in the digital economy are well known.Our British friends have reasons to be also proud of the pioneering drive in countering climate change head on.Today in the EU, we are united behind the idea that the green thread needs to run through all our policies - from transport to taxation, food to farming, industry to infrastructure.The European Green Deal was the first major initiative announced by President Ursula von der Leyen in December last year when she took the helm of the European Commission.And in March, we proposed to enshrine in law, the European Climate Law, the political commitment to transform Europe into the first climate neutral continent by 2050. Our post-Covid recovery plan, Next Generation EU, brings concrete ideas on how to harness additional funding in helping member states to achieve this ambition.The European Union will press on with all these initiatives. But we are very much aware that climate change knows no borders.Countries and people will remain connected by deep ties that bind our future, including how we decarbonise our economies and protect our societies from climate change.The EU and the UK, in particular given its crucial role as COP-26 President, should continue to lead on the path toward climate neutrality by ensuring a strong green dimension in the post-COVID recovery measures we are putting in place and by updating our emissions reduction targets for 2030.The UK now has an ambitious Global Britain agenda. The EU is one of the most important global actors. In addressing climate change and preserving the environment, we can work together: leading by our ambitions keeping the pressure on other global players who may be tempted to compromise for the sake of immediate economic gain being creative and open-minded in finding solutions where none seems obvious.Building on our joint efforts from the past, we need to work together for a future in which humanity will be able to live within nature’s boundaries, in a sustainable manner on our common home.João Vale de Almeida is the EU\u0027s  Ambassador to the UKMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pressure duke speak fbi without home office intervening","story":"Home Secretary Priti Patel is facing a diplomatic quandary after US prosecutors submitted a formal request for the Duke of York to speak to them about claims Maxwell trafficked young women for sex for Jeffrey Epstein.Their request was made through the filing of a Mutual Legal Assistance (MLA) to the Home Office, as part of an agreement allowing the US to seek help from the British authorities in a legal or criminal matter.But it is now understood the British Government is in favour of the stand-off between the Duke and the FBI being sorted out between the two parties, rather than by any ministerial intervention under a MLA.The Duke had a long friendship with Epstein and stayed at his homes, including Epstein’s mansion in New York and his home in the US Virgin Islands.Prosecutors believe he could have vital information as a witness rather than a suspect, although the Duke insists he never saw or suspected any wrongdoing in the times he stayed at Epstein’s homes.As a potential witness the Duke cannot be compelled to talk to the FBI, but the matter threatens to become deeply embarrassing for the Home Office following the submission of the MLA.Extradition expert Andrew Campbell-Tiech QC, head of Drystone Chambers, said: “I’m sure the Home Office would rather the two parties deal with it themselves without any ministerial involvement. The last thing they want is to find themselves caught between the Royal family on one side and the US authorities on the other. They do not want to navigate through that.”Ms Maxwell is accused of lying about Epstein’s sexual activities, including the recruitment of underage girls for sexual massages. The perjury allegations are the only charges brought against Ms Maxwell to date that relate to a period of time when the Duke knew Epstein.The more serious offences of child sex trafficking and grooming are alleged to have taken place between 1994 and 1997, two years before the Duke was introduced to Epstein.The alleged offences against one of the victims took place in London between 1994 and 1995, when she was under the age of 18.Campaign groups and lawyers representing victims of sex abuse have now called on the politan Police to mount their own investigation into the London allegations rather than just defer to US investigators.Harriet Wistrich, a solicitor and founder and director of  the Centre for Women’s Justice, said: “If there are offences that took place in London and the politan Police’s area then they should investigate them, if that is what the victims want.”Scotland Yard said it had liaised with other law enforcement organisations but had not received a formal request asking for assistance in connection with the allegations.US prosecutors said they would “welcome” the Duke’s testimony as part of the ongoing FBI investigation, with Audrey Strauss, acting US Attorney for the Southern District for New York, urging the Duke to come forward to be questioned.The Duke’s lawyers say they twice contacted the US Department of Justice in the past month but received no response. A source close to the Duke’s team said: “We’ve been in contact with the US Department of Justice saying we’re willing to offer assistance. The Duke has indicated his intention to cooperate with the investigation and the ball is now in their court.“There is still a dialogue going on and we are sure the Home Office would not want to intervene.”The Duke’s legal problems deepened on Friday after a new lawsuit from one of Epstein’s alleged victims was filed on Thursday.The civil claim against Epstein’s $630 million (£505 million) estate is being brought by Caroline Kaufman, now 26, who alleges that she was sexually abused by Epstein in 2010 when she was 17 at the financier’s New York mansion. She claims that she was raped while the Duke of York was visiting. The Duke claimed he had travelled to the US to cut ties with Epstein, who committed suicide last year in a new York cell while facing fresh charges.The lawsuit does not accuse the Duke of wrongdoing or of being aware of the alleged attack. He has previously said of Epstein, who died in prison last year: “At no stage during the limited time I spent with (Epstein) did I see, witness or suspect any behavior of the sort that subsequently led to his arrest and conviction.”Geoffrey Berman, who was controversially fired as US attorney for the Southern District of New York last month by the Trump administration, will appear at a congressional committee to answer questions. Mr Berman led the Maxwell investigation and publicly called for the Duke of York to speak to him a number of times, including claiming that the royal had been resisting the move. Mr Berman is due to spend hours giving testimony to the House Judiciary Committee next Thursday. Congressmen could seek to better understand why prosecutors are so keen to talk to the Duke and the full details of his legal team’s correspondence about giving an interview. A spokesman for the prosecutors at the Southern District of New York declined to comment on the question of Mutual Legal Assistance. The Home Office would not confirm or deny the existence of an MLA request.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"super saturday pictures lockdown ends pubs reopen","story":"Thrillseekers were out early today as \u0027Super Saturday\u0027 began and England\u0027s lockdown restrictions eased.

Our Taiwan-Hong Kong Office for Exchanges \u0026amp Services is dedicated to helping #HKers transition to a new life here in Taiwan,” tweeted Tsai Ing-wen, the Taiwanese president, on Friday. The announcement came on the same day that China’s top legislative body started drafting the controversial legislation, in an apparent rush to push through a law that bans subversion, separatism and acts of foreign interference, but which critics say will be used to crush dissent. Britain, which has accused China of violating a legally-binding joint declaration that guaranteed the city’s way of life until 2047, this week persuaded all G7 industrialised nations to sign a statement expressing deep concern about Beijing’s plans.The UK has also stepped up to offer up to 3 million Hong Kong holders of a “British National Overseas” passport a pathway to citizenship if the law goes ahead. In Hong Kong people are already making plans to take up offers of refuge. “I fear that Hong Kong is no longer a safe place to live anymore,” said a 23-year-old male clerk working at a political organisation, who wished to remain anonymous.  He said he was already processing the paperwork for his BNO passport.“My local passport doesn\u0027t safeguard my identity anymore,” he said, adding that he feared his political work would make him a target under the new law, possibly leading to his imprisonment. “The future of Hong Kong is definitely in despair. No matter which side you are with, either you’re fervently pro-democracy or loyal to the Communist Party, society remains deeply polarised. The ending for Hong Kong will be full of darkness,” he said. Ms Li, an airline worker in her forties, told The  that she was fearful enough about the law to urgently consider uprooting her entire life. “(The law) is another form of cultural revolution,” she said, adding that she and her fiancé would emigrate as soon as borders started to reopen after the pandemic. “I’m sorry to the youngsters. I don’t have their strength and guts to fight for Hong Kong.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Scientists have raised fresh questions over whether a coronavirus sample held for years in a Wuhan laboratory could have mutated naturally or via genetic experimentation to become the virus which causes Covid-19.Since the Sars pandemic in 2003, China-based researchers have been scouring bat-inhabited caves in the hope of tracking and analysing potential new coronaviruses, notably at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV).Among the most revered of these scientists is Dr Shi Zhengli, nicknamed “Bat Woman” by her colleagues – who in February co-authored the most extensive academic paper on the novel coronavirus up to that point.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIn addition to giving a full genetic description of the virus, Dr Shi’s paper – published in Nature – revealed that the WIV housed a sample of virus collected from bats named RaTG13, which it said was a 96.2 per cent match with the Covid-19 virus – the closest yet discovered.The scientific consensus has been that the two viruses are unlikely to be the same, with some estimates suggesting it could take between 20 and 50 years to make up the 4 per cent genetic difference.However, past research work carried out at VIW to improve the ability of pathogens to cause disease, known as “gain-of-function” research, has been documented in papers published between 2015 and 2017, described in one paper co-authored by Dr Shi as “virus infectivity experiments”.Johnson’s father defends trip to GreeceWomen’s lives at risk from ‘holes’ in abuse law National landmarks to light up in blue to celebrate NHS staff Flag-waving activists ridiculed for Scottish border ‘patrol’WHO reports record global rise in daily cases as pandemic intensifies While scientists also overwhelmingly believe the genetic code of Sars-Cov-2 suggests it has mutated naturally, and has not been engineered, others believe it should not be ruled out that the two viruses may once have been the same.The type of techniques required to turn RaTG13 into Sars-Cov-2 are “identical” to work previously carried out in Wuhan, alleges Professor Richard Ebright of Rutgers University’s Waksman Institute of Microbiology in New Jersey.“The very same techniques, the very same experimental strategies using RaTG13 as the starting point, would yield a virus essentially identical to Sars-Cov-2,” he told The Sunday Times.However, Professor Martin Hibberd of the London School of Hygiene \u0026amp Tropical Medicine contended that to do so would be “exceptionally difficult”, telling the paper that they “are not the same virus and I don’t think you can easily manipulate one into the other”.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I think that is a distinct possibility.”The origins of the RaTG13 sample held have also been placed under further scrutiny, with one of Dr Shi’s longstanding colleagues alleging that it was found in 2013 in a Chinese copper mine linked to the deaths of three men tasked with clearing bat faeces.While the cause of their deaths was linked to fungus found in the cave, tests carried out on four of the men found they all had antibodies against an unknown Sars-like coronavirus.Security agencies investigating coronavirus spread in Wuhan in OctoberIn 2012, Dr Shi and her team were reportedly called to the copper mine near Tongguan in the Mojiang region after six men fell ill with pneumonia-like symptoms.In a paper called “Coexistence of multiple coronaviruses in several bat colonies in an abandoned mineshaft” published in 2016, she and her colleagues wrote that of the 152 genetic sequences of coronavirus found in the mine, two were similar to that which had caused Sars. One was reportedly described as a “new strain” of Sars and called RaBtCoV4991.In claims backed up by a virus database published by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Peter Daszak, president of EcoHealth Alliance, who has searched for viruses with Dr Shi’s team for 15 years told The Sunday Times that the sample found in the mine, RaBtCoV4991, had been renamed RaTG13, adding: “It was just one of the 16,000 bats we sampled.“It was a faecal sample, we put it in a tube, put it in liquid nitrogen, took it back to the lab. We sequenced a short fragment.”Referencing the sample’s change of name since its discovery in 2013, he said: “The conspiracy folks are saying there’s something suspicious about the change in name, but the world has changed in six years – the coding system has changed.”While it is reported that what is believed to be the closest-known relation to the novel coronavirus was shelved in the Wuhan institute at that point as not being a close enough match to the Sars virus, scientists have questioned the likelihood of this scenario.Wuhan Institute of Virology\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Two of the stores – in Ross-on-Wye and Leominster – reopened on Monday 15 June.“Being able to shop in person, especially at smaller independents, is a joy,” owner Andy Rossiter, pictured above, says. “I think lockdown made a lot of people realise that they don’t want all their shopping to just land at their door, but booksellers also know they need to work hard for their audience. It’s not simply a case of just opening your doors.”Rossiter has been busy preparing the stores, moving fixtures and checkouts so that staff and customers can socially distance while browsing for books.Carry out a risk assessment: employers will need to carry out Covid-19 risk assessments in consultation with their workers or trade unions.Maintain social distancing: employers should redesign workspaces to maintain social distancing between people and stagger start times.Manage transmission risk:\u0026nbspemployers should look into putting barriers in shared spaces, creating workplace shift patterns or fixed teams.Reinforcing cleaning processes: workplaces should be cleaned more frequently, paying close attention to\u0026nbspdoor handles and keyboards.“We have installed Perspex screens at till points, bought hand sanitiser stations for the entrances to our stores and placed tape and signage throughout so we can clearly indicate the social distancing rules within our stores,” he says.From fashion stylist to farm hand: meet the people helping to harvestThe bookshops have reopened with less members of staff and they have limited their opening hours from their pre-lockdown seven days to just five. Rossiter has also been consulting staff and getting their input on the UK Government’s coronavirus advice.“Our trade body, the Booksellers Association, has been brilliant at reading and interpreting this advice to make it bookshop-specific and releasing it in digestible and accessible weekly bulletins, he says.“Booksellers love serving customers, and we’ve been serving our local community for a decade, so seeing those regulars again and having that relationship start to return to normal will be fantastic.Surinder Josan, owner of All Seasons DIY, a family-run shop, explains how he has used strict safe workplace measures to keep his shop doors open and his businesses afloat.“All Seasons DIY is a family-run shop which was established over 40 years ago, run by myself, my wife, and my mother. My son and daughter work in the shop around their university studies as well,” Josan, below, says.The family decided to shut the shop when school closures were announced. But after just a week they decided to reopen the business in order to serve the local community, who relied on the store for essential food and other items.“In order to reopen, we had to reassess how we both serve and interact with our customers,” Josan explains. “We adopted several new measures to comply with social distancing to keep both ourselves and our customers safe.”These new measures they adopted included safe distance markers outside the shop, to limit the number of people in store at any one time, installing screens at the checkout areas, encouraging contactless payments, lowering the minimum card spend to £1, and offering hand wipes to customers.“The number of customers who have come in and complimented us for it is unbelievable. They say when they come here they feel really safe,” Josan adds.Blend Coffee Co is an independent coffee shop based in Portslade, East Sussex, near Brighton. The two directors behind the business, Oli Crawley and Tom Jennion, have introduced a range of measures so they could confidently reopen for staff and customers.“Our primary concern is to keep people safe, so to make sure our coffee shop was ready to be reopened we implemented a number of safer working measures,” says Crawley.These new measures included a deep clean of the shop prior to reopening, implementation of a new ordering layout and adopting a new policy which stipulates that no customers are allowed inside the store.Working alongside Crawley and Jennion are a further three members of staff.“Only the directors returned to work to alleviate any pressure on our barista team feeling they need to work,” says Crawley. “This also allows an operational analysis of all our new protocols to ensure they are efficient and safe.”The checkout system has now been moved to the front of the shop, Blend now only accepts card payments and there is a new waiting area outside the shop.This plan was developed after we undertook a risk assessment and analysis of the premises to ensure that customer-staff interaction could be maintained and sustained in a safe manner. We ran a test prior to reopening to ensure that our new measures would work and allow us and our customers to stay safe,” adds Crawley.For further information from the UK Government on how employers, employees and the self-employed can return to work safely, click hereThis is Government advice for EnglandWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Concern has been raised over the reopening of pubs in London after scenes from Soho appeared to show people failing to observe social distancing rules.Numerous pictures and videos have been shared online of packed, crowded streets in the famous London district.One Twitter user wrote: “Just seen the scenes in Soho. It’s as if the health care workers who risked their lives trying to deal with the pandemic were just wasting their time.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAnother wrote: “Cycling through London tonight made me cry. Heaving with bodies \u0026amp puke, the continual sound of police sirens. The queues in Soho like when England win a match. And yet we didn’t win. We lost! People will always be trash. But none more so than the Tories. This is on them.”One man who passed through Soho told the Daily Mirror: “Walking down old Compton Street felt like wading through a Petri dish.”Police were present in the area, though it seems no attempts were made to disperse the crowds, which filled a number of streets closed off to cars.Large groups were also seen congregating in Notting Hill on Saturday night.The latest figures show the R rate range has risen above 1 in London – meaning cases of the virus could be growing again.In the capital, the range is thought to be between 0.8 and 1.1. Across the UK, the government says the estimated R number is between 0.7-0.9.On Friday, England’s chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, warned that “this virus is a long way from gone.Although ‘Super Saturday’ appears to have passed without any major incidents, there have been reports of disorder across the country.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As a result four arrests were made by officers and we supported licensees who chose to close their own premises.“No pubs have been closed by the police.“We’d like to thank the majority of the public who have acted responsibly throughout Saturday, especially whilst watching the much-anticipated Derby v Forest match.”Elsewhere, police in Essex claim to have made four arrests following a “disturbance” in Brentwood High Street.Special inspector Steve Weaver tweeted: “That didn’t last long. Disturbance in Brentwood High street assisted other units. 4 people arrested. 2 of my team have arrested and are currently on the way to custody.”Earlier on Saturday, the national chairman of the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra) said feedback from branches suggested up to half of pubs did not reopen on Saturday.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Dame Judi Dench and Joanna Lumley are among the stars who have today urged Londoners to bid on sections of Sir Peter Blake’s pop artwork Our Fans to raise money for Help the Hungry.Last Friday, The Independent announced that the giant mural — draped over the London Mandarin Oriental hotel in Knightsbridge during its 2017 renovation — would be cut into 100 sections and auctioned off.The work, which echoes Sir Peter’s famous 1967 artwork for The Beatles’ Sgt Pepper album, is his largest piece, the size of 38 London buses. Each section features a famous face, including Morgan Freeman, Whoopi Goldberg and Sir Paul McCartney, and is signed by Sir Peter, 87.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesProceeds will go to two beneficiaries, including The Independent\u0027s Help The Hungry Now appeal partner The Felix Project.Today, Ms Lumley said it was an “honour” to be part of the fundraising effort.

It is a fabulous way of making life worth living.”Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mDame Judi said: “How wonderful that Peter Blake’s amazing artwork will have a new lease of life for such good causes. I’m very glad that maybe my left eyebrow has gone to good use.”Italian actress Caterina Murino, who also stars in the work, said: “The world is upside down. We fight for our life, we fight for the life of our brothers, and this is the feeling I have when I contemplate Sir Peter Blake’s masterpiece!

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising. Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years. Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I would not be here if it wasn’t for this project,’ one helper saysWhat has it been like to volunteer during the pandemic? Social enterprise Bread n Butter – one of the charities supplied by our Help The Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project – closed its doors at the end of March.However, its founders saw a growing need among the city’s most vulnerable for regular home-cooked, nutritious meals, so they joined with community centres Stonegrove Community Trust and the Hive Trust.Since then, Bread n Butter’s team, aided by volunteers, have been cooking and delivering more than 1,000 meals a day to Londoners in need in Barnet, Enfield and Brent. Here, we speak to four people who keep this project going.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRichard Simon, a furloughed IT worker, joined the Stonegrove Community Trust’s OneStonegrove project in Edgware at his wife’s suggestion. The 52-year-old said: “Working in the kitchens was like being on Ready Steady Cook. You don’t know what ingredients you’re going to be working with, so you have to think on your feet.” The father of two, who dedicates 20 hours a week, added that the biggest thing he had learnt was the power of “working together”.“For a group of people who don’t know each other, we just get on with it, working flat out. No one is being paid, we’re just working for a great cause. It has been extraordinary.”How to support our campaignBid on Sir Peter Blake’s artwork in Help the Hungry auction, say stars4.3 million meals to be delivered as Help The Hungry appeal passes £7mJoanne Karbritz, 47, works up to five hours a day, four days a week at OneStonegrove community centre. The former Oxfam shop worker, who has high-functioning autism, said that because of her condition, having a “structured day” is incredibly important. “Without routine, I can’t cope,” she said. “I would not be here if it wasn’t for this project.”Ms Karbritz, who is also anorexic, said working with food had been transformative. “Working to create healthy, nutritious food everyday has changed my relationship with it. I have also learned how to cook, whereas before I lived out of tins.”Mariana Bassi Da Silva, a software developer, wanted to volunteer as she was not working due to the pandemic. A keen cook, the 34-year-old volunteered for OneStonegrove and said the project had helped develop her love of cooking. The Brazilian-Italian, who moved to London seven years ago, said the greatest impact the project has had on her was the sense of “belonging”.“It is hard to settle in when you move,” she said. “Here, I have a community.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Ten in the morning on the first day of pubs reopening since lockdown and in Sheffield’s most central Wetherspoon pub Connor Bowling and his two mates are already three pints deep, Full English full and considering ordering a round of Jagermeisters.“It’s early, but why not?” the 23-year-old gas engineer says. “It’s been a long three months.”Thus began the much-anticipated day on which, to paraphrase the prime minister, English people regained their ancient unalienable right to go out and drink. Fourth July: when the country’s pubs and bars reopened for the first time following 15 weeks and one day of coronavirus lockdown when the government told us: get to the boozer – the economy needs you.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhat had Bowling and his pals got planned in order to do their duty? “No plans,” he said, sat in The Sheffield Water Works Company. “Other than it getting messy.”Twelve hours later, with the night now in full swing, it seemed that, while plenty had similar aspirations, the weekend would not, in fact, be the booze-apocalypse many had feared.Sheffield was Saturday night busy – but only just. Roughly half of all pubs were shut – a figure in line with national reports – and few of those open had queues outside, despite social distancing rules meaning they were only able to cater for about 70 per cent normal capacity. Certainly, the lines did not compare to those which formed outside reopened barbers and hair salons in the morning and afternoon.Three pints deep at 10am as pub drinkers toast end to lockdown“I wonder what that says about people?” pondered 19-year-old Ria Hinchliffe in The Wick At Both Ends pub. “I’m having mine done on Tuesday.”A\u0026ampE figures and arrest numbers will come in due course. But on the streets and in the bars of this South Yorkshire city, this did not feel like the mass release of energy many had predicted. If social distancing wasn’t exactly being observed everywhere, nor perhaps was it being smashed to quite the extent one might expect following a 106 day shut down. Similar scenes were experienced in towns and cities across England, including Manchester and Newcastle, reports suggested.“People have been behaving really well, actually,” said Amy Locke, a bar manager at the city’s Forum bar. “Once you’re at a table, you’re not supposed to get up and mix with other people and we’ve had to ask a few people to stop doing that. I’ve felt a bit like a school teacher telling people to sit down but I think people understand why.”Among the changes from a pre-Covid world were hand-sanitiser on doors, Perspex screens on counters, more table service and music turned right down. Among the similarities were the odd lad still having an indiscrete wee in the odd doorway.“It’s actually quite civilised, isn’t it?” said Idony Lee – talking about the table service not the doorway misuse. “It reminds me of how people drink on the continent.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I’d rather know I’d enjoyed myself than stayed sat at home afraid of a virus.”She may have been 52 years younger but 19-year-old project coordinator Chloe Pownall, drinking in The Wick At Both Ends, felt something similar.“What are we going to do?” she asked. “Just stay in forever? Especially because I’m quite young, so I just think it’s worth the risk.”She was on a pint of Carling. How did it taste from the tap? “So, so good,” she said. “People look down at you for being a girl drinking pints. Couldn’t care less.”In London, earlier in the day, there had been a similar situation.John, a 66-year-old who lives in Putney and was enjoying a pint with a newspaper in the JJ Moon pub in Tooting Broadway, said: “This tastes a lot better out of a glass than it does out of a tin, that I can tell you.”While he said that the return to pubs pales in comparison with seeing his grandchildren after three months of shielding, he agreed that the renewed sense of community would offer a boost after the hardships of lockdown.“At the moment, where this pub’s concerned, it seems to be working out fine, but you can’t judge one pub by all pubs,” he said. “The way it is in here now, it’s quite modern. It’s not too hectic either. I’m quite happy with it.”Of whether pre-booking systems could affect the spontaneity of going for a drink, he added: “Possibly, it all depends how busy it is. Saturday night, a lot of people, in the event of a football match where it’s screened in certain pubs, that could take its toll. You’ll probably have a line-up about half a mile down the road waiting to get in to see the match.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Pubs in south London have reopened with more of an initial whimper than a bang, as the thirstiest punters were given a taste of the post-coronavirus reality facing one of the nation’s favourite habitats.Despite pubs being granted permission to start serving at 6am, there appeared little sign of the New Year’s Eve-esque “Super Saturday” hype forecast by many, with some establishments remaining shuttered after midday and others, on the face of it, appearing relatively empty.In Tooting, the queues outside hairdressers by far outstripped those outside favoured locals – an outcome that had been hinted at by Redfield \u0026amp Wilton polling for the BBC, which indicated just seven per cent of adults in England intended to visit a pub this weekend.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhile several people spoken to by The Independent questioned whether the calm and ordered atmosphere would hold come Saturday night, the clear contrast with a trip to the pub before they were forced to close more than 100 days ago was stark.Customers were greeted at doorways with hand sanitisers and test and trace forms, in many cases asked if they had a booking and how many people would be sitting at their table – which could seat a maximum of six people.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safely“It’s like a restaurant,” one Wetherspoons customer remarked, although the reality was often not far from checking into a hotel, with drinkers given a short tour of the premises, told how to order drinks, which directions to walk, where to stand and queue at the bar, and where to leave their contact-tracing forms on their way out.With customers forbidden from propping up the bar in most establishments, Wetherspoons customers are asked to stand in a small box at the bar demarcated by black and yellow tape on the floor. Asked how she is feeling about the reopening, a bartender replied from behind perspex glass that she is “stressed” – a feeling unlikely to be due to high levels of custom, given JJ Moon’s typical capacity of 290 people has been reduced to 79 to allow for social distancing, and more likely due to the challenges in navigating and enforcing the new rules.John, a 66-year-old who lives in Putney and was enjoying a pint with a newspaper in the Tooting Broadway pub, said: “This tastes a lot better out of a glass than it does out of a tin, that I can tell you.”While he said that the return to pubs pales in comparison with seeing his grandchildren after three months of shielding, he agreed that the renewed sense of community would offer a boost after the hardships of lockdown.

Saturday night, a lot of people, in the event of a football match where it’s screened in certain pubs, that could take its toll.“You’ll probably have a line-up about half a mile down the road waiting to get in to see the match.”While JJ Moons, the only pub in Tooting with a short queue outside, appeared to be at capacity, a focus on table service saw groups and iniduals more or less marooned at their tables, leaving plenty of rare open space typically filled with bodies and precariously held pints.In the relatively quiet atmosphere, one elderly local joked with an acquaintance several tables away that he’d been thinking about stopping drinking, adding: “But when you get that first pint, that’s it, isn’t it? It’s nice to be able to come out and talk, that’s the difference – socialising.”Whitty warns opening pubs are a \u0027high risk\u0027 for spreading coronavirusSeveral hundred yards away in The Antelope – a popular local – customers are asked if they have a booking, and are greeted with a form titled “The Antelope’s New Normal”.“Like Boris, we are relying on the cooperation and common sense of you all so please remember that when pubs aren’t exactly how you remember them, or hoped they would be, we’ve all been in lockdown too,” it reads. “Things will get back to normal, just not straight away. Please be patient with us.”By 2pm, the indoor seating areas and beer garden were already well-populated, with table service rendering it unnecessary for customers to order at the bar.Emma, a 25-year-old from Margate, and Taylor, a 24-year-old from Cambridgeshire both told The Independent it was “fantastic” to be back in a pub, but said they were visiting London with the intention of looking for a flat to rent post-lockdown, rather than going drinking.“It’s weird but it feels normal at the same time,” Emma said. “Walking in with all the segregated walkways, that was odd, but being outside it feels just normal still ... I just want a pint – drinking beer from the bottle is not the same.”Taylor said: “I wouldn’t feel comfortable meeting a big group of people in a pub at the moment, unless it was in a big outside area”, while Emma added: “I think now it’s fine but later it’s going to get stressful. I can imagine it getting pretty out of hand.”If social distancing in pubs works, it may also end sexual harassmentThree pints deep at 10am as pub drinkers toast end to lockdownStop judging people at the pub – it\u0027s not just about getting drunkAsked whether they expect people to maintain social distancing later, they reply “absolutely not” and “definitely not”.While the stringent new rules make it seem likely that social distancing may largely be maintained within establishments, policing the streets outside may prove more difficult – particularly given the difficulties of getting into already busy pubs and bars without a booking, and the relatively short stays allowed.Taylor added: “In London, walking down the street, it’s so busy. So if you put that with alcohol, it’s not going to end well.”Speaking in light of the crowds seen in Clapham, Streatham and Tooting Bec Commons in recent weeks (a 26-year-old friend texts at around 1pm reporting Clapham is already “rammed”), she added: “If you think at how stressful the parks have been, imagine that in a pub. It’s going to be horrible.”The government itself appears to have tempered its vocal desire for the nation to drink to the economy’s good health on Saturday, with the prime minister contradicting Jacob Rees-Mogg’s “yard of ale” comments and HM Treasury deleting a celebratory “pubs are back” tweet, telling the public to “grab a drink and raise a glass”.While it is far from clear what lasting effect the virus will have upon England’s pub culture, the effects of lockdown upon iniduals’ drinking habits are also cause for concern in some quarters.Research published on Friday by Alcohol Change UK found that 28 per cent of those surveyed who have ever drunk alcohol think they have been drinking more during lockdown. As pubs reopen and lockdown eases, two thirds polled said they expect to continue drinking as they have been during lockdown, or even drink more.Emma said that while she had spent lockdown with her family, who do not drink much, she believes many of her friends who live in London are going to the park “regularly” and drinking more “just because it’s something to do”.But asked whether she would return to the pub as often as before the pandemic, Emma replied: “No. I think where you can sit in a park and drink, I would definitely choose that over going to the pub still.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Despite the vast differences between the two situations, Fawcett’s extensive military experiences and qualifications have helped him and his team develop a robust response to the Covid-19 crisis.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I was the only doctor there for about 300 people, which was quite an eye-opening experience,” says Fawcett of his first stint in Afghanistan in 2007 as part of the Army Reserves. Working at the Role 2E Field Hospital in Camp Bastion and at the Forward Operating Base, Fawcett provided key treatment on the Afghanistan frontline.On his second stint in 2007, he spent three months in Camp Bastion as a Trauma Team Leader, and on his third tour in 2011, he was the clinical lead for the Medical Emergency Response Team, a four-person medical team operating from a Chinook flying over Afghanistan, picking up wounded soldiers on the battlefield.What’s more, Fawcett – who also counts a role with the Midlands Air Ambulance Charity as a helicopter doctor amongst his impressive repertoire – has completed an MSc in Disaster Healthcare. Playing an instrumental part of Stoke hospital’s response to the Coronavirus pandemic is just one more string to his bow.“I was able to take a lot of stuff I learnt and apply it from the very start,” Fawcett says of putting his Masters in Disaster Healthcare into practise. “Before the patients even get to the emergency department, we make sure there’s clear boundaries, and patients are directed to the right areas to avoid any cross-contamination.”His army tours also contributed: “Looking at the designs of how they set up field hospitals and stuff helps,” he adds. “And working with international colleagues – it’s good to get a non-UK perspective on how other countries deal with certain circumstances.”This involved an overhaul of the whole emergency area and its processes. “We now run two emergency medicine departments out of one department,” he explains. “We’ve had to basically split the whole department in half.”Now, Stoke hospital features red zones and green zones: the former is for those displaying potential Covid symptoms and the latter is for those who aren’t. As such, the pathways and patient-flow of the hospital have had to be changed to avoid any instances of contact between these areas.“We have separate ambulance entrances for red and green patients. We have two resuscitation departments, two areas for major patients, two areas for walk-in patients, two minor injuries areas, two paediatrics departments, as well as designing alternative pathways to try and stream those patients that don’t have to come through the emergency department to other places.” he explains, noting how such isions have had to be executed throughout the whole hospital to prevent crowding and maintain social distancing.How schools in England are helping pupils return to the classroomThe task may have been monumental, but Fawcett takes pride in the hospital’s response: “This is what we’ve always trained for and it’s been good to see how us as an emergency department have responded to it. We’ve ensured patient safety and staff safety has always been at the forefront.”Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Here are some of the measures that schools are implementing to make the transition easier for pupils, staff and parentsIn association with the UK GovernmentHinchingbrooke School is an academy school in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, with more than 1,900 pupils and 200 staff. Teachers started welcoming back A-level students last week.“We’ve only had the Year 12s in so far, but for them it was really clear they were delighted to be back,” says Mark Patterson, school principal, pictured above. “You could see it on their faces. It’s getting back to some sense of routine, structure and normality.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHe continues: “I think a lot of them have been surprised by how much they’ve missed school. I think if you’d asked them before lockdown ‘Would you like a week off?’, they’d have said ‘Please!’. I bet if you asked them now, they’d say ‘Can I come back?’. I think the parents and students now realise how important school is.”Prior to the return, teachers organised a virtual assembly for Year 10 and 12 pupils, and sent a booklet home detailing the new guidelines which would be in place.5 back-to-school tips for parents\u0026nbsp“Don\u0027t give them a lot of small instructions – recognise your child would have had an enormous amount of\u0026nbspinstructions during the course of the day.”“If you are rewarding your child\u0027s behaviour, it\u0027s very important to do it every time.”“For a child who\u0027s been finding it tough,\u0026nbsptalking to another child who\u0027s been in the same situation is by far the best way of letting it out.”“It\u0027s important to encourage a child to work for themselves and get on with their own inner task.”New measures include red circles marked on the ground that are two metres apart and one-way systems throughout the school.“We’ve reorganised all the classrooms that we’re using so the desks and chairs are two metres apart,” Patterson explains. “We’ve got designated areas set aside at break and lunchtime for each group to go to, and we’ve got signage around the school reminding everybody of the importance of hygiene, frequent hand washing and keeping their distance.”Implementing new measuresRheeya Makwana is one of the Year 12 students who has returned to Hinchingbrooke. “We’ve been having online lessons and voiceover PowerPoints, but it’s not really the same as being in a classroom,” she says. “The structure was really good and I felt like I learned a lot more being back at school. I came home in such a good mood.”Rheeya’s father Yogesh Makwana did have some initial worries about his daughter returning to school: “There’s always some concern, but all the communication from school has been excellent in the build up to it and all the measures that have been put in place have reassured us. If you offered our 13-year-old the chance to go back to school tomorrow, he’d do it in a heartbeat. He misses his classes the social interaction. He loves PE and he does so much at school that he misses.Year 10 pupils Vahine and Lucia will also be returning to the school this week. “The twins are really looking forward to it,” says their mother, Alesia Dickinson. “They’ve been messaging all their friends to find out what group they’re in. Less than a week after we said yes to going back we found out what bubbles they were in and we had clear guidelines about times, rooms and what they can expect when they go back to school. They’re raring to go.”Both Makwana and Dickinson agree that their children have missed the structure of school lessons and that the transition back to the classroom has been easier than expected. “I think it’s a positive thing,” says Dickinson. “I think it’s a step in the right direction. We need to let the children start that process.”Going back to Embark schoolsTrust leader at Embark Matthew Crawford, pictured below, has been welcoming back primary pupils to the Federation’s schools across Derbyshire.“The feedback we have had so far from all the schools across the Trust is that it’s going really well in terms of welcoming the children back,” he says. “It’s not a one-size-fits-all. Each school has done a risk assessment based on what they can do.”Most Embark schools are now back at around 25-30 per cent capacity, Crawford says. It\u0027s up from around two per cent when lockdown began, when it was just key workers’ children and more vulnerable pupils in the classroom.“It’s lovely to hear the children playing and see schools becoming vibrant again,” he adds. “As soon as lockdown began, we started work on our Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme, a nine-stage support package to welcome children back safely.”Keyworker Vicki Ellis has two children who have returned to one of Embark\u0027s schools Richardson Endowed Primary - Amelia in Year 3 and Darcey in Year 1, pictured below.The first day the girls were back I was wondering how they were all day. I knew the school had done everything possible to welcome the children back in a happy, positive way but I worried whether Amelia and Darcey were enjoying themselves. But when they came home they were so happy to have had that day at school – and eager to go back next day. Crawford explains that the school has tried to make the transition back to the classroom as fun as possible for the children: “We’re following the guidelines but in a way that’s fun for the children. We aren’t marking big Xs on the floor. Some of our schools, for example, are painting snakes in bright colours to show the way.”Embark has also shared its programme with schools as far as Devon, Durham, South Gloucestershire and Wales.“It’s a suite of resources and activities that schools can adapt to their own settings, taking the bits that work for them,” explains Crawford. “It’s lovely that the brilliant work of our staff is making a difference and impacting the lives of millions of children across the country, not just the 3,000 within our Trust.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

But when coronavirus hit in March, Ireland’s biggest sportswear brand had to break the habit of a lifetime and sack its entire 750-strong workforce at its Strabane factory due to the lockdown.With sports events cancelled or postponed, orders from teams and retailers vanished.However, the company was thrown a surprise lifeline when, a day after announcing the layoffs, the Western Health and Social Care Trust approached O’Neills on a Friday about fulfilling a shortage of scrubs to safeguard frontline NHS workers.Factory staff spent that weekend making sample scrubs. By the Monday, O’Neills had secured an order for 10,000 sets of maroon tops and trousers for GPs at a coronavirus testing centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, Londonderry.As a result, the company rehired 150 workers immediately. It has since brought back more than 400 staff overall as orders from other health trusts across Northern Ireland grew, with the remaining 350 employees being furloughed.The company now produces some 10,000 sets of scrubs a week. Managing director Kieran Kennedy, a veteran of 41 years at the business, says employees have been supportive of the switch from making sporting goods.“We are a close-knit community in Strabane. Many employees know people who work in the NHS and they want to give back,” he explains. “We could either feel sorry for ourselves or be productive and take a bite at the cherry. Without the NHS orders, we would have had no sales and no cash flow. The scrubs kept the show on the road.”Kennedy says the move outside the company’s traditional business area has been relatively easy. For instance, O’Neills had stockpiled a six-month supply of yarn – the raw material for the scrubs and other clothing – from China to hedge against Brexit uncertainty. The company knits the scrubs at its Strabane factory, then dyes and coats them with anti-viral substances at its production plant in Dublin.Workers on the factory floors are social distancing, as well as wearing face masks, sanitising their hands and having their temperature checked.Kennedy is upbeat on the company’s future prospects, noting that big sporting fixtures are returning, which should boost sales and enable him to rehire more workers. But for the foreseeable future, Kennedy plans to continue producing protective gear – an unexpected new revenue stream.   The gift shop owner donating Happy Bags to localsWhen Sarah Lloyd Williams, pictured above, had to temporarily close her quirky little gift shop in Frome on 22 March, she had no idea what she was going to do with the time ahead.At first, Lloyd Williams relished the opportunity to spend every day with her dog, Chester, taking him with other dogs out for walks. However, by nature, she is a hands-on person and soon realised she needed to find something to fill her time other than dog walking and cleaning.She had found out that someone local to her had been having a hard time. “I knew this lady slightly and wondered if there was anything I could do to help, Lloyd Williams explains. I didn’t feel that I knew her enough to contact her offering assistance, so instead I decided to leave a little gift on her doorstep.” She called it a Happy Bag, containing a copy of The Happy Newspaper (a quarterly newspaper by Emily Coxhead containing nothing but good news), a chocolate bar, bath bomb and a little note.This good deed went down very well: the recipient messaged Lloyd Williams to ask if she could buy a Happy Bag for her friend. “I didn’t want any money, Lloyd Williams explains. This was something small that I could do with items that I already sell in Figgins, so I delivered a Happy Bag to her friend and it went from there.”She ended up delivering a number of bags in the local area and it led to doing a few other little things for people, such as picking up medicines, shopping and more dog walking.For Lloyd Williams, this became a lovely way to connect with people that she barely knew, or had never met before, and it made lockdown much easier to navigate: “Giving away some Happy Bags certainly made me feel much happier. It’s a tiny thing, but sometimes that’s all it takes to make someone’s day,” she says.Figgins has now reopened, with Lloyd Williams taking steps to make sure her shop is safer with a screen, hand sanitising stations, floor stickers and limiting the number of people in the shop at any one time. Lloyd Williams is also donating a Happy Bag every week to someone in the local community.At the start of lockdown, Andy Hibbert, above, transformed his car-sharing business.Launched in 2017, Car \u0026amp Away had enabled holidaymakers to rent out their cars from Gatwick and Bristol Airports while they were away, but when the coronavirus forced airports to close, business plummeted.The CEO from south west London quickly decided to use the business\u0027 existing assets to help key workers and launched a new service: Karshare.“We had this burgeoning desire for people to rent their car from home because it was sat there doing nothing,” Hibbert explains. “But then Covid came along. As a business we were stranded. We thought: this is ridiculous. We have all the systems in place to enable us to share cars. Why don\u0027t we launch the car-sharing concept where owners donate their cars to critical-care workers and people who are supporting the most vulnerable in our community?”At the peak of the pandemic, travelling by car minimised viral spread on public transport and limited key workers’ exposure, while making their journeys easier at a stressful time. Karshare encouraged members of the public in Bristol, Brighton, London, Manchester and Leeds to donate their cars for a week to NHS staff and volunteer organisations. The cars were then deep cleaned and matched to local key workers in need of transport.Insurance and road coverage were provided for free, and the owner received a full tank of petrol as a thank you.Impressively, 700 cars have since been donated – including to 31 London NHS trusts – with a total 19,000 days of use. Leasing company ALD donated 30 new cars in Bristol. “We were overwhelmed initially about the donations,” says Hibbert.One key worker who benefited was Michaela Morris, deputy chief operating officer at the NHS Nightingale Hospital London in Docklands. “She was put into a hotel and told she needs to be on call 247, so we quickly found her a car,” says Hibbert. “It’s remarkable that she has been able to continue that work because of the generosity of the public.”Karshare also helped a care worker who had only been able to reach a couple of vulnerable patients a day on his bicycle. When he was loaned a car he could reach up to 11 – and save more lives.While Karshare is now focusing efforts on making the business profitable again, it is also inviting donations to critical workers and will ask for contributions to cover the insurance. Karshare is also being extended to the wider community, allowing people to rent their cars from home.“There are financial pressures for people,” adds Hibbert, “yet they\u0027ve got an asset on their driveway that could really help.”The distillery that swapped gin for hand sanitiserIn the midst of a global pandemic, constrained by lockdown, a fledging gin brand was surrounded by alcohol with no bars open to supply. But reports of hand sanitiser shortages hit the headlines and gave the team an idea.Sean Roche launched Aintree Gin in December 2019. An organic, craft spirit, it takes its name from its home in Merseyside – a village renowned for its famous racecourse which hosts the historic Grand National.By spring, Roche and the team had introduced the gin to over 30 establishments around Liverpool. They were gearing up for the steeplechase, but lockdown put paid to their plans. “As soon as everything started to shut … all of our income went down to zero,” Roche says.Realising online sales would be key, the team started building a website – then they had a brainwave. “News reports started to regularly mention how shortages of… alcohol-based sanitiser were putting NHS and care workers at risk,” says Roche. “We knew that because we were already using pure alcohol to make our gin, we could change our production line to make sanitiser.”Their first batch was ready within weeks. Word got out and, soon after, they were inundated with requests from care homes, hospitals and more, Roche recalls.Volunteers were recruited and more than 600 litres were donated in six weeks. But as supplies ran low, and with no money coming in, the enterprise became financially unviable. “We had two choices,” says Roche. “Stop – or start selling something.”Opting for the latter, new containers were ordered and labels designed so the sanitiser could be sold online. They started offering a range of PPE products too, from face shields to masks. “This created a revenue stream that allowed us to continue,” adds Roche.A PPE pop-up and free hand sanitiser stations at an Asda store followed. “We donated more than we made in profit over the period,” Roche admits.Today, sales are going strong. As businesses look to reopen, many are turning to Aintree Gin for their sanitisation requirements – and also the brand’s primary product. They now aim to supply as many bars and restaurants as possible, and get into supermarkets as well.To read about more inspiring GREAT stories, visit greatbritaincampaigninspirationsWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Coronavirus lockdowns are lifting around the world, raising concerns that it could trigger a new wave of infections.Some countries that experienced a significant drop in new Covid-19 cases in April and May are now beginning to experience an uptick in confirmed daily cases.The concerning trend can be seen in several countries throughout the Middle East, most notably in Iran where new cases briefly dropped below 1,000 in early May but have now more than doubled.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIran was one of the first countries to experience a significant outbreak of the deadly virus, with close to 200,000 total cases recorded.Looking at a smoothed seven-day rolling average for new daily cases, Iran\u0027s second wave came almost exactly one month after the first wave.The data suggests that Iran may have already reached the peak of its second wave and is now on the decline.Other countries in the region appear to be experiencing a more gradual second wave, with official figures from Israel revealing that new coronavirus cases have been rising consistently for the past three weeks.Israel\u0027s second wave remains a long way off the peak of the first wave, and the country remains one of the least affected in the Middle East.In Saudi Arabia, new cases are rising at record rates despite briefly appearing to peak in late May.The false peak means the latest surge of new cases could be counted as a continuation of the first wave, rather than a new second wave.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Prime Minister announced yesterday the reopening of most of the hospitality sector from July , but the days of dragging friends onto the dance floor and yelling to be heard of loud music are over for a while. The guidance tells pub owners to take steps to prevent other close contact activities, such as communal dancing. It adds: All venues should ensure that steps are taken to avoid peopleneeding to unduly raise their voices to each other. This includes, but is not limited to, refraining from playing music orbroadcasts that may encourage shouting, includingplayed ata volume that makes normal conversation dficult.Temptations including live entertainment, loud music and sports broadcasts will all be banned in British pubs to keep people on their best behaviour. The Government warned businesses to stop people taking part in group singing or chanting as well because it carries an increased risk of spreading coronavirus. Dance floors will also be repurposed into table areas and patrons will need to be sat downthey want to be indoors. Another favourite pastime is also on the chopping block - the pub quiz will have to stay virtual at least for the moment. This is because of concerns it could lead to yelling and spread the virus. But in a hopeful sign for entertainment in pubs when conversation runs dry, the guidance said it will continue to develop based on scientic evidence to enable these activities as soon as possible.   To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

However, on Tuesday, it was €. to every pound.This means that Brits will get £ less on every £ they exchange into euros this summer.Follow our Brexit live blog below for all the latest updates…The EU’s chief negotiator is “‘losing his French charm.”.Brexit party chief Michael Tice told The Express: “The EU have got a very good negotiating team.#They conned us into agreeing on a ridiculous sequencing process.#They have revealed themselves to be strategically very smart and very confident.#When things dont go their way, and they are not currently going their way, they lose their temperament and get cross very quickly.#The EU like to hold all the cards and have the upper hand, that is what they got used to with our previous negotiators, that has now changed now.#Michel Barnier is suave and sophisticated with this French charm.#But he is starting to look a little rough around the edges and that is because things are not going their way.”Products from Japan or South Korea would be stamped Made in Britain, under Boris Johnson’s plan to save the domestic car industry after Brexit.The idea is an attempt to prevent harsh tarfs that could drive away brands such as Nissan and Toyota and was uncovered in proposals for an EU trade deal.But many Brexit voters could find the idea “ridiculous” after being promised huge benefits from leaving the EU.Goods made solely from foreign parts, but assembled in the UK – particularly vehicles and prepared foods and other manufactured goods – would be granted the same exemptions from tarfs as those from UK components.Alan Winters, professor of economics at the University of Sussex Business School, said companys such as Nissan could leave the UKit had to pay tarfs.He told The Independent: “We know that the Japanese are wondering whether they would stay around.“Brexit is going to be bad news for jobs in lots of dimensions. In this one dimension, the British proposal would help to head off some of those losses.”Dr Peter Holmes, reader in economics, said: “What the UK government is seeking from the EU on rules of origin is unprecedented.“To the average Brexit supporter this approach may sound ridiculous and not part of any deal they voted for, but without it Japanese car plants risk facing  per cent tarfs on cars made in the UKthey use engines, gearboxes or other components made in Japan.”Nigel Farage, well known for his fondness for beer, tweeted a picture of himself in a reopened pub, but was met by a storm of tweeted criticism and suggestions he should still be observing a -day quarantine as mandated for people traveling from the United States.Farage attended a campaign rally for President Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma on June .Acting Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey called on police to investigate whether Nigel Farage has broken quarantine rules.Mr Farage tweetED a photo of himself at .pm today from a Kent pub declaring # oclock, first customer in. Love it.# However, he insisted he had been back from a trip to the US for two weeks and had tested negative for Covid-.Sir Ed wrote to chief constable Alan Pughsley, stating: #I write out of concern that one of your local residents may have broken quarantine rules regarding international travel and is putting lives at risk with a wilful disregard for scientic and medical advice.The Secretary of State for International Trade Liz Truss has said Britain will boom once Brexit is completedit can successfully form partnerships with other countries.She claimed the UK would greatly benefit from becoming a part of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacic Partnershiponce Brexit was out of the way.During a speech at a Policy Exchange webinar event, Ms Truss claimed the CPTPP would allow Britain to grow in ways that it could not, had it stayed a member of the EU.Ms Truss said: #I also think it’s important to recognise these benefits we could gain by joining CPTPP that wouldn’t have been able to access as a member of the European Union.#We would be able to accede to this agreement in ways that does not damage our national sovereignty.#There is no ECJ and there is no harmonisation of domestic regulation and there is no seizing of our sovereign power.#Prime Minister Boris Johnson met with Kenyas President Uhuru Kenyatta for private talks today during which the two leaders agreed to start negotiations for a Kenya-United Kingdom post-Brexit trade agreement.The negotiations, which are expected to be finalised ahead of the UK’s exit from the EU on st December , will be conducted within the Kenya-UK Strategic Partnership Framework established by the two leaders in January  and the East African Communityparameters in order to enhance regional integration.In a telephone conversation at State House, President Kenyatta and Boris Johnson also discussed several Kenya-UK bilateral interests among them the two nation’s response to the global Covid- health crisis.The UK needs to show more #ambition#it wants to secure a post-Brexit deal with the EU before the end of the transition period, European Commissioner for Trade Phil Hogan said today.the Irish commissioner spoke with Ireland’s RTÉ radio today and said the EU over the past few months has shown it is willing to compromise, but that a #lack of ambition# on the UK side means #very little has happened.#Hogan said: “There’s a frustration on the EU side about the fact that the good faith in terms of the negotiations that’s required on both sides is not happening to the extent that it should.“Boris Johnson has explicitly stated that he wants a deal, so we need to see movement on the U.K. side soon or  it’s going to be too late.The commissioner added that he still believes that a deal can be struck by December , when the transition period ends.“The ambition of that deal on the EU side is real. I don’t see the same ambition on the U.K. side, so the ball is in the U.K.’s court. If they want a deal, there is a deal to be done,” he said.Plans to enshrine a UK #internal market# after Brexit would seriously undermine devolution, the Scottish Governments Constitution Secretary has said.Michael Russell said proposals from the UK Government would be a #power grab# on responsibilities held by the Scottish Parliament.In a letter to Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove, he said he is concerned about proposals for an external body which would #test# whether a bill in Holyrood affected the UKs internal market.The letter also details concerns about plans for a #mutual recognition regime#, which he said could lower regulatory standards beyond what the Scottish Parliament found acceptable.Mr Russell said the proposals, which have not been published, #ignore the reality and history of devolution# and would be opposed by the Scottish Government.The EU and the UK issued statements early on Thursday afternoon calling an end to the talks.There was meant to be another day of discussions on Friday # but British officials led by David Frost ed to London.In a statement, Mr Frost said: “We have completed our discussion of the full range of issues in the negotiation in just over three days. “Our talks were face-to-face for the first time since March and this has given extra depth and flexibility to our discussions.“The negotiations have been comprehensive and useful. #But they have also underlined the signicant dferences that still remain between us on a number of important issues.”Talks are due to resume in London next week.Mr Barnier has said that there needs to be a “sustainable and long-term solution” on fisheries.Such a solution must take into account the needs of European fishermen for certainty over their livelihoods.It must also feature an effective all-encompassing dispute settlement mechanism to ensure both sides stick to their obligations.“We will continue to insist on parallel progress on all areas,” he said. “The EU expects, in turn, its positions to be better understood and respected in order to reach an agreement. #We need an equivalent engagement by the United Kingdom.”Mr Barnier says the UK has established red lines over its negotiations, including “no role for the European court of justice in the UK no obligation for the UK to continue to be bound by EU law and an agreement on fisheries that shows Brexit makes a real dference”.But he suggested the EU’s willingness to be flexible on its initial demands in light of the British positions had not been met with similar understanding from Downing Street over Brussels’ red lines.The latest negotiations in Brussels on an EU-UK trade and security deal have broke up early this week.The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier has complained of a lack of respect and engagement by the British government.The two sides ended the week’s talks – the first held in person since February – a day ahead of the jointly agreed schedule.Both Mr Barnier and his UK counterpart David Frost say theyre facing “serious” disagreements.“Our goal was to get negotiations successfully and quickly on a trajectory to reach an agreement,” Barnier said in a statement. “However, after four days of discussions, serious ergences remain.”Holidays for Brits are going to be more expensive now after the value of the pound dropped during lockdown.In February, £ was worth €. # but its since dropped by ten pence to €..On Tuesday, it was €. to every pound.This means that Brits will get £ less on every £ they exchange into euros this summer.Experts have blamed the fall in the pound against the euro down to the coronavirus outbreak and uncertainty around Brexit negotiations.Image: AlamyBritain is considering joining an EU plan to secure supplies of potential vaccines against Covid-, officials in London and Brussels said on Friday.The UK-EU talks, first reported by the Financial Times, represent a test of the cooperation required to tackle international emergencies after Brexit.The EU is planning to spend around  billion euros on the advance purchase of vaccines in testing, on behalf of the  EU states.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has said she is trying to convince “a signicant number” of world leaders to join forces and buy vaccines up front together, as competition for a vaccine could otherwise raise the cost for everyone.  Once Britain leaves the Brexit transition period and the European Single Market next January, the Government plans to implement a new IT system to manage the additional border checks that will be needed.The new # and untested # system is known as the Goods Vehicle Movement Service, or GVMS.It means UK companies exporting into the EU will have to wait for permission from the taxman before they can move their goods.According to a document circulated by HMRC, lorries will only be able to move loads into the EUthey have a valid reference from GVMS.Hauliers will need to file the correct customs paperwork electronically in advance in order to get approval # and the Government plans to bar trucks without clearance from reaching ports.Chancellor Rishi Sunak has called on Brits to eat out to help out as the coronavirus lockdown restrictions ease today.He says a generation of young people risk being #lost# unless the public starts spending in pubs and restaurants.He told The Times: #This is a consumption-driven economy people used to, three months ago, go out with their friends or family to go and have a meal.#Mr Sunak said that the public had to “relearn what it’s like to go out again” and added, in what may become his new slogan: “Eat out to help out”. Image: WmediaBritish businesses are increasingly worried that the UK governments planned system to check goods heading to the European Union wont be ready in time for when the Brexit transition period ends in .The Government plans to bring in an entirely new IT system to help check goods heading to the EU from January .But leading UK business groups have told Business Insider that the government has failed to confirm to them how the system will work and whether it will be fully al in time.One senior figure who is in close contact with the government about its Brexit plans says Government officials #just dont know# how the new arrangements will work.Royal Dutch Shell is not ruling out moving its headquarters from the Netherlands to Britain, the oil companys chief executive Ben van Beurden said in an interview with a Dutch newspaper.Anglo-Dutch consumer products giant Unilever said last month it plans to ditch its dual Anglo-Dutch legal structure and create a single entity in Britain.Van Beurden did not explicitly say Shell wants to move its headquarters, het Financieele Dagblad said.#You always need to keep thinking,# Shells Van Beurden told the newspaper. #Nothing is permanent and of course we will look at the business climate. #But moving your headquarters is not a trivial measure. You cannot think too lightly about that.#A Shell spokesman confirmed the CEOs comments to Reuters and said the company was looking at ways to simply its dual structure, as it had been doing for many years. The England and Wales Cricket Board has approved an increase in overseas players in domestic cricket from next year and will now allow two per side in four-day and -over cricket.Teams are currently allowed to field only one imported player, though foreign-born players with British passports and those on Kolpak registrations have not counted towards the allocation.The effects of Brexit mean Kolpak deals will be terminated at the end of the postponed  campaign meaning those players # as well as those who have had deals cancelled this summer due to the coronavirus pandemic # will now have a greater chance to earning deals.The move was recommended by the performance cricket committee, chaired by Sir Andrew Strauss.An expert says the dferences on fishing could prove to be too dficult to resolve # because Whitehall doesnt have enough expertise in fisheries laws to extricate the UK from European rules.According to iNews, Andrew Oliver said it is unlikely the industry will be free of European control before  and that it “might never happen”.He said that it may eventually be possible to wrestle back some of the quota and fishing rights taken by European fleets # but that it would probably cost billions of pounds in compensation.He said: “I think it will take up to  years before we are completely orced and have our own stand-alone statute book.#One of the big disagreements between the EU and the UK is over fishing.During the referendum campaign in , Brexiteers argued in favour of Britain ditching the Common Fisheries Policy.The agreement opens up UK fishing grounds to European vessels.The calls to get rid of it has left many British fishermen furious.And the EUs chief negotiator Michel Barnier has told Boris Johnson and David Frost thatthe UK wants access to European markets, the country must open up its fisheries.The UKs top civil servant, Sir Mark Sedwill, revealed plans to step down from his role in September earlier this week.In a letter to Boris Johnson he said that he believed it was the right time to leave as the UK moved into the next phase of the governments coronavirus recovery plan.But there was alleged tensions between Sir Mark and Dominic Cummings, the Prime Ministers most influential aide, and cabinet minister Michael Gove.No sources said Dominic Cummings thought Sir Mark was a barrier to #Whitehall reform,# with the agreement of Mr Johnson and Michael Gove, reports .His departure is part of an overhaul of the civil service spearheaded by Nos top adviser Cummings.Brexit adviser David Frost will step in as national security adviser.News organisation Bloomberg is reporting that the Brexit gang is back in charge in Britain.Writers say Boris Johnson has #little time for conventions#.#Despite being a product of the English establishment # educated at Eton and Oxford # he has surrounded himself with the band of brothers who upended the existing order with their  Brexit campaign and are bent on continuing the revolution in government.#The tight-knit group of trusted aides is determined to reshape the country, bringing investment to depressed areas and overhauling how the government is run. #After three months battling the coronavirus pandemic, which nearly killed Johnson and damaged his reputation for competence, the premier and his team of revolutionaries are now re-asserting their reforming agenda.#Michael Gove says a no-deal Brexit could lead to UK business being #adversely affected#.He made the admission after being questioned by former Shadow Chancellor Michael Portillo on Times Radio.Mr Portillo said: #Its possible that well reach the end of the Brexit transition period and leave without signing a deal with the European Union.#I think that before the general election you were very worried about a no-deal Brexit. #What changed #Mr Gove admitted that he was #worried# that the UK would not be #sufficiently prepared# for an exit without a deal.#Id much rather that we secured a free trade agreement with the EU,# he said.The home shopping tycoon who was among the most prominent business backers of Britains departure from the EU has put his company up for sale.Sky News reports that John Mills has instructed Cavendish Corporate Finance to contact prospective buyers of JML, a multichannel retailer of consumer products.It comes just months before the end of the Brexit transition period.The process is at an early stage and is not expected to result in a deal for several months, according to a source.Earlier this week, the deadline passed for the UK and the EU to extend the Brexit transition period.It means theres no going back # and were leaving the EU, with a deal or without one, at the end of the year.Now Boris Johnson has suggested thatthe UK and EU could not reach an agreement with the bloc, then an “Australia-style” arrangement with the bloc would be a “very good option”. Australia does not have a comprehensive trade deal with the EU. While specic agreements are in place for certain goods, much EU-Australia trade takes place on World Trade Organisation terms. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That now looks like a very unfortunate explanation. He has straightforwardly shot himself in the foot.It was Maxwell who introduced Andrew to Epstein. It was Maxwell who was Andrew’s guest at Buckingham Palace last summer. And it was Maxwell whose house was the venue for the infamous photo of Andrew with his arm round the bare midrf of young Virginia Roberts who says she was a sex slave for Epstein and a bit of flesh to service his important friends.Andrew told the BBC he went all the way to New York to break off his friendship with Epstein, by then a convicted paedophile. And then stayed for four days at his swanky Manhattan house where he was given a dinner in his honour.Oh, and shortly afterwards Epstein handed over £, as his contribution to the Help The Fergie Fund. It’s a very odd way to end a friendship.Epstein may have died in prison – no doubt very conveniently for lots of famous and powerful people – but it has not stopped the calls for prosecutions of those connected with Epstein, and the calls for justice from Epstein’s victims.The FBI have made it plain they want to talk to Andrew. But he seems determined to keep as far as possible away from them.Geoffrey Berman, the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan, told reporters earlier this year that Andrew had so far given zero co-operation.Lisa Bloom, representing the women who say they were abused by Epstein, called Andrew’s refusal to answer questions ‘a slap in the face’ for the women.Yet the pariah prince was at it again yesterday, insisting he has in fact offered to co-operate.Well there is a very simple way of finding out who is telling the truth. Let him publish the letters and emails he has sent to the US law enforcement agencies and we can judge for ourselves.Overall, Andrew has done more to undermine the British royal family than any other living person. He is the gt that just keeps on giving for those who want to replace the monarchy with a republic.When local councils earlier this year were told to fly the flag for his birthday there was uproar. The Sun captured it perfectly in its front page headline: Union Joke.Meanwhile a Yougov poll revealed that only  in  have a favourable opinion of him. The only surprise is that it was that high.Horrendous as all the Epstein and Maxwell stuff is, that is just one item in the charge sheet against Andrew.There is the calamitous way he damaged Britain’s image abroad over many years as our trade envoy as he went round the globe insulting those he came into contact with and belting out his saloon bar views, views very often the exact opposite of agreed government policy.Diplomats called him His Buffoon Highness for his mixture of arrogance, rudeness, ignorance and stupidity.There is his outrageous use of helicopters, often to get to golf courses, and private jets when commercial flights would do - all charged to the taxpayer.There is all the dodgy company in dodgy countries he has kept – nasty dictators, outright crooks, alleged torturers, even a convicted gunrunner - some of whom he has accepted gts from, and some he even weaselled into Buckingham Palace, so tainting the Queen with his dubious associates.There is the wealth he has amassed from questionable sources, whether through shady offshore companies, using a  name, Andrew Inverness, or direct from his dodgy friends.What a stroke of luck that he was able to offload his old house, Sunninghill Park, which had been on the market for years at £ million, to Timur Kulibayev, the billionaire son-in-law of the Kazakh dictator, for £ million.Mr Kulibayev never moved in, the house sat empty for a further nine years before being demolished. Why would he pay well over the asking price for a house he never intended to live in And how astonishing on a grant from his mum of £, each year and a tiny naval pension of £,, he has been able to spend £.m refurbishing the property in Windsor Great Park AND get hold of a £m ski chalet in Switzerland.Then there is the appalling boorish behaviour to his protection staff. On at least one occasion he threw stuff on the ground and told them to “f---ing pick that up.”Or there is the casual racism, using phrases like “n----- in the woodpile” which he denies though plenty heard it, or making a jaw-dropping and hugely tasteless joke about camels at a state banquet for the Saudi royals. How to win friends and influence people!Even Donald Trump, who has played golf with Andrew, met him many times, and once lent him a plane, now say:s “I don’t know Prince Andrew.”We’ve all had enough of the obnoxious prince. He is a national embarrassment. When Princess Diana orced from Charles, she was immediately stripped of her HRH status yet the Prince of Sleaze keeps his. He should have his taken away without any further delay. Let him be Andrew Inverness, since he likes that name.The victims of Epstein will be scarred for le. If he has a scrap of decency left inside him, he will travel to the United States and tell the FBI all he knows.This is one trip for Air Miles Andy that the taxpayer would be prepared to pay for - especiallyit is a one-way ticket.       Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

One source familiar with the proposal said: A six-month stamp duty holiday would save people lots of money, is very Thatcherite and would please Tory backbenchers.The move would mirror the popular measure introduced by ex-Chancellor Philip Hammond in  when he removed stamp duty for all first-time buyers on homes under £, and £, in London.Another measure being looked at is removing stamp duty land taxon vacant land. The move is designed to take advantage of disused land to boost the development of new house-building projects.Both forms of stamp duty cuts are unlikely to be announced in the economic statement Mr Sunak is giving next week, which will instead focus on the Governments plan  to tackle mass youth unemployment triggered by the coronavirus crisis.The Treasury declined to comment.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But, this time, don’t head straight back indoors after the clap. Linger in the street, talk to your neighbours, perhaps pop by to say hello to someone who has been on their own during lockdown.We want people to thank each other.On my road there have been a lot of people putting notes through the letterbox saying, “If  you are self-isolating and need help, please call this number”.I now know who my postman is, partly because I am working from home, and I check in with him and have a chat to see how he is. I will be at No Downing Street with Prime Minister Boris Johnson to applaud the NHS and carers on Sunday.Afterwards there will be a barbecue with the NHS staff who looked after the Prime Minister when he was in hospital with Covid-.Hopefully, there will be a moment to address issues of how to look after our NHS workers properly. Many of the NHS staff tell us they were just doing their jobs and that was their purpose in le.For the nurses and doctors, looking after people is a calling.This is our chance to show how grateful we are that they followed that calling and stay true to it — even when their lives are in danger.Of course, this is not a celebration, because people are still passing away and carers are still being put in danger.Tonight we would like people to put some kind of light in their window, an electric one rather than a candle, and to pause for reflection.Many landmarks will also be lit up in blue as we remember the thousands who have lost their lives.The other reason why this weekend is a good time to come together again is that there have been signs of a ide in the nation. We also need to remember that we are not over coronavirus  yet.We don’t know what is going to happen and there is a risk that there will be a second spike.We have already seen in Leicester that a fresh lockdown was needed and people are still dying.News is changing so fast and there is so much uncertainty.The Together coalition, which I am part of, hopes we can bring back that special spirit that helped us get through the worst of the crisis.We hope that Sunday can be a positive spark.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The big aim was to save lives and protect the vulnerable.⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesI doubt it occurred to many parents that schools would be closed for nearly FOUR months, and counting, or that they were about to take a pivotal role in educating their own children.But that is what has happened. And I know from friends with school-aged children that it has been, shall we say, a bit challenging.So I want to dedicate this column to the hundreds of thousands of parents who became home-educators overnight — with a particular shout out to the “lucky” ones who had to do this while also doing their regular jobs.Trying to educate your child, with no idea of when schools will reopen, and at the same time as trying to do justice to your day job, is seriously hard and my hat comes off to all of you.Now that the UK is slowly unlocking, there are many working parents who face the prospect of having to go back to their jobs.Some have children back at school until the end of term. But it is fair to say that no one is in an ideal situation.It has been a slog for everyone — and what we all need is a holiday. But with all the chaos and uncertainty surrounding trips abroad, and most UK holiday homes and campsites now already booked up, many of us will have been lucky to plan any kind of trip.More pressingly, many of the children’s holiday clubs people rely on are closed. After all, try telling a bunch of seven-year-olds to stay socially distant during a game of football.Many families rely on grand- parents to fill the childcare gaps during school holidays.But even though restrictions have eased, lots of grandparents will have underlying health conditions that make it unsafe for them to venture out.They will be stuck at home, missing family and unable to help out with childcare.In short, there is an army of working parents out there, already on their knees after four months of combining school and work, who now face their kids having seven more weeks off school, with no structure and support.What are working parents to do  This is a really tough situation for families.There are some basic things that parents can do to make le easier — and right at the top of that list is to lower your standards.Very few things are so important that they cannot wait until tomorrow. No one died because the house was not Hoovered.One thing I do know is that when you are working all the hours God sends and looking after kids, “me time” is almost impossible. But when you are firing on all cylinders, it is all too easy to burn out.So my advice for this particular Sunday is this — try to find even just one hour to go for a walk or meet a friend.Or find a corner where no one can bother you, and read a book, do some yoga, have a bath and pour yourself a cup of tea or a glass of wine.The rest of the world can go hang while you recharge your batteries and live to fight another day.Parenting is the hardest job in the world at the best of times. It does not come with a manual or instructions. It is relentless and you get very little thanks.The rewards are happy, healthy, balanced adults — but that comes -plus years later.If you are struggling, remember this — it will pass. Meanwhile, take it a day at a time and hang in there. You are doing a sterling job.The BBC has found the perfect solution to lockdown filming, with their revival of Alan Bennett’s Talking Heads series of monologues.No need to worry about social-distancing with a cast of one.And Killing Eve star Jodie Comer playing a part first performed by Julie Walters in the s in Her Big Chance, was brilliant.She is a fantastic actor, as we well know from Killing Eve, and this performance demonstrated her versatility, too.Did you see those pictures of Loose Women star Nadia Sawalha, who is , stripping down to her underwear If you did, then you may well have uttered the word: “Why ”But she wanted to show what women really look like, and to demonstrate the power that a filter, camera angle and ious other cunning techniques can have in efforts to make women look more “perfect”.When you think about the multiple images of “perfection” that women are subjected to daily, you realise that unless there is a visible antidote to this – actual evidence that real women are not perfect after all – we will never change the pressure we are under.So, good on you, Nadia.This was a successful attempt to highlight the degree to which the camera does, indeed, lie – but also the pressure we are all under to distort normality.I know many people who look great in photos but normal in real le.That feeling of need to alter your image can be a sort of self-hatred. It also fuels others’ need to airbrush themselves, so that all of us risk becoming unrecognisable in real le.The problem with altering your image is that you are fooling precisely no one.What is far better is to love yourself, no matter what you look like.Seeking adulation from people you don’t know and will never meet is a fool’s game because it will never, ever pay idends.It’s so easy to indulge in regret – but this is also a fool’s game.Anyone tempted by its lure needs to take a leaf out of Pierce Brosnan’s book.He said this week he has “no regret” after being told over the phone that he was being replaced in his role as James Bond.The actor, now , had his last outing as  in Die Another Day in  – and although he was eager to do a fth film, producers decided they wanted to reboot the role.Instead of feeling bitter and resentful, he said: “There’s no regret. I do not let regret come into my world . . . it just leads to more misery and more regrets.”Pierce is one of those actors who really has mastered the art of growing old gracefully – a le goal for all of us.He is a gorgeous man and comes across as a genuinely nice guy.Oh, and judging from recent photos, he could still play Bond now.I know many people have been disappointed they are having to scale back plans for big summer weddings.If you’ve been arranging the biggest and best day of your le, you might be wondering whether it’s better to just postpone altogether.For what it’s worth, I have some advice. It really is just a day. Yes, it should be lovely but it’s not the wedding that is important – it’s what happens afterwards.By that, I mean the rest of your married le together.It’s easy to get caught up with expectation and convention but maybe this is a chance to think about what you really want and what matters to you as a couple.You may also realise thatyou marry at the moment there can be no first dance – a tradition surely conceived during the s when couples don’t have sex before marriage – and a cause for celebration.The local lockdown in Leicester is a stark reminder that the next few months, and maybe years, could bring plenty more of the same. Anywhere.When this does happen, we will all have to do our bit.But hearing garment manufacturers in Leicester saying it will defy the city’s lockdown shines a light on what, for some, is the nub of the matter – for so many people, lockdown equals a loss of income.They cannot afford to lose any more money, evenit means putting lives at risk.That is going to be a real problem. But staying open “evenit puts lives at risk” is a cavalier and dangerous attitude.If you own a factory, it is your job to make sure your workers are safe.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But Hong Kong was British for  years, from  to , and it was handed back to China on the understanding that Hong Kong’s unique freedoms would remain unchanged for  years. One country, two systems was the promise.China has trashed that promise. There is one country now — tyrannical communist China where you kowtow to the party line or face the consequences. It is now illegal to sing the wrong song in Hong Kong. It is now a criminal offence to carry the wrong flag. Demanding basic human freedoms that we take for granted — and were also the norm in Hong Kong — will now get you jail time without even the pretence of anything resembling a fair trial.As the free world struggles with crashing economies, soaring unemployment and horric corona­virus death tolls, communist dictators are reverting to the law of the secret police and kang­aroo court, the baton and tear gas and terror.The old men in Beijing love to say that outside agencies are interfering in Hong Kong’s internal policies. But the simple truth is that the young people of Hong Kong — all born after the Union Jack came down — have grown up with freedoms that are un­known on mainland China. They do not want to live under a soul-destroying communist regime.That is why, at every attempt to roll back their freedoms and make Hong Kong as servile as every other part of China, the youngsters of Hong Kong have taken to the streets to protest in their millions. That is why riot police are currently arresting children in Hong Kong. Because they want to be free.President Xi’s National Security Law allows communist China to crush dissent in any way China sees fit. Likewise, President Putin’s referendum marginalises the millions of Russians who would love to see the back of the floundering KGB hardman.Millions of ordinary Russians and Hong Kongers have seen their freedoms eroded this week.And although the UK has problems of its own, we should do everything in our power to stand up to these old communist thugs who rule Russia and China. Don’t do business with them, for starters. And when teenagers are being rounded up on the streets of Hong Kong, we should not be asking a Chinese tech firm to build our mobile network.British history teaches us you can never appease a murderous bullyEnraging Beijing, a poll shows the British public are in favour of offering Hong Kong residents holding British National Overseas passports a home in the UK.So much for a post-Brexit UK that closes its borders to the world.So much for the racist, intolerant, xenophobic country we are supposed to be.This has been a rotten week for freedom. But in the darkness, there is a light — the decency, generosity and tolerance of the freedom-loving British people.And it is a light that will never go out.KATIE BOULTER, the golden girl of British tennis, says she is spending the cancelled Wimbledon fortnight watching the BBC crime series Killing Eve, which stars Jodie Comer – who many suggest is Katie’s doppelganger.The blonde bombshell of the baseline, above, says: “My brother recently said that to me. He was like – you definitely look like her. You’ve got to watch this box set. It’s unbelievable!”I do hope Katie is not disappointed. No series ever went downhill as fast as Killing Eve.The first series was great.Then Phoebe Waller-Bridge bailed out and the second series was mediocre.

Dickens’ experience of watching a hanging at Newgate informs the end of Oliver Twist, when Fagin is hanged – it is only in Lionel Bart’s cheerful musical Oliver! that Fagin gets to dance off into the sunset.With his profound sympathy for the oppressed, the average Victorian would have considered Charles Dickens decidedly “woke”.The character of Fagin in Oliver Twist – my favourite Dickens novel – is meant to be evidence of Dickens’ racism.But Fagin is Jewish – there is nothing anti-Semitic about his portrayal.Has this elderly Green Party graffiti artist actually read any Dickens  If not, he doesn’t know what he is missing.Nobody  has created the range of dazzling characters that poured out of Dickens’ imagination – Scrooge, Fagin, Oliver Twist, Miss Havisham, Mr Bumble, the Artful Dodger, Bill Sikes.Every writer in the English language lives in the shadow of Charles Dickens.This big-hearted genius enriched the language, the world and the imagination of generations.Calling him a racist is pig ignorant.Dickens lived and died in Victorian England.Expecting him to think exactly like a st-century Twitter user hardly seems fair.In fact, it hardly seems sane.THE UK and Japan are both tea-drinking monarchies.

Many could be thrown on the “scrapheap” and those trying to build a new career will find it tougher than ever to get a foothold on the jobs ­ladder.The impact of unemployment will blight their future, as the knock-on effects — including hopelessness and alienation — will last a letime.The Government has a simple choice this week: Either invest now to ensure youngsters have the training and skills needed to meet the challenges ahead, or we will all pick up the pieces later.That means laying the ground for real apprenticeships and work ­experience, with proper jobs at the end of them. There should be more opportunity to continue learning, developing the knowledge and skills required to land a job or, better still, become a future entrepreneur.We should seize the opportunity to create new jobs in the regions by regenerating the North and the Midlands, including tackling climate change, housing and construction, and the added social care challenges of supporting an ageing population.\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"The Chancellor should also work with business and the trade unions to recruit , employers willing to assist, by offering them incentives and subsidies, including help with National Insurance and pension contributions.Additionally, existing underspends and the Apprenticeship Levy, together with potential benefit payments, should be topped up to create a £billion fund to meet the challenge of a record ­million under-s predicted to be out of work by Christmas. This is not just a matter of hard-headed public policy.It is about the lives of every inidual and their chances of building a future for themselves, developing a family of their own and contributing to their community. It is about what ­happens when aimlessness turns either into apathy or, more likely, into what my grandfather would have described as the danger of “idle hands”.History has taught us that society begins to unravel when young men without prospects, stability or the capacity to provide a role model become an unattractive prospect as a lelong partner.The future is grim when young women feel that they alone carry the responsibility of nurturing a child, and when a lack of prospects and progress to something better leads to a “live today and to hell with tomorrow” attitude.Former Conservative minister Lord Willetts has written and spoken convincingly about the danger of the generational ide.His honest reflections of how the austerity measures put in place in  hit younger people hardest, and how the protected ­pensions of the past, combined with the enormous rise in property values, have placed the majority of older people in a more favourable place to face the future showed great insight.\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"Young people lack the prospects of a secure job and either owning their own home or affording the rent.That is why we should face this challenge head-on and invest now, or we will pick up the cost later.In , during the early days of the New Labour government, our New Deal for the young unemployed offered four options.Not surprisingly, the bulk of young people went for either jobs with ­training attached or full-time education, which would lead to much better prospects of holding on to a job with decent earnings.Another lesson learnt, including in -, was that much of what needed to be done should be localised.The tendency to over-centralise ­everything has bedevilled us in this crisis.From the failure to devolve test-and-trace to local government through to months of ineptitude in ­getting our children back to school, the Government has classically created a central bureaucracy then blamed it for failure.While it has done the right thing in investing money in recovery ­programmes for our children over the winter, astonishingly, it failed to put any money in for recovery for those  to -year-olds in further education in sixth-form colleges.These are the young people whose vocational training and practical ­opportunities for work will be vital both for the economic recovery and for their own chances of getting a job.After all, you cannot promise a ­guarantee of apprenticeships or work experiencea business has folded.The Government needs to work with and listen to young people, employers and those in education and training.Unfashionable as it is at this moment to talk about universities, it is crucial that those capable of taking up such opportunities should be supported in doing so.If we don’t, they will be the ones who take the jobs of those less qualied and less confident.The result is simple. The least educated and the most vulnerable will be the ones to lose out most.Thinking these things through ­carefully, being able to act decisively and learning from the past, while not living in it, is surely common sense.And by God, we need a great deal more of that right now.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Since March, millions of clinically vulnerable people have been shut indoors practically the whole time, until recently not even leaving for exercise. Now a plan to unlock those doors - in two stages on July  and August  - has been revealed by the government. From July  shielding people can go out and meet up to five friends in a socially distanced way. And cruciallythey live alone, they can also form a aposbubbleapos with another household - allowing millions to hug and kiss their closest family or friends for the first time. Then, from August , the advice to shield ends completely. The exception is in Leicester, where current rules on shielding will remain due to a local lockdown. The ability to go outside and hug and kiss will be welcome relief for millions whose mental health has taken a toll. But charities warn there is too much dangerous ambiguity and people could have vital support withdrawn. Sick pay and a system of food deliveries will end on July  - which they fear could leave shielded people in the lurch. So what are the changes and what are the implications for you and the ones you love   From Monday  July, there are two major changes for all .million people who are shielding in England. Firstly, people who are shielding are able to join gatherings of up to six people outdoors. These gatherings can be from up to six dferent households - but anyone from separate households must maintain a -metre distance. This follows the rules that were unveiled for the rest of England from June .  Secondly, people who are shielding and live alonewill be able to join the apossupport bubbleapos system topair up permanently with one other household. They will be able to break the two-metre rule with people inside their bubble to hug and kiss. One of the two households - the shielded household - must be a single-adult household. The other household can have an unlimited number of people. What will change from August   From Saturday  August, the .million clinically vulnerable people in England will officially be told they no longer have to shield from the virus. It will bring to an end a period of isolation lasting more than four months. While they should strictly follow social distancing rules, they will be able to go back to workthey cannot work from home, and visit shops and places of worship. Will shielding support end on August   Not completely - but a lot of it will. The governmentaposs direct food parcel and medicine deliveries will end. Matt Hancock confirmed they “continue to the end of July”. And shielding people will no longer be paid Statutory Sick Pay - unless they develop symptoms or are told to isolate. That brings them in line with the rest of the population. The government claims help wonapost simply end at the stroke of midnight on July . NHS Volunteer Responders will still be able to help with collecting shopping or medication, a regular friendly phone call, or transport to appointments. Shielding people will also retain their priority for supermarket delivery slots. But Nick Moberly, Chief Executive of the MS Society, warned: “We are gravely concerned that certain key support measures – such as food packages and Statutory Sick Pay – will be taken away prematurely. Without this help, and with many people still terried of infection, for some the idea of normal le ing will feel more like a threat than an opportunity. WhatIaposm scared toto work on August   Itaposs up to you and your employer - not the government. This is likely to prompt a major row from campaigners who want guaranteed legal protection for workers. The government press release says: From  August, those who need to work and cannot do so from home will be able toto work as long as their workplace is COVID secure, adhering to the  guidance available. But it does not say what will happenpeople feel too frightened or clinically vulnerable to go back. And government sources confirmed this would be a conversation between a worker and their employer - rather than a set legal protection. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told employers: We expect you to do the right thing. Nick Moberly, Chief Executive of the MS Society, warned: “Those who now may have no choice but toto work must be given the right information so that – together with their employer – they can ensure their working environment is safe. We also need clarity on what ‘carefully following social distancing’ means in the real world, in situations like shopping or meeting friends. There is still far too much room for interpretation, and this ambiguity could put people in danger. So are shielded people now under the same rules as other people in England  No. Between July  and August , there are only specic changes. Shielding isnapost being lted completely at that point. Shielded people are still advised not to go to the shops, pubs, restaurants and bars. From August , shielding people are still advised to continue to follow strict social distancing measures so the rules are more or less the same as the non-shielded. But they are still at higher risk. Whatmy family already bubbled up with someone  in June   Then youaposre a bit stuck. Single-adult households in the rest of England have already been able to bubble up with one other household since June . But households are only meant to pick one bubble buddy and stick with that one, not switch around. This meansyou, a family of four, have already decided to bubble up with your non-shielded sister, you shouldnapost then bubble up with your shielded dad. Could I end up having to shield all over again  Yes,there is a second wave of the pandemic. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the shielding list will be maintained and “we stand ready to support people to shield againthat is what’s clinically required”. Mr Hancock also said there could be local shielding ordersthe virus flares up in one particular city. That has already come true in Leicester.

Today, on its nd birthday, we have the chance not just to celebrate it but to reflect on what it means to us. My mum was a nurse, but she was also very ill for much of her le. The NHS she served and loved was also her leline. When I remember the dedication and professionalism of the doctors and nurses who cared for her, I feel a deep sense of gratitude. It is what inspires me to fight for our health system, to ensure that kind of care will always be available to everyone. I know many others feel the same. The NHS means so much to so many. But in the last few months, as we have battled the coronavirus, it has become even more important. The impact of Covid- across our country has been devastating. Friends and families have been kept apart and tens of thousands of lives have been taken too early, including hundreds of NHS workers. At the centre of this storm, our NHS has been a rock. For every le tragically lost, many more have been saved by the actions of our NHS heroes.  I know it has been incredibly hard for those on the front line. Day in, day out, they put themselves in harm’s way to save others. We must never forget who our key workers are. For them, it’s more than a job. Their deep sense of public service and desire to help people in need shine through. They are the best of us. That’s why Labour supports those calling on the Government to make an immediate commitment to talks on a pay rise for NHS workers, and to agree this deal as soon as possible. The numbers of deaths are, at last, coming down. But Covid- has not gone away. The threat from the virus is still very real.  Throughout this crisis, the Government has been too slow. Too slow into lockdown, too slow to ramp up testing, too slow to fix the test-and-trace system and much too slow to get PPE to the front line of the NHS. The situation we saw in Leicester this week shows that the Government has still not got a grip on quickly identying and containing local outbreaks. We need to remain vigilant and do everything we can to protect and support our NHS.  That’s why Labour is calling on ministers to publish an NHS winter resilience plan, with free flu jabs for over-s, weekly coronavirus testing for NHS and social care staff, and proper stockpiling of PPE. The Government must learn from the mistakes made in their response to the virus so far and help the NHS prepare for winter. That includes facing up to the scandal that allowed the virus to ravage our care homes. We need to eliminate the virus from care homes before winter sets in.

Lawyer Charlotte, , had done a km run, a km walk and a session with a personal trainer when the niggling pain kicked in.Incredibly, her doctor made a house call to examine Charlotte, and he said it was most likely trapped wind or irritable bowel syndrome.But just an hour later Charlotte suddenly went into labour. She was about to give birth – yet didn’t even know she was pregnant. A wave of panic and mixed emotions swept over her but Charlotte still stayed cool. She phoned boyfriend Dominic – who was out on a run – then an ambulance. Dominic got back in time for Charlotte to give birth in just three pushes. But little Evelyn Rose was born breach and Charlotte suffered an umbilical cord prolapse, meaning her baby was starved of oxygen. Charlotte says: “I had absolutely no idea I was pregnant. The only signs were stomach cramps two days before she was born. “I thought I’d eaten something bad, or it was period pains, but I called a doctor on the morning before she was born, to be sure. “He visited and said I had trapped gas and IBS. Then an hour later, I went to the toilet and an umbilical cord fell out of me. I could not believe what was happening. “I got a sudden urge to push, then two little feet popped out. I was astonished, but I knew from watching One Born Every Minute that an umbilical cord coming out first is not good, because the baby is being starved of oxygen. “And a breach delivery is harder. So I knew that I had to push with everything I had. “I was strangely calm. I just knew I had to get our baby out.” Evelyn Rose was born in a corridor at Dominic’s flat in Amsterdam, where he and fellow Londoner Charlotte live. Dominic, , picks up the story: “We’d called an ambulance, but I saw the little legs and, at this point, it’s just me and Charlotte.  “I rang the emergency services back and said, ‘You’ve got to get here now, guys!’ Charlotte is standing there, holding on to the legs. She pushed once, and it was half way up the baby’s calves, she pushed again and it was up to the hips. “With the final push, the baby dropped out. Just three pushes. Charlotte grabbed her and passed her to me. She was really floppy and blue. Then we started chest compressions and tried to get air into her. “In the meantime, the ambulance crew turned up and started working on her.” Charlotte continues: “I shouted, ‘Oh my gosh, it’s a little girl.’ I’ve always wanted a little girl – a mini- me. I looked at her and she was so beautul, with dark curly hair. I shouted, ‘Is she alive ’ I really thought at that moment she was dead. Dominic had given her CPR that he remembered being taught in primary school. She was whisked away in an ambulance and we were taken in another. “I didn’t knowshe was alive or dead. Then the emotional rollercoaster started. As a woman who has just had a baby, your emotions are all over the place – I desperately wanted her to survive.” The couple – reeling from the shock of having a baby at all – faced an anxious wait to find outEvelyn was brain damaged. Charlotte adds: “Five days later, the neurosurgeon came back and said to the doctor, ‘Have you sent me the correct scan, because this baby’s brain is absolutely fine.’ She has no brain damage at all – a real miracle given the way she was born. We were so relieved, I burst into tears. We are so, so lucky to have her. She’s a dream come true. “Being able to hold her for the first time four days after her birth was the best feeling in the world. It felt amazing and so special.” Two-week-old Evelyn is recovering well and has been moved out of ICU and on to the children’s ward. To say Charlotte was stunned to become a mum is an understatement.  She had no baby bump and had been having regular periods. Evelyn’s arrival came after a worrying time for Charlotte, who was overweight in her s and feared that might prevent her having children. “I was  stone and my periods were very irregular, so I knew falling pregnant would be a struggle,” she says. In , after a diplomatic word from a friend, Charlotte joined Slimming World, started working out and lost a whopping st in  months – dropping from a size  to size -. She now writes a blog about her weight loss journey, called Slimming and the City, and shares exercise and recipe tips. In , she met Dominic on Tinder and embarked on a long-distance romance with the telecommunications company director, who has lived in Amsterdam for  years.  While they had discussed marriage and children, neither was prepared for the shock birth of baby Evelyn. Charlotte adds: “Because of lockdown, we’d been apart for  weeks, so when I got to Amsterdam three weeks ago, we had a lovely reunion. “Who could have guessed just a few weeks later we would be parents ” Luckily, Charlotte is not a big drinker and hadn’t been consuming much alcohol during her pregnancy. She exercised vigorously daily – running, indoor cycling, exercise classes – and travelled quite a bit too. She goes on: “I feel really guilty I didn’t realise I was pregnant, when I think of the things I have done while she was in my tummy.  “Crazy exercise, personal training sessions. All the travel. “I went to Dubai in February and ended up playing Uno and drinking Hennessey Paradis – which is £, a bottle – with Tottenham footballer Dele Alli on the flight. Luckily that was the only time I really drank. Drinking for me is a single glass of Prosecco on a Friday night. “I also had surgery when I was two months pregnant – a breast uplt and skin removal after losing so much weight. They did a pregnancy test, but it came back negative! “Two days before I gave birth, I started with a run, followed by a walk and an online training session. “Then I worked and cycled into Amsterdam to go to the pub. Two days later, Evelyn Rose was born. Our little miracle. I’m so, so proud of my body and all it has achieved.” "},{"url":null,"title":"dogs incredible transformation looking like","story":"NewsDogs incredible transformation from looking like bag of bones with rotting fleshWhen Nicola Owst stumbled upon a neglected dog trapped in a crate in a field, little did she know he would become a rescue project that would turn her le aroundShareCommentsByLouise Burke:,  JUL NewsPoor Buddy was in a terrible state when Nicola found him \", url\"News, views and top stories .

It was  April  when my friend Sally and I decided to take a trip to view a foal she’d seen for sale on the internet. Sally ran a stables with her husband Rob in Leicestershire, where I’d spent much of my teenage years living and working with horses. It was a bit of a mission to drive down the M in the pouring rain. We had to then weave through tiny B roads and muddy lanes to see this foal, but Sally was the type of person who would go above and beyond to give an animal a loving new home. When we arrived at the address, we both had a funny feeling in the pit of our stomachs. It was clear it was not a proper paddock – it was the grimmest, scariest place I’d ever been to. Two shady-looking men came out and showed us the six-month foal. I was horried to see it looked half-starved and riddled with worms. There wasn’t just one, but two of them. We quickly handed over the cash and coaxed the nervous foals into our trailer. Just as we were about to leave, I spotted an animal wedged into the back of a rusty metal crate. I crept closer to see whether it was even alive. The poor creature, squashed inside a cat carrier, was breathing faintly. His sad eyes were just slits in his bony, bruised face. It looked astrying to keep them open was causing him intense pain. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. His fur had worn away, showing his paper-thin skin over his bony rib-cage and face. His mottled flesh looked like it had been clawed at. He was barely alive. This poor dog had been trapped in his own waste and had obviously had no food or water for days. But what really hit me was the horrendous smell – a combination of rotting flesh and faeces. His little paw pads were burnt and red raw from standing in his own urine. It was unbelievably sad. I didn’t think twice about rescuing him. I swaddled him in a towel and took him back to our x. His legs buckled from underneath him as I carefully placed him on my knee. On closer inspection, I could see he was covered in mange – a nasty infection caused by mites that burrow under the skin. I had to save this poor creature from these horrible people. ‘I’ve got you, Buddy,’ I said to him. The name stuck. We made a sharp exit from that hellhole.  I knew exactly who to call on when we got home – Ian, the local vet, who had tended to the horses at the stables for years. He examined him straight away. Sitting on the examining table in the veterinary practice, Buddy resembled a bag of bones. Ian confirmed he was a Staffordshire bull terrier, probably not even a year old. I watched over Buddy as Ian checked him out. You’d think he would be frightened of me and the environment, but I think he was relieved. The way he looked at me made me think he was grateful to be saved. The vet diagnosed him with demodectic mange. Because he’d been left in his own mess, he’d got secondary infections and his skin was rotting away. Armed with a bag of antibiotics and care instructions from Ian, I took Buddy home. That first night I bathed him gently in the kitchen sink, then I didn’t sleep a wink, constantly checkinghe was breathing. It felt touch and go at times… We took everything slowly. I introduced small plates of chicken or scrambled egg to him so as not to upset his stomach, and gave him just enough exercise in between lots of sleep. If I’m honest, the Staffy breed hadn’t always appealed to me. I had it in my head they were aggressive dogs. But I couldn’t have been more wrong. He is the most loving, kind and loyal dog I’ve ever come across.  Over the following year, Buddy grew stronger and his infections cleared up. I made a point of socialising him even in puppyhood. He was my number one in le, and he soon won the hearts of those close to me. At the stables, Sally’s mum, Phyllis, who we called Gran, had a special bond with him. Instead of running around in the fields, playing with other dogs, he’d prefer to curl up on the sofa with Gran. When she was diagnosed with diabetes, he wouldn’t leave her side until she had her insulin. He’s very intuitive. When it came to finding myself a partner, it was a case of ‘love me, love Buddy and my horses too’. I was lucky to meet Jon through work, and he took us on as a package. To find a man who was happy to love us all meant the world. Of course, we had Buddy as a guest of honour at our wedding in . He had a special outfit for the pictures – my great auntie who has since passed away, made him a fancy collar to match my bridesmaids. Our le as a family of three was going smoothly until Buddy was diagnosed with cancer in March .  It happened the same year I went through two miscarriages. It was a very traumatic time. In a way, him being ill shted the focus away from me. I channelled any emotional energy I had on him getting better. And after numerous rounds of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, he made a recovery in October . The following autumn, I fell pregnant with my son Toby, who is now three.Before Toby arrived, we got another dog, a springer spaniel called Susie, who was rescued from a puppy farm where she was a breeding bitch for three years in a shed. I still haven’t quite worked my magic on her, she can be nervous, whereas I can take Buddy anywhere, and do anything. He’s so well-behaved. I feel like I have a lot to thank Buddy for. I’ve experienced so many things in my le because of him – we’ve been to dog shows like Crufts and won awards, met celebrities like Martin Clunes and Christine Lampard, and have a fantastic circle of friends we’ve met through Buddy, who we holiday with twice a year. Who would have thought that poor, neglected dog I first saw in the cage could have turned my le around for the better  "},{"url":null,"title":"boy who touched comedy stars","story":"NewsBoy who touched comedy stars hearts now in Mexico for last chance to save his leCharlie, , has battled medulloblastoma since he was eight and won support from John Bishop, fellow comedian Katherine Ryan and actor Chris O’Dowd at a Stand Up To Cancer eventShareCommentsByAmy Sharpe:,  JUL NewsCharlie out after his latest round of treatment in Mexico \", url\"News, views and top stories .

Mum Toni Ilsley raised £, to take son Charlie abroad – though doing so in the Covid- pandemic petried her. Charlie, , has battled medulloblastoma – the highest-grade brain tumour for children – since he was eight. In January he was given months to live. Parents Toni and Mark, , are clinging to the hope that a three-week trial at the Williams’ Cancer Institute in Mexico City can offer a miracle cure. He is midway through treatment led by Dr Jason Williams. It uses a protein in the body to attack tumorous cells. Pharmacist technician Toni, , said from Mexico: “No one at such a young age should be going through what he’s had to endure. Learning the NHS could do no more almost destroyed us. “We were getting to the point doctors said he wouldn’t live past – but thankfully we scraped the funds to get to Mexico. I was petried to take Charlie but told myselfI don’t, he will die. It’s his last chance. So far, so good, though it’s too early to say. Charlie is in good spirits and swimming between therapy.”  The family has won support from John Bishop, fellow comedian Katherine Ryan and actor Chris O’Dowd. They met at a Stand Up To Cancer event which helped raise £, to send Charlie to Turkey for CyberKne radiotherapy treatment. That was in  – after Charlie’s brain tumours spread. The treatment worked, he was declared cancer-free but the cruel disease ed last November.  Mum-of-three Toni, from Henley, Oxfordshire, says she was told no more could be done. She said: “I went into shock, I couldn’t eat or sleep. We tried to make it the best Christmas, knowing it could be his last.” With the NHS offering palliative chemo, the family went private – paying £, so Charlie could get drugs through a reservoir inserted under his scalp. But after one of four treatments, appointments were halted due to Covid-.  Toni said: “Every door was closing. I researched America and Turkey, but the pandemic made it hard to find anyone to treat Charlie. Finding Doctor Williams was a miracle. I sent Charlie’s scans and we spoke for hours on Skype. Eventually, he said Charlie was eligible.”  Arriving in Mexico brought its own drama – earthquake tremors hurtling Charlie across a room as he lay in bed. “We thought we would die,” said Toni.  She, Mark and Charlie are in Mexico until scans gauge how successful treatment has been. They continue to fundraise in case he needs further therapy. Toni said: “Between treatment we’ve created memories including visiting a ranch where Charlie rode a horse. All we can hope now is that the therapy works.” "},{"url":null,"title":"couple who set up hand","story":"NewsCouple who set up hand sanitiser firm just  weeks ago on track to make £millionAndrew and Rachel Montague set up ClearWater Hygiene in March, and now employ  full-time staff and eight contractors, with deals secured with giants such as O Retail, Aldi and the Post OfficeShareCommentsByEllie Forbes:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL NewsRachel and Andrew Montague, founders of ClearWater Hygiene\", url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

In the aftermath, John Apter, the chairman of the Police Federation, said drunk people are unable to properly socially distance. It was crystal clear revellers would not adhere to the one metre plus rule as restrictions were eased on so-called Super Saturday, he added. Mr Apter was on sht in Southampton, Hampshire, where he dealt with naked men, happy drunks, angry drunks, fights and more angry drunks. He said: What was crystal clear is that drunk people canapost wonapost socially distance. It was a busy night but the sht managed to cope. I know other areas have had issues with officers being assaulted. Some police forces had signalled they were apprehensive about theof pubs on a Saturday and said they were expecting problems. In some places, their fears came true. In Nottinghamshire, police responded to trouble at pubs across Mansfield, Sutton-in-Ashfield, Arnold and Newark. Windows were smashed and at least one person was assaulted as police dealt with several incidents of anti-social behaviour. Four people were arrested and five pubs decided to shut early in a bid to prevent any further trouble. Police said three pubs in Mansfield and Sutton in Ashfield, plus two in Arnold and Newark , closed.Inspector Craig Berry of Nottinghamshire Police said: Officers were quickly on the scene to deal with a number of alcohol related anti-social behaviour reports including a smashed window and minor assault. As a result four arrests were made by officers and we supported licensees who chose to close their own premises. No pubs have been closed by the police. Weaposd like to thank the majority of the public who have acted responsibly throughout Saturday, especially whilst watching the much-anticipated Derby v Forest match.  Devon and Cornwall Police said they had received more than , reports over the so-called Super Saturday, most of which were drink-related. In Leicestershire, police were granted a dispersal order to send people away from Market Harborough town centre after reports of anti-social behaviour. The order was in place between pm on Saturday ad am on Sunday.  Images from Soho in central London showed packed streets into the early hours of Sunday with revellers ignoring the one-metre plus social distancing rule which was introduced on Saturday. One man who passed through the busy streets told : Walking down old Compton Street felt like wading through a Petri dish. Photos showed carnage in the streets in London, Manchester, Bristol, Leeds and Newcastle. Pubs were allowed to reopen from am for the first time since the lockdown began in late March after Boris Johnsonaposs government decided it would be safe to do so.Many reopened at am or am and there wasnapost an immediate rush, but venues became busy in the afternoon and through the evening, when trouble flared. It was estimated , pubs would reopen and customers would sink  million pints from Saturday. Nik Antona, the national chairman of the Campaign for Real Ale , said feedback from branches suggeted up to half of pubs did not reopen. Many licensees criticised insufficient notice from the government and were taking a wait and see approach, he added.A major easing of lockdown measures in England saw pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, theme parks and cinemas opening their doors again under modied social distancing regulations. The National Police Chiefs Council issued a joint appeal with the hospitality industry calling on drinkers to behave responsibly when pubs reopened. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and government experts had urged people to stick to the rules on Super Saturday to avoid creating a second wave of coronavirus.

Instead, the former solicitor has gone on to tackle some of the world’s most physically challenging races and has never let his degenerative condition stand in the way. Alex, now , has ­completed the ­notoriously tough Marathon des Sables in the searing heat of the Sahara Desert, pulled a lb sled across the Arctic in temperatures of -C and run  miles through the Amazon. Since , he has successfully ­completed  marathons and challenges. And the dad of three didn’t let up during lockdown either. He spent  hours a day for a whole week climbing ,ft – more than double the height of Mount Everest – using just his stairs to raise money for charity. So far, Alex’s amazing feats of physical endurance have raised more than £, for Parkinson’s UK and more than £, for charities worldwide. He says: “I have learned to accept the bad days, and give my all on the good. I want to raise £million for Parkinson’s UK in the hope of better treatments or even a cure one day.” Fitness fanatic Alex was diagnosed with Parkinson’s in  after he noticed his little finger moving involuntarily. Following a series of tests, he was told he had the incurable disease, which develops when cells that produce ­dopamine in the brain stop working and are lost over time. In the UK, around , people are living with Parkinson’s and a further two people are diagnosed every hour. There is no cure for the le-changing disease, and sufferers are forced to live with the knowledge that they will slowly lose control of their body as the ­illness progresses.  Alex recalls: “When the ­neurologist told me it was Parkinson’s, my le suddenly felt meaningless. “I was devoid of hope and my diagnosis weighed on me from the moment I woke to the moment I fell asleep. “My twitching finger was a constant physical reminder of the battle I couldn’t fight and wouldn’t win.” But after months of ­feeling both anger and ­despair, Alex realised that he couldn’t ­wallow. Instead, he focused on his work as a lawyer and ploughed all his energy into athletic events he’d planned to do ­before his diagnosis.  Alex continued training for the Marathon des Sables – a -mile race across the Sahara Desert, known as the “toughest footrace on the Earth”. During the event, Alex got lost and had to be rescued by local tribesmen. He then became seriously ill and had to pull out of the race due viral pericarditis – an ­infection of the sac surrounding the heart. Alex was ­gutted he had to quit, but still ­managed to raise £, for charity – which made him realise that his global adventures could really help other people. He says: “This led me to the MillionMetres challenge, which ­involves running, hiking, ­cycling, climbing and rowing ,km.” In , Alex ran  miles across the Alps in  hours, ­surviving on just  minutes’ sleep. And the following year, he ran from London to Rome via Brussels and Paris in  days.  In , he became the first person to cross America using four dferent disciplines – cycling, running, climbing and rowing – covering more than , miles in just  days. He also ran  miles across the Dolomite mountains in Italy and  miles of the Colorado Rockies. More recently, in , Alex took part in Fiji’s -mile Lost Island Ultra before completing the London Marathon a fortnight later. He also trained for Primal Quest in Canada – one of the toughest adventure races in the world. Despite suffering broken ribs, a concussion and a bulging disc in his spine, Alex and his team completed the challenge in four days and five hours. Later this year, he hopes to take part in Racing the Planet’s -mile six-stage ultramarathon on Namibia’s Skeleton Coast. Alex is also hoping to secure ­sponsorship to become the first person with Parkinson’s to climb Mount Everest for real – a challenge he hopes to have professionally filmed.  But in the meantime, from July , he’ll be ­running a -mile ultramarathon in  days for Parkinson’s UK in his home town of Wantage, Oxfordshire. Although Alex does his best to stay fit and healthy, the physical symptoms of his condition sometimes flare up, which he finds ­dficult to deal with. “When I have to walk like a robot or lose my voice, my world feels ­intrinsically smaller,” Alex says.  “It really affects my confidence to be a part of society ­because I don’t want the world to see my symptoms. “I know others with Parkinson’s feel this way, too.” It is this feeling that drives Alex to continue with his epic fundraising ­adventures around the globe. He says: “Being physically restricted at times has taught me to be resilient. “That doesn’t stop me feeling angry but I use that anger and hatred for Parkinson’s to do ­positive things, such as raising money for research. “This ­disease can zap your self-worth but you can keep doing what you want to do, evenit means finding an ­alternative way of doing it. “I have hope in better treatments for Parkinson’s being discovered.

Tim Spector, professor of genetic epidemiology at King’s College, said: “The new model picked up Leicester as a consistent hotspot back on June .

Mark Adams, chief executive of Community Integrated Care, believes thousands would have been saved – and has slammed plans for weekly tests in England as “too little, too late”. To date, Office for National Statistics figures show , care home ­residents have died with Covid-. And Mr Adams’ claim suggests some , could still be alivea robust testing regime had limited outbreaks. Accusing the Government of abandoned residents, he said: “If the priority had been, ‘Let’s just test everybody that’s coming into contact with vulnerable people’, you probably would have more than halved the number you lost in a care home, and maybe even made it a fraction of what it has been. “The Government clearly started off thinking, ‘We’re all going to get this, there are going to be about , people who die’. They’re mainly going to be old people who potentially might have died anyway and they might even save the NHS and local authorities moneythey pop their clogs early’.” Mr Adams spoke after regular testing was finally announced for care home staff in England. He said without twice-weekly testing, care homes and supported living homes would be left completely unprepared for a second, third or fourth wave of the virus. He stressed that twice-weekly testing is needed to stop infected staff bringing Covid- into homes – with residents tested by local public health nurses rather than carers. Mr Adams said: “Dealing with ­vulnerable and confused people who might have dementia, that’s a horrendous experience for them to go through. You really need to have experienced nurses doing the testing now.   “Our organisation has  nurses across  locations. But a great many social care environments are run where you don’t have nursing staff – you have highly trained care workers.“The test has a % failure rate just on the science. But thenyou add the human error into that there’s a risk. The ideal scenario is public health teams would have a dedicated team who visit care homes.” Mr Adams warned the toll could rise much higherthe Government fails to also boost testing in supported living environments. He said: “We talk about the , in nursing and care homes. There’s , in supported living. “The fact that they’re in a dferent building doesn’t mean the complexity of their condition has changed. Every time the Government pats itself on the back about gradually getting its act together five months too late, they’re talking about care homes and nursing homes – they’re not talking about this army of people who are waiting to have support themselves.” Charities have also demanded beefed-up testing for agency staff. The ONS found infection rates were higher in homes that used agency staff who worked across several sites. Professor Martin Green, chief executive of Care England, added: “Regular and routine testing is criticalwe are to garner a better understanding and keep at bay this virus. This initiative needs to be rolled out to all care homes, including adults with learning disabilities and also supported living.” "},{"url":null,"title":"hoarding worse during lockdown theres","story":"NewsHoarding much worse during lockdown and theres nowhere to hide from the clutterThe founder of Hoarding Disorders UK says that since March, the organisation’s helpline has seen a spike in calls.

But for around . ­million Brits, hoarding items is a serious issue, linked to anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorders. And for many sufferers, the lockdown has exacerbated the problem because staying at home means there is nowhere to hide from the clutter. Jo Cooke, founder of Hoarding Disorders UK, says that since March, the organisation’s helpline has seen a spike in calls. But what exactly is hoarding and what can be done to stop it   Hoarding – once dismissed as an extension of other mental health conditions – was officially recognised as a disorder in its own right by the World Health Organization in . The NHS describes it as ­someone acquiring an ­excessive number of items and storing them in a chaotic manner, resulting in huge amounts of clutter. These hoards often interfere with daily le and the use of the home, such as making the shower or kitchen inaccessible. They also cause distress to the sufferer and their family. Hoarded homes also pose a number of safety issues, ­particularlythere is a fire. The severity is measured by a visual guide known as the Clutter Image Rating. Who is affected   Around two to five per cent of Brits are thought to be hoarders to some degree, but the true number could be higher because sufferers are often too ashamed to talk about it. Jo says: “This is an ­anxiety disorder, not people who are lazy or dirty. “They have emotional ­attachments to things, often ­triggered by bereavement or trauma, such as redundancy or empty nest syndrome.” Seek some support Reaching out for help is a vital first step when it comes to ­treating the condition. There are currently around  support groups in the UK – and self-diagnosed hoarder Lynn Howells runs one in Berkshire, with the support of Jo. It was set up by Silva Homes, the housing association -year-old Lynn works for. And the group’s monthly meetings, which are now taking place online, provide emotional support as well as practical tips to curb hoarding behaviours and cope with family tensions. Lynn says: “I’ve bought or kept things ‘just in case’ my whole adult le, and I’ve traced it back to the upset of being sent to boarding school. “Volunteering to run the ­support group has helped me a lot. Everyone’s story is unique but it is a relief to realise you are not alone.” How to tackle a hoardIf you feel able to declutter, Jo recommends starting small.She says: “Begin in the least emotional area, such as the ­hallway.

This weekend is marking the biggest thank-you yet not only to the NHS and key workers, but also to all those in the community whose support has helped us get through the pandemic. The events will reach a climax with a nation-wide clap at pm on Sunday when people are being asked to come out again on their doorsteps or stop what they’re doingto applaud and then spend some time with neighbours and friends to reflect on those connections that continue to strengthen our communities as we move into the next stage of the crisis. Brits have put a candle or a light in their window to remember all those we have lost to Covid-. At pm the Dean of St Pauls lit a candle on the West End portico of the cathedral in London. Landmarks all across the country have been lit in NHS blue, supported by the #LightItBlue campaign. Number  Downing Street is lit up and a candle is placed on the doorstep to remember the hundreds of key workers who have list their lives during the pandemic.Windsor Castle, where The Queen is currently staying, is also lit in blue this evening.  Kenilworth Castle is another building paying tribute to the NHS. They tweeted: Tonight, weaposre supporting the NHS and Togetheraposs Moment of Remembrance. We remember those we have lost and pay tribute to NHS staff, key workers and everyone who has played their part during the pandemic. #lightitblue#thankyoutogether.  The famous clock at Londonaposs Waterloo station is also lit up in blue, the colour of the NHS. Lordaposs Cricket Ground tweeted: Weaposre lighting the Pavilion blue tonight.On the weekend of @NHSEngland aposs birthday, weaposre joining with other landmarks from across the UK to #LightItBlue as we remember those we have sadly lost during the pandemic.The Eden Project in Cornwall, the windmill in Lytham St Annes in Lancashire, the arch at Wembley Stadium and The Royal Albert Hall are some other iconic venues to also light up blue tonight. And across the country, members of the public have lit candles and placed them in their windows in paying tribute to our heroes. One person tweeted: #NeverForgotten#LightItBlue for those we have loved and lost due to COVID . Another said: Remembering those we have sadly lost during the pandemic. Shining a light in my window #LightItBlue#ThankYouTogether. Thinking about all those who are no longer with us... Light a candle #LightItBlue#NHS#NHSBirthday, another said.  The Covid- outbreak has been the greatest challenge the NHS has faced since it was founded on  July . Premier League stars and match officials applauded healthcare professionals and other key workers before games kicked-off on Saturday afternoon. At pm on Sunday, broadcasters will suspend normal transmissions to encourage everybody to stop what they’re doing and join with othersin their streets or neighbourhoods to applaud not just the NHS and other key workers but all those who have volunteered or helped keep services and community networks going. Sir Simon Stevens, NHS Chief Executive, said: This year has been the most challenging in NHS history, with staff displaying extraordinary dedication, skill and compassion to care for the , patients with COVID- who needed specialist hospital treatment and many others besides. During this testing time our nurses, doctors, physios, pharmacists and countless more colleagues were sustained by the support of the public, not least through the weekly applause for key workers. No health service, not even the NHS, could have coped alone with this coronavirus pandemic. From bus drivers and teachers to care staff and food retailers and, of course, the public who took action to stay at home to stop infection spreading, everyone played their part. The NHS’s birthday this year not only offers the opportunity for us to say thank you to the nation, but for us all to come together at pm to pause and recognise all the work which has taken place in the last months and say a heartfelt thank you. The clap for carers at pm on a Thursday night became an established ritual during the Covid- plague – and a focal point for unity among neighbours, streets and whole towns. The idea for this weekendaposs tribute came from the newly founded Together coalition, which includes the CBI, trades unions, the Scouts and Guides. Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury, said: “ My sincere hope is this weekend will serve as a powerful moment of remembrance, thanks and connection, as we come together and commit to helping to create kinder, closer more connected communities.” Others supporters include UK Sport, Clap for Carers founder Annemarie Plas and Baroness Doreen Lawrence. Ruth May, chief nursing officer for England, said: “Throughout its history the NHS has brought the whole country together, treating everyone based on need not ability to pay. So we’re honoured the Together coalition have chosen the NHS birthday to pull the country together.” Kwame Kwei-Armah, director of the Young Vic, said: “At a time when there is so much emphasis on what ides us, giving thanks and connecting with our communities is one of the things that unites us.” The last official Clap for Carers event was held on May .

Hand sanitiser was passed out to the guests and the coupleaposs witnesses had to sign the register, at St Georgeaposs Church in Leeds, with separate pens. But Heather and Tom finally wed, nearly four months after they had first intended to marry. Their original plans - a lavish ceremony in front of more than  guests at Greyfriars Kirk in Edinburgh - had to be axed because they were scheduled days into the lockdown back in March. Speaking from their home in Leeds, the devout Christians said: It wasnapost what we had planned but it was completely unique and really special. I know everyoneaposs wedding day is memorable but this one feels particularly memorable. Indeed, photos show some of the  or so guests wearing face masks in the church. Each seat in the building had a name label on the back to avoid people sitting down where others had sat.  Tape was put on the floor to help guests adhere to social distancing measures too. Heather, who is a PhD student, said: aposEveryone at the church has been so wonderful. They deep cleaned the church and set up a webcam so other friends and family could watch from home.

In documents lodged at the High Court this week, the Duchess of Sussex has insisted she was left “unprotected” by the Royal Family while pregnant with son Archie. It’s the latest salvo fired in her continuing fight with a newspaper over published extracts of a letter she sent to dad Thomas. And the stress of their new le is also said to be taking its toll on Harry who is missing the close bond he once had with his brother Prince William. The relative of Meghan, who does not want to be named, told the Sunday Mirror: “She has gone very quiet. I think she is likely to be feeling extremely low and probably struggling.  “The legal battle and the increased tension it’s created with the royals due to the information that’s coming out has to be putting a lot of strain on them both. “Meghan’s been a lot more distant and introverted over the last few weeks – her family is worried. And Harry must be tormented by his fractured family ties. He was particularly down on William’s birthday on June .” This week it emerged -year-old Meghan has named in court papers five friends who gave an interview to US People magazine defending her and criticising her father.But she denies authorising them to do it.  She insisted her friends spoke to the magazine only because they were worried for her. Meghan also claimed she had been the subject of numerous damaging and distressing articles, with Kensington Palace ordering her to say nothing but “no comment”. Her legal document stated: “As her friends had never seen her in this state before, they were rightly concerned for her welfare, specically as she was pregnant, unprotected by the Institution, and prohibited from defending herself.” The couple quit as frontline royals in January to move to Canada before settling in Los Angeles. Meghan is suing the Mail on Sunday for publishing extracts from the handwritten letter she sent to her father Thomas, , in August . It was written three months after he was unable to walk her down the aisle following a heart attack. The former Suits actress claims the letter was private.  The newspaper says Mr Markle wanted its content published to correct any  impression her friends had given about what it contained when they gave their magazine interviews. Meghan has identied one of her five pals, Friend A, as the person who told People magazine the letter said: “Dad, I’m so heartbroken. I love you. I have one father. “Please stop victimising me through the media so we can repair our relationship.”  In court documents Meghan claimed this was an “unfortunately inaccurate” portrayal of her letter, insisting many times she had known nothing of her closest friends’ decision to go public. Her friends now face the prospect of having to testy on oath in the High Court that this is true. Meghan is also believed to have been hit hard by her spat with long-time pal Jessica Mulroney who was caught up in a race row last month.

They caused confusion among locals as to whether or not they fell into the boundary. Now Leicester City Police have tweeted a further version of the map which covers the same lockdown area but has all the affected zone shaded in pink.Are you affected by the Leicester lockdown  Email  webnews@mirrorThe police say the latest version is more viewer-friendly, LeicestershireLive reports.The force is currently running Operation Integrate where it is policing two parts of the county with separate legal status. Within the lockdown zone, that covers the whole city and some outlying areas pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and cinemas are not yet allowed to re-open and non-essential shops had to close again. Outside the zone all those businesses can stay open or re-open from today.  The Leicester Lockdown has been put in place to try to stop infection after a recent spike of Coronavirus cases in the city. Last week, residents in villages were left baffled as one side of the street was inside the boundary, but the other was not. In Scraptoft, Kathleen McDonagh, , will have to wait at least two weeks before she can go to the pub or the hair salon.  In contrast, Veronica Cayless, also , who lives opposite her, is free to head to her local now as she is outside of the lockdown boundary. Itaposs a similar situation in Thurncourt, another area in Leicester. Residents in the lockdown boundary are separated by just a wooden picket fence. It has caused confusion for Helen Bale, , who lives inside the lockdown zone, but works outside of it.  My boss called me and said how does it fall for you  If I donapost go in, I donapost get paid. I just donapost see how it is going to work, she told Mail Online. Neighbour Lisa Jones, , was also left confused by the measures as she too lives in the lockdown area but isnapost sureshe can cross the other side of the fence to go to the essential shops.

Mark “Billy” Billingham, a star of SAS Who Dares Wins, spoke out following the death of special forces medic Staff Sgt Jamie Ferguson, , who shot himself on an Army base last month. The Sunday People revealed he made a video saying: “I asked for help but no one was ­listening. They didn’t understand.” His widow Sammi, , who had a son with Jamie, and two daughters from another marriage, wants the Government to admit there is a problem with suicide in veterans’ and hold a full and open investigation into her husband’s death. Billy, , said: “It’s an absolute tragedy. You are not going to ­prevent all deaths but surely the MoD and the Army can do far more. It’s clear the MoD doesn’t care – once you’re out of the door it’s clear you are not its problem and that’s wrong. “The MoD doesn’t know how many veterans are killing themselves and that’s disgraceful – that ­disgusts me.” Staff Sgt Ferguson, originally from Leicestershire, joined up at  and was in the Royal Army Medical Corps. Among the hundreds of lives he saved with the SAS in Iraq and Afghanistan were victims of a  checkpoint ambush by a rogue Afghan cop in Helmand.  He was treated for post-traumatic stress last year after failing to save a soldier trampled by an ­elephant in an anti-poaching ­operation in Malawi. MPs last week told the Sunday People his ­suicide, at Leuchars Military Base, Fe, should be a “catalyst for change” for the way that the MoD treats soldiers with mental health problems. Billy, who spent  years with the Paras and the SAS, said: “With over  veteran suicides since  that’s a dficult number to get your head around. “Why are they not getting help with PTSD or other mental health problems ” Billy, who has guarded A-list stars such as Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, has been ­decorated for bravery and had people die in his arms.He said he thought people with PTSD were weak until an SAS friend developed it. “I realised he had PTSD and it was something very real and very dangerous,” he recalled. Billy praised the Sunday People’s Save Our Soldiers campaign,which calls for an overhaul of how the MoD tackles PTSD and other mental health issues. He said there should be a ­specic centre giving veterans and ­members of the armed forces world class treatment rather than a ­“confusing” multi-agency approach.

Clips posted online show joyful people celebrating and engaging closely with those around them. However the Government had advised Brits continue to keep one metre apart from others despite allowing bars and restaurants to reopen on Saturday July . One man, who passed through the busy roads, told : Walking down old Compton Street felt like wading through a Petri dish.  And that was at about :pm. Not much chance to socially distance even just walking down the street. Another video shared online shows a man twerking against a car trying to navigate through the crowds. The twerker is moved on but the car struggles to get through Soho as other drinkers move into the road. In each video, police officers are seen but signicantly outnumbered by the drinkers. But police had warned Saturday night would be as busy as New Yearaposs Eve for forces across England. Nevertheless, the ugly scenes sparked a furious backlash on social media.  One shocked woman wrote on Twitter : Just seen scenesSoho pubs... my heart goes out to those health care workers and their families who died of Covid to save the rest of us... disgusting lack of respect. And one man shared video of groups gathered in the streets, writing: Soho lockdown is over. Another fumed: Just seen the scenes in Soho. Itaposs asthe health care workers who risked their lives trying to deal with the pandemic were just wasting their time. And Borough Market, also in the capital, was heaving with drinkers pictured sipping foamy pints. They too were bunched together on the street.  Experts predicted pub-goers would sink a staggering  million pints at , establishments across England on Saturday alone. Some opened their doors at am to accommodate the demand. But prices for beer, wine, cider and spirits were hiked as pubs, including Wetherspoons, desperately tried to make up for lost business. Nevertheless, people were queuing to get in some pubs across England. There was a wait of around an hour just to get inside The Regal, a Wetherspoon in Cambridge.  Meanwhile AE departments prepared for a surge in booze-fuelled patients by setting up tents outside hospitals to keep people socially distanced as they waited. Police in Devon and Cornwall said they received more than , reports, most of which were drink-related, while police in West Yorkshire were called to a safety concern at a village pub near Bradford.

These are teachers abrogating their responsibilities in favour of making money. I feel sorry for the talented, hard-working teachers who have thought up imaginative ways of teaching pupils during lockdown and whose efforts have been undermined by these few rotten apples. But Omar, a full-time mathematics teacher, was adamant moonlighting would not clash with commitments at a secondary school.He was exposed as part of a Mail on Sunday investigation, which saw an undercover reporter pose on a website as a prospective parent.Omar said: At the moment I am working from home due to Covid-, hence the all day [availability].  He gave no comment to the publication when the reporter revealed their identity in the end. Pavan, a maths teacher at a Birmingham secondary school, was also exposed and has since deleted her online account for work. She was reportedly adamant his £ hour-long tutorials would not hamper her main job. Yes I’m able to do school hours depending on time and day. I teach via Zoom. One-to-one at GCSE is £, she said. I am going into school but not everyday – we are on a rota basis –some days from home some from school. So Wednesday Thursday will work well for me.

The creatures have suddenly collapsed into heaps on the ground since the start of May in the Okavango Panhandle region.The government is yet to explain what has happened to the animals but has ruled out poaching, as all the carcasses have remained intact. But National Park Rescue is concerned at what it believes is slow progress. Mark Hiley, co-founder of National Park Rescue, said today: Elephants began dying in huge numbers in early May and the government would normally respond within days to an event of this scale. Yet here we are, months later, with no testing completed and with no more information than we had at the start.Mass elephant deaths on this scale are almost unprecedented, certainly in Botswana. A potential correlation between these and the coronavirus pandemic is yet to be ruled out.Youaposre not going to be able to get the elephants to do social-distancing, and youaposre not going to be able to inoculate them, Chris Thouless, head of research at Save the Elephants, said.  But the professional doesnapost believe authorities are dragging their feet. He continued: This is pretty remote country, hearing about the carcasses, getting in there, taking a whole range of samples, knowing how and where to get them from, ... that is a pretty dficult task. Mmadi Reuben, principal veterinary officer in the Department of Wildle and National Parks, said: A government investigating team has been on the ground since the first cases were reported. Botswana responded swtly.

Some countries given the green light from July  still have their borders closed to British tourists, and holiday firms claim utter confusion is putting people off from booking a trip.Only  of the  approved destinations are open to British arrivals without any restrictions, with some countries forcing travellers to undergo health screening at airports or provide up-to-date test results proving they donapost have coronavirus. Confusion over air corridors and restrictions means airlines are planning their schedules hand to mouth and holidaymakers should brace for flights to be cancelled or changed. Travel industry leaders hit out at the government for publishing contradictory advice for holidaymakers - the Department for Transportaposslist of approved destinations conflicts with guidance from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office . They have called for a single list of countries where there are no restrictions for Britons.Noel Josephides, the chairman of Sunvil, told the Sunday Times: It is highly confusing for travellers. We have two dferent sets of advice it is very odd. Itaposs as though government departments donapost actually speak to each other. All we want is one list.Travel consultant Paul Charles, from the Quash Quarantine campaign, claims Britons were being put off from booking trips abroad. He said: There is utter confusion: the two lists do not tally and consumers are going to be extremely confused. Currently, people have to check both lists, the government website for entry requirements and also contact the country they want to visit to make sure the information is up to date. The DfT published its travel corridor list of  destinations, plus  British Overseas Territories, on Friday. English travellers can visit without having to quarantine for  days upon their . Australia and Canada, for example, are on the DfTaposs list but both remain closed to British arrivals.  The Cayman Islandsapos borders are still closed to people who are not citizens or legal residents. People who arenapost citizens will have to quarantine at a government facility for  days at their own expense. Direct flights to Greece are banned until July . Visitors to Austria will have to provide a negative Covid- test that is less than four days old. In the Bahamas, the test result must be less than  days old and passengers must undergo a temperature check.  In addition to restrictions, British travellers also have to worry about their flights being cancelled or changed.Airlines expert John Strickland, director of JLS Consulting, told the Mail on Sunday: A number of airlines are planning their schedules on a very short term, hand to mouth basis.Several airlines have planned flights and put them on sale, only to find that Government policies and regulatory conditions in one country or another have meant that it is not possible to operate and have then had to cancel them and go back to square one. I don’t believe airlines are deliberately or maliciously cancelling flights. The colour-coded traffic light system decides which countries are considered safe to travel to.  Green is given to approved countries, amber is for countries considered less safe, and red means passengers ing from those countries will need to self-isolate for  days. The DfT published a list of  countries and territories where English tourists can visit without self-isolating on their . It features popular short-haul destinations such as Spain, France, Italy, Turkey, Greece and Cyprus, as well as long-haul locations including Australia, Barbados, Hong Kong, Japan, New Zealand and Vietnam. China, Portugal, Thailand, the Males and the US are among the notable absentees. The FCO published a separate list of  countries and territories which will be exempt from its advisory against all non-essential travel from Saturday, making it easier for UK tourists to be covered by travel insurance while visiting.

They make everything months in advance and base their numbers on last year’s sales figures.“No one was expecting such an increase in demand.”Gordon Farquharson, from Spokes on Annfield Road, also said that “no one could have ever predicted” such a rise in sales.He said their shop – which has remained open throughout lockdown and its workers are classed as key workers – even struggled to get bikes at one point.He said: “The demand completely outstripped supply.“People were coming in and just taking what we had without trying them, on bikes anything from £ to £,.“We were struggling for tyres and tubes at one point too.“We always managed to get them from somewhere, they were a lot more expensive than out usual suppliers but we would rather that than have nothing to offer the customer.”Gordon says suppliers are now starting to sell their  stock of bikes to keep up with demand.He added: “It is starting to get better now, we’re finding it easier to get hold of stock.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

That was something a lot of us considered.“Given everything that has gone clubs will just be glad it’s happening atall.“The fact things have improved over the last few weeks is allowing us to still have this competition.“But it is still a long way to go yet before we get to August .“Hopefully things keep moving in the right direction so that we can play the tournament.”With the first three qualying rounds up to the play-offs now one legged the Reds will need the luck of the draw to land a Pittodrie tie.Home advantage in the all or nothing tie will be determined by the first team out of the hat in the draw.Aberdeen had initially been scheduled to kick off their Europa League on July  but that entry has been pushed back seven weeks due to Covid-.McInnes and his squad, along with Motherwell, will discover their first qualying round opponents at the UEFA draw on Monday August .The draw for the second round, where Premiership runners-up Rangers enter, will be made on Monday August .The Europa League second round will be played on September  with the third round on September  and play off on October .McInnes recently said he hoped there would be some financial assistance from UEFA for clubs drawn away from home in the one legged ties.Away trips will bring the expenditure of flights and hotel stays without the chance to offset that spend by home gate income.Any home games in the qualiers for Aberdeen will be played behind closed doors.Aberdeen hope to have as many as , supporters back to Pittodrie in October, after the Europa League qualiers,the Scottish Government’s easing of lockdown restrictions allow.However Scotland’s Fist Minister Nicola Sturgeon has urged caution over October for the phasedof fans.McInnes said: “One legged ties is something that was mooted a few weeks ago.“Obviously the Europa League has still to be concluded from last season.“There is also the fact that games that are normally played in June and July will now be in the back end of August.“One legged ties kind of makes sense and was expected to be honest.“It will be a dferent competition in the early stages because of that.”McInnes will attempt to lead Aberdeen into the group stages of the Europa League for the first time in seven attempts next season.In the previous six years the Reds have fallen at the third qualying round five times and exited at the second qualying stage once, to English Premier League Burnley.In preparation for the new season Aberdeen signed winger Jonny Hayes on a two year contract following his exit from Celtic.A deal for Hayes, , could only be completed because the Republic of Ireland international offered to defer his wages for a year.Due to the Covid- pandemic and predicted £m losses McInnes is for now unable to bring in new signings.It could be a case of one out for one to come inthe Reds sell a player although the club are adamant there will be no fire-sale despite the losses during the coronavirus shutdown.McInnnes is confident he will have a strong squad next season.He said: “With a clean bill of health I feel we can go and compete and achieve what we want to this season.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 22 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,Mental Health Awareness Week, now in its th year, runs from May  to May .This year, the theme for the week is kindness and across the country, people will be celebrating kindness in digital and creative ways within social distancing restrictions.The last couple of months, with all the uncertainty of the virus and the impact of lockdown, have been an extremely stressful and worrying time for many people across the Highlands and Islands. People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"midweek joy for golfer david","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDavid Ronald took the honours in the first midweek stableford at Tarbert Golf Club, with a fantastic score of  points.He was on target to break  for the first time but finished with a double bogey for a , still a great score.

moon.Therefore, the moon cannot shine ndash because its surface is not reflecting the sunrsquos rays.The eclipse will be visible over ScotlandAccording to TimeAndDate, a penumbral lunar eclipse occurs

with the other part of its shadow.People in Scotland are urged to find an unobstructed area with a free sight to the southwest for a best view of the eclipse.Unlike solar eclipses, which can only be

up with a great idea to give back, so pound from every mask will go to NHS charities and other small charities.ldquoThey are really nice to wear since theyrsquore a natural fibre, and ever since we opened theyrsquove been incredibly popular.\"When the pandemic hit, engineer and entrepreneur Gavin McAdam got to work creating masks.His Edinburgh-based start-up Breathe Easy began by asking only for donations to try and help the third-party care sector and vulnerable groups get access to quality medical-grade face masks.And when someone got in touch askingMr McAdam could create a face mask for their deaf son, the company set about creating and trialling a cotton face mask with a transparent plastic face .Now Breathe Easy continues to issue free face masks to a iety of charities around Scotland, but also sells both full cotton masks and those with transparent  for deaf and hard of hearing communities on their website.Owner Gavin McAdam said: ldquoWersquore growing all the time and employing more people to keep up with demand.ldquoWersquore also working in partnership with the National Manufacturing Institute and Glasgow University in the development of a novel material that has natural microbial properties, engineered to capture the exact particle size of the Covid- virus.\"We will be trialling the first of these masks in two or three weeks.\"Slanj Kilts recently came into the limelight when Nicola Sturgeon was seen wearing one of their latest wares.The First Minister was spotted modelling the homeless tartan design, which sees % of all its sales donated to Shelter.General Manager Ross Lyall said: ldquoWe started making face masks in February in anticipation of lockdown. Sales were trickling through, but then of course Nicola wore our mask, and it went mental.ldquoThe traditional kilt business is dependent on the wedding industry, so we were very worried about the way things are at the moment and asking ourselves where the money is going to come fromthere are no weddings.ldquoSuddenly we had thousands of orders going through, so we are currently trying to recruit as many sowers as possible to keep up with demand.As an Aberdeen-based brand known for its lingerie, this company is now also producing cloth masks in a iety of dferent colours and prints, with a pocket for a filter, for only pound..Designer Hazel Lethaby, founder of Mischke Lingerie said:\"We have a passion for making small and beautul things and firmly believe that the Devil is in the detail.\"I started making masks as I saw a need to use my skills to produce something for the general public so that there was no need for people to buy up supplies of medical grade equipment.\"The masks I make are not designed as PPE but can be worn to comply with the guidelines in stores and on public transport.\"I am using mainly % cotton gingham as it has a stylish and playful look and its easy to wash, making the masks more sustainable. The design is also zero waste, there are no offcuts!\"Owner of this Kirkaldy bridal store Mirka Jankowska has been hard at workcollaboratingwith Laila Letteringto produce limited edition face masks during lockdown.For each face mask purchase Mirka Bridal Couture are donatinga face mask to the Childrenrsquos Oncology Ward in Edinburgh who are in need of reusable face masks for their young patients and their families.Julie Macintyre, from Dalkieth near Edinburgh has pressed pause on making bags to create beautul Harris Tweed face masks.After trialling several designsshe found that the above product, with % cotton lining, was most comfortable to wear.This independent store has added face masks to its list of handmade items, which already includes bottle light lamps, hand-knitted items, handmade cards, and jewellery.The face masks come in a wide range of colours and patterns, are washable and double lined with a filter pocket."},{"url":null,"title":"wetherspoons-reopening-9-rules-every-customer-must-follow","story":"While the pubs and bars will be allowed to open for limited table service, a strict set of rules will be in place.Here is what Wetherspoons has said.The pub chain has one venue in East Lothian, in Musselburgh.When are they reopening across the UK The company have confirmed they will reopen in the following nations on these dates:The chain isprovisonally planning to reopen inWalesandNorthern Irelandon Monday, July .What rules will Wetherspoons enforce JD Wetherspoon reopened  of its branches across England onJuly , with pub goers required to follow a number of new safety measures during their visit.Pubs will open from am, with breakfast to be served until .am, followed by the main menu thereafter.The menu has been slightly reduced to minimise the amount of food produced from more than one kitchen workstation, and a reduced range of condiments will be provided in sachets.The pub chain has invested pound million into making sure both staff and customers are kept safe when branches reopen, and has warned that during the first few weeks, some pubs may close earlier than normal.Customers are advised to check online for details of their local Wetherspoons.Here are nine rules that pub goers will have to follow at every Wetherspoons pub fromJuly .Queues to enterWhere possible, outdoor areas will be marked for customers to queue to enter pubs, and only one entry point will be used, with a separate exit point.Entrance doors will also be pinned open to increase air flow and reduce hand contact points.The number of people allowed in at one time will be limited, so customers will have to wait outside until a table becomes free.Signage will be installed inside pubs, offering guidance and direction for customers when they enter.Hand sanitiser on entryA hand sanitiser station will be placed at the entrance, with customers asked to clean their hands before they go inside.There will be an average of  hand sanitiser stations at most pubs for customers to use, positioned at the entrance, bar, outside toilets and other locations.Small groups onlyJD Wetherspoon is discouraging people to visit in large groups, or to congregate in the pub after arrival.Customers will be asked to disperse around the pub,capacity allows, or leave the premises.Order and pay via the appCustomers are encouraged to order using the Wetherspoon app, where possible, directly from their table.Where customers are unable to order from their table, such as they donrsquot have a smartphone, they will instead be allowed to order from one of the designated till points at the bar.

Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus.

It may just be the run of great weather through the spring, or the slightly slower pace meaning we can all take the time to enjoy it that bit more. Maybe it is the quieter streets helping us hear the birdsong better, but many folk canrsquot help thinking the reduced traffic and less mowing ndash just less interference all round ndash makes for a much healthier relationship between us and the wildle with which we share our towns and country.For me, the most striking thing is quite how vibrant and green everything has become in a single season without feet tramping over plants or mowers chopping through them. It is almost asnature is just waiting in the wings when we are gone the world around us will recover in the blink of an eye. Thatrsquos one of the most powerful things about the living word, and plants in particular. They donrsquot need us, but we definitely need them. Plants provide us with food, drink and medicines, they clothe us, provide building materials, shape our myths and give us the very oxygen we breathe.Modern society often fools itself into feeling removed from plants, but the vast majority of humanityrsquos cultures are profoundly shaped by the green world around us, and Scotland is no exception. Its rich heritage of plant lore shows how the countryrsquos flora has shaped our history, from the earliest inhabitants right through to the present day. Hints come from archaeological finds ndash ancient log boats hewn from huge, single trees show the importance of the coast and rivers to hunter-gatherer and early settled communities. This is understandable when much of the interior was covered in deep forest. These forests evidently harboured some huge trees,the boats are anything to go by.Millennia of exploitation, climate change and \"land management\" mean there are very few trees as large and straight as these left in Scotland, so we have to imagine these early post-Ice Age times as a primal world, where hunting and gathering were the fundamentals of le. Modern foragers find there is a huge wealth of interesting botanical fayre out there ndash a topic wersquollto later.Plant pollen found in ious Bronze-Age cups and beakers suggest a culture where honey, mead and beer were important aspects of either daily or ritual le, with many of the plant finds potential flavourings for the drinks. Interestingly, brewers and distillers have turned to many of these same species in making modern concoctions, supporting the huge growth in artisan beers and gins.Another wonderful find is the lsquohair-moss caprsquo found in the defensive ditch around the Roman fort of Newstead, near Melrose in the Borders. Woven from the tough stems of the woodland-dwelling hair-moss, Polytrichum, this enigmatic artefact prompts many questions ndash who made it  A Roman soldier, camp attendant or member of a native tribe  Why was it literally lsquoditchedrsquo  Is it a cap, or something   The now peat-blackened stems form a frill of hair around the cap, so my pet theory is that it was the forerunner of the lsquosee-you Jimmyrsquo wigs you can buy in tourist shops. Or maybe not.One of the big issues with archaeological botany is how to interpret these botanical finds. The fact that hazel shells pop up in ancient middens all the time might reflect hazelnutsrsquo popularity and value as nutritious foods or the fact they remain fresh for months. Or it might just be because the hazel shells are tough and survive through to the present while softer fruits, leaves and other parts of the hunter-gatherer diet rot away, giving us a  impression of people who appeared to eat nothing but hazels and shellfish ndash sounds quite posh actually.In more recent times, we are very fortunate that people had the foresight to research and record many fascinating uses ndash one of the champions of this was Sir Robert Sibbald. A th century physician, botanist and eventually Geographer Royal to the Scottish Crown, his passion for plants and their uses led him and friend Andrew Balfour to establish the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh. This year is the Botanicsrsquo th anniversary and from a small plot of land behind the Palace of Holyrood House, this institution has grown into a pioneer of international research and collaboration on plant ersity and conservation.Sibbaldrsquos pamphlet entitled Provision for the Poor in Time of Dearth and Scarcity was an attempt to list all the edible things in Scotland in case crops failed and famine reared its head again as it had in the \"Seven Ill years\" of the s. Provision for the Poor lists a great many edible plants that could be foraged, as well as many fish, fowl and other animals including wildcat and pine marten ndash essentially the bat or pangolin of their day in Europe. More than one hundred species of plants are listed in the book, although with names such as ldquothe small hemlock chervil with the rough seeds it could be a bit of a lottery trying to identy the correct plant. Chervil would be tasty, while hemlock would be deadly. This one sounds most like bur-chervil, a relatively rare plant which has been eaten in the past. Strangely, Sibbald does not mention a single mushroom, reflecting the Scottish and wider British dread of a fatal error while mushroom hunting.Sibbald does, however, reserve space for seaweeds. Coastal communities across Scotland ate plenty of this nutritious resource, and it was likely on the menu for those earliest settlers millennia before. Martin Martin, a native of Skye was commissioned by Sibbald to document the land, people and natural history of the Gaelic-speaking parts of the country through the late s. His renowned account A Description of the Western Islands of Scotland mentions many uses for seaweeds as fertilisers, snacks and medicines. Carrageen pudding was made from carrageen seaweed and is still made widely today. It needs plenty of flavouring ndash traditionally lemon, pepper or vinegar. Reminiscent of a supernaturally bland cregraveme caramel it was thought particularly good for invalids recovering from stomach problems. The jelly-like chemicals in the seaweed help to set the milk for the pudding. Called carrageenans, they can be found in a host of modern products as gelling agents.Seaweeds are fascinating group. As dferent from most land plants as we are, these marine algae are abundant and wonderfully erse. The burned ash of some of the big brown seaweeds was the basis for Scotlandrsquos kelp industry in the th and th centuries. Thousands of tonnes of mineral-rich seaweed ash were produced annually and made many of the lairds in coastal areas very wealthy men. The same could not be said of the crofting families that were set to making the pits on the beach, hauling the weed and tending the fires as they smouldered. Parts of the Orkney archipelago were likened to volcanoes because of the smoke billowing up day and night from the shores. The kelp ash was very versatile ndash as a fertiliser, for bleaching linen or use in glassmaking. Inevitably, cheaper replacements were found over time and the bottom had fallen out of the industry by the s. The lairds who had grown comfortable on the profits of the industry looked straightaway to the next big thing ndash sheep. The failure of Scotlandrsquos kelp industry went hand-in-hand with the Highland Clearances.Tracing where these ideas about plants and their uses come from, and how they change on their journey, is fascinating. Plant medicines are a great source of such stories. St Johnrsquos Wort is an excellent example ndash it appears in classical Roman literature as fuga daemonum ndash the chaser of demons. It was widely used as a medicine throughout Europe from Classical times ndash the idea possibly spreading with the Romans, although one of its names in Gaelic suggests a strong connection to the Celtic god Lug who filled a similar role to St John as a shining, heroic sort. Of course, in Gaelic Christianity, the plant became St Columbarsquos plant and was known by one curious name reported by Alexander Carmichael: \"armpit package of St Columba\". Pieces of the plant were tucked into the oxter, where the sweat and hair would presumably break up the plant and allow the active \"demon-chasing\" principle into the thin skin of the armpit. This is a beautully elegant interpretation of the plantrsquos antidepressant compounds. If you were beset by devils, an interpretation of psychiatric issues such as depression, then surely the power of a saint or a god working through the plant would vanquish those demons.We still do not understand how St Johnrsquos wort works as an antidepressant and it can have signicant, dangerous interactions with other medicines, but it is just one example of a rich folklore building up around a real-le bit of biochemistry. How  would people have interpreted this seemingly magical property of the plant  The sinister associations of foxglove with witches, the dead or fairy-folk reflect a poison still used as a medicine in heart conditions today. There are many other examples of intriguing tales where a botanical story might hold the key to a new medicine, and many where the story is seemingly just that ndash a story. Why, for example, do witches supposedly fear rowan trees  Is it the red berries or some other property lost to time ndash and has anyone actually done a proper double-blind scientic research study on it  Of course it doesnrsquot matter why, but just take a look at how many gardens have a rowan tree by the gate and you can see that these stories run deep in the cultural psyche.As well as the ideas and stories, our flora also contains many plants that were brought here by humans, either intentionally or by happy accident. These are the lsquonon-nativersquo flora and actually make up about half the species we find in Scotland today. The vast majority of these are rare, often limited to the port towns where they arrived, or the gardens they were cultivated in. A very few of them can be invasive, but they have all contributed to ersity of our new flora. In the face of climate change and globalisation, the flora changes all the time, and many species, both native and non-native are hugely adaptable. Watch this spaceas the sweet cicely brought by monastic communities from central Europe as a flavouring and strewing herb evolves into a unique new iety or species cut off from its original populations.Many traditionally useful plants are important parts of Scotlandrsquos ancient native habitats. These are precious and unique places with global signicance for bioersity. The incredibly rich Atlantic oakwoods ndash our local \"west-coast rainforest\" ndash have a profusion of lichens, mosses and ferns, but are potentially threatened by development.

Food factories and meat plants in the US, Europe and the UK have become Covid- hotspots. Most recently, a chicken plant in Anglesey, Wales, had to shut down when  employees tested positive out of a total workforce of .Expect the usual ldquoI told you so interpretation of this phenomenon from vegan propagandists who seize any opportunity to frame their usual suspect: meat production. But itrsquos not the type of food ndash animal or plant-based ndash these factories handle that creates the problem.One suspected cluster of cases, for instance, has occurred in a Chinese factory that manufactures crisps. Itrsquos the physical set-up.Food factories donrsquot do Doors Open Days, and for good reason. If we saw how the products we buy, so slickly presented on supermarket shelves, were produced inside such places, it would kill our appetite for them.When I was researching my book Swallow This, which investigates the processed food industry, I inveigled myself into several factories that supply the major multiples, and take it from me, itrsquos no mystery why people get ill working in such environments, or why they have such high staff turnovers. They are horrible places to work in. Food manufacturers want us to think that these factories are just like a scaled up version of a domestic kitchen. But they more resemble car plants and oil refineries, or even the missile-launching pad at the end of Dr No, where James Bond sabotages the efforts of a small army of operatives, lost and almost robotic-looking inside their bulky protective clothing.Whether theyrsquore turning out packs of chicken pieces or vegan lasagna, chilled food factories operate in similar ways. To inhibit the growth of dangerous food poisoning bacteria, such as campylobacter and listeria, the ambient temperature in most zones of food factories is bitingly raw and cold. It chills you down to the bone marrow. Covid- appears to love such conditions. So therersquos problem number one.Thanks to the sheer scale and heft of the machinery in these factories, the noise is deafening. Staff usually get given ear plugs, but when they do have to communicate, they have to shout. Shouting appears to increase the risk of spreading coronavirus problem number two.Problem number three  Letrsquos call it inadequate physical distancing because therersquos nothing sociable about standing closely on a factory line arranging vegan nuggets on trays, or checking that each jalfrezi barbecue skewer has the stipulated four chunks of meat.I wouldnrsquot last an hour in one of these places, let alone get through the demanding shts that workers typically put in ndash  hours isnrsquot unusual, sometimes nightsht. Thatrsquos problem four right there: factory workers have protracted exposure in circumstances where coronavirus flourishes.And that includes sharing tables in the canteen. The one I saw was small and intimate compared to the factory floor. Its dish of the day was bigos, the Polish meat and sauerkraut stew.Housing presents us with problem five. Staff often share living quarters ndash basic accommodation is frequently part of the employment package ndash and workers are bussed from there to the factory and back again after their sht. The Unite union says that staff often struggle into work when they feel sick because theyrsquore scared of their pay being docked.Bottom line  Yoursquod need a very strong immune system to work in one of these factories at the very best of times, let alone when coronavirus is around.This should give us pause to think. The industrial food system didnrsquot create Covid-, but its workplaces are a vector for it. Surely an essential requirement for any sane food economy should be that it creates safe jobs for the people who work in it "},{"url":null,"title":"Opinion  Rosemary Goring  Why the Border must regain its old role as the country   s first line of defence","story":"Yet she is clearly unsettled at the idea of some kind of checkpoint on the A, A, or whichever route she might take. Speculation over testing or quarantining travellers between England and Scotland has been raised as part of a discussion of how to prevent infection from a neighbour with a higher incidence of Covid  than here. As a result, almost overnight the Border has begun to assume a signicance it has not held for centuries.:Thousands back petition to close Scottish border to all but essential trafficThis pandemic might one day be viewed as a textbook illustration of the geopolitical fault lines across the UK. What was once a united front has splintered into four distinct nations, each with a dferent solution to the same problem. Nothing more starkly demonstrates the gulf between the laissez-faire ethos of the Westminsterrsquos panjandrums and the commonsensical attitude at Holyrood than the ways in which they have eased restrictions.The increasingly relaxed English regime appears to be fuelled by wishful thinking rather than science the Scottish situation, meanwhile, is characterised by caution. Long before talk of checkpoints, this was already causing tension. When Englandrsquos routemap out of lockdown was weeks ahead of Scotland, John Lamont, Conservative MP for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk, said those of his constituents close to Borisrsquos bailiwick were confused. Why did one rule apply to their very near neighbours, and another to them The answer seemed obvious ndash it was far too soon to relax ndash but the question vividly demonstrated the nature of this area. Many who live where Hadrianrsquos men boldly marched have a foot in both countries. They might work in one, and live in the other, hail from this side and have relocated to that. They could have family and friends in either camp, who remained out of reach for so long as the Scottish government prohibited meeting.Those Border villagers who defied lockdown to visit a garden centre in Berwick were making a political rather than a horticultural statement. In this, they echoed attitudes since the days of the great reiving clans, who roamed freely on both banks of the Tweed. The Scottish and English kings were so appalled at the regionrsquos lawlessness that, despite being sworn enemies, they worked in tandem to subdue it.Given the way Borderers were treated by their lieges, itrsquos no surprise they thumbed their noses. These days, towns and villages are awash with folk from both sides, thereby creating a unique and strongly bonded region. Little wonder Unionism still pertains hereabouts.:Tourists from England could face -day quarantine in ScotlandCovid- cases flareThat there have been no deaths from Covid  in Scotland for the past few days suggests we are heading in the right direction. But there is a long way still to go. The First Ministerrsquos aim is to eradicate the virus, not merely contain it. Seeing the daily tally of new cases and deaths in England, she seeks confirmation that the Prime Minister has the same objective. But, as she said earlier this week, without such assurances she fears Englandrsquos strategy is ldquoletting it circulate at higher levels as long as it doesnrsquot threaten to overwhelm the NHS.If that is indeed the case, then monitoring passage between the countries is in some respects no dferent from policies implemented by a place like New Zealand. It initially imposed an outright ban on entry, followed later by quarantine on new arrivals. The problem is, as a devolved nation within a union, the consequences of such a step are potentially inflammatory. Some will view it as independence by stealth, a confrontational declaration of autonomy, or simply authoritarianism run rampant. Yet with a summer of staycations approaching, the repercussions of allowing untrammelled travel could be dire.Before the prospect of imposing controls was mooted, people around where I live in Roxburghshire have been scowling at visitors from only a few miles away, let alone the depths of the English shires. When a couple of walkers dared ask a neighbour directions over the hills last week, they narrowly avoided a tirade.The idea of the Border ing to its roots as a frontier inevitably creates a troubling sense of Them and Us, or Friend and Foe. Affront will be taken at any restriction on free transit between south and north. Presumably residents of Scotland who visit England will also be tested or quarantined on their , making it a two-way injunction. Suddenly a weekend break in Northumberland looks a lot less appealing.:YouGov Poll: Half of Conservative voters in England support English independenceYet how exactly would it work  Is it only tourists who will be checked, or will those travelling back and forth for work, be they lorry drivers or business reps, also be subject to testing  Will every road, rail and sea route across the Border from Berwick to Workington be patrolled  Might we see a surge in midnight crossings over no-manrsquos land and rivers, four-by-fours finally justying their existence and canoes retrofitted to ferry families plus their luggage across the Tweed As things stand, there have been no new cases of the virus in the Scottish Borders in two weeks. This beautul, windswept district is starting to feel like a cordon sanitaire, a buffer between the haves and,not precisely the have-nots, then a population beginning slowly but steadily to paralyse the disease.Given our reputation as one of the sickest countries in Europe, we need to take every precaution to protect lives. Reimposing the Border as a barrier and guard would not be popular, and the war-time and military resonances are unsettling. Yet, in light of the high risk of contagion still posed by parts of the south, in the short term it would make sense. If the first thing passengers see as they arrive is not a sig welcoming them to Scotland but an NHS squad, then for the first time since  ndash the last pitched battle between England and Scotland ndash the Border will have regained its old role as the countryrsquos first line of defence.All columnists are free to express their opinions.

The objects of ire are campervans.I would agree there are issues to be resolved, but the character of tourism has changed dramatically in recent times.Many campervanners donrsquot want to stay in campsites because they lack the flexibility the modern tourist wants. Traditional holidays on campsites were planned in advance and people spent the entire holiday in one place. That doesnrsquot suit todayrsquos active travel market.Campervans offer people the chance to visit and explore areas of Scotland. They just need somewhere to safely park for the night ndash a non-muddy, level stretch of ground.Many campsites are now charging upwards of pound-pound a night and these five-star set-ups are greatyou want all the facilities on offer. Better to have a network of -star budget campsites ndash the corner of a farmerrsquos field, for example.Also, most campsites only open between Easter and September.There are a number of alternatives to campsites already in existence and more enlightened communities have set up overnight parking areas for campervans for a small fee. I have used such facilities in Kinlochbervie, Findhorn, the Glen Coe ski area and throughout the Western Isles.Rather than suggest \"banning\" camper vans from overnight parking can I suggest community councils look at ways of helping to create an infrastructure that will provide safe, low-cost overnight parking whilst creating a source of income for the communities themselves  We only have to look at the success of the Aires network in most European countries to realise that here in Scotland we are decades behind in how we treat this kind of tourism.Campervans already provide a considerable amount of money to rural economies. Owners buy fuel for their vehicles, eat and drink in local restaurants and pubs and buy supplies from supermarket and small village shops. In a country that claims to be progressive I find it extraordinary that community councils should actively oppose camper van tourism.Making informal camping by camper vans illegal would require a major change to UK traffic law, so that is extremely unlikely. Far better for community councils to work together with organisations like the Campervan and Motorhome Professional Associtionto develop a more positive, welcoming and beneficial way forward, to Scotlandrsquos benefit.Cameron McNeish, Newtonmore."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-view-time-braver-easing-lockdown","story":"Only cautious and provisional, though, not just because those have characterised the moves out of lockdown, and there are economic reasons to be pessimistic about their effects, but because even for the health results ndash which look much more heartening ndash we need to bear in mind that much is still unknown.On current evidence, it looks asthe Scottish Government has handled the urgent issues, those literally of le and death, reasonably well,far from perfectly. It may be that it has done so more effectively than the UK Government it has certainly looked more competent, and deserves to be commended for that.But until we can realistically compare international data, reliably test the rate of infection, and have information about levels of immunity , it is too early to say so definitively.There is still no cure, no vaccine, and no indication of whether a second, even worse, spike is likely. It is even theoretically possible that countries with what look like the worst results now will fare best in the long run, though to pin hopes on that would certainly have been an unreasonable basis for government responses. The trouble is that no one knows, so the precautionary principle ndash what scientists lean on when the science is uncertain ndash is the obvious approach to the medical risks.The damage wrought by coronavirus is not merely to health, however: while it is understandable, and correct, that the Government should have made that the immediate priority, it also has to consider other costs and risks.In education, employment, the economy ndash particularly tourism, hospitality, arts and retail sectors ndash welfare, taxation and other issues, excessive caution has produced devastating, measurable costs, not all economic. Some, including poverty, home care for the vulnerable and the impact on non-covid medical treatment, from transplants to chemo to mental health, threaten lives and qualities of le as seriously as the coronavirus.It was always impossible completely to eradicate risk from le , and accepting that is still true in the age of coronavirus should inform the Governments approach to emerging from lockdown.

Scotland did not invent the modern world. At best, we were one of many small nations whose people contributed some of the ideas and ingenuity that improved our shared human experience. The Declaration of Arbroath did not inspire the fathers of American independence. Can we not just appreciate it for what it is without making extravagant claims on its behalf Perhaps Irsquom being too unkind. Unlike many successful entrepreneurs who are content to enjoy the fruits of othersrsquo endeavours without paying anything back, Sir Tom seems like a caring chap whorsquos sincere about leaving the world better than he found it. His foundation has helped many iniduals and groups to grow wings and fly. When it comes to blowing smoke up our fundaments, though, hersquod be advised to leave it to the politicians who can do it without thinking.Yet, when you eventually did drill down to the essence of his homily there were some sound conclusions, evenit was a little light on specics, a charge he levelled at Benny Higgins. Mr Higgins is the Scottish Governmentrsquos new best friend and he had also issued us with his roadmap to recovery. Mr Higgins says he is no fan of paying everyone a fair universal income. This is hardly surprising as the mere prospect of this would have caused his former employers at Tesco to reach for the Diocalm.Sir Tom rightly concluded that Scotlandrsquos small to medium enterprisesheld the key to recovery over the next five years, though he ought to press for a more nimble and adroit approach to public sector procurement. He also wrote passionately about the need to consider ideas from a wider arc of talents.ldquoDo not have the civil service or your agencies write an implementation plan for a customer they donrsquot really understand, he urged Nicola Sturgeon. ldquoLet us in business take this on, trust business to do it and work with you on this, he added.Yet, while I may be inclined to trust an entrepreneur with a veriable track record of making ladders rather than pulling them up, Irsquod demur at ceding signicant influence to the wider business community. Were it not for the sharp practices, profiteering and predatory instincts of large corporations wersquod be looking at the future with a shade more optimism.The biggest weakness in Sir Tomrsquos diagnosis and cure was the absence of anything resembling collectivism. It was all top-down when it needs to build from the shop-floor. The key to a well-managed and fair route away from the privations of coronavirus lies not in giving rich businessmen the idea that their ability to make money is the golden mean of a healthy economy.Any prescription that omits the trade union movement and the Living Wage Foundation simply wonrsquot work. The stagnation in the wages of our poorest-paid workers prevents them from supporting small businesses and building local economies. The tilt towards the tyranny of zero-hours contracts by the High Streetrsquos new cartels erodes the confidence of young people to make long-term financial and emotional commitments.Predatory behaviour such as this happens when trade unions are discouraged and the workforce is dehumanised and measured only in their profitability. No one is denying you the right to turn a reasonable profit but when you sacrice the right to dignity and respect in the workplace for it you arenrsquot running a business but a sweat-shop.The reasonable and fair deployment of capital permits all sections of society the chance to contribute. When this is distorted by greed and aice it quickly descends into unfettered capitalism. At times of mortal peril it begets disaster capitalism where billionaires feed on pestilence, war, famine and death and invest in those governments who specialise in making these happen. They have feasted on coronavirus.During these wretched months we have been at our best when those with very little have risked everything to maintain the lestyles of affluent people. The very worst of us was observed in the actions of Tim Witherspoon, Richard Branson and Willie Walsh, head of British Airwaysrsquo parent company IAG who, despite decades of massive profits instinctively sacriced their lowest-paid staff at the first hint of trouble.Itrsquos a template now being followed by those further down capitalismrsquos food-chain as tens of thousands of jobs disappear. Yet, no-one it seems is prepared to ask why our financial system always demands that those who are least able to cope with an economic challenge are the first to be jettisoned. Each Thursday we stood to applaud them and our NHS workers for their daily sacrice. Now that they are being fed to the wolves the applause must be ringing hollow in their ears.The myth of the lsquowealth-creatorsrsquo travels on the lie that an enlightened group of capitalist necromancers is solely responsible for their own success and that only through their natural beneficence are the rest of us blessed with a job. The truth is that the workers are the real wealth creators. If large corporations could discover a way of making profits without having to employ actual people theyrsquod escort us all from the building personally.By all means, Sir Tom ldquoengage the best brains from around the world your ldquojob-creators and entrepreneurs.

Like-for-like sales for the six weeks to September ,  were up .%.\"The outspoken Wetherspoon chiefhad faced criticism for once playing down the risks of people gathering in pubs during the pandemic at the time and insisted that the government was wrong to shut them down.In March, in the aftermath of Boris Johnson announcing the coronavirus lockdown, it emerged the pub chain denied it was ldquoabandoning its , staff and insisted it could not afford to pay them during the Covid- crisis until the company was reimbursed for their wages by the government.Details of the loan which were confirmed onJune .He angered workers and MPs after sending a video message to staff a few days before the official lockdown indicating they would no longer be paid while the company works out details of a ldquofurlough scheme under which the government will pay % of wages.He hinted they could seek work in Tesco, which was hiring staff to help it meet the countryrsquos need for food delivery and distribution,they needed employment in the meantime.Mr Martin, who donated pound, to Boris Johnsons General Electon campaign said at the time: ldquoCompanies like Costa, owned by Coca-Cola, and McDonaldrsquos, being owned by large multinationals, can afford to retain staff and commit to paying them, before details of the government furlough scheme are published.ldquoHowever, they are in a minority in the pub and restaurant trade. Most companies, including Wetherspoon, do not have the resources, while pubs are shut, to make this commitment and need to see details of the scheme in order to retain and pay staff, as the government has sensibly requested, rather than instigating large-scale layoffs.ldquoThat may seem stark, but thatrsquos the economic reality of the unprecedented situation in the UK today.But in a separate statement, Wetherspoon had blamed a ldquocomplete misinterpretation of its message to staff, although it did not dispute that they would cease to be paid after Friday while details of the furlough scheme were finalised.ldquoAs we understand it, tens of thousands of hospitality workers and others have already lost their jobs, but Wetherspoon is retaining all its employees, using the government scheme for the purpose for which it is intended, said a spokesperson.ldquoWetherspoon chairman Tim Martin said to employees in a video that supermarkets were urgently looking for staff, since all trade from pubs, restaurants and cafes had transferred to supermarkets in the last few days.ldquoWetherspoon has had urgent calls from supermarkets asking for help in recruitment. Tesco alone urgently needs , staff, we understand. Tim Martin said in the video that staff who wanted to work for Tesco should do so and they will be given first priority when Wetherspoon pubs reopen.ldquoWetherspoon believes that the actions it has taken are responsible and sensible in the dficult circumstances.Mr Martin, who played a leading role in campaigning for Brexit and as the Citys most outspoken critic of the EU, had been hoping for forecast sales for the year to July  to rise to pound.billion, up from pound.billion.Mr Martins pub chain took the unusual step on May  of publishing corrections the business magazine Forbes had made to the stock exchange about its actions post-lockdown.It said that articles published online on March  and May  , made a number of what it called \"factually incorrect statements\" regarding the company.It said it was alleged that the company told the \"workforce that not only would they not be paid, but they can trot off to get a job in a supermarket\".The pub chain said: \"As regards pay, a company video, recorded on Sunday March  actually said, all our endeavours are going to be on trying to make sure that you get your money and that the pubs reopen.\"Wetherspoons published the transcript.The pub chain stated: \"An email, sent out with the video, said: All hourly paid employees will be paid as normal on Friday March  for all hours worked up to, and including, Sunday  March .\"Staff were paid on that Friday and have been paid on every Friday since.\"The statement in Forbes that staff were told they could trot off to get a job in a supermarket is misleading.\"The video actually said,  youre offered a job in a supermarket, many of you will want to do that. If you think its a good idea, do it...I promise you, well give you first preferenceyou want to come back.\"Forbes also said that the company announced that... pubs WILLopen sometime in June. That is also incorrect.\"In a stock exchange announcement on  April, Wetherspoon said, the companys current assumptions are that its pubs will remain closed until late June .\"The assumptions related to the modelling of two financial scenarios, for the benefit of investors, which necessitated an estimated opening date.\"The date was only an estimate and the company made clear that it would only open when permitted by the government.\"The video transcript published by Wetherspoons.Hi everyone, Im very sorry about the situation thats occurred with our pubs, theyve been shut, as you know, unprecedented in the last  years and it puts everyone in a terribly dficult position. I know youre all sitting there wondering what the hells happening. Over the weekend Ive had lots of phone calls with dferent people and were trying to sort it all out as best we can in this highly unusual situation.The good news is that the government has undertaken to underwrite peoples wages for an indefinite amount of time, which is great as we have no money coming in through the tills, which is not something that we ever planned for as you can appreciate. The governments promised to pay about % of wages, they will probably be pretty slow about paying it so there may be some delays, for which I also apologise, but I feel sure theyre going to come through on their promise.Our main aim and my main aim is to reopen. We employ over , people so its very important for them, just as important perhaps for the country is Wetherspoon, you, thanks to you, pays ,th of all taxes, so its very important to the country that we reopen. It might be weeks, it might be months, tremendous pressure on us all because of the uncertainty, apart from all the practical considerations, so all our endeavours are going to be on trying to make sure that you get your money and that the pubs reopen and I know that almost all of our trade now has gone to supermarkets, not only our trade but the trade from cafes, leisure centres, restaurants etc.Weve had lots of calls from supermarkets, Tesco alone want , people to join them, thats half the number of people who work in our pubs. If Im being honest I say you can get the furlough payments and stay at home,youre offered a job in a supermarket many of you will want to do that,you think its a good idea do it, I can completely understand it. If youve worked for us before I promise you, well give you first preferenceyou want to come back.

Scotland, just to acclimatise themselves to playing on blood-soaked turf, had enjoyed a warm-up in Chile, also under the rule of a fascist junta.

They went, claiming they would report on what was going on, but they never did.Enough of my war wounds. In Argentina, thousands of government opponents had been \"disappeared\".

But they are not allowed to travel more than five miles for leisure.\"This outbreak underlines the importance of following the rules.\"As as of Friday NHS Forth Valley, which serves a population of , saw a spike of ten in a week - with six reported on Friday alone. The rise over the week is identical to that in Scotlands biggest NHS board, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, which provides health care for more than four times the number of people.The Scottish Government says that the situation in Forth Valley was being monitored and contact tracing carried out.The latest analysis of Scotlands track and trace performance shows that despite an expansion in testing facilities - the carrying out of checks against capacity continues to flatline.Latest official figures show that while the Scottish Government has ramped laboratory facilities to meet its target to have the ability to do , daily tests across Scotland to deliver Test and Protect - it has been running in the past week at little over a quarter of capacity, with an average of  checks a day in hospitals, care homes or the community. The numbers do not include postal tests.Scotland was testing at little over a third of its capacity on the three days after the First Minister said the ability to screen had been ramped up in preparation for the national Test and Protect scheme going live on May .Despite a pledge by Scotlandrsquos health secretary, Jeane Freeman at the end of May to offer weekly tests to all , care home workers, it is still failing to deliver with new official figures showing , staff were tested in the last full week. But that is a rise of over  on the previous week.The Scottish Government say the numbers are an undercount because they are still having problems gathering robust data from NHS boards.Some  of Scotlands care homes still have at least one suspected Covid case.With the Scottish tourism industry beginning to reopen from July  and the nation preparing to ease travel restrictions and self-catering holiday accommodation is allowed to reopen, islanders have raised worries about an influx of visitors from south of the border whocould spread the virus.The Scottish Islands Federation said it had \"much sympathy\" with a petition launched by a woman from the Inner Hebrides who was accused of racism after fighting for Scotland-only visitors.With an indication that a full reopening could happen on July  one petition launched on Colonsay by resident Jen MacNeill has received over  signatures and sparked what she described as an islands \"civil war\".It calls on the Scottish and UK governments to provide lsquoa designated route maprsquo out of lockdown and provide financial assistance to encourage the tourism industry to open in a controlled way. It also calls on each inidual island to decide the best route out of lockdown.Camille Dressler, chairman of the federation said there were worries about the \"pent-up demand from people down south\" will put communities at risk through a spread of Covid-.She said: \"This transition from lockdown is a very dficult time as people are having to balance conflicting demands. The fact is that the islands are having to respond to the very detailed instructions for re-opening safely facilities such as public toilets, restaurants and cafes, hotels and museum and that for many businesses these instructions are so demanding that they prefer not to open at all.\"Not every business will have the cash to invest in the new equipment or the extra staff that may be required.\"So the danger for many of the smaller island communities is that their safety - and particularly the safety of those who are more at risk - might be compromisedthere is a sudden influx of visitors that may be carrying the virus without knowing it.\"For this reason, many islands are reluctant to welcome day trippers or campers yet, whereas visitors staying in self catering accommodation are considered to pose a lesser risk, especially when there is limited health service available.\"This may appear as discriminatory to some, but hopefully this is something that most people understand.\"As a federation we hope that the public at large will help keep the islands special and safe, and understands that not all islands are ready to open up as fully as some would expect them too.\"She welcomed a plan on Orkney where tourists are to be given warning letters amid fears that the islands could open up to Covid- with the easing of lockdown.The letter has been produced by Orkney Islands Council and NHS Orkney ahead of the expected relaxation of travel restrictions in mid-July.It will be handed to passengers using NorthLink Ferries, Pentland Ferries and airline Loganair.OIC leader James Stockan said they hoped to have introduced an \"extra level\" of testing for the Orkney but said it has not happened.\"If we were doing that and we had a proper test and trace system in place on the islands, we could have opened up our economy much sooner,\" he said.\"We have tried right through the pandemic to engage with the government. We wanted to try testing people coming in to Orkney before they even embarked on their journey and then a week again a week after they arrived. That was turned down. We were left dangling.\"The chairman of the Arran Economic Group, Tom Tracey said Arran had been Covid- free for seven weeks and that the primary concern was to protect the health of islands.He welcomed moves by the local health and social care partnership to create and Arran-based Test and Track operation that will support the local population and the \"greatly reduced\" number of visitors.Last year Arran had , visitors contributing poundm to the local economy and employing  people. With Covid-, he believes that economic boost will be cut by more than half to poundm with a potential knock on effect on island jobs.\"Opening up to the outside world is inevitable and this undoubtedly carries risk and folks are naturally concerned. However, the best we can do is signicantly limit the visitors numbers, social distancing on ferries will do that, keep the community informed and prepare as best we can with information, best practice and Scottish Government and local health guidelines.:Scottish tourism at risk of total collapse\"Given all of the economics and employment issues, our primary concern remains the health of our community and by implication, our visitors. We based our Arran Recovery Plan on health first and then balancing, community, environments and economy.\"On a practical matter, it does not make any sense to restrict or welcome people to the island based on postcode. Again, the Government is best placed to do that through local lockdowns, or guidance.\"Highland councillor John Finlayson, who lives on Skye said he hoped everyone from tourists to tourism operators will \"take seriously\" the responsibilities they have to \"prevent us having toto lockdown at a later date, which would be catastrophic for everyone\".\"The economy of Skye is hugely dependent on tourism and we need to be acutely aware of the importance of safety and risk assessments as we move forward,\" he said.\"Clearly advice from the Scottish Government is key to what can and will happen but there is also a need for inidual and collective responsibility in terms of how operators apply the guidance whilst also taking cognisance of what community feelings are.\"The majority of feedback I have received from across Skye recognises both the need for safety but also the need for le toto some sort of normality within a context of following the health and safety, social distancing and hygiene rules that are in place. \"Skye welcomes tourists and the suggestion that initially we only have staycation tourism is one that needs discussed but as with all kinds of restrictions around free movement, implementation of checks and who carries them out will be the challenge.\"Ferry passengers have been urged to wear face coverings aboard CalMac vessels, as the transport giant begins to increase services as Scotland gradually emerges from the Covid- coronavirus lockdown.Face coverings are mandatory when travelling on enclosed areas inside a ferry, and on other forms of public transport.The Shetland Tourism Association in a welcome message to would-be travellers said that while they may be looking for assurance about their safety, equally the community had some concerns that the virus \"may accelerate when we re-open tourism\".\"For everyonersquos protection, tourism related businesses have undertaken new risk assessments, applied higher standards of cleaning and changed their procedures to comply with the new Government advice,\" it said.\"Our members have been working hard to ensure safety for reopening this means investing in PPE, equipment, adapting buildings, training staff, or developing entirely new ways of working. All added expense, stress, and pressure at an already dficult time.\"It added: \"Nobody wants Shetland to have an outbreak of Covid cases.\"But it said that many tourism related businesses were not eligible for any funding at all, or financie received had barely covered costs or has been used for refunding customers.Several have decided it is simply not viable to re-open this year.A Scottish Government spokesmansaid that rise in cases in NHS Forth Valley was not being classed as a cluster andthat the situation was being monitored.\"Although there have been a number ofconfirmed cases in the past few days contact tracing hasnotidentied alink between these cases. The situation continues to be monitored,\" the spokesman said.ldquoOur highest priority is continuing to reduce transmission of Covid- and we will consider any measures that might contribute to reducing its spread. Test and Protect has been fully initiated in all  Health Boards, including NHS Forth Valley, and there is sufficient testing capacity within the health board to carry out all the appropriate testing that is required.ldquoWe have established procedures for identying localised outbreaks, and the implementation of Test and Protect is an important enhancement to this. Where local outbreaks occur, our actions will be guided by scientic evidence and the most up to date public health advice.ldquoWe have seen the level of testing among care home residents and staffacross Scotlandsignicantly increase over the last two weeks and are working closely with health boards and care homes to support further increased testing.\"The Scottish Government said on Orkney there wascurrently sufficient \"capacity\" available for testing citizens through the NHS, with additional capacity available through satellite centresrequired. ldquoAt all times, the Scottish Governmentrsquos actions have been guided by the best scientic evidence and the most up to date public health advice.However we must be clear about the limitations of testing alone. Tests areonly a snapshot of a particular point in time. Theyare effective at identying people who have COVID-, but only when they are symptomatic.They cannot reliably detect infection prior to the onset of symptoms,\" the spokesman added.ldquoThat is why other health measures are so important, including regularly washing your hands, maintaining a two metre distance, avoiding crowded places and wearing face coverings to protect otherswhere social distancing is dficult."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11553535.jpg?type=article-full","title":"pictures-thousands-descend-london-soho-streets-england-opens-pubs-first-time-since-lockdown-began","story":"Crowded scenes in one of the citys largest party districts have sparked mass concern over social distancing rules, with pictures showing people bunched together into the early hours of Sunday.Users on social media have expressed their concern over the antics, which have been described as embarrassing and dangerous.:Tim Martins Wetherspoons prepares to re-open pubs in England with help of poundm state loanDrinkers in Soho, London, as coronavirus lockdown restrictions are eased across England.

Even its centenary in  sparked city-wide celebration and praise for ldquoone of the brightest gems in Edinburghrsquos richly jewelled crown.Now, unoccupied for  years and costing around pound, a year to keep it watertight, it appears that - finally - Edinburghrsquos former Royal High School building is on the brink of a new beginning.The long-running and at times bitter saga that saw bold plans by joint developer Urbanist Hotels and Duddingston House Properties to turn the building into a pound million luxury hotel rejected by Edinburgh City Council followed by a y and expensive planning appeal, appears within touching distance of being resolved.ldquoReports on the planning and listed building consent appeals relating to the former Royal High School were received from the Scottish Governmentrsquos Planning and Environmental Appeals Division on  June, confirmed a Scottish Government spokesman.ldquoThe reports and recommendations from the reporters are being considered in detail, and decisions on the appeals will be issued in due course.However, its timing has sparked speculation over whether pressure to kickstart the economy by pushing ahead with major development projects may influence the final decision ndash orconcerns over the collapse in the tourism sector might push the hotel plan off the agenda completely.Terry Levinthal, director of Edinburgh heritage watchdog, the Cockburn Association, said the impact of Covid- on the tourism sector has diluted the argument for turning Hamiltonrsquos architectural gem into a hotel, even further.ldquoThe utter devastation of the cityrsquos tourism and hotel sectors as a result of the covid- pandemic is hugely distressing and has seen the virtual collapse of the industry as we know it today, he said.ldquoIn late  the Edinburgh Hotel Association reported that there was an over-supply of hotel beds based in the city, creating challenging trading conditions for all operators.ldquoI think itrsquos fair to say that these changes in the market and the huge impact of Covid- changes the business case supporting the proposed conversion of the royal high school into luxury hotel.ldquoWe advocate for Scottish ministers to actually recognise the potential damage to not only the buildings but to the reputation of the city as a world heritage city that these proposals represent and to refuse consent.On the other hand, David Orr, Chairman of Urbanist Hotels Ltd, said: \"lsquoWe remain ready to progress this long-awaited and signicant development and are hopeful for a positive outcome.\"The controversial hotel proposals for the building once mooted as a possible base for the Scottish Parliament, first emerged ten years ago after a council-run design contest to determine the future of the building was won by a proposal to create a  room lsquoarts hotelrsquo.The move followed seven years of limbo as The Hill Adamson Trust, backed by Sir Sean Connery, desperately tried to raise money to turn it into a photography centre inspired by pioneers David Octavius Hill and Robert Adamson who developed their skills at a studio at Calton Hill.However, within weeks of the councilrsquos decision, loud criticism emerged of the designrsquos potential impact, with fears over the risk altering a key historic building placed on Edinburghrsquos UNESCO World Heritage Site status, and complaints that it was \"fatally flawed\" and \"insensitive\".One planning chief went so far as to suggest it was ldquoone of the most abhorrent and the most ugly buildings that Irsquove ever seen.The plans were later revived to curb the size of the extensions and cut the number of hotel beds, however the city council again refused planning permission and listed building consent in August .Meanwhile, plans emerged from the Royal High School Preservation Trust and St Maryrsquos Music School to restore the building as the new home for an expanded national music school, with public concert hall and garden.Backed by figures such as author Alexander McCall Smith and violinist Nicola Benedetti, and with funding by Dunard Fund - believed to be one of the largest philanthropic gts to Scottish arts and education - the plans received Edinburgh City Council approval in .Despite the approval, the councilrsquos agreement with the hotel developers means the school would not be able to take over the building until .According to Clf Hague, chair of the Cockburn Association, more delays could cause further deterioration of the fabric of the building.ldquoThere are signicant question marks over just how the hospitality sector and international tourism are going to fare, he said.ldquoI think we have a strong case, but itrsquos whether the minister will see this as a stepping stone towards economic recovery. Therersquos also nothing to prevent the developer coming forward with another application, modying the design in light of changing circumstances.ldquoIt is conceivable that the music school could have been operating by now, anda further period of delay will be to the detriment of the fabric of the building.Meanwhile, Scottish ministersrsquo decision over the future of the old Royal High School will have a direct impact on hopes to create a world class music school in the city.A statement from the Royal High School Preservation Trust said: ldquoWe could start tomorrow, except for the intransigence of the hotel developers and an unseen contract they have with CEC which gives them the lease on the Old Royal High until . This contract is not publicly available.ldquoAs far as we know, as long as there is an appeal process ongoing, the contract remains in place, unless it is terminated by Scottish ministers.ldquoWe want the Government to support the aspiration to proceed with our plans without further delay.ldquoThis is no longer a local Edinburgh matter, but has become a national issue, it added.ldquoThis is a once in a letime opportunity with an iconic building, philanthropic funding and the chance to create a major cultural and educational hub coming together for the whole of Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"calls-ferry-clarity-islands-prepare-welcome-visitors","story":"As Scotland prepares to reopen for tourism, it is the second category that worries James Stockan.The leader of Orkney Islands Council has to figure out how to maintain leline services to what he calls ldquoour double insular places, the ones that take two journeys to get to.His concern  The need for social distancing has reduced capacity on the ferries which dart between Orkneyrsquos outer islands. And that means tourists who book could take the seats of locals who do not.Stockan thinks islands ndash not just his own archipelago ndash are going to struggle as Scots and visitors from further afield start trying to holiday again.Last week, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon urged Scots to holiday in Scotland. But transport capacity may make that hard to do in the places where visitors ndash and their money ndash is most needed.ldquoWe have some real challenges with opening up tourism, including boat capacity, Stockan said.ldquoIf we donrsquot change the social distancing rules, when tourists start travelling the locals may not get on the boats when they are needing to go to the mainland for medical appointments or other urgent business.The mainland he is referring to is Orkneyrsquos, not Scotlandrsquos. It is connected to the outer islands by an airline and a ferry company, Orkney Ferries. Both services would normally be heaving with people at this time of year.Scottish Government rules mean passengers now have to be more spaced out and must wear face coverings ndash both on short hops to inner islands like Shapinsay and longer journeys to outer ones like North Ronaldsay.There is no way to distinguish between passengers who are locals and those who are holidaymakers. Moreover, a local needing an urgent trip has no power to bump a visitor off a boat.ldquoIt is a public service, said Stockan. ldquoIf the boat is full, the boat is full. So, therefore, the more that tourism opens up, the more tourists will book ahead whereas locals wonrsquot. If locals cannot get on the boat, we will have signicant challenges.This is also true on the big ferries ndash most of the heavy lting is done by NorthLink ndash carrying people between Orkney and the Scottish mainland.Here, too, capacity is an issue because of social distancing. And that presents a huge dilemma to tourism businesses on the islands: will enough people make it across the Pentland Firth to make it worthwhile opening up Stockan said: ldquoSocial distancing on ferries mean we are starting tourism on a reduced ability for people to come. Businesses are now unsure how to start because they canrsquot open fully. It is your last few customers that turn your profit.Orkney is greeting all those who cross from the mainland with a letter, asking them to be be responsible.The islands, Stockan explained, have a ldquoying and yang of Covid. Their isolation makes them less vulnerable to the disease but more vulnerable to the cure, to the long-term economic hardship lockdown will bring.Some Orcadians are nervous about tourism reopening. After all, some of the ldquodouble islands ndash those off the Orkney mainland ndash have no real capacity to treat people with serious Covid symptoms.This is not just an Orkney problem. Islanders across Scotland have expressed concern that ferry providers may not have space for locals and that capacity might be an issue for tourism.Nigel Scott of Comhairle nan Eilean Siar in the Western Isles said his councilrsquos position was that ldquopriority for travel going forward should focus on island residents and friends and family living on and from islands, key workers and freight, while maintaining a safe environment for all.Scott added: ldquoWe are seeking further clarity on this and discussions are continuing with Scottish Government, Transport Scotland, CalMac and CalMacrsquos Community Board. There are obviously many issues around ferry travel and the Comhairle is of the view that our communities need greater clarity as restrictions ease.Camille Dressler chairs both the Scottish Islands Federation and the community council for the islands of Eigg, Rum, Muck and Canna in the Inner Hebrides. She took aim at CalMacrsquos booking system, which like that of Orkney Ferries and other operators ldquostill does not recognise the dferent needs of islanders and visitors.She said: ldquoWhat we have heard from members is that in many cases, the pent-up demand, reduced number of sailings and social distancing restrictions mean ferries have been fully booked within seconds, with no possibilities for islanders to have places reserved for them when they have not been able to leave their island for over three months.ldquoThis is placing them in a very dficult situation when they are having to travel for any reason, such as medical and dental appointments, essential shopping, collecting building supplies, and visiting mainland families."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : amBy Patricia Long When John Mackay came to Orkney to run the Masons Arms Hotel in Stromness, he saw the potential for a hotel for fishermen.

It has taken some time to reach this decision.#But as we all start to interact more, it’s vital that we take all reasonable steps to reduce risk and we know that face coverings can help reduce the risk of transmission indoors.#Also in shops, as on public transport, contact tracing is more dficult because we usually don’t know the people that we have been contact with. So a face covering provides an additional layer of protection. It is therefore for all of these reasons, that face coverings in shops will be compulsory from the end of next week.#But please do not wait until then — get into the habit now. This is an important way for all of us to help protect each other and to display that sense of solidarity that has helped the country so well over these past months.#From Friday, July , Children who are  years old or under will now be able to play normally with friends outdoors.Distancing should still be adhered to by children while indoors and there is no change to the guidelines for adults.Other rules will remain the same — you should continue to meet in groups of eight or less, and to meet no more than two other households at a time.For young people aged  to , the limit on the number of meetings you can have in any one day has been lted, meaning that dferent groups of friends can meet at dferent times of the day.However, meetings should still take place outdoors and should be no more than eight people — from no more than three households — at any one time.Ms Sturgeon also announced that the two-metre distancing requirement will be relaxed for some key sectors — with the appropriate mitigations in place.The government will work with those in the hospitality, retail and public transport sectors initially to agree the mitigations that will be required, which will allow sectors to operate a one-metre distance ruling.It is hoped that these exemptions for specic sectors could be agreed and in place by the time phase three comes round, potentially from Thursday, July .Mitigations could be improved ventilation, perspex screens, regulation of customer flow and seating plans that reduce transmission risk.However, Ms Sturgeon recognised that the guidance will be change between sectors.The First Minister said: #In my view, this represents a balanced and proportionate approach to what is a genuinely dficult issue. It allows businesses to cater for more customers — and we know that for some that will be the dference between staying in business or closing.#However, it also continues to minimise risk — which, for some iniduals, and with no exaggeration, could be the dference between le and death.#Obviously,infection levels were to rise again, we reserve the right to re-impose a strict two-metre rule, either nationally or locally, and to take other public health measures that are necessary to keep us safe.#Conversely, though,we continue to make progress, we may be able to consider a more general relaxation in later phases.#Outdoor hospitality, such as pavement cafes and beer gardens, can re-open from Monday, Ms Sturgeon confirmed, and although tourism will not open fully until July , self-contained holiday accommodation — for example holiday cottages, lodges or caravans with no shared facilities — can reopen from tomorrow.An additional five positive cases were confirmed yesterday, taking the total now to , in Scotland.One COVID- death was registered in Scotland in the past  hours, taking the total number of deaths, of people who have tested positive for COVID-, to ,.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

After eating far too many patisseries, she enrolled at the Alain Ducasse cookery school to learn how to make macarons. She said: “They’re just so pretty. They’re so delicate. And they’re quite hard to make because there’s a lot that can go wrong.”Once Rachel ed to Edinburgh and noticed a gap in the market, she decided to set up her very own macaron business.She said: “I wanted to have that little bit of Paris with me. I focused on taste bud tourism, so when you eat these macarons you’re transported to the Champs-Élysées.” After nine months of trading from home and going to food markets, Rachel set up her first bricks-and-mortar store.She said: “It was in the centre of Edinburgh, it had a view of the castle. It was beautul.” vw, px\"  But since launching their online store in , and realising that they could send macarons across the country, plus the fact that they had large bookings from both wholesale and wedding customers, the bricks and mortar became unnecessary.The company, which employs eight people, lost all their wholesale customers overnight due to Coronavirus.Rachel said: “It was really scary. All the weddings, all the wholesale customers, and the bulk of our production disappeared. And then, of course, you have phone calls from people wanting to cancel future orders and refunds.“We entered the cash flow situation whereby the wholesale customers stopped paying the invoices. And we’ve now got over £, worth of overdue invoices.”But, it’s not all doom and gloom, as Mademoiselle Macaron has started to see an increase in online orders. It’s thanks to the UK Government’s furlough scheme that her business has kept afloat. Rachel said: “The furlough scheme has been a real leline in this time of crisis. I asked people to volunteer for furlough. So the people who wanted to and were happy to, they were the first ones to go. I cried.“I just felt like I was stuck in this moral quandary. Do we keep going and safeguard the business, so there’s a business for everyone to come back to  Or do I shut down because I can see that this is causing people severe anguish  We managed to recall stock that was sitting in hospitality clients freezers. That is the only reason we survived. What you make, you keep in the freezer and you use when you need to. It’s not like it’s a cupcake,we were perishable goods we would never have survived.”“We have a big kitchen so the space isn’t the issue. It’s more that we wanted to keep the team safe,” adds Rachel.Mademoiselle Macaron’s online sales have increased so much that they’re potentially in a position to hire more people on temporary contracts. Ideally, Rachel would like to help younger people and develop a training program with a college. “They’ve been so much more affected, and it’s just something close to my heart,” she said. vw, px\"  But when the Covid- pandemic struck, the managing director of Wales-based The Seren Collection required urgent assistance from the UK Government’s support schemes to pay his creditors and maintain supplier relationships.Mr Kedward and his we Zoe entered the hospitality industry almost by accident in .He said: “We just happened to come home to South Wales for the weekend and stumbled across The Grove. It was a calamitous trip with lots of wrong turns and family arguments, but we found the owner in, made our offer and that was that.“Our aspiration was much smaller than that, in fact we just wanted to convert the six outlying buildings into self catering units – now we’re a  bedroom hotel.”Neil and Zoe went on to open two restaurants in Saundersfoot and Oxwich on the back of the success of The Grove.Asthat weren’t enough to keep the team busy, he also spotted a gap in the tour operator market.Neil said: It struck me that there weren’t enough tour operators bringing people into the country. So we started a business called routescape, which had a hugely encouraging start, launching at World Travel Market before a big business development trip in . We had built up all our bookings for this financial year.“And then of course the whole project was wiped out by the virus. We lost every single booking. Not just for Routescape, but for The Grove too.”Neil added: “The loan from the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme has allowed us to pay off all our creditors and we will be able to relaunch owing nobody any money.”When Covid- struck, one of Northern Ireland’s leading providers of tyres and automotive services, had just invested £.m in a new head office and distribution centre in Antrim and cash reserves were low.But thanks to their ability to adapt, ersy as well as the invaluable support from the UK Government, Kerr’s Tyres  Auto has been able play a vital role in servicing and keeping the province’s key workers on the road.Managing director Norman Kerr said: “The Antrim site used up our cash reserves and had a big impact on our cash flow.“Unfortunately the coronavirus kicked in three months later, when we still didn’t have a chance to build up any cash reserves that we would normally have. So it had a massive impact on ourselves.“But the problem was we had to continue trading because we supply the food sector and the white delivery van man.“So our business had to continue. We had to pay suppliers, we had no choice in it.”However thanks to a UK Government Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme loan of £, through the Ulster Bank, as well as the furlough scheme, the family-run business was able to remain solvent and save over  jobs.Norman said: “Had we not been able to get the UK Government loan scheme, it would have had a huge impact on our business. Our business, in essence, dropped probably  per cent within the first month.“Thankfully that has grown steadily back since then.”Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers.Details of the support available to businesses across the UK can be found at gov.uk coronavirus business-supportcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He bought a field from William Isbister of Kethesgeo and hired Samuel Baikie. Baikie’s obituary says that he designed the hotel but the local story was that it had been a show-house at the  Glasgow Exhibition. Perhaps the plans came from the Exhibition.Good though the fishing was, John Mackay wanted to make it even better. He got some trout spawn and put the fry he had hatched in a specially built pond at Stairwaddy. A year later, he had a lot of good- sized fish.The hotel opened in June . It had a coffee room, drawing room, smoking room, fteen bedrooms, lavatories and one bathroom. The Orkney Herald thought for beauty and comfort it could not be excelled in the north. The first phone line in Orkney connected the hotel to the Masons Arms and this featured in the advertising.In , Mackay had an “Illustrated Guide to Orkney” printed. The useful information included the charges for Maeshowe:- sixpence for one person one shilling for more than one, up to four persons and for more than four, threepence per person, up to ten shillings, the maximum charge for one party. In WWI, Houton was the main seaplane base but late in  it was decided to increase the number in Orkney from  to , to fight the threat of submarines, and a camp was built in Stenness. The Admiralty had not listened to the locals but soon found out that they were right, and the loch was too shallow. The planes were moved to Houton but the hotel remained the HQ of the Naval Air Service.At the end of WWI, another long running battle restarted, as John Mackay fought the Temperance movement. Stromness was dry from  to  and campaigners were determined that Stenness would be the same. Successive owners promised not to sell drink to locals, but it was no use, the petitions kept coming.John Mackay died in  and the hotel was briefly owned by Mrs Jessie Smith. The Misses Catherine and Jessie Harper from Thurso took it over in , announcing they were going to bring it up to date.Patricia Long is a tourist guide based in Stenness with a particular interest in social historycopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The GREAT Inspirations campaign will recognise companies that have gone above and beyond to continue to operate for their employees, serve their customers and contribute to their local communities. Here are some examples of the many thousands of companies that have proved to be an inspiration.Rooms and pamper packages for NHS workers away from their families, prepping more than  meals a week for vulnerable people in the community and projecting light shows every week for Clap for Carers are just some of the things one hotel team has done during the coronavirus outbreak.The team at the Queens Hotel in Southsea have been working hard since lockdown began in March to support everyone in the community across Portsmouth.Duty manager Megan Lockyer has been working with the small team who have welcomed more than  NHS workers to the hotel, which during the Second World War served as a hospital for recovering servicemen, for a place to rest away from their jobs.She said: “I watched the NHS workers come back to the hotel after a challenging day and I really wanted to let them know how much we appreciate what they are doing.“I came up with the idea of making hampers for the NHS workers who are currently with us at the hotel.“I shared my idea with the Facebook group and it was amazing how the community responded.“The NHS staff had told us how sore their hands were due to constant washing and we were able to include aloe vera hand cream along with items such as face masks, relaxing bath gels, slippers and Easter eggs.”Staff also worked with Medusa Hairdressing in Southsea to create more hampers which were distributed to key workers in local nursing homes.The hotel’s managing director Farid Yeganeh said: “I am delighted with the small team we have working at the hotel who have ensured it is clean and safe for our NHS guests.” vw, px\"  More than , meals have been sent out in lockdown to vulnerable people around the city thanks to a collaboration between the hotel, a collective of voluntary organisations called Portsmouth Hive, Portsmouth City Council, NHS Portsmouth CCG, the charity arm of Portsmouth Football Club called Pompey in the Community, as well as Anghel Niko Nedelcu, head chef from Portsmouth’s Brasserie Blanc and Royal Beach Hotel head chef Paul Playford. The initiative received two £, anonymous donations, as well as food donations from local businesses including butchers Buckwells. Farid said: “We got an email from the council at the start of lockdown about whether any businesses had any stock that was going out of date. It just snowballed from there really and we teamed up with the Hive to get meals distributed and it means so much that we could help our community.”Each week for Clap For Carers, projections showing support for the NHS were displayed on the Edwardian era hotel as part of the team’s commitment to supporting local health workers. Farid added: “I have always been aware that we have a really special team working at the hotel and this just underlines it. I look forward to being able to welcome back the whole Queens Hotel team once the lockdown is over.”When coronavirus started appearing in Inverness, care home manager Victoria Connolly was determined no one who worked or lived there would fall ill.So she asked the staff of the Isobel Fraser home in Invernessthey’d be prepared to live onsite and was thrilled when  said they would.But then came the problem of where to put them.The -year-old said: “There are a couple of rooms upstairs I could fit six people into. But then I thought, ‘Where am I going to put everyone  ’”“I have a friend with a campervan so I phoned her and askedwe could use it. She agreed but I needed more so she suggested I hire one.”Victoria got in touch with Highland Auto Campers whose owner Mark Jarratt, , immediately agreed to hire her three vehicles for cost.While they’d normally charge £ a night for their practically-new fleet, the care home got them for just £ each a week.Mark says: “We’ve only been going two years but earlier this year, things were going well – March was picking up and April and May were fully booked.“But we only get an eight-month window to make our money because of the tourist season so lockdown came at the worst time for us, the start of our season and was a complete disaster.“Then around April , we got a call from the Isobel Fraser home. Stories were, by then, beginning to emerge that some care homes had been really badly hit by coronavirus.“They said that while the home was free of coronavirus, they knew they needed to take steps to keep both staff and residents virus free and by providing accommodation for their staff on site.hey wanted to rent three of our vans to do this.“We were surprised to get the phone call – there are a lot of similar companies in the area – but quite pleased and we immediately agreed to assist in any way that we could. We just wanted to help.“It was also a win-win situation for us. The campervans hadn’t been used for a few weeks, they were just sitting quarantined and this was income – not a great deal of income but better than nothing.“Even though they hadn’t been used for weeks, and one was so new it had never been used, we gave them a thorough clean before driving them over and setting them up.“The staff and some of the residents were quite excited when we arrived and were looking out of the windows.”Six care home staff slept in the vans for between three and five weeks. Manager Victoria said: “They really enjoyed it – they were warm and comfortable. Most have said they’d take them out on holiday!”The care home, which has  residents, hasn’t had a single case of coronavirus. Mark said: “We were really proud to have been able to help. It’s good to do something for the community.”Newtownards-based company Shnuggle ersied into making PPE when the coronavirus pandemic hit the firm’s core business.Sinead and Adam Murphy were building the company into a leading name among parents with products such as an air bedside crib, air flow mattress, rocking stand, toddler baths, bath stands and many other creations.But the growth was interrupted when Covid- arrived in the UK, and the country went into lockdown.Although UK sales remained strong, imports were hit and Shnuggle’s owners turned their attention to designing and creating a face covering that would help save lives.Adam and Sinead quickly realised that they could help make a dference in the national effort to provide Personal Protective Equipment items. After taking measures needed to sustain the business, including taking advantage of UK Government furlough and business loan schemes, they set about creating and growing not-for-profit business Hero Shield.Adam said: “We had seen a few initiatives that had popped up all around the world.“A lot were printing D face shields so we kind of sat down with our head of design who was on furlough and said, ‘can we come up with a design here that we could start producing at rock bottom price and we’d prefer it to be a reusable one rather than a disposable one ’.“We came up with designs over the course of a weekend, by Monday we had done  dferent designs and D printed them on our prototyping printer and we’d put out a call on LinkedIn to local companies who wanted to get involved and within a very short space of time we had about  dferent businesses all saying, ‘Yep, we can do that bit and we’ll do it free of charge or we’ll do it at cost’.“We said that we weren’t doing it to make money. We were trying to help the NHS and other care workers so we founded another company which was Hero Shield Ltd and we set it up as not for profit so nobody could take any money out of it. Alongside that we did a crowdfunder to cover the costs so we raised £, in the end.“We managed to produce and ship out about , face shields in about six weeks.”Adam and Sinead are working to secure charitable status for Hero Shield Ltd, which is still running on a non-profit basis, and is now focussing more on charities and care services that don’t have the funds for whatever PPE they might need to get back up and running.Sinead said: “The businesses that were actually producing the face shields, we passed the orders to them and they have turned it into more of a commercial venture because we got a massive order from the NHS.“It was worth shy of £m and we needed to focus back on Shnuggles, so we passed it over to them and they pay a royalty into the Hero Shield charity for every one that they make.”So having helped the NHS in Northern Ireland, Adam and Sinead are now focused again on their core business – creating and marketing clever products for babies and children.Read about more inspiring GREAT stories at greatbritaincampaign inspirationscopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is also hoped to help Shetland#s existing oil and gas industry achieve carbon net zero targets.Plans for the hub are still in early stages with no specic projects agreed. However, ideas such as an offshore wind farm east of Shetland, and the creation of hydrogen from natural gas or electrolysis, are some of the ideas being suggested.Smaller scale community projects would also be developed through the hub project.Mr Irvine#s report to the council said the hub could generate pound billion of revenue for the region, remove carbon emissions by eight million tons, and create , jobs.He said the formative phase would look at which options are viable commercially and which were not.While the council has already committed pound, to the project, Mr Irvine said funding from the Scottish and UK governments as well as the Highlands and Islands Enterprise would be needed.He also said private sector investment was ldquocore to the project ndash and a steering group was working on that.Lerwick North councillor Stephen Leask had questioned how strong the council#s position # and how much financial risk it could face.Mr Irvine said most of the risk would be taken by the major investors from the energy industry, rather than the SIC.Martyn Tulloch, who leads the Net Zero Solution Centre, at OGTC, told the meeting that while other regions were advancing hub projects, with one in Humberside said to be the furthest advanced, he was not aware of any that had received Scottish government funding.#We have been approached by other regions but this is very much our sole focus at the moment,# he added.SIC leader Steven Coutts said the hub was a #crucial# project to Shetland#s future # and one that the council could not progress alone.He added it would need to bring #signicant community benefits# .#We want to see people thrive in Shetland with a strong and resilient community,# he added.Councillors agreed to progress the project into its #formative phase#, which will see the project team work with the energy industry and government agencies to identy next steps, including research projects and trials.Consultations will also take place with the community, businesses and other relevant interestsA funding application is expected to be submitted to the Scottish government next month...The SIC will make a decision later in the year about the outcome of the public holiday that traditionally follows the Lerwick Up-Helly-A# festival.Andrew Moorhouse, who had been missing since early Thursday morning, was traced safe and well on Friday evening.

DaoineThe study of areas like Staffin, Tiree and the Western Isles has been labelled as the most comprehensive social survey on the state of Gaelic communities ever conducted.The findings conclude that the language is in crisis, and that within remaining vernacular communities of Scotland the social use and transmission of Gaelic is at the point of collapse.Researchers from the University of the Highlands and Islands Language Sciences Institute and Soillse, a multi-institutional research collaboration which includes Sabhal Mòr Ostaig in Skye, outline the findings in a new book published todayThe authors of ‘The Gaelic Crisis in the Vernacular Community: A comprehensive sociolinguistic survey of Scottish Gaelic’ urge a radical new agenda and strategy for Gaelic revitalisation in the islands.They argue for the creation of a community development trust for Gaelic-speakers that is island based and under the direct control of the community.Professor Conchúr Ó Giollagáin, Professor of Gaelic Research at the University of the Highlands explained the motivation behind the new book.He said: “It is important that we are clear about the immense scale of the challenges involved in reversing the ongoing decline in the use of Gaelic in these areas.“Our statistical evidence indicates that the Gaelic vernacular community is comprised of around , people, of which a majority are in the  years and over age category.“The decline of the Gaelic community, as especially shown in the marginal practice of Gaelic in families and among teenagers, indicates that without a community-wide revival of Gaelic, the trend towards the loss of vernacular Gaelic will continue.“We found a mismatch between current Gaelic policies and the level of crisis among the speaker group which must be addressed to face the urgency of the language loss in the islands.“The primary focus of Gaelic policy should now be on relevant initiatives to avert the loss of vernacular Gaelic.”In order to make Gaelic policy viable, the researchers called for a re-aligning of national policy to address the decline in the use of Gaelic as a community language.Whilst some elements of national policy have had some success, such as the numbers of primary pupils in Gaelic Medium Education, without an overarching revitalisation approach, as outlined in their research, the authors believe the decline in the Gaelic vernacular community will rapidly continue.Iain Caimbeul, research fellow at the Language Sciences Institute in the University of the Highlands and Islands added: “If Scotland is to continue to give practical expression to its commitment to sustaining cultural ersity, it is vital that strategy for the Gaelic group is rooted in the broader context of community revitalisation.#We hope this research will be valuable to those interested in seeking to sht public policy assumptions from a sole dependence on the school system for creating the next generation of fluent Gaelic speakers.“It is vital that we change the basis for allocating resources to protect against further decline.”The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until th July .Sorry for any inconvenience

school","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineI’ve always been of the opinion that local government should be exempt from the Machiavellian attempts of people whose only agenda is to disrupt the successful running of the ‘machinery’ of administration we all take for granted.Maybe I was naive to expect we’d all be on the same ‘side’, trying our collective best to maximise the opportunities for the people of these Western Isles.I guess too naive.Cue SNP leader, Councillor Gordon Murray’s latest dog-whistle, resulting from last week’s meeting of Comhairle nan Eilean Siar.For those who remain oblivious to the frequency at which Facebook Barbara Woodhouse wannabes broadcastMr Murray sometimes operates with an economy of factual accuracy which leaves those who are unprepared to dig # even just a little bit further in pursuit of the truth # salivating in the best Pavlovian traditions.There will never be a time, certainly not in the foreseeable future, when there will be ‘spare’ money floating around Sandwick Road.The halcyon days of having underspent budgets and of looking for projects on which to lavish ‘leftover’ cashare but a twinkle in old Convenors’ eyes.So any refurbishment of the council chambers, shamefully overlooked by at least the last five incumbent collaboratives, was always going to be moderately controversial.It certainly didn’t require a Molotov cocktail lobbed in its general direction, especially not one fuelled by completely unsubstantiated innuendo and inferences, designed to ignite ‘public’ opinion.An uncaring, out-of-touch majority of elected membershad decided to refurbish the council chambers in the middle of the Covid- crisis, ignoring the more pressing needs of the local economy.The comfort of our bums on seats was of greater signicance than the struggles of inidual businesses trying to survive a devastating economic downturn.Balderdash.The decision to refurbish the council chambers was about much more and, in any scheme of things, needed doing.That Councillor Murray knew it and had commissioned a report to explain it to him, was neither here nor there.He went with his simple narrative and the howling began.The decision was actually taken some  months ago and, despite some robust discussion, it was agreed that what was planned was necessary and overdue.The seating in the chamber was, after  years of wear and tear, burst at the seams.Its tangerine hue had now assumed a week old, orange peel in the sun, frayed facade.It stank a bit and was, even to my own initial impressions three years ago, a bit of a tawdry embarrassment.Especially so when it doubles as a civic reception arena for visitors of every gravitas and distinction.They say thatyour IT infrastructure is five years old, then it’s probably  years out of date.When you cannot, in today’s modern world, reliably communicate with your ‘satellite’ offices in Castlebay, Balivanich and Tarbert, far less those at Marybank, Cromwell Street and Creed Park then the chances of joining in with anyone further afield may be remote.When, in a hugely changed modern meeting landscape, everything is getting done on Zoom or Microsoft Teams, then you need to be able to do so efficiently, effectively and with stability.Of course, nobody could have predicted this  months ago which is why, retrospectively, we should be ‘selling’ the notion to the public as the excellent news it is. other offices will be upgraded to the same standard of communication technology.Nobody will have to rely, embarrassingly, on a decent mobile signal and having to ‘put you on speakerphone’ to continue a discussion when the smoke signals have failed.Sensible people understand this.People from Gordon’s own party understand this.The ones who inhabit the real world anyway and some have already commented.The fact that an improved connectivity infrastructure might just re-invigorate our democracy hasn’t been lost on the more astute.Going back to ‘how we’ve always done things’ should never be an option again, given this new, exciting opportunity.Of course, there’s much that can be achieved by face-to-face contact and the physical intimacy of ‘actual’ meetings are still important.But that landscape will be vastly altered by the new normal.Hopefully, this will mean that a whole raft of possibilities might open up.The current format for being a councillor makes it dficult for many people to commit to even considering the election process, far less the minimum time required to attend all the meetings.Maybe being able to do so from the comfort of their own homes, raising their ‘virtual hands’ on a large screen in the chambers when they wish to speak, might just persuade more people that it’s time for our elderly, male-dominated, ‘democracy’ to change Which might just make for an influx of fresh thinking and constructive debate.Opposition for opposing’s sake is still the stuff of the primary school classroom.When you know you can propose the most fancul notions without any fear that they’ll ever get beyond the debating arena, you can always tell an incredulous audience that, but for the bad guys in the Comhairle, you could also have had ‘jelly and ice-cream’ in your ‘land of milk and honey’. local members know that successive national government failures have taken away most of the cows and bees, so why the continued deflection from reality by our local group on CNES Because they require to have a purpose, albeit a mostly destructive one.It has generally been accepted that our council workers, officers and directorates have done a pretty decent job in the midst of what have been exceptionally trying circumstances.But when you talk ‘council’ up here, you generally mean the whole kit-kaboodle.You throw everyone under the same bus when # in order to get a massive negative reaction for your own political ends # you allude that the Comhairle are spending a large sum of money on new chairs.Four months of exemplary work down the drain so someone can appear as some sort of martyr.Quite shameful behaviour, and quickly seen through by even his own acolytes, many of whom had spoken passionately in favour of a refurbishment , before adding their names to a list of dissenters when the motion was rejected as incompetent.Incompetent because the procurement processhad already begun, and had been explained, in great detail, several months previously.What has been hugely fortunate these past few months is the resilience which the Comhairle has been able to demonstrate as a result of having ‘balances’ at hand to deal with emergency situations such as Covid-.Balances which, had they embarked on a spree of imprudence as appealed for by the SNP group when budget setting was being undertaken, would have disappeared into the ether.Combine with their insistence on asking for meaningless, time-consuming report after report in an effort to undermine what’s already been decided and the wasted saved money could have us all bedecked in ermine.When you insist on portraying yourself as Roy Rogers in a white hat, consistently battling against the bad guysmaybe it’s time that you listened to Tonto.Hopefully, someone close will volunteer to be that side-kick, and soon, eh kemo-sabe Gordon is essentially a decent guy, but in his aspirations to undermine the credibility of his fellow councillors he undermines the hard work of every single council employee and misses his target spectacularly.The disconnect between the success of his party at national, and at local government level, may be partly down to perception.A degree of maturity, purposeful intent, willingness to participate and collaborate to be serious about their proposals, would go a long way.I like to think of myself as a reasonable fellow and, as I’ve previously stated, I will support any sensible suggestions, no matter their origin.Three years later, Gordon I’m still waiting.And it’s not due to any political or philosophical opposition.When it

The Eco-Schools Programme is the world’s largest Environmental Education programme and aims to make environmental awareness and action an intrinsic part of the le and ethos of a school. Its participatory approach and combination of learning and action makes it an ideal way for schools to begin improving the environments of schools and their local communities. Eco-Schools work through a simple seven-step process resulting in the programme becoming central to the schools ethos. Schools can choose from ten eco-topics ranging from litter and waste to energy, bioersity and transport to name a few. Eco-Schools work towards achieving awards - bronze, silver and the prestigious Green Flag.The internationally recognised Green Flag is this highest award given to Eco-Schools and symbolises excellence in the field of environmental activity. Over the past two years, pupils of Buick Memorial have been working hard on many initiatives in order to address their chosen topics of Waste, Litter and Bioersity. Together with Eco Coordinators Mrs Carleton and Miss Stirling, they have produced policies on printing, recycling and litter for staff and pupils within the school to follow. Their continued commitment to regular Cash for Clobber collections enabled the school to purchase a number of new bins for the playground. Thanks to Catherine Hunter, Mid and East Antrim Education Officer, the children were able to give each class a bin for food waste, allowing the Eco Club to produce compost for their many planting activities. A highlight of the Eco-School endeavours is the annual litter-pick with Cullybackey Community Partnership and thanks must be given in particular to Margaret Murphy who is always keen to help the children in any way she can. The school is extremely grateful to Cranswick Country Foods for providing a superb wooden structure for the ‘plastic bottle greenhouse’ project and to Barry Tapster, Mid and East Antrim Recycling Officer, for his guidance. This year has been exceptionally busy, with the introduction of a termly ‘Walking Week’ which the pupils and parents have strongly supported. The Eco Club have spent a lot of time tending to the school pond area building mini-beast and frog hotels, making bird feeders and planting flowers for pollinators amongst many other tasks. None of these opportunities would have run as smoothly were it not for the unwavering input from Mr Fleckand the dedication of Ms Harkin . The positive attitude and increased awareness of environmental issues is evident within the school from Nursery through to P and this Green Flag is a welcome acknowledgement of the children’s efforts.The International Eco-Schools Programme is operated in Northern Ireland by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul and is a free to enter programme.

From this date passengers travelling on most bus, train and ferry services in Northern Ireland will be required to wear a face covering. Face coverings will also be required in public transport stations. There will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for health and medical reasons, and for children under the age of . Outdoor areas of a ferry where social distancing can be maintained will be exempt from the requirements, along with school transport.  googletag.cmd.push The Executive has agreed that the cross-departmental group that has been established to consider face coverings will engage with the tour coach and taxi industry to explore extending the requirement to these transport modes. Making the announcement, Minister Nichola Mallon said:“As we move throughthe Executive’s recovery plan, more and more of the economy and society is opening up. Wemust remember however that Covid- is still with us. We need to remain vigilant and continue to play our part in controlling the virus to protect ourselves and others. “As restrictions on our movement are eased, the safety ofpassengers and staff remains my priority.The evidence suggests that you can reduce the risk of spreading the virus by wearing a face covering. That is why, with the support of my Executive colleagues and the unions, I am announcing that face coverings will be mandatory on public transport, from Friday July th. googletag.cmd.push “The requirement will apply to passengers and also staff in public areas who are not protected by a screen. However, there will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for specic health and medical reasons.” A face covering is a covering of any type which covers a person’s nose and mouth it does not have to be a surgical face mask. While face coverings can offer protection to others, they are not a substitute for other protective measures and it is important that people continue to follow social distancing and wash or sanitise hands regularly. Minister Mallon continued:“We are asking you to take personal responsibility and do the right thing to protect the health and well-being of others. The fact of the matter is you can spread the virus to other more vulnerable people without even knowing you have it. By wearing a face covering you are showing your support and consideration for other passengers and staff. “It is important to be aware that wearing face coverings will not be suitable for all members of the public and we need to be sensitive to this and know that reasons for not wearing a face covering may not always be visible. “Advice will be available on nidirect and social media channels. Translink staffwill begin preparing commuters for the requirement to wear face coverings. “It is alsoimportant that you do not get a  sense of security about the level of protection a face covering offers. They are not a substitute for social distancing or good hand hygiene. While I know many will find it challenging in the coming days and weeks to keep up compliance with the rules, I want to applaud the public for their leadership. The public have done the heavy lting and kept us all safe. You have been the leaders in Northern Ireland fighting Covid- and I am asking you to keep it up and we will beat this together. “By acting together and thinking of each other we can reduce the risk of transmission.” Further information is available on nidirect at:https:www.nidirect.gov.uk  coronavirus-safer-travel- guidanceandhttps:www.nidirect.gov.uk  face-coverings  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Commission revealed that it received a late notication from The Glendermott Valley Flute Band. It will march in the Waterside area of the city on the Tullyally Road and Ardmore Road on July . The Pride of Orange and Blue Flute Band from Newbuildings will also march with  members registered. Other bands from Coleraine and Limavady have also applied to march. It is anticipated that more could follow in the coming days. The Twelfth is the annual Protestant celebration held every year on July . googletag.cmd.push However, it is being celebrated on July  this year because the twelfth falls on a Sunday. It dates back to a  when the last British Catholic monarch King James II was defeated by Protestant King William, formerly Prince of Orange in Holland, at the Battle of the Boyne. Each year, members of the Orange Order - named after the victorious king and founded in  - carry banners and flags in parades acrossNorthern Irelandaccompanied by marching bands. The Orange Order cancelled events in April due to the Coronavirus pandemic and asked bands not to parade this year. Harold Henning, Deputy Grand Master, said: This year will be a dferent Twelfthbut just because our parades and gatherings are cancelled, does not mean that we cannot celebrate King William’s momentous victory.Quite the opposite, our challenge is to ensure this Twelfth is marked in style online, in your home, at your door, with families and neighbours. Together we can make it a fun-filled, extra-special - socially distanced th - that will be talked about for years. googletag.cmd.push He added: So begin by planning to suitably decorate your home, street, village or town - fly the flag, proudly and respectfully. Encourage children and grandchildren to watchour craft videos and create Orange Liliesand buntingor brush up your history by reading about William’s Generals. However, during our celebrations let us be mindful that the priority in  is to look after everyone’s health this Twelfth as we continue the battle against Coronavirus.Please ensure you comply with the lockdown regulations in existence over the period. But the Parades Commission has now received around  applications for marches to celebrate the Twelfth. The sudden influx has been attributed to the easing of restrictions on outdoor gatherings whereby up to  people are able to gather outdoors, provided social distancing can be observed. Among the areas where applications have been made are Belfast, Ballymena, Newtownards and Enniskillen. SOLDIER F BAND At this stage no applications have been submitted for the annual ‘Relief of Londonderry parade’ which traditionally takes place on the second Saturday of August. On August  last year there was controversy in the city when a loyalist band wore parachute regiment insignia accompanied by a soldier F symbol. It was deemed to be an intentional act aimed at inciting the nationalist community in the city. The ex-paratrooper known as soldier F is being prosecuted for the murders of James Wray, , and William McKinney, . He is also facing four attempted murder charges, plus an additional support count in respect of the attempted murder of a person or persons unknown.

Since the first official announcement of the post-graduate facility in  , a catalogue of failures has been allowed by the university and decision-makers within government. Impediments almost too numerous to list have acted to frustrate,not block, delivery of what is agreed is a much-needed facility. googletag.cmd.push The responsibility and willingness to bow to problems readily rather than resolve them lies at many doors, not least: politicians, internal university committees, government committees, health officials, Stormont officials, UU officials, other universities, and the Northern Ireland Civil Service. Is there an underlying and more pernicious problem that has its roots in decision-making by UU that is seen to favour other places over Derry  Why are our public representatives facilitating this  Since its establishment in Coleraine by the Stormont government in the s, the university has been allowed, and encouraged, to run an unfettered and unchallenged agenda, whereby major development decided upon by university authorities, based in Belfast, has been centred on Coleraine, Jordanstown and, more recently, North Belfast. googletag.cmd.push The post-GFA era has seen little change and, effectively, Belfast and Stormont, acting as a city-state, exercise a veto on every major development in Derry or the North West. This is the continuation of an unfortunate and deliberate policy which we thought had been consigned to a troubled past. Derry has been patiently lobbying for proper and deserved university provision for the region for  years. It is the last remaining grievance of the Civil Rights era, and the failure to provide a modern university in the North West sustains the injustice practiced by the Unionist government, now long gone, of the time. For almost  years, Direct Rule and devolved governments at Stormont and UU have favoured other localised priorities and broken promises to Derry. In , under the Ilex One Plan, UU and government gave a commitment to have , full-time students at Magee by . The actual number – under , – didn’t change at all over the decade. Most recently, a commitment, endorsed by Dublin and Westminster, to have , students at Magee by  was made in January as part of ‘New Decade New Approach’. Just weeks later, Stormont handed a poundm off-the-books bailout to UU for its well over-budget North Belfast campus, while simultaneously putting a freeze on Derry development. The city and the region are either the collateral damage of flawed strategic planning or dismissive indference to any regional equality and provision. It has to be one or the other and when you dismiss a region, you dismiss the people who live there. Given the inequitable outcomes flowing from policy-making pursued by a university with government money for almost  years now, it would, in a normal society, merit a full public inquiry. Local representatives and most worryingly, nationalist politicians, who would have traditionally questioned the policy, are failing to alter what is undeniably UU’s ‘Belfast-first’ agenda - to the huge detriment of northwest Ireland which has still, by far, the lowest Higher Education provision on these islands. Derry University Group figures recently put the HE uptake in Derry at fty percent lower than the next lowest in Ireland. The medical school,and when it arrives, is barely a fig leaf to cover UU’s embarrassment, and Stormont’s shame, at how they have treated Derry. It will house just  students – and the capital costs will be financed not by the university, nor central government, nor Stormont, but by the city-region itself from its City Deal package. Despite having failed utterly, and consistently, in its responsibilities to this region, UU stands to become the biggest single beneficiary of the City Deal. Stormont will not, however, underwrite the on-going running costs of the new Derry facility, on the grounds that UU – having spent all its money, and much more besides, in Belfast - is now for all intents and purposes, insolvent. In recent years, following lobbying by the Derry University Group and others, the Dublin government has stated that it is prepared to help lead university development in Derry and northwest Ireland – a promise, indeed, that is reinforced in its new Programme for Government. It is time to make good on that promise. Representative democracy and investment cannot be the trickle-down preserve of just one geographical area or one demographic community. Such presents as unbalanced economic, educational, social and cultural polarisation. It is a poor and failed model for regeneration especially now, given the possible economic and social repercussions of Covid-. The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, a constituent college of the National University, is ideally placed to develop and deliver a medical school in the North West, and can do so rapidly. RCSI currently runs two medical school campuses in Malaysia and another in Bahrain. A new cross-border facility in the North West, operated by RCSI and overseen by the Irish and British governments directly as part of the North-South institutions, would short circuit the bureaucratic and financial logjams at Stormont and UU. It would also provide a starting blueprint for a new, autonomous cross-border university for Derry and Donegal, which ultimately is the only viable solution to the HE crisis here. It is time to put the North West first and allow us to develop our higher education sector independently, away from the grip of centralised decision-makers.

Kelly, who has coached Derry to back to back Celtic Challenge titles and a Nicky Rackard Cup success, feels the main problem with the Ulster championship is the window of opportunity to get it played. In  and , the Ulster championship was played off in two groups. Derry were relegated in  when they conceded the relegation play-off to Down, after defeat to Antrim in the Ulster semi-final. It also followed a winless Division A league and Christy Ring campaign. googletag.cmd.push Donegal were promoted for winning the shield. Derry were the shield winners in , when the competition was played between the league and the Oakleafers successful Nicky Rackard winning campaign. The decision to shelve the Ulster championship completely was taken early in . Ulster official Oliver Galligan conveyed the message to the Antrim and Down teams at the Conor McGurk final. “The restructuring of the national competitions aims to provide a high number of games for Ulster counties at their own level while the apathy towards the Ulster Senior Hurling Championship in recent times has been obvious,” Ulster Secretary Brian McAvoy later told delegates at the Ulster convention at the time. googletag.cmd.push “Therefore, with a heavy heart, the Ulster Senior Hurling Championship has been discontinued for a three year period .” Kelly outlined four options available to the deployment of the Ulster senior hurling championship. The first one was to play it after the league and before the Christy Ring Cup and other tiered championships. Kelly pointed to the need for counties to vote on moving thechampionships back to allow time. The majority of the counties hail from Leinster and Connacht, who would have to restructure their club scene accordingly, to accommodate the Ulster counties. With the hurling league finishing before the football league and with dual players almost defunct, the Ulster championship would need to fit around the club window “That one is the best option,” Kelly points out about slotting the Ulster championship into mid-season. “Thats the gold star one. The next one would be to play it after the Christy Ring is played. We have tried that and it didnt work,” he added, referring to the  season. “Option C is to play it before the National League, which means the Conor McGurk Cup would become the Ulster championship. You could have the Liam Harvey Cup and the Conor McGurk Cup could become the shield of that competition. Thats not degrading it, it is just saying there is an option.” Kellys fourth option would be not to have the Ulster championship, with the current schedule providing enough games and there is no window to play it. “To me, they are the four options and I dont see anything ,” he concluded.

As more and more companies continue to get back to work, we look at how the financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here are examples of how companies have been helped, and what support is available. CASE STUDY KERR’S TYRES  AUTO When Covid- struck, one of Northern Ireland’s leading providers of tyres and automotive services, had just invested pound.m in a new head office and distribution centre in Antrim and cash reserves were low. googletag.cmd.push But thanks to their ability to adapt, ersy as well as the invaluable support from the UK Government, Kerr’s Tyres  Auto has been able play a vital role in servicing and keeping the province’s key workers on the road. Managing director Norman Kerr said: “The Antrim site used up our cash reserves and had a big impact on our cash flow. “Unfortunately the coronavirus kicked in three months later, when we still didn’t have a chance to build up any cash reserves that we would normally have. So it had a massive impact on ourselves. “But the problem was we had to continue trading because we supply the food sector and the white delivery van man. So our business had to continue. We had to pay suppliers, we had no choice in it.” googletag.cmd.push However thanks to a UK Government Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme loan of pound, through the Ulster Bank, as well as the furlough scheme, the family-run business was able to remain solvent and save over  jobs. Norman said: “Had we not been able to get the UK Government loan scheme, it would have had a huge impact on our business. Our business, in essence, dropped probably  per cent within the first month. Thankfully that has grown steadily back since then.  ON THE RIGHT ROAD: Norman Kerr, of Kerr’s Tyres  Auto “We also had to furlough  per cent of our staff in month one. As business picked up again and things moved forward, by month two we were probably down to  per cent. “Month three was  per cent working and we hope within the coming weeks we will have nobody left on furlough. But againit wasn’t for furlough, this would have also had a huge impact on cash flow. “Honestly, when you have  staff, it’s a big bill at the end of every month. We would have had no option but to have laid off around  staff and there was nothing we could have done about that. “So the schemes that the UK Government has introduced have been very helpful.” With  branches, including four in the Republic and seven in Northern Ireland, plus a workforce of over , the UK Government schemes also gave Norman and his team the freedom to ersy and keep some of the leading supermarkets and delivery firms up and running. He said: “We had to ersy dramatically in our business. Collection and delivery rather than customers coming to us. “We had to operate a night sht. So we put four breakdown fitters on our night sht rota. That was to cover the likes of Tesco, Asda and the white van man. “The delivery men have been working   because everything is getting delivered at home. So we found the need to have to serve them on a night sht rota.” With over  years business experience, Kerr’s also adapted to ensure Government guidelines were adhered to. Norman said: “Because we did ersication and received the UK Government help we were able to continue to do business and can look forward to the future.” ‘A real letime in this time of crisis’ CASE STUDY MADEMOISELLE MACARON Rachel Hanretty, of Mademoiselle Macaron, fell in love with macarons while living in Paris. Once Rachel ed to Edinburgh and noticed a gap in the market, she decided to set up her very own macaron business. After nine months of trading from home and going to food markets, Rachel set up her first bricks-and-mortar store. She said: “It was in the centre of Edinburgh, it had a view of the castle. It was beautul.” But since launching their online store in , and realising that they could send macarons across the country, plus the fact that they had large bookings from both wholesale and wedding customers, the bricks and mortar became unnecessary. The company, which employs eight people, lost all their wholesale customers overnight due to Coronavirus. Rachel said: “It was really scary. All the weddings, all the wholesale customers, and the bulk of our production disappeared. And then, of course, you have phone calls from people wanting to cancel future orders and refunds.  TASTY TREATS: Rachel Hanretty, below, has used the furlough scheme to keep Mademoiselle Macaron going  “We entered the cash flow situation whereby the wholesale customers stopped paying the invoices. And we’ve now got over pound, worth of overdue invoices.” But, it’s not all doom and gloom, as Mademoiselle Macaron has started to see an increase in online orders. It’s thanks to the UK Government’s furlough scheme that her business has kept afloat. Rachel said: “The furlough scheme has been a real leline in this time of crisis. I asked people to volunteer for furlough. So the people who wanted to and were happy to, they were the first ones to go.”   ‘We paid creditors and maintained relationships’ CASE STUDY THE SEREN COLLECTION With plans for a new spa at his five-star hotel, a Michelin-star chef in his restaurant and the launch of a tour operator business underway, Neil Kedward was looking forward to a good year in . But when the Covid- pandemic struck, the managing director of Wales-based The Seren Collection required urgent assistance from the UK Government’s support schemes to pay his creditors and maintain supplier relationships. Mr Kedward and his we Zoe entered the hospitality industry almost by accident in . He said: “We just happened to come home to South Wales for the weekend and stumbled across The Grove. It was a calamitous trip with lots of wrong turns and family arguments, but we found the owner in, made our offer and that was that.”  FINANCIAL AID: Neil Kedward, of The Seren Collection Neil and Zoe went on to open two restaurants in Saundersfoot and Oxwich on the back of the success of The Grove. Asthat weren’t enough to keep the team busy, he also spotted a gap in the tour operator market. Neil said: “ It struck me that there weren’t enough tour operators bringing people into the country. So we started a business called routescape, which had a hugely encouraging start, launching at World Travel Market before a big business development trip in . And then, of course, the whole project was wiped out by the virus. We lost every single booking. “The loan from the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme has allowed us to pay off all our creditors and we will be able to relaunch owing nobody any money.” Help available to companies and workers Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers. middot The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has enabled businesses to put employees on a period of temporary leaveand apply for a UK Government grant to cover  per cent of those workers’ usual monthly wage costs, up to pound, a month. middot The Self-Employment Income Support Scheme will allow eligible self-employed iniduals to claim a taxable grant of  per cent of their average monthly profits, up to pound,. middot UK VAT-registered firms have been given the option to defer VAT payments until the end of June.

Despite not yet being built, the futuristic eco-house, which is called The Qube, has gone up for sale in the Prehen area of the Waterside with a price tag of pound,. The five-bedroom property called The Qube will be built on land beside the Everglades Hotel. It has been advertised as one of Northern Irelands only passive houses, which means it will use very little energy and leave a small ecological footprint. The three-story dwelling will also be a smart home and the lights, heating and blinds can all be operated from a tablet or smartphone. googletag.cmd.push  The , sq ft building will be locatedon a triangular piece of landat the junction of Prehen Road andHazelwood Avenue. This heavily-wooded area is home to a number of mature trees which arecovered by a Tree Preservation Order . Although work on the property is yet to begin, it has full planning permission. However, the journey to obtaining this was not a smooth one. In Northeern Ireland, local councils are responsible for most planning decisions. Each council has planning officers who make recommendations about planning applications. However, the Planning Committee, which is made up of councillors, has the option to reject these recommendations. googletag.cmd.push The planning application for The Qube first came before Derry City and Strabane District Councils Planning Committee last September. Council planners provided councillors with a detailed report which recommended that planning permission be refused for the building.  The meeting was also told that  letters of objection had been sent by local residents. Among their concerns werethe destructionof ancient woodland and mature trees and the suggestion that the buildingis out of character and proportion with theexisting neighbouring properties. The report said thatthe building went ahead it would have adversely affected thecharacterandenvironmental quality of theof thesurrounding area through the loss of an important and well establishedurban woodland greenspace. Councillors agreed to defer the decision for a site visit, which took place on September  last year and which was attended by seven councillors. On September , the Planning Committee voted not toaccept the recommendation to refuse the planning application and agreed to reconsider itfurther information on the Tree Protection Order was provided. The council sent out additional notications to all neighbours, objectors and supporters ofthe scheme in January this year and  more letters were received, with six in objection to the application and  in support. The letters in support said the site was an eyesore and the owner of the proposed building would have a vested interest in maintaining it. On March  this year, the Planning Committee met again and was told council planners had not changed their position that planning permission should be refused. The Principal Planning Officer told elected members an Arboriculture Impact Assessment had been carried out which broadly agreed with the initial recommendation that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate the proposed scheme would not have a detrimental impact on the Tree Preservation Ordersite. DUP Alderman Hilary McClintock, who attended the site visit, told the meeting she did not believe the protected trees would be affected by the proposed building. She proposed to overturn the decision of the planning officer and for approval to be granted subject to conditions provided by planners. The proposal was seconded by SDLP councillor Angela Dobbins and was passed after seven votes for, three against and three abstentions. On Friday, a spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council confirmed that that an application for the Prehen building came before the Planning Committee in September  with a recommendation to refuse as it would result in the loss of a valuable urban woodland green space and the applicant had failed to demonstrate that this dwelling would not have an adverse impact on existing trees. The recommendation was not accepted by elected members and the application came back before the committee on March of this year as a reconsidered application, following a visit to the site by elected members and the submission of further information, said the spokesperson. Whilst the officers presented an unaltered opinion to refuse, elected members voted to approved the application.” The sale of The Qube, which was designed by architect Gerard McPeake, is being handled by McGuinness Fleck Estate Agents   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The championship was put on hold for three seasons, at the start of the  season. Derry won back to back titles in  and , but have not contested a final since the the  final at Owenbeg. Goals from Ruairi Convery and Paddy McCloskey had Derry well in the hunt. Convery, who scored -, levelled the game before Daniel McKernans winner. Antrim have won the last  in succession, with Down not lting the title since . Armagh reached the final in  and , losing to the Saffrons, before the competition was paused for three years, given the new tiered All-Ireland structure which has saw Derry play at Nicky Rackard and Christy Ring level. googletag.cmd.push The  season was the final year of the experiment with the Ulster hurling championship.  The County Derry Post contacted Ulster GAA for clarication of the future of the competition andthere were any further developments. “No decision has yet been taken on this matter. Its a matter for CCCC and Coiste Bainisti and we dont have any detail as to when it will be discussed,” read a statement from Ulster GAA PRO Declan Woods. In a special feature this week, we get the thoughts from Derry, Antrim and Down on the Ulster championship and where it could fit into the calendar. googletag.cmd.push “A provincial championship is a provincial championship. I think there could be a window for it before the Christy Ring,” felt Derry senior manager John McEvoy. Kevin Kelly, a former Derry selector, is on the Ulster Hurling Development committee feels there are four options available, but the best option would be after the league. Antrim captain Conor McCann said the Saffrons would welcome it back, but there needed to be the reward of an automatic spot in the All-Ireland series for the winner. Down boss Ronan Sheehan hit out at the Ulster Council for not having a championship in place.“I make no bones about this, I think the Ulster Council are reneging on their responsibilities by failing to have an Ulsterchampionship,” he said.

Ciaraacuten McShane died last Monday as a result of a road collision on a stretch of the M motorway in County Louth. On Sunday, mourners at the Church of St John the Baptist heard how the -year-old father-of-two had been working to establish a family home for what he called his ‘wee unit’. Fr Charles Kearney told those gathered for his funeral that the former Crossroads PS and St Paul’s pupil had a great sense of humour. googletag.cmd.push “The fourth and youngest of his family, he turned out to be great craic, very quick-witted,” he said. “He had many, many friends. He was a good son and brother. When he began to go out and about, he ended up in Maghera, in Walsh’s Hotel, where he met the love of his le. “They were together for eleven years, and six, of course, as man and we. They have two beautul children, Conan and Carina.” The congregation heard how Ciaraacuten, a plumber by trade, lived for a Sunday, which he designated as a day to be spent with his young family. googletag.cmd.push “Another important thing for Ciaraacuten was a Sunday,” said Fr Kearney. “Sunday was his family day and he played with the children. They watched movies and had great fun together. He adored them and they adored him. “He had built his own house and was working to establish a good family home for his ‘wee unit’. He was a real family man and he is going to miss so many firsts. “One was coming up very soon, when Conan starts school just across the road in September. In his short le, Ciaraacuten McShane brought so much love, joy and goodness to people. “He most certainly will be rewarded for all of that.” Local Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Councillor, Sean Bateson, described Ciaraacuten as a ‘proper gentleman, one of the good guys in le’. Pearse’s GAC, Kilrea, where Ciaraacuten played football in his younger days, said they were ‘deeply saddened’ by his passing. “Ciaran played underage with the club and then came back to kit out for the reserves on many occasions. “One thing that everyone will tell you about Ciaran was that he always had a big smile on his face and his sense of humour was infectious.” Ciaraacuten will be sadly missed by his we Shauna, their children Conan and Carina, his parents Bertie and Patricia and siblings Siobhaacuten, Damian and Odraacuten and all his wider family and friends. Fr Kearney summed things up by telling mourners to look back on all Ciaraacuten achieved. “Sometimes bad things happen accidentally, and we know that’s part of le, but it’s devastating when it happens. “We should look back at his years among you and see what he achieved, and it was much.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The supermarket giant wants to build a new store in the Buncrana Road area of the city. The company first applied for planning permission for the proposed store on a vacant site at the junction of Buncrana Road and Springtown Roadin .  The Derry News has learned that planners at Derry City and Strabane District Council have recommended that planning permission be granted for the store. The final approval for the development now rests with councillors on the council’s planning committee. If the new supermarket gets the green light from local councillors, Lidl says it will close its current store at Buncrana Road. googletag.cmd.push However, the company would retain its current building for storage purposes. In its planning submissions, Lidl said that they wanted to build a new larger store in Derry because of the lack of expansion space at its present store. The proposed new store would have much more parking facilities. The entrance to the new store would be via the Springtown Road which would reduce the traffic pressure on the busy Buncrana Road. Traffic entering and leaving Lidl’s current store creates a frequent bottleneck on the Buncrana Road. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Marie Lindsay is to step down as principal of St Marys College. Among those to pay tribute to her work was a spokesperson for St Eugenes Cathedral. A parish spokesperson said Mrs Lindsay had a great impact on the lives of students and staff through her leadership in St Marys College. She has also directly advanced the mission of evangelisation of the Church here in the Diocese of Derry. As an educator and leader, Marie has made an exceptional contribution to Catholic education here in the City and beyond. Marie, on behalf of everyone in the St Eugenes Parish we wish you very well in your retirement, the spokesperson added. googletag.cmd.push Mrs Lindsay joined St Marys in  and taught science for  years before being appointed principal in . During her time as principal, St Marys were involved in the first formal Shared Education Programme with Lisneal College. In , the school was awarded Specialist Status in Science and continues to promote STEM subjects and career paths. In , Mrs Lindsay was named Principal of the Year at the Foyle Blackboard Awards and in April  she was inducted into the Business Excellence Hall of Fame. Derrys Mayor Brian Tierney said Mrs Lindsay had done so much for education within the city. googletag.cmd.push Its with great pleasure that I offer my congratulations to Marie on her retirement, and with great admiration that I look back on everything that she has achieved both as teacher and, later, as a principal at St Marys College. Marie perfectly captured everything that teaching is about as she went above and beyond every day to put the needs of her students first. She was incredibly active within the community, including on our Council Education and Skills working group, to ensure that those not just within her own school, but across the district also,were receiving the best education they could. With two of her daughters recently welcoming a set of twins each Im sure she will certainly be kept very busy, and I look forward to welcoming Marie, her husband Collie and her family to the Mayors Parlour to celebrate her career when the guidelines allow it. I wish Marie a healthy and happy retirement, and offer my sincere thanks to her for everything she has done for theeducation sectorin our district.

The call comes as bars and restaurants who can provide food on site prepare to open from tomorrow. Among the bars who have grouped together is The Dugout Bar in Maghera, and manager Una McReynolds says those making the rules are out of touch with reality. “The reason we can’t open is because we’ve been told we’re too dangerous,” she told Derry Now. “I would say % of the people making these decisions have never been in a local pub. They’re seeing what goes on in the Cathedral Quarter on a busy Saturday night, but that’s not real le. googletag.cmd.push “If we get four people through the door on a weekday, it’s like Christmas to us, we think it’s great. Even at weekends, we probably still wouldn’t be shoulder to shoulder. “Our customers can’t understand why we aren’t open. People don’t read into the specics of it, so everybody just thinks that all the bars can open tomorrow.” The online petition was launched by the owner of McKenna’s Bar in Armagh and has found support in many quarters, with pubs in Newry and Ballymena voicing support along with The Dugout. With the bigger establishments in a position to open their doors, Una feels the regulations show the inequality and discrimination at play. googletag.cmd.push “Hospitality is hospitality. It’s like saying the barbers can open but the hairdressers can’t, because women sit in the hairdressers longer than a man sits in the barbers,” she said. “We’re completely left alone. There is discrimination and inequality. Local pubs are never going to be able to survivethis continues. “All the big establishments are now allowed m social distancing, we’re not even allowed m. We can’t open our doors at all. “Who’s going to fight for us  I sent a message to a junior minster last week, but he couldn’t answer any of my questions. All he could say was ‘scientic evidence’. “Well, show us the scientic evidence that says sitting at a table, eating a burger and having a glass of wine is okay, but sitting at the same table just drinking a glass of wine is not.” The pressure has been exacerbated by dferences between the ious jurisdictions, and the recent political crisis sparked by Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neills presence at the funeral of veteran republican, Bobby Storey. “Now Sky TV are pushing the small bars to give them an update by July , when they’re going to reinstate charges,” said Una. “They just see that in the UK, the bars are open again. England are open on Saturday, Scotland have a date, the south have a date and the north of Ireland have nothing. “We now are in the situation where those in power have decided to throw their toys out of the pram over the weekend. “We’re in the middle of a pandemic, everyone waits to hear about a date and now they won’t even give press briefings. “Small pubs are the hub of the community. Some people would love to go out and have a pint, but they can’t afford to have a meal with their pint. “We have no one to turn to, because no one is responding. We’ve been left high and dry, nobody is making a decision for us and we are extremely frustrated.” The petition can be viewed here.

In an anonymous poll conducted by the County Derry Post, with  responses,  of John McEvoys squad indicated they would play for Team Ulster, yet only eight of the squad would see it as a benefit to hurling in the county. As part of the survey comments were sought. One said it was a good idea but it wouldnt be easily organised. All the rest spoke out against it, citing a range of reasons. googletag.cmd.push The combined Ulster team wouldnt compete with Top  teams for the McCarthy Cup, hence it would be a waste of time and resources should be used to get the Ulster championship resurrected. Another respondent pointed to Derrys ability to compete in the Joe McDonagh Cupall the best players in Derry were playing. With more publicity, the current tiered structure was the better solution. Team Ulster would paper over the cracks was another comment, with the already considerable training load also offered as a reason to oppose the concept. On the topic of bringing back the Ulster senior hurling championship,  players indicated it should be ed after its three-year absence. googletag.cmd.push One respondent, who commented at , felt Team Ulster was nice to chat about but would only serve players who felt they needed to be playing in the Liam McCarthy Cup. Full commitment to the Derry jersey, from all the best players, full backing from the county board and supporters, was the way forward, something he felt was happening. Of the squad,  felt it should be played after the league and before the tiered hurling championships, such as the Christy Ring and Joe McDonagh Cups. The remainder opted for a window in pre-season, before the leagues. One respondent felt that Antrim would be so far away from the rest of the pack, but a combined rest of Ulster team playing the Saffrons would diminish the competition.

July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Ambitious cafe plans for to boost Comber centre  ","story":"PLANS for an exciting new lsquocafe culturersquo in Comber have been unveiled.A meeting to discuss the way forward was held in the town on Monday morning, with Ards and North Down Council officials joined by Chamber of Commerce representatives and local councillor Deborah Girvan.Work has been ongoing to develop a strategy on the way forward for Comber as coronavirus lockdown measures continue to ease, with more and more businesses reopening after being closed for four months.News of Mondayrsquos meeting comes ahead of the reopening of the hugely popular Comber Farmersrsquo Market tomorrow which also coincides with its sixth anniversary.A special cake will be cut by council chairman Trevor Cummings who will be joined by Northern Ireland Officer Minister of State Robin Walker.The market has been closed for the past three months as a result of Covid- with its reopening viewed as a boost for existing traders who will benefit from the increased footfall.Alderman Girvan mdash who arranged Mondayrsquos meeting in conjunction with Comber Chamber of Commerce mdash said cafes, restaurants and pubs have been among the hardest hit industries during the coronavirus pandemic.And with the hospitality businesses able to open their doors to the public this Friday, she thought that it would be beneficial to meet with the council to see what support it give to catering businesses to allow food to be served outdoors on pavements.ldquoEven though the two-metre social distancing rule will be halved, it will still be dficult for hospitality businesses to increase their capacity unless they expand outdoors, said Mrs Girvan.ldquoComber is the perfect place to introduce a cafeacute culture as there are wide footpaths on three sides of the town square and,permission for this is granted, it will create a kaleidoscope of colourful tables, chairs and umbrella shades.Mrs Girvan hopes that it will also attract more shoppers, cyclists and visitors to Comber as it slowly emerges out of lockdown.She also recognises that before anything happens, there are many issues to consider and for consultation with residents and businesses, describing Mondayrsquos meeting as a ldquofirst step to explore the opportunities and possibilities of reconfiguring footpaths to ensure the safety of visitors, shoppers, and cyclists.News of the cafe culture plan comes just days after the local council agreed to help hospitality businesses back on their feet by waiving the pound fee for a so-called pavement cafeacute licence fee, initially for nine months.Comber Chamber of Commerce chairwoman Laura Bradley, who is also director of the Indie Fude delicatessen, described the past few as ldquoextremely dficult for retailers across Northern Ireland.She said apart from shops that are selling food and drink, the majority of businesses in Comber have been closed for almost four months.ldquoComber has been branded the lsquohome of great tastersquo and the town has built up a strong reputation for producing, cooking and serving excellent food, continued Laura.ldquoWe have the monthly artisan farmersrsquo market, award winning restaurants, cafes and food shops, and a discerning customer base which comes from far and wide to avail of high quality, locally grown produce.The Chamber chairwoman said she had no doubt that creating a cafeacute culture will not only help all the businesses in Comber, but also help build upon the success of the food industry that is firmly established in the area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Championship draws made  ","story":"THE draws for the  Down Football

There are over , megaliths in Europe alone but the one outside Killyleagh is quite possibly the most recent of them all.It was erected in  with one thousand young people raising the so-called Strangford Stone using only their bare hands and a lot of scientic know-how.Joe speaks to the people involved in the original design and installation of the stone which was a feat in civil, mechanical and electrical engineering.Safety was a massive consideration, given that , young people were to be on site pulling the stone upright by hand into position.It is certainly a very special monument, not only because itrsquos a Millennium Stone, but also because of the remarkable way in which it was erected.Among those whom Joe talks to are Saintfieldrsquos Martyn Todd, who was heavily involved in the megalith project. His daughter, Katy, one of the volunteers who helped pull the giant stone into place.The tallest megalith in the British Isles faces the Mourne Mountains from where it was excavated.After being quarried in the Mournes, the huge stone was transported by road to the country park and was described by the Millennium Commission as ldquoone of the simplest and most directly appealing of all the year  projects.Four years before it was hauled into place, a group of people decided to bring , young people together to celebrate the start of a new millennium by pulling up the stone.They hoped, as the peace process was gaining momentum, to involve young people from all backgrounds in Northern Ireland to create a lasting testament to a shared future.In November , the Millennium Commission awarded pound, to the Strangford Stone project, with the remaining costs donated as contributions in kind by all the people who worked on it.The former Down Council gave permission for Delamont to become home to the stone which is located on an elevated site which boasts superb views over Strangford Lough and towards Slieve Croob and the Mountains of Mourne.The McConnell family quarried a single block of granite weighing over  tonnes mdash the largest ever-quarried in Ireland mdash trimmed it along the grain of rock, using the ancient plug and feathers technique, to its smallest natural size, twelve and a half metres long.However, during the trimming, a weakness in the granite was discovered, resulting in the stone being split into two parts and then rejoined with three stainless steel dowels.A special steel cradle to support the stone during the pull was designed, as were special low-stretch ropes, a hydraulic safety system and the three metres deep concrete foundation for the stone. Others recruited and trained the teams of young people or provided legal, financial and insurance support for the project.Anyone unable to tune in next Monday night can watch the programme on www.itv utvprogrammes..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"MP calls for Ancient East tour region to include Down  ","story":"MARKETING a large swathe of East Down on an all-island basis would help produce a signicant boost for local tourism, according to South Down MP Chris Hazzard.He has asked Stormont tourism minister Diane Dodds to work with tourism agencies on either side of the border to extend Irelandrsquos Ancient East Tourism region to include a large part of Down District.Mr Hazzard was responding to the publication of the tourism ministerrsquos lsquoeconomic recovery strategyrsquo and believes that such a move would help the South Down tourism industry recover from Covid- and help mitigate ldquothe looming Brexit shock.Mr Hazzard argues that itrsquos ldquoludicrous that Failte Irelandrsquos lsquoAncient Eastrsquo tourism region stops in Louth, excluding the historically signicant north-east region of the island.He said that a large part of East Down was the playground for Cuacute Chulainn and Fionn Mac Cumhaill ldquowith the landscape forever marked by St Patrickrsquos legacy, surrounded by shoreline that welcomed Vikings, Planters and the Normans.The MP said that in Downpatrick, there are the graves of the patron saint and Viking King Magnus.He continued: ldquoWe have the impressive Downpatrick and Co Down Railway Museum, the only working heritage railway in the North which stretches out to the historic Inch Abbey.ldquoUnder the shadow of Down Cathedral, we have the only St Patrickrsquos visitor exhibition in the world, with the nearby Down County Museum located in the historic buildings of the th century gaol where United Irish leader, Thomas Russell, was executed in .Mr Hazzard said the northern side of Downpatrick was surrounded by the Mound of Down, Finnebrogue Wood and the stunning Quoile Nature Reserve, with Delamont Country Park completing the short journey to the shores of Strangford Lough where the Vikings first landed.ldquoTo the east lies Struell Wells and St Patrickrsquos first church at Saul, a unique site known widely as the cradle of christianity in Ireland, the MP continued, insisting it is ldquosimply unacceptable that this rich heritage would be a victim of partitionism of the very worst kind.Mr Hazzard said local tourism providers had been hit hard by the Covid- pandemic, with many very worried about the impact of Brexit and ldquoneedless bureaucratic hurdles.He continued: ldquoUndoubtedly, they need to be supported in the years ahead and I have have written to the tourism minister asking her to look seriously at this opportunity.ldquoNow is the time to extend the lsquoAncient Eastrsquo region and also the Wild Atlantic Way coastal route into the north to encompass all that is worth seeing on the island of Ireland.He added: ldquoQuite simply, it is the best way to successfully mitigate the impact of Covid- and Brexit on the local tourism industry..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"New president appointed at Downpatrick Lions Club  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK Lions Club has appointed Raymond Crea as its new president.Mr Crea succeeds Mr John Dennis, who presented him with his chain of office during a socially-distanced handover.Reflecting on his year in office, John said that while it was disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic, it was nevertheless rewarding, thanking his fellow club members and wider public for their enthusiasm and support.Mr Crea said he was delighted to take over an important role at the helm of the organisation.He said he looked forward to finding new ways to raise funds in what he described as ldquochallenging times for numerous charities that Downpatrick Lions support..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Newcastle man Paul  climbs world’s toughest peaks  ","story":"FOR most of us sleeping on a narrow bed suspended hundreds of metres high off El Capitan, Calorniarsquos famous vertical rock wall in Yosemite Valley, would be utterly fear-inducing.Not so for mountain guide and expert rock climber Paul Swail, who first discovered his love of mountains growing up in Newcastle at the foot of the Mournes.For the  year-old, itrsquos the best nightrsquos sleep ever.ldquoYou get the most amazing nightrsquos sleep in one of those, said Paul, referring to a piece of equipment called a portaledge where rock climbers sleep and eat in during a long climb.ldquoWe spent six days climbing one of the El Cap routes and we didnrsquot want to get out of our beds in the morning.ldquoYes, we were knackered but itrsquos the comfiest thing you will ever sleep on. With all the fresh air and seeing the stars at night, when you wake up, all you can see is the ground hundreds of metres below you, itrsquos just amazing.Paul now lives in Chamonix at the foot of Mont Blanc in the French Alps with his English we, Ellie, and toddler son Luca. Luca was only weeks old when his parents climbed Slieve Donard on a trip home with him safely tucked inside a sling on his fatherrsquos chest.Hersquos enjoying his time lsquorestingrsquo from his day job of guiding people on challenging climbs of the Alpsrsquo highest peaks of Mont Blanc, the Matterhorn and the Eiger to spend time with his son.Depending on the mountain, he guides either one or two people up the peaks and safely down again.Paul explained: ldquoThe people who hire me are time poor but money rich. They can afford to employ a mountain guide like me. Doing the Matterhorn and Eiger are much more technical guiding as it on a one to one ratio.ldquoMont Blanc is mostly snow and ice and really exposed with some sections of scrambling where with the Matterhorn, you are pretty much on your hands from the start all the way to the top and all the way back down.Mont Blanc at , metres is the high European peak outside Russia and a mountain that Paul has come to know very well. He prefers to take his clients up later during the day, descending near sunset, to avoid the growing numbers of commercial climbers.Supported by the French government during lockdown from March , Paul has been able toto guiding over the last six weeks but he was still hampered by the fact says that British and Irish people were unable to fly.Born in Vancouver to Northern Ireland parents who emigrated to Canada to escape the Troubles, Paul was  when the announcement of the first IRA ceasefire came in . A year later the family moved back and decided to settle in Newcastle.He was one of the first students to attend Shimna Integrated College at its current King Street site in Newcastle and within years Paul showed his love of the outdoors, particularly mountains.ldquoMy dad and I used to walk in the Mourne mountains, he said. ldquoI had skied in Canada, but really got into the mountains back home.ldquoMy first experience of rock climbing was being taken to Altnadue Quarry just outside Castlewellan by a family friend and I just loved it.ldquoWhile I had played soccer and done a bit of running for the school, I wasnrsquot really into sports. It was around my fth year that I really veered to be more interested in outdoor pursuits. I really didnrsquot knowI wanted it as a career but after getting into climbing, it did shape what options that I was interested in.Paul went on to do a degree in outdoor education at the University of Central Lancashire and made the Tollymore National Outdoor Centre his second home when he ed home during holidays and post-college.Once he completed college, his time was split between taking climbing and outdoor pursuit courses back home. While working in France, he would ski and climb during the day in the Alps and work in bars at night, with the sole focus of funding trips such as climbing El Capitan twice or climbing in Patagonia.He went on to become a guide with the International Federation of Mountain Guides Associations, which is the highest recognised mountaineering qualication in the world and the only qualication valid to work outside the UK and Ireland for climbing and off-piste skiing on glaciated terrain.Paulrsquos only salaried job to date was as a youth development officer for Mountaineering Ireland for four years from  based out of Tollymore where he taught young climbers the importance of enjoying the mountains responsibly and safely.Paul said: ldquoI worked every minute I could freelancing to fund the next trip and when I ran out of money, I came back home to work again. Up until my late s, I never thought much about the future, it was just living for the moment.ldquoIrsquove never really had a secure income until I had the Mountaineering Ireland job and it allowed me to buy a house in Castlewellan.While his responsibility to provide for his family is uppermost in his mind, Paul is not yet finished with his need to climb and explore mdash although, interestingly, the worldrsquos highest mountain, Everest, is not on his wish list.ldquoTherersquos a letime of climbs that I would love to do, said Paul. ldquoI love to go back to Patagonia in Argentina to climb Cerro Torre, which for me is the most beautul mountain in the world every climber dreams of standing on top of it. Or the Blasket Islands innorthern Canada would be quite high on my list.ldquoEverest has never appealed to me to go and climb as itrsquos not very dficult technically now. Itrsquos a challenge due to the seriousness of the weather and acclimatising to the attitude makes an extremely serious mountain because of its height.ldquoBut I donrsquot think you need a huge amount of skill to get up Everest and I donrsquot believe you actually have to be a rock climber. You do need to be fit and to be able to acclimatise your body to altitude and you need to have a lot of money.His friend and mentor Dawson Stelfox mdash who became the first Irish man to ascend Everest on his own in May,  mdash is something of a trailblazer to Paul.ldquoI didnrsquot realise that in , when Dawson made the summit on his own, there were no fixed ropes as there are today, there wasnrsquot the support from Sherpas and so on, said Paul.ldquoThat would appeal to meEverest was like that now, then I would love to go. But I donrsquot want to and sit and wait in a queue of  people to get to the top of the mountain.ldquoI really like to explore and there would need to be technical challenge to it as well, apart from overcoming the physical challenges and altitude.ldquoIf you were to take El Cap and put it somewhere a bit remote where it would take you a couple of days to get to it and very few people have climbed it, you would have about , metres of vertical rock to climb. Now that would be really rewarding..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"October next National League date for Down  ","story":"IT has been over  weeks now since Down last played a league game mdash against Offaly on March .The next league game is due to take place against Leitrim on Saturday, October , or the following day,the Covid- virus continues to fizzle out.

Powys.NRW proposed the dam as one option to alleviate potential flood risk.More NewsVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldMillions become unpaid carers due to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh Government is keen for Wales to become an exemplar of good practice. community involvement and support will remain key features of our campaign.He added: ldquoWe are grateful to people far and wide who have supported our campaign, including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge where the stream passes under the A to reduce flood risk.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquolsquoFollowing our meeting on May  Sir David Henshaw chairman of NRW wrote to me on May  to say that NRW received almost  responses to our consultation on the Outline Business Case with the vast majority being opposed to the upstream storage option on the Cadoxton Brook.NRW chairman, Sir Henshaw said: ldquoWhen we consider the marginal case for this option, it is therefore clear that we will not be pursuing an upstream storage scheme. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

It centres on long-standing racism and disadvantage, and the lack of BAME representation within decision-making processes,\" said Professor Ogbonna, who is also a trustee and vice-chair of Race Council Wales.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic is, in some respects, revealing the consequences of a lack of action on race equality.ldquoMany of the issues wersquove highlighted have been identied and discussed previously, but they havenrsquot been addressed in any systematic and sustained way.Analysis of Covid- related deaths across England and Wales by ethnicity showed that people from a black ethnic background are at a greater risk of death involving COVID- than all other ethnic groups.The Office for National Statistics study showe that the risk for black males has been more than three times higher than white males, and nearly two-and-a-half times higher for black females than white.Adjusting for socio-economic factors and geographical location partly explains the increased risk, but there remains twice the risk for black males and around one-and-a-half times for black females.

have seen a massive increase in areas such as recycling and waste.The other area of increased spending is in social services, which normally spends around  per cent of our budget.\"That is going to go up dramatically because people are getting frailer and succumbing to covid- and we are also supporting people in care homes and providing PPE for our staff and the care homes.Overall the virus is

while the council takes steps to mitigate further issues.A meeting with residents and the local community council was held on Tuesday, June  to explain the steps the council would be taking, in the

From this date, passengers travelling on most bus, train and ferry services in Northern Ireland will be required to wear a face covering. Face coverings will also be required in public transport stations. There will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for health and medical reasons, and for children under the age of . Outdoor areas of a ferry where social distancing can be maintained will be exempt from the requirements, along with school transport.  The Executive has agreed that the cross-departmental group that has been established to consider face coverings will engage with the tour coach and taxi industry to explore extending the requirement to these transport modes. Making the announcement, Minister Nichola Mallon said: “As we move through the Executive’s recovery plan, more and more of the economy and society is opening up. Wemust remember however that Covid- is still with us. We need to remain vigilant and continue to play our part in controlling the virus to protect ourselves and others. “As restrictions on our movement are eased, the safety of passengers and staff remains my priority.The evidence suggests that you can reduce the risk of spreading the virus by wearing a face covering. That is why, with the support of my Executive colleagues and the unions, I am announcing that face coverings will be mandatory on public transport, from Friday July th. “The requirement will apply to passengers and also staff in public areas who are not protected by a screen. However, there will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for specic health and medical reasons.” A face covering is a covering of any type which covers a person’s nose and mouth it does not have to be a surgical face mask. While face coverings can offer protection to others, they are not a substitute for other protective measures and it is important that people continue to follow social distancing and wash or sanitise hands regularly. Minister Mallon continued: “We are asking you to take personal responsibility and do the right thing to protect the health and well-being of others. The fact of the matter is you can spread the virus to other more vulnerable people without even knowing you have it. By wearing a face covering you are showing your support and consideration for other passengers and staff. “It is important to be aware that wearing face coverings will not be suitable for all members of the public and we need to be sensitive to this and know that reasons for not wearing a face covering may not always be visible. “Advice will be available on nidirect and social media channels. Translink staffwill begin preparing commuters for the requirement to wear face coverings. “It is also important that you do not get a  sense of security about the level of protection a face covering offers. They are not a substitute for social distancing or good hand hygiene. While I know many will find it challenging in the coming days and weeks to keep up compliance with the rules, I want to applaud the public for their leadership. The public have done the heavy lting and kept us all safe. You have been the leaders in Northern Ireland fighting Covid- and I am asking you to keep it up and we will beat this together. “By acting together and thinking of each other we can reduce the risk of transmission.”  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dafaaaecfecbd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_edbfecbaaedfbc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
