Labour MP John Mann claims there are 70 colleagues who are opposed to a second referendum and up to 35 may vote for the PM\u0027s dealLast night it was claimed that Attorney General Geoffrey Cox has \u0027admitted defeat\u0027 on his plans to secure an end date to Irish backstop.He denied this today saying a report in the Daily Telegraph was based on \u0027misunderstood fag ends dressed up as facts\u0027.But refusing to be drawn further he said: \u0027Complex and detailed negotiations cannot be conducted in public\u0027. Cox will return to Brussels with Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay for more negotiations tomorrow. Labour Leave-supporter John Mann says that a group of rebel MPs willing to vote with the PM in the Commons  has increased from a handful of MPs to approaching 35.Mr Mann, who represents Bassetlaw in Nottinghamshire, believes that 70 of his colleagues are opposed to holding another referendum - and \u0027possibly half as many\u0027 may back the Tory deal with Brussels. He told The Sun: \u0027The choice facing us all is either to deliver Brexit as we promised or to vote for a second referendum. When the deal comes before Parliament again, the clear choice will be the deal or a second referendum\u0027.           Labour MPs have said the Prime Minister can \u0027keep her money\u0027 and said the money being offered is a bribe          The Prime Minister walks with Nicholas Papadopulos, Dean of Salisbury, and Tricia Glass, Deputy Head Guide at Salisbury Cathedral, as she visited the historic city one year since the nerve agent attack by the Russians on Sergei SkripalMrs May was accused of \u0027bribery\u0027 today after setting out plans to funnel nearly £1billion to ‘left-behind’ towns in the North and Midlands as part of a package of ‘bribes’ designed to persuade Labour MPs to back her Brexit deal. A further £600million will be made available for towns across the country to bid for. Wigan’s Labour MP Lisa Nandy, who has said her vote is \u0027not for sale\u0027, tweeted today: ‘This Stronger Towns announcement just keeps getting worse. To put it in context in Wigan alone we’ve had cuts of £134million since 2010 with more in the pipeline\u0027. But Don Valley MP and former Labour minister Caroline Flint, who has urged Jeremy Corbyn to allow Labour MPs to have a free vote on Theresa May’s Brexit deal, was more receptive.‘I have long argued that the voices and concerns of our smaller towns need to be heard’, she said.‘Too many funding pots are hoovered up by cities or massive infrastructure projects.‘The Stronger Towns Fund isn’t enough but it is a step forward.’       Attorney General Geoffrey Cox is said to have admitted defeat on getting the EU to agree a firm end date to the Irish backstop    Justice minister Rory Stewart said the threat that Brexit could be delayed, softened or even halted was focusing minds among Eurosceptic MPs   Theresa May\u0027s office pays tribute to \u0027beautiful, welcoming\u0027 Salisbury a year on from novichok attack by posting a picture of BathDowning Street blamed \u0027human error\u0027 for a social media post about Theresa May\u0027s visit to Salisbury being illustrated by a picture of Bath.A message on the Prime Minister\u0027s official Twitter feed paid tribute to the \u0027beautiful, welcoming\u0027 Wiltshire city on the anniversary of the poison attack on former Russian double agent Sergei and Yulia Skripal on its streets.But rather than a picture of the famous 123-metre spire of Salisbury Cathedral, the message was accompanied by a shot of St John the Evangelist Roman Catholic Church 40 miles away in Bath.\u0027I hope that moving forward Salisbury will once again be known for being a beautiful, welcoming English city and not for the events of 4 March 2018,\u0027 said the PM in her message.

The approach mirrors that adopted by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge for their children, George, five, Charlotte, three, and Louis, ten months.They later appointed Maria Borrallo, a graduate of the prestigious Norland College, when George was a few months old, although it is understood that Meghan may bring in a nanny when her child is younger than that.Last night Norland College declined to say if they had been approached by the couple.It is understood that Harry and Meghan have been ‘listening to advice from friends’ including George Clooney’s wife Amal, who had twins in June 2017, and fashion stylist Jessica Mulroney, who has three children.          It is understood that Harry and Meghan have been ‘listening to advice from friends’ including George Clooney’s wife Amal, who had twins in June 2017, and fashion stylist Jessica Mulroney, who has three childrenWhile Meghan will take formal maternity leave and is unlikely to attend public engagements, she is determined to remain active behind the scenes working for her various causes. But a source said: ‘This is her first baby and there will be a certain degree of playing it by ear.’In January, Meghan became patron of the National Theatre, the Association of Commonwealth Universities, the animal welfare charity Mayhew and Smart Works, which helps women get jobs.She will this week join a panel including singer Annie Lennox and former Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard to mark International Women’s Day, where they will discus issues such as ‘access to education and limitations in employment’.Meanwhile, builders have been working feverishly to complete the refurbishment of Frogmore Cottage in Home Park, Windsor. Harry and Meghan hope to move to the Grade II listed property from Kensington Palace within the next three weeks.The move may mean that Meghan chooses not to give birth at the Lindo Wing, the exclusive maternity ward at St Mary’s Hospital in Central London where the Duchess of Cambridge had her three children, but instead use a hospital ‘closer to home’.One option would be Frimley Park Hospital in Berkshire, which is about 15 miles from Windsor and where the Countess of Wessex had her children. It comes amid reports Meghan and Harry are considering raising their child \u0027gender neutral\u0027 – understood to mean they will not enforce any male or female stereotypes.        Gender neutral:  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are said to be looking at bring up their child without gender stereotypes According to a source, who has known the Duchess for many years and was at her wedding: \u0027Meghan has been talking to some of her friends about the birth and how she and Harry plan to raise their baby.\u0027She said they plan to raise their child with a fluid approach to gender and they won\u0027t be imposing any stereotypes.\u0027The most likely scenario is that the couple could choose to forgo traditional blues and pinks to match the baby\u0027s gender. They could also avoid conventional gender-biased toys such as dolls for girls and train sets for boys.Last night a senior Kensington Palace aide refused to rule out the possibility of the baby being raised gender neutral.       Gone with traditional: Meghan pictured meeting youngsters on a recent trip to Morocco will do away with blue and pink colour schemes and would not wish them to be surrounded with conventional toys            Keeping quiet: Kensington Palace have refused to comment on plans to bring up the baby gender fluid The couple are understood to have chosen neutral grey and white hues for the nursery, rather than the blue or pink.Meghan has transformed her husband in many ways: Harry has given up alcohol in solidarity with his pregnant wife, quit smoking and recently revealed he starts the day by meditating. But the Duke is still very much a traditionalist at heart. He has continued his passion for hunting and shooting despite Meghan\u0027s love for animals.And as a young boy, he was always running around Highgrove in military fatigues, climbing trees and playing toy soldiers with Prince William.Meghan has also revealed she played with dolls as a child.A spokesman for Kensington Palace last night said: \u0027The Duke and Duchess are extremely excited to welcome their first child in the spring.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/03/04/00/03556CF0000003E8-6767331-image-a-22_1551660358360.jpg","title":"New calls Philip Green lose knighthood","story":"      Sir Philip Green with his wife Tina (left) and daughter Chloe (right) in Cannes in 2017.

The State Department announcement on Sunday gave the official date for the move.The decision has angered the Palestinian leadership and added to the outrage caused in the Arab world when the U.S. Embassy was moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in May last year.President Donald Trump caused outraged and stoked international criticism by recognizing Jerusalem as Israel\u0027s capital in December 2017.The announcement was met by mass protests across in Gaza with dozens of protesters killed.The announcement from the State Department came early on Monday in Jerusalem, the merger effective that day.

The remains of one of the largest plantations in the South of America  horrified British actress Fanny Kemble leading her to publishing an anti-slavery journal that is said to have helped inspire the abolitionist movement in the United States           Upon entering through the dilapidated exterior, you\u0027re met with a surprisingly well-maintained entrance hall with natural light\u0027The area provided the perfect conditions for growing rice. In 1838, the major\u0027s grandson, Captain Pierce Butler, married famous and beautiful British stage actress Fanny Kemble.\u0027Kemble, who was not familiar with the reality of slavery, immediately became very opposed to the treatment of slaves. She eventually published a book called \u0027Journal of a Resident on a Georgia Plantation,\u0027 which some say helped persuade the British to oppose slavery and the Civil War.\u0027Fanny Kemble was a notable British actress from a theatre family in the early and mid-19th century.          Frances Anne \u0027Fanny\u0027 Kemble (1809-1893) visited the house and was appalled by the slavery, going on to write about it           A reception area or dining room inside the vast property that overlooks the plantation and dark history of the United States          Although steeped in controversial historic elements the property has some beautiful features like this period windowIn 1834, she married an American, Pierce Mease Butler, grandson of Pierce Butler, whom she had met on an American acting tour with her father in 1832. After living in Philadelphia for a time, Butler became heir to the cotton, tobacco and rice plantations of his grandfather on Butler Island, just south of Darien, Georgia, and to the hundreds of slaves who worked them.He made trips to the plantations during the early years of their marriage, but never took Kemble or their children with him. At Kemble\u0027s insistence, they finally spent the winter of 1838-39 there and Kemble kept a diary of her observations, flavoured strongly by the abolitionist sentiment.          The house boasts a splendid living area with a marble fireplace and two sets of grand double doors leading to well-lit hallways          Porch with electrical fan overlooking the grounds that have played host to hundreds of slaves as well as a lettuce plantationHer memoir circulated in American abolitionist circles, but she waited until 1863, during the American Civil War, to publish her anti-slavery Journal of a Residence on a Georgian Plantation in 1838-1839. It has become her best-known work in the United States, she published several other volumes of journals.Huston House was also home to a former owner of the New York Yankees, TL Huston.\u0027Colonel Tillinghast L\u0027Hommedieu (T.L.)

He bought the plantation and built the house in 1926\u0027His father, an Irish-immigrant, was a civil engineer and his mother was a Kentucky school teacher. His early years were spent in Cincinnati before he became a civil engineer alongside his father on the Louisville and Nashville rails. \u0027He served as a Captain (where he got his nickname) of Engineers in Cuba during the Spanish-American War. Later, Huston was a member of the Sixteenth Engineers during World War I, where he rebuilt roads and railways near the front lines throughout France. He first came to wealth when he remained in Cuba after its independence to rebuild infrastructure and improve their sewer system.\u0027In 1913, Colonel T.L. Huston partnered with fellow Colonel, Jacob Ruppert Jr., and purchased the American League Baseball Club of New York. Two years later, they bought a lowly Yankees team from Frank Farrell and William Devery, who were responsible for bringing the franchise to New York City.          Another period window arch overlooking the grounds bought by Huston in 1926, he built the house the following year           Huston converted the former rice plantation into a dairy farm and attempted to raise cows, pictured is the cow shed he built\u0027Under Ruppert and Huston\u0027s ownership, the New York Yankees won two pennants, quickly becoming one of America\u0027s favourite baseball teams. Huston was instrumental in signing and retaining Babe Ruth, at the time considered \u0027The Deal of the Century.\u0027 He also supervised most of the $2 million construction of the original Yankee Stadium. When the stadium was completed in 1923, Huston dubbed it \u0027The House that Ruth Built.\u0027\u0027T.L. Huston retired in 1922 and sold his share of the Yankees to his partner Ruppert for $1.5 million. He purchased the Butler Island Plantation in 1926 and constructed the house the following year. Huston converted the former rice plantation into a dairy farm and attempted to raise cows. Locals proclaimed Huston\u0027s Dairy produced the best milk east of the Mississippi.\u0027However, the dairy farm proved to be a difficult endeavour. Huston hauled off the cows in 1932 and found success using the plantation to grow iceberg lettuce. Butler Island became one of the largest iceberg lettuce farms on the east coast within a decade. On March 29, 1938, Col. Huston suffered a heart attack and died instantly while at his desk.          In 1913, Colonel T.L. Huston partnered with fellow Colonel, Jacob Ruppert Jr., and purchased the American League Baseball Club of New York, later known as the New York Yankees \u0027After his death, Butler Island Plantation was purchased by tobacco heir R.J. Reynolds, Jr. All operations on the grounds ceased by the 1970s. Today, the Butler Island Plantation is owned by the Department of Natural Resources Wildlife Division.\u0027Butler Island Plantation is open to the public for picnicking, fishing and bird watching. The Huston House is currently vacant and not open to the public. It was last used as offices for the Georgia Nature Conservancy.There are no long-term plans for use or maintenance of the home.

He has 28 days to appeal and cannot reapply to teach for at least three years. He was cleared of allegations that he pushed a schoolgirl against a wall and pulled her leggings and underwear down. Steiner schools, which are favoured by liberally-minded middle-class parents, base their curriculum on the spiritual philosophy of Rudolf Steiner. "},{"url":null,"title":"Banking leak reveals Russian network funnelled 150 000 Prince Charles charity","story":"    Prince Charles (right) is pictured talking with Ruben Vardanyan (left), who was the 99th richest man in Russia two years ago, and who used to be the boss of investment bank Troika Dialog, some of whose managers pumped money into the West over an eight-year period This would make it impossible to identify the original source and the money would have been passed through other companies into the banking system.One benefactor of the cash was the Prince of Wales\u0027s Scottish stately home Dumfries House, which was saved from slipping into private hands by the Royal\u0027s charity.  Other funds paid for fees at English private schools, football tickets, holidays, luxury properties and private jets.           Dumfries House (pictured) was saved from slipping into private hands when Prince Charles stepped in but a leak has shown how a Russian banking network then funelled £150,000 to the Royal\u0027s charity But anti-corruption activist Bill Browder said it wouldn\u0027t have been available in the West if it weren\u0027t for \u0027the pipe through which the proceeds of kleptocracy flow from Russia\u0027.Emails show how managers at leading Russian investment bank Troika Dialog kept money pumping into the west for more than eight years.The activity started in 2004 when Armenian financier Ruben Vardanyan, who has close ties to the Windsors and Putin, who ran the bank.

Ruben Vardanyan (pictured with Vladimir Putin) has close ties with the Windsors and transferred £150,000 to the Prince\u0027s Charities Foundation, which is run by Prince Charles Vardanyan denies he\u0027s done business with the cellist \u0027personally\u0027 and said he does not know why he allegedly received the money.Three transfers from Vardanyan totalling $200,000 (£151,809) went to the Prince’s Charities Foundation.The money arrived in Prince Charles foundation via a British Virgin Islands shell company called Quantus Division Ltd in 2009, 2010 and 2011. Vardanyan says the donations were made to \u0027preserve architectural heritage in England\u0027.The donations came after Dumfries House looked like it was going to be auctioned off to private bidders.It is understood Vardanyan has not been involved in the operations personally and does not oversee transactions. But he did not deny benefiting from funds himself after the figures showed Quantus appear to have sent $500,000 to pay his credit card bills.Vardanyan sold Troika in 2012 to Russia\u0027s state-controlled Sberbank, reportedly for $1billion. He remains the controlling shareholder in Armenia’s Ameriabank.The leak shows that cash enters Quantus from legitimate origins and then funds the spending of dozens of benefactors. Some of the funds have been linked to major frauds, including a scandal in which lawyer Sergei Magnitsky died in a Moscow prison after uncovering fraudulent tax refunds committed by the city\u0027s tax office. Firms accused by prosecutors of a fuel price fixing scam at a state-owned airport in Russia are beleived to have paid $37m into the Troika.Lithuanian bank Ukio - which was shut down in 2013 due to insolvency - is being investigated by prosecutors tasked with probing the Troika scheme. Documents revealed that money moved in and out of the bank through deals made with tax haven-registered entities with no offices or staff.Airship Universal Inc – which was also managed by Troika – sent £126,000 to Chelsea football club to pay for a corporate executive box in August 2012.

File photograph: ReutersFurious passengers at Dublin Airport have berated Ryanair for delays of up to nine hours to flights following Sunday’s snowfall. Many passengers were forced to sleep in Terminal 1 overnight after the airline cancelled 17 flights. Dublin Airport said the flight cancellations were as a result of de-icing which is the responsibility of the airlines. When asked as to the breakdown of flight cancellations on Sunday, he said 23 flights were affected. The others were five Aer Lingus flights and one from British Airways. In a statement, the airport added: “Dublin Airport’s runways, taxiways and parking stands were clear of snow and ice throughout yesterday. “Unfortunately some airlines had an issue with de-icing their aircraft that the resulted in delays to some departures and also had a knock-on impact on the availability of aircraft parking stands for incoming aircraft. “We regret the impact that airline de-icing issues had on passengers’ travels plans.” One Ryanair passenger, Michael Skelly, who was on his way to Edinburgh tweeted that the pilot had informed passengers there was only one wing de-icer for the whole airport on Sunday. Ryanair responded to the chaos by stating: “Weather has regrettably caused a small number of Dublin cancellations . . . All those affected were advised of their rebookrefund options.” Many passengers who were stranded at Dublin Airport responded with incredulity to the Tweet. Allen Mongey tweeted photographs of long queues of passengers: “A small number maybe but you left over a thousand stranded and decided to close the desk in the airport at 1.30am.

Photograph: Conor PopeThe Department of Health’s offices on Baggot Street in Dublin city centre have reopened after being evacuated earlier on Monday. Sources said the building was cleared out after a suspicious package containing white powder was sent to Minister for Health Simon Harris. The contents were later deemed by the Army to be “non-hazardous” and have been handed over to gardaí for further examination. The envelope was sent to the Miesien Plaza Building on Baggot Street Lower, the old Bank of Ireland HQ which houses the Department of Health and the Department of Children. The Department of Finance also has staff in the building.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar condemned those responsible for the incident. “I’m not sure what kind of oddballs send suspicious packages in the post but they should be well aware that it is not politicians opening the mail, it’s people doing a normal job, a receptionist or a security guard or clerical officer or someone in the constituency team,” he said “If you want to come after us, come after us, but don’t come after our staff or our families.”Mr Harris was said to be working in his office in the department at the time, and the entire building was evacuated as a precaution. Mr Harris then left the area for an engagment in Fingal. Gardaí, the Army bomb disposal unit and the hazardous materials support unit from Dublin Fire Brigade were at the scene. Also at the scene were six units of the Dublin Fire Brigade and ambulance as well as four support vehicles.Protective gearAt least two members of the hazardous materials unit entered the building in full protective gear while sections of the building close to the steps at the entrance were cordoned off by firefighters.Shortly afterwards, the fire fighters in the biohazard gear came out of the building and were sprayed with disinfectant on the front steps as firefighters began moving the public further away from the scene. An entire block of Baggot Street stretching from the canal towards St Stephen’s Green was closed off.In a statement, the Army said it received a request from gardaí to investigate a “suspect substance” at the premises, arriving at 12.20pm. “Should members of the public encounter suspicious items, or potentially hazardous substances, they are advised to maintain a safe distance and inform An Garda Síochána.”Gardaí told people working in adjacent buildings to either go home if they were outside the workplace already or to stay indoors if they are still there.No accessPeople attempting to get to work or to homes within the cordon were told by the Garda that there is no access.“The incident on Baggot Street is of a HazMat nature. All resources are in place to resolve the incident. There is no danger to the public. Baggot Street Lower is still closed, and we ask the public to respect the emergency cordons,” Dublin Fire Brigade said. One civil servant working in the department told The  that “at around 11.15am the alarm went off and we were told to evacuate the building”.“We just assumed it was a drill so we all filed out. Then we were told that a dodgy package had been sent to the Minister and they said not to come back to the office until 2pm,” he said. Shortly before 2.20pm the emergency services started to leave the scene and the tape condoning off the area around the building on Baggot Street was removed. The Army said its members had departed by 2.30pm.

Photograph: Facundo ArrizabalagaPoolEPABritain’s attorney general Geoffrey Cox and Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay return to Brussels on Tuesday amid deepening pessimism at Westminster about the prospects of a crucial Brexit vote next week.Mr Cox sought on Monday to play down a report that he is no longer seeking a time limit or a unilateral exit mechanism for the Northern Ireland backstop.The attorney general described the Daily  report as “misunderstood fag ends dressed up as facts” but stopped short of denying it.\u0026nbsp“Some of it is accurate, much more of it isn’t and what is not is far more significant than what is. Complex and detailed negotiations cannot be conducted in public,” he said.Downing Street also declined to give details of the negotiations but said the attorney general “continues to pursue legally binding changes to the backstop” to ensure it cannot be indefinite.The EU has ruled out a time limit, a unilateral exit mechanism or any change to the text of what the withdrawal agreement says about the backstop – the guarantee there will be no hard border in Ireland after Brexit.Negotiations have focused instead on review clauses and an arbitration mechanism to determine when the conditions have been met for the backstop to end.The prime minister is hoping Mr Cox will secure enough from the EU to allow him to change his legal advice that Britain could be kept in the backstop indefinitely.Panel of lawyersThe European Research Group (ERG) of Conservative Brexiteers has established a panel of eight lawyers, including DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds, to evaluate any new text Mr Cox negotiates.Mr Dodds made clear this week that further assurances about the temporary nature of the backstop will not be enough to win his support for the Brexit deal.“We know the current backstop arrangements are meant to be temporary and all the assurances in the world from the EU that they will negotiate in good faith etc – it doesn’t change that. What we need to have is legally binding change, not assurances about what we know already,” he told the BBC.Mr Dodds said he was less concerned about the legal form of any change than that it should have legal effect and “changes the current meaning” of the withdrawal agreement and makes it clear that it cannot be indefinite.Long extensionMartin Howe, another of the lawyers on the Brexiteer panel, said on Monday that a long extension of the article 50 negotiating period would be preferable to a short extension or approving Mrs May’s deal.Writing for the Conservative Home website, Mr Howe said a three-month extension would make no practical difference but a 21-month extension would mean that the UK would continue to have a say in EU institutions rather than simply accepting EU rules during a transition period and avoid triggering the backstop.“The article 50 extension would give us more time to do what May’s government should have been doing all along during the 2½ years since the referendum. That is to prepare overtly, steadily and determinedly for a no-deal exit as a twin-track alongside negotiating with the EU.“This would strengthen our negotiating position, and with May’s deal in the bin we could actually press for a deal which genuinely protects our ability to forge an independent trade policy and also deals with the Northern Ireland Border issue by alternative means,” he wrote.Meanwhile, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar insisted that Ireland has been “very flexible and reasonable” in helping the UK to deal with problems “largely of their own creation” in the Brexit process.He said he was “happy to offer further clarifications and assurances” to help the EU and UK negotiators get a deal done, with the planned departure date of March 29th looming.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

refuses remove saudi government app men track women","story":"The app - named Absher - has been downloaded more than a million times in Saudi ArabiaGoogle is refusing to remove a Saudi government app that allows men to track and control women.The app, which gives men the power to grant and rescind travel permission for women and to set up SMS alerts for when they use their passports, will remain available to buy.Google said it had reviewed the app — called Absher — and concluded that it did not violate any agreements, and could therefore remain on its Google Play store.The app, which is owned and operated by the kingdom’s interior ministry, also has features that send alerts if a woman leaves a certain area - making it difficult for women to leave without the say so of a “male ”.Women in the ultra-conservative kingdom must by law have male s, whether it be a husband, father, brother or uncle, who gives permission for them to do everything including studying, marrying, renting a house, and travelling.Google and Apple’s decision to host the app, which has been downloaded more than one million times, has drawn complaints, including from Human Rights Watch which said the tech companies were “facilitating human rights abuses”.Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun, an 18-year-old Saudi woman took back her passport and fled her family More than a dozen members of US Congress wrote to Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Apple CEO Tim Cook on February 21, demanding that the app be removed.They described Google, as well as Apple, as accomplices in the oppression of Saudi Arabian women for hosting the app.They gave a deadline of Thursday 28 February to explain why the app is hosted on Google Play.Ilhan Omar, Democrat Rep, one of the signatories, tweeted: “Women are not your property! Women are not your property! Women are not your property! So why are @Apple and @Google hosting an app that allows men to track and control women’s movement in Saudi Arabia? This insanity needs to end!”The subject of Saudi women’s right to travel was highlighted last month after an 18-year-old Saudi woman fled her family over alleged abuse.Rahaf Mohammed Alqunun said she took her passport while on holiday in Kuwait and travelled to Thailand hoping to claim asylum.Please review our commenting policyDrivers film huge avalanche engulfing highway in Colorado Police

He was also alleged to have “gone in and out of the girls’ tents” on a camping trip.He would pick pupils up by the waist, sit them on his lap and put his arms around them while they played with his hair, a professional misconduct panel in Coventry heard.One mother saw Mr McCarthy touching her daughter\u0027s neck and “drawing letters” on her back as she sat on his lap “in a manner that seemed sensual”.Sue Peat, a trustee at the school from 2006 to 2016, said teachers felt “threatened” and “intimidated” by Mr McCarthy and were scared to raise the alarm. Martin Pilkington, the panel chair, said: “It is not for a teacher to act as a surrogate parent and conduct that leads to such a relationship to develop is inappropriate and crosses the professional boundaries.“It is essential that teachers maintain professional and unambiguous boundaries between themselves and pupils at all times.”He said the panel was satisfied that Mr McCarthy’s conduct amounted to misconduct of a serious nature” which fell significantly short of the standards expected of the profession. Parents alleged the school tried to cover up its failings by intimidating those who voiced unease about some of its activities. When they raised concerns about the behaviour of Mr McCarthy, they were sent threatening legal letters.In one letter from solicitors in 2014, they were told to sign a series of conditions and warned that failure to do so would result in their child being removed from the school.Mr McCarthy was sacked for gross misconduct in 2017 and the school has since been ordered to close. He has 28 days to appeal and cannot reapply to teach for at least three years.Drivers film huge avalanche engulfing highway in Colorado Police officers call for emergency stop and search powers to stem knife crime epidemicComment: Why, ten years after my brother\u0026#39s death, the knife crisis still hasn\u0026#39t been dealt withBanks must keep paper billing for 5 million people who don\u0026#39t use the internet, ONS saysEmmanuel Macron calls for \u0026#39minimum European wage\u0026#39 as he says Brexit presents a \u0026#39danger\u0026#39 to EUVolvo to limit speed of all vehicles to 112mph in bid to reduce road deathsDaughter of Jeremy Corbyn’s ally moved to Labour complaints unit, despite attacking Rachel RileyComment: What would Chris Grayling have to do for Theresa May to sack him?Grieving mother forgives \u0026#39school bullies\u0026#39 who tormented her sensitive daughterComment: No energy drinks till you\u0026#39re 18, no smoking before 21: our nanny state won\u0026#39t let youngsters act like grown upsComment: We can end this terrible epidemic of knife killings, but not with so few police officersFormer Royal Marine reaches agreement with MoD after suing for hearing lossGermany\u0026#39s controversial immigration measures have only prevented 11 people from entering the countryPrince William opens new Foreign Office facility named after pioneering female diplomat who gave up career for marriageBritish Isil fighters surrender to US-backed forces amid Baghuz offensiveChina accuses two detained Canadian men of spyingBritain to return two locks of hair taken from corpse of 19th century Ethiopian emperorVirgin Airlines tells air hostesses they don\u0026#39t need to wear make upWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/03/04/TELEMMGLPICT000190293625_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqZHrTyqqLjLkPKjc3TsrXSSooe0IxaCyVBdsVei4rh_Q.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"two sisters aged 5 8 miraculously found 44 hours californian","story":"Leia Carrico, left, and her sister Caroline CarricoArmed with some outdoor survival training, granola bars and pink rubber boots, five- and eight-year-old sisters survived 44 hours in rugged Northern California wilderness before they were found dehydrated and cold but in good spirits on Sunday, authorities said.A fire chief and firefighter from a local volunteer department found Leia and Caroline Carrico in a wooded area about 1½ miles (2.3 kilometres) from their home in the small community of Benbow, where they had last been seen Friday afternoon, Humboldt County Sheriff William Honsal said.Benbow is about 200 miles (320 kilometers) northwest of Sacramento.The girls were safe and sound and uninjured, thanks in part to survival training they got with their local 4-H club, Mr Honsal said.This is an absolute miracle, he said.

How they were out there for 44 hours is pretty amazing.The sisters were last seen on Friday outside their home in CaliforniaA photo of one of the girls posted by the sheriff\u0027s office and already being widely shared on social media shows her wearing pink rubber boots, dirty jeans, a long pink shirt and a woolen cap. She is standing while a firefighter kneels down and talks to her.One person commented that she looks like a seasoned outdoor gal while another said, those little adventurers will sure have a story to tell!Mr Honsal said the girls were given fresh warm clothes, water and food and were being assessed but were in good spirits and doing well.A lot of us didn\u0027t get any sleep the last 48 hours or so, Mr Honsal said. To have a positive outcome like this is just absolutely amazing ... These girls definitely have a survival story to tell.He said the firefighters who found the girls had followed their boot prints. The firefighters were part of a massive search of a vast and rugged rural area that included a dozen agencies, including the National Guard, helicopters and tracking dogs.Rescuers were hopeful about finding the girls Saturday after they came across prints from their boots and wrappers from granola bars, Lt. Mike Fridley said.The wrappers showed us a direction from where they started to where the wrappers ended up at, Mr Fridley said.Mr Fridley said he was the one who got to call the girls\u0027 mother and tell them her daughters were alive.She melted on the phone, he said.Please review our commenting policyTories praise Tony Benn\u0026#39s financial planning as donation of his archive knocks £210,000 off family\u0026#39s tax billTwitter, Google and Facebook agree to rapid \u0026#39takedown\u0026#39 system to remove posts which threaten to collapse trialsComment: If the Conservatives aren’t careful, their next leader could be their lastTheresa May warned she must whip MPs to stop them taking no-deal Brexit off the tableDisabled pensioners will not longer have to undergo repeat benefit assessments, Amber Rudd to sayDrivers film huge avalanche engulfing highway in Colorado Police officers call for emergency stop and search powers to stem knife crime epidemicSteiner school teacher who said he was being \u0026#39grandfatherly\u0026#39 when he allowed children to sit in his lap is struck offComment: Why, ten years after my brother\u0026#39s death, the knife crisis still hasn\u0026#39t been dealt withBanks must keep paper billing for 5 million people who don\u0026#39t use the internet, ONS saysEmmanuel Macron calls for \u0026#39minimum European wage\u0026#39 as he says Brexit presents a \u0026#39danger\u0026#39 to EUVolvo to limit speed of all vehicles to 112mph in bid to reduce road deathsDaughter of Jeremy Corbyn’s ally moved to Labour complaints unit, despite attacking Rachel RileyComment: What would Chris Grayling have to do for Theresa May to sack him?Grieving mother forgives \u0026#39school bullies\u0026#39 who tormented her sensitive daughterComment: No energy drinks till you\u0026#39re 18, no smoking before 21: our nanny state won\u0026#39t let youngsters act like grown upsComment: We can end this terrible epidemic of knife killings, but not with so few police officersFormer Royal Marine reaches agreement with MoD after suing for hearing lossGermany\u0026#39s controversial immigration measures have only prevented 11 people from entering the countryPrince William opens new Foreign Office facility named after pioneering female diplomat who gave up career for marriageBritish Isil fighters surrender to US-backed forces amid Baghuz offensiveWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/beauty/2019/03/04/TELEMMGLPICT000006518209_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqNJjoeBT78QIaYdkJdEY4CnGTJFJS74MYhNY6w3GNbO8.jpeg?imwidth=4","title":"virgin airlines tells air hostesses dont need wear make","story":"THEY should weigh no more than eight stone, be younger than 26, and display the bloom that goes with perfect health, said a New York Times article in 1936.But times have changed and now air hostesses are being freed from rigid beauty standards, as high heels, compulsory skirts, and now make up are no longer part of their compulsory dress codes. In just the latest sign that the traditional trolley dolly is dead, Virgin Atlantic has become the first premier airline to tell female cabin crew that they will no longer have to wear makeup in the air.  It will also provide female crew with trousers as part of their standard uniform to wear instead of a skirt. Until now trousers have only been available if female staff specially request them.The move will by seen by many as going some way towards addressing a gaping gender equality problem within the aviation industry, which s everything from uniform to pay and workers\u0027 rights. Sir Richard Branson waves farewell prior to his flight to Kuala Lumpur at Perth International AirportJust last week this newspaper revealed that British Airways “gagged” a group of female pilots to stop them telling MPs about poor maternity policies at work.It comes five years after the airline’s uniform policy made the news after Virgin boss Richard Branson dressed in cabin crew uniform – complete with red lipstick – after losing a bet.It follows British Airways\u0027 decision back in 2016 to allow female flight attendants to wear trousers.  However airlines generally require flight attendants to have a “groomed look that meets conventional standard”, and BA is no exception.BA\u0027s latest staff handbook states: “For women, you will need to have a styled look with hair and makeup that would be appropriate in a professional environment and complements our uniform.Air hostesses in training are taught in a mock-up of an aircraft cabin at London Airport in 1958For men, your hair must meet a conventional style which is appropriate for a professional environment, shaven or sculptured styles and long hair are not permitted. Dyed hair must be of a natural colour for both men and women.”Some airlines are reported to have gone even further by having specific guidelines for tiny details of the physical appearance of their cabin crew. For example American Airlines is said to advise that: Noticeable hair in nostrils and inon ears or underarms must be cut or otherwise removed”.  Meanwhile Hawaiian Airlines is reported to advise that: “Hands and nails should be kept well groomed at all times, with nail length not exceeding an eighth of an inch beyond the finger tip. A spokesman at Virgin said: Our world-famous red uniform is something all of us at Virgin Atlantic are incredibly proud of. We want our uniform to truly reflect who we are as iniduals while maintaining that famous Virgin Atlantic style.Not only do the new guidelines offer an increased level of comfort, they also provide our team with more choice on they want to express themselves at work.Drivers film huge avalanche engulfing highway in Colorado Police officers call for emergency stop and search powers to stem knife crime epidemicSteiner school teacher who said he was being \u0026#39grandfatherly\u0026#39 when he allowed children to sit in his lap is struck offComment: Why, ten years after my brother\u0026#39s death, the knife crisis still hasn\u0026#39t been dealt withBanks must keep paper billing for 5 million people who don\u0026#39t use the internet, ONS saysEmmanuel Macron calls for \u0026#39minimum European wage\u0026#39 as he says Brexit presents a \u0026#39danger\u0026#39 to EUVolvo to limit speed of all vehicles to 112mph in bid to reduce road deathsDaughter of Jeremy Corbyn’s ally moved to Labour complaints unit, despite attacking Rachel RileyComment: What would Chris Grayling have to do for Theresa May to sack him?Grieving mother forgives \u0026#39school bullies\u0026#39 who tormented her sensitive daughterComment: No energy drinks till you\u0026#39re 18, no smoking before 21: our nanny state won\u0026#39t let youngsters act like grown upsComment: We can end this terrible epidemic of knife killings, but not with so few police officersFormer Royal Marine reaches agreement with MoD after suing for hearing lossGermany\u0026#39s controversial immigration measures have only prevented 11 people from entering the countryPrince William opens new Foreign Office facility named after pioneering female diplomat who gave up career for marriageBritish Isil fighters surrender to US-backed forces amid Baghuz offensiveChina accuses two detained Canadian men of spyingBritain to return two locks of hair taken from corpse of 19th century Ethiopian emperorWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/03/04/17/apex-legends-players-fortnite-record.jpg","title":"apex legends players fortnite record","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

In 2008, he joined Lehman Brothers on an industrial placement as part of his degree at the University of Bath. Within three months, global financial markets had spiralled into meltdown leading to the collapse of the fourth largest investment bank in the US, and battering swathes of other financial institutions beyond recognition.Tens of thousands of people lost their jobs and the global economy crumbled. Reflecting on that time, the now 30-year-old understands that he was much more fortunate than some of his older colleagues. As a bright-eyed graduate he was swiftly snapped up by one of the global investment banks that had emerged from the crash bruised but still breathing. He stayed with that organisation until 2012, when he took five months off to go travelling.“I was completely uninspired,” Rocha-Thomas, who now lives in Cambridge, says of his former employer. “The IT team I was part of was so far removed from any kind of purpose,” he adds. So when he got back to the UK, he decided to join The App Business, a start-up which helps large companies build mobile apps. At the time the company\u0026nbsphad 20 employees. In the seven years that Rocha-Thomas has been there, the workforce has ballooned to almost 200 and he feel like he\u0027s been instrumental in driving that expansion. He says it\u0027s been incredibly rewarding and has given him an immense sense of purpose.Rocha-Thomas\u0027 story is becoming increasingly common. Although graduate schemes at banks, consultancies and accounting firms for years represented a well-trodden path for many bright youngsters leaving top universities, signs have emerged that even some of the most prestigious employers are starting to lose their shine.How Lehman Brothers caused \u0027the worst financial crisis in history\u0027According to a study published last year by High Flyers, a market research company which specialises in student and graduate recruitment, employers in eight out of 13\u0026nbspkey industries and employment areas hired fewer graduates in 2017 than the year before, with the biggest drops in recruitment at the top accounting and professional services firms, and banking and financial companies.Just 9.6 per cent of all graduates surveyed applied for roles in investment banking, which represented the lowest proportion since 2009 when banks halted graduate recruitment in the wake of the global financial crisis. And over the past year, that trend is expected to have continued.\u0026nbspWhile some of the move is likely to have been driven by companies cutting their recruitment budget in the face of Brexit uncertainty and other economic pressures, experts say that increased competition from booming tech companies and entrepreneurial start-ups is also to blame.Created with Sketch.

Juergen Ziegler, chief executive for Europe, said that while Brexit was not the only factor, it has brought forward the decision to relocateSeveral studies have highlighted that young people are no longer as motivated by money as they used to be, and are increasingly prioritising a sense of purpose over pay. Start-ups are tapping into this sentiment by offering professional newbies the opportunity to have an impact from the get go – something that would ordinarily be unthinkable in a large multinational.Gian Power worked at Deutsche Bank and PwC after graduating from Aston Business School in 2014. He quit big corporate life in 2017 to set up his own company called The Lion\u0027s Club, which brings together motivational speakers on subjects around well-being, work-life-balance, and overcoming challenges to reach your full personal and professional potential.Gian PowerYouTube)“When working at PwC, my hours were long and I spent most weekends studying. It was a sacrifice I chose to make but it was hard to find time to explore my own interests and purpose,” he says. “I wanted to be my own boss, I wanted to craft a life that makes me happy and allows me to do things that bring me happiness.”Edwin Lee\u0027s experience echoes this. He interned at RBC Capital Markets before joining JP Morgan full time in 2006 in New York, and rising to the position of managing director. At the end of 2017 he resigned and joined a friend who was setting up his own company,\u0026nbspCastle Ridge Asset Management,\u0026nbspthat uses investment strategies informed by artificial intelligence.He tells The Independent that, particularly during his final few years at the Wall Street stalwart, work-life balance became “a serious issue”.“I ran the corporate trading desk which meant I was at work before the markets opened and didn\u0027t leave until the bankers were done,” he says. Lee often worked more than 15 hours a day and if calls weren\u0027t taking over his weekends and evenings then travel to London, Hong Kong and Tokyo often was. His wife had just given birth to their daughter and he felt like he was not seeing her grow up. “It had to change”.Of his current job he says that it was a “once in a lifetime opportunity” and that the autonomy was a considerable incentive. “It would be our team and our firm to build exactly as we like.”Already back in 2014, McGraw-Hill Education commissioned a survey of hundreds of US graduates which found that 73 per cent prioritised finding a job that they enjoy over one that pays well. And almost half of respondents said that they would favour a career that is beneficial to society.iStock)Lovell Corporation, a Canadian marketing company that focuses on connecting businesses with young professionals, published a research report in 2017 based on a survey of 2,000 young people, that found Generation Z – or those born between the mid-1990s and early 2000s – to be a generation of “change-makers”. These are the young people currently entering the workforce.The top career choice for that demographic in the survey was entrepreneur, with a large proportion also citing the not-for-profit sector as their top pick.“These statistics demonstrate the inclination of younger workers to seek meaningful work that fulfils their personal goals and creates impact,” the study concluded.Gian Power on meditation and motivation in the face of family tragedyOther studies have shown that the generation of people entering today\u0027s workforce is also more sensitive to issues around ersity and inclusion, and that those people are increasingly looking for a company that reflects those qualities.\u0026nbspScores of banks, professional service firms and consultancies are still marred by a reputation of being dominated by white men, and progress towards a more erse workforce is proving sluggish. Gender pay gaps are stubborn and that\u0027s spoiling the appetite of not just young women.Speaking recently at Goldman Sachs Asset Management\u0027s annual Future Leaders Conference, Ruwan Weerasekera, the chief operating officer at Softbank Investment Advisers, the manager of the massive Saudi-Japanese backed technology fund, said that almost everyone working at his company was previously at Deutsche Bank, UBS or Goldman Sachs.Softbank attracts talent, he said, by being erse, forward looking and representing an “intersection between finance and technology”. Many of the firms his company invests in are focused on social responsibility, which he says is also a big driver for a heterogeneous pool of potential hires, and is likely one of the reasons why his current employer is the only place he has worked where “white men are in the minority”.\u0026nbspDoing well by doing goodSo what are large institutions, like investment banks, doing to combat the start-up-driven brain drain? Kathleen Hughes, a partner at Goldman Sachs, tells The Independent that her firm has recognised and acknowledged the need for change to address the priorities of the next generation.“Around 60 per cent of Goldman Sachs\u0027 workforce is millennial and they have very particular values. As they start their career, they will value things like giving back and making an impact,” she says, adding that this is something Goldman has started tapping into.When Crystelle\u0026nbspPereira\u0026nbspfirst joined Goldman Sachs she felt like she was competing in \u0027both a marathon and a sprint\u0027In recent years, Goldman launched what it calls the Analyst Impact Fund which provides an annual opportunity for the most junior workers to pitch their cases to invest in non-profit organisations they deem to be most worthy. A sizeable grant from the firm is then allocated to the winning organisation. “Giving back is important,” says Hughes, “and that\u0027s what we\u0027re addressing.”Acknowledging issues around work-life-balance and presenteeism is also high up on Hughes\u0027 list of priorities. She says that technology has represented a sea-change for the better in that flexible working is now an integral part of company culture.And the initiatives seem to be resonating where it matters. Arianna Roccio, a recent graduate who has been at Goldman Sachs for three years, says that flexibility has evolved dramatically even in the short time that she has been at the company. “It\u0027s not really about face time in the way you might think,” she says.Crystelle Pereira, another recent graduate who works at Goldman, says that when she first joined she felt like she was competing in “both a marathon and a sprint”. Since then, however, the dialogue between graduates and their managers has improved, “especially around the importance of balance and downtime”.Other banks have also implemented measures to sweeten career prospects for potential employees and tune into the zeitgeist.\u0026nbspChuck Teixeira, chief administrative officer and head of transformation at HSBC\u0027s global banking and markets ision, tells The Independent that his company has had to “completely change our approach”.Forget Brexit. We might be approaching another global recessionCould a no-deal Brexit hit the economy sooner than we think?Political tensions in Europe could lead to a serious economic slowdownHe says that they\u0027ve recently launched internship and graduate programmes, in which new professionals are introduced to careers in data science and engineering – areas not traditionally associated with banking.“To attract talent to these programmes, we have had to get on campus face-to-face, run meet-ups and hackathons where engineers and data scientists work together to rapidly prototype products,” he explains. “We realise that HSBC is not front-of-mind for these capabilities so we are reaching out to the global market and positioning ourselves differently, including targeting talent in other industries,” he adds.\u0026nbspiStock)Will Rocha-Thomas, who these days serves on his company\u0027s team that is responsible for hiring and retaining talent, is also encouraged by the progress. But he says that large firms still have their work cut out for them, and it\u0027s not always straightforward for the entrepreneurial start-ups either.Finally, he says that another simple thing that many large and small firms are still getting wrong, is that they are not taking action in response to feedback.\u0026nbsp“This sounds obvious but it’s a struggle for many big, centralised companies where making a simple change is a huge endeavour,” he says. “When people feel unhappy about something, and feel like there’s nothing they can do to change it – even if they give honest feedback – they generally quit,” he adds.Former JP Morgan managing director Edwin Lee agrees. While he admits that there are a lot of things\u0026nbsplarge institutions are able to do to improve the satisfaction and work-life balance of staff, the shift has to first occur in the fundamental, cultural DNA of the firm. Only then can practical changes be implemented. And that\u0027s where he sees the hurdle.He says that measures like paid leave, flexible working arrangements, sabbaticals or even mobility opportunities – that are frequently a given at start-ups and newer tech companies – are still often at odds with managers\u0027 immediate objectives. Those, in turn, often centre around short-term goals and the next earnings report.So perhaps the first step is to simply expand the horizon: teach managers that change happens gradually and that the long-term satisfaction of employees is as critical to the long-term health of the firm as the next quarter\u0027s profit is. Delving into the unknown is always scary, but once you\u0027re in, the opportunities might just surprise you positively.We’ll tell you what’s true.

In response, we are seeing heroic innovations, tantalising technologies and corporate sustainability going mainstream. But too often these approaches are geared towards temporary relief and don\u0027t address the root cause of the problem. We believe the answer lies in embracing systems change.\u0026nbspA system is simply a configuration of parts geared towards an outcome. A system can be as small as a beehive or as large as the NHS. At Forum for the Future, we see that the greatest challenges arise from our global systems being fundamentally broken: a food system that undermines the ecosystems upon which it relies, an economy which maximises short-term growth over long term viability, or an energy system fuelling runaway emissions and climate breakdown. System change means reinventing the rules of the game, creating new ways of organising and building refreshed, resilient systems.What then does this mean in practice? A crucial first step is a proper diagnosis of the problem at hand, something we explore with seven megatrends in our report, ‘The Future of Sustainability: Driving Systems Change in Turbulent Times’.Created with Sketch.

What we see above the surface, at the tip of the iceberg, are the visible events around us – a mother seagull trying to feed plastic to her chick, for example.A little below the surface, these events join up into patterns and trends. Plastic turning up in the stomachs of hundreds of marine species, for example. Deeper still are the systems and structures which allow these patterns to emerge such as cheap plastic, poor recycling infrastructure, a throwaway economy, lack of incentives.\u0026nbspFinally at the iceberg’s base, far below the surface\u0026nbspare our deeply held belief systems, values and mindsets: convenience, disconnection from nature, consumerism and many more. Each level creates the conditions for the layer above to emerge. Recognising the deep drivers of a challenge helps you diagnose where change is needed for long-lasting effect - the deeper, the better.\u0026nbspGetting to the root cause also reveals how global challenges are messy and rarely act in isolation. Climate change, for example, is deeply interwoven with loss of bioersity, which is needed for a high-yield food system and is driven by short-term thinking and demand for convenience. Rising nationalism is intermeshed with increasing digital connection and the spread of misinformation, built on deeply held fears of being left behind, and the need for belonging and for security. \u0026nbspSo, what can we do?\u0026nbspThere are no silver-bullet solutions. Addressing global challenges requires joined-up action from a whole suite of actors – from iniduals to governments to non-profits.In particular, the corporate sector urgently needs to move beyond corporate social responsibility (CSR) towards understanding the power it has\u0026nbspto reconfigure systems that it is\u0026nbsppart of.Citarum River in Bandung, Indonesia. According to reports, Citarum is one of the most polluted rivers in the world, with tons of plastic waste and wastewater (EPA)A great example of this is Sky and its role in raising awareness around ocean plastics. The company\u0026nbspquickly moved beyond standard CSR, recognising the power of its broadcasting reach, giving rise to the documentary ‘A Plastic Ocean’, the Ocean Rescue and Sky Ocean Ventures – true corporate activists.Or another long-term partner of ours, Unilever, who, seeing that frequent financial reporting caused short-term thinking, stopped quarterly reporting. This small structural change is enabling the long-term investment required for more sustainable approaches and demonstrating that shareholders can be persuaded to get behind\u0026nbspideas when they are convinced they\u0026nbspwill generate long-term value.\u0026nbspBoth companies are contributing to a wider process of system change\u0026nbspSky by highlighting the root causes of the plastics problem, Unilever by shifting, however minutely, the rules of the game for business.\u0026nbspOf course, enlightened self-interest comes into play here. These leaders recognise that putting their faith in current, broken systems will ultimately spell the end of their businesses as they run out of resources and their supply chains are fractured by climate change.But they are also helping to create the conditions for the emergence of a new version of capitalism. One that is regenerative – giving back more than it takes from people and planet – and that fully appreciates the fallacy of infinite growth on a finite planet.\u0026nbspIt is only through fixing our broken systems, rather than applying sticking-plaster\u0026nbspsolutions, that we can inch back from the brink of a climate crisis. By looking to the future, re-imagining our systems, understanding how they can be different, we can reinvent the way the world works.This is what will make the difference between climate apocalypse and a bright new future. And it is within our grasp, but only just.Dr Sally Uren OBE is chief executive at Forum for the Future, a leading international non-profit tackling complex global challenges by catalysing change in key systems.

Who refused to back down, however outlandish the lie, and however it was disproven?Trying to extricate ourselves from the EU, and Brexit, is like a multiple transplant patient attempting to give all the donated organs back.Paying my taxes to pay for Brexit is like asking a guy on death row if he has any change to put in the meter for the electric chair.Brexit is like watching Bandersnatch with your bae where bae is 70,000 Conservative party members hogging the PlayStation controller \u0026amp  choosing the most WTF option every time.!Brexit is like the shit that never comes. Total constitutional constipation. Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.And 82 percent generate profit from their business ventures.So perhaps it’s no wonder two thirds of women revealed they are happier doing their side projects than their main job.Furthermore, half wish they had started their venture sooner.Ella d’Amato, chief commercial and marketing officer for notonthehighstreet, said: “Of the six million businesses in Britain, only one fifth are run by women.“So it’s fantastic to see this community taking matters such as flexible working, creative fulfilment and self-confidence into their own hands.”The study also found side hustlers spend on average of four hours a week on their venture outside of their full-time work.UK earnings growth at 10-year high as employment hits record levelsMost have been maintaining their side hustle for an impressive 17 years – while one in five has been going strong for more than three decades.It also emerged a third of women believe they have entrepreneurial spirit – one in seven even spends more than 10 extra hours a week investing time in their side hustle.Skilled crafts, food and drinks, and education came top of the list of side hustles that women are likely to enter – while technology and gaming emerged as male-dominated ones.Art and prints, jewellery making, and personalised goods were among some of the more creative endeavours Brits are pursuing with some even devoting time to including home grown food produce, beer brewing, homemade candle making and book writing.One in five said they set one up to keep busy – while one fifth said they wanted to utilise their other skill sets.However, several barriers were blamed for preventing that from happening, including not having the necessary funds and lacking self-confidence as major roadblocks.\u0026nbspCarried out by OnePoll, the research also found four in 10 women were worried they didn’t have enough money to set up their own business – and a quarter were too fearful of the unknown to start one.Ella d’Amato added: “The increasing number of women in business is a trend we have seen, supported and encouraged since the business was founded as 82 percent of our Partners (sellers) are female with some now running million pound businesses.”*Notonthehighstreet is home to over 5,000 small creative businesses – with many of them beginning as a creative idea or side-project before working closely with the online platform to develop and grow their business.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Lawyers allege that Huawei’s chief financial officer was detained, searched and interrogated for three hours in violation of her constitutional rights.The US lawsuit will filed in the Eastern District of Texas where Huawei has its American headquarters, the New York Times reported, citing two people familiar with the matter.According to one of the people, the lawsuit is likely to challenge a US law passed last year blocking government agencies from using Huawei’s telecoms equipment.The newspaper reported that Huawei will argue that the provision is unconstitutional because it amounts to a “bill of attainder,” or a legislative act that singles out a person or group for punishment without trial.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The SpaceX team in Hawthorne watches as the SpaceX Crew Dragon docks with the International Space Station\u0027s Harmony module.

The company\u0027s equipment could be used for Chinese government spying operations, US officials have said.The company’s executives have strongly rejected the allegations which they say are motivated by political and economic concerns.However, a number of governments including Australia and New Zealand have since banned\u0026nbspHuawei\u0027s equipment from the next generation of mobile networks.In a blow to US efforts, UK security bosses said last month that risks posed by Huawei\u0027s involvement in 5G networks can be contained.Huawei declined to comment on the NYT report.A hearing is set to begin this week in Canada that will determine whether Ms Meng will be extradited to the US to face charges. Ms Meng was arrested in Vancouver in December at the request of the US, which argued she posed a threat to national security. Huawei\u0027s CFO was charged with bank and wire fraud which she allegedly committed to circumvent American sanctions against Iran.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHIt was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHAguilera is set to perform hits from her back catalogue, including “Dirrty”, “Genie In A Bottle” and “Fighter”, as well as favourites from her 2018 studio album, Liberation.Tickets go on sale on March 8 at LiveNation.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It looked to be a straight-forward victory for the Spaniard as he surged into a two-set lead, but Murray is not a three-time Grand Slam champion for nothing and he supremely levelled the match despite hobbling around the court from the get-go.

She added: “It is shocking how much of our own salary is spent on classroom resources.”And one teacher in Lincoln said schools were “dirty” because they could not afford proper cleaning and cuts have meant schools are barely able to afford photocopying.School spending per pupil has fallen by 8 per cent in real terms since 2010 amid increased cost pressures, according to the latest\u0026nbspanalysis from the Institute for\u0026nbspFiscal Studies (IFS).School governors call on government to urgently increase fundingThe online petition, started by headteachers in Gateshead, says: “All schools are working very hard to ‘make ends meet’ but this is becoming increasingly difficult and verging on almost impossible.”It adds parents are being increasingly asked to pay for books and materials due to a squeeze on budgets,\u0026nbspand schools are having to cut teachers, subjects and support for vulnerable pupils – including those with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND).It came as three families who are challenging the government’s funding policy for children with SEND have been told their challenge will be heard in the High Court in June this year.Mary\u0026nbspBousted, joint general secretary of the NEU, called the funding cuts to schools and colleges “entirely unacceptable”, adding that the “real losers” were the children and young people.She added: “Education is one of the most important things a government can provide for its citizens, and currently it is failing miserably in its duty.”In response to the petition, the Department for Education (DfE) said: “We recognise schools are facing budgeting challenges and we are asking them to do more. We have increased funding by an extra £1.3bn across this year and next, over and above previous spending plans.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

It will roll out to everyone as normal – with a change in the settings that will do the same job as the crescent moon –\u0026nbspin the coming weeks.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Lawyers allege that Huawei’s chief financial officer was detained, searched and interrogated for three hours in violation of her constitutional rights.The US lawsuit will filed in the Eastern District of Texas where Huawei has its American headquarters, the New York Times reported, citing two people familiar with the matter.According to one of the people, the lawsuit is likely to challenge a US law passed last year blocking government agencies from using Huawei’s telecoms equipment.The newspaper reported that Huawei will argue that the provision is unconstitutional because it amounts to a “bill of attainder,” or a legislative act that singles out a person or group for punishment without trial.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The SpaceX team in Hawthorne watches as the SpaceX Crew Dragon docks with the International Space Station\u0027s Harmony module.

The company\u0027s equipment could be used for Chinese government spying operations, US officials have said.The company’s executives have strongly rejected the allegations which they say are motivated by political and economic concerns.However, a number of governments including Australia and New Zealand have since banned\u0026nbspHuawei\u0027s equipment from the next generation of mobile networks.In a blow to US efforts, UK security bosses said last month that risks posed by Huawei\u0027s involvement in 5G networks can be contained.Huawei declined to comment on the NYT report.A hearing is set to begin this week in Canada that will determine whether Ms Meng will be extradited to the US to face charges. Ms Meng was arrested in Vancouver in December at the request of the US, which argued she posed a threat to national security. Huawei\u0027s CFO was charged with bank and wire fraud which she allegedly committed to circumvent American sanctions against Iran.We’ll tell you what’s true.

He told me he had once picked up a distressed woman from a nightclub, late at night, and she told him she had just been sexually assaulted by a north African immigrant.After taking a few moments to digest this, I asked the obvious question: “But what’s that got to do with Brexit?” He had barely begun answering before he accidentally drove through a red light, triggering a camera flash. This was going to cost him.\u0026nbspFor an Australian, getting to understand Brexit has been a process of getting to understand the English. I had a slight advantage on some of my compatriots. I was born in England, though my family moved to seek sun, sand and work after the winter of discontent in 1978-79 when I was a child.\u0026nbspI retain enough Englishness (and English relatives) to appreciate the lingering distrust of the continent and its people, the instinctive rejection of the post-war plan for all Europe to join in an ode to joy and brotherhood.

Australia is one of the world’s biggest fans of trade deals. As a self-aware “middle power”, we know that we prosper through alliances. We have few empire romances to fall back on (though we have the Commonwealth\u0026nbspmore of that later). We instinctively seek to draw ourselves closer to our neighbours, friends and trading partners through deals and forums.\u0026nbspFarage (AFPGetty)The sight of a country deliberately throwing away a close, mutually beneficial partnership, wilfully damaging its economy and influence on a point of cultural principle, was a surprise.From the start there was an immediate interest from our readers – reflected in the below-the-article arguments and in article click-throughs. I soon found myself writing seemingly endless updates, analysis pieces and weekend news reads on this technical, political spasm on the other side of the world.In the pre-Trump era Brexit was the international focus for a global trend: the rise of nationalism, the disillusionment with globalism, the fear of “uncontrolled”\u0026nbspmigration.\u0026nbspThese factors have been playing out in Australia too, though with different timing and emphasis.\u0026nbspWe managed to make it through the financial crisis more or less unscathed, so the economic triggers for Brexit were alien to us, or at least less relatable.As tensions rise with China, Brexit seems more dangerous than ever Australian salaries are high and public services pretty robust. But our housing availabilityaffordability bubble is as bad as Britain’s, with similar knock-on effects for quality of life.\u0026nbspOur migration “crisis”\u0026nbspcame in 2001, with a surge in the numbers of asylum seekers trying to reach Australia by boat. Our then centrist, populist prime minister John Howard seized the moment to proclaim: “We will decide who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they come.”It was a resonant phrase. Like the best political slogans it was impossible to argue with, defending controversial politics with impenetrable rhetoric.\u0026nbspWhen Australians heard the Brexiteer slogan “take back control”\u0026nbspwe immediately recognised what was going on.Australia hopes to be the first cab off the rank for a post-Brexit free trade deal. We’ve a lot of recent experience in getting them done fastDavid Cameron could have taken a leaf from Howard’s playbook. When Howard was confronted with an irresistible push for a referendum in the late Nineties (on Australia becoming a republic, which Howard strongly opposed), he responded with a process ingeniously designed to undermine it: first, a national convention to agree on a model that was inevitably going to be a compromise nobody liked, then a vote in which half the people who wanted a republic would vote against it because it wasn’t the republic they had imagined. Sadly, Howard didn’t offer this advice or Cameron didn’t seek it.So the campaign began. As a foreign correspondent I rarely had to report the daily tennis match. This avoided much of the problem faced by domestic media: the failure of “he said, she said”\u0026nbspjournalism when confronted with daily exaggerations and concoctions from campaigners, and the rejection of expertise.\u0026nbspInstead, my editors wanted to know what was driving public opinion. Not quite a forecast of the result, but understanding of, whichever way it fell, why it had fallen that way.My initial theory was that it would shake out much like the 2014 Scottish referendum. It was to be nationalistic passion and vague promises of future benefits, up against a well-organised steamrolling campaign of warnings about the inevitable costs and risks.Farage says he would rather \u0027go on holiday\u0027 than vote in a second Brexit referendumThe sight of a country deliberately throwing away a close, mutually beneficial partnership, wilfully damaging its economy and influence on a point of cultural principle, was a surpriseBut then I met an insightful\u0026nbspBrussels thinktank chief, whose depressing logic completely changed my mind.\u0026nbspFabian Zuleeg told me the above theory was “plausible… but not one I believe in”. He asked the simple question: “Who’s going to campaign against Brexit?”Business would be reticent, worried about spooking shareholders. Much of the media were scathingly Eurosceptic. Trade unions were never really on board with the EU. Labour was ided. Cameron was on the nose with voters and had for years (like many of his colleagues) used the EU and immigration as a political punch bag. On the other side were figures like Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage: stump speakers with mass appeal. I’d met Farage. I understood why he was political catnip.\u0026nbsp“It’s quite frightening,” the thinktank chief said. “If you look at the general attitudes towards migration (in the UK) it’s intensely negative and I think this is going to drive a lot of this agenda.”For an Australian to lecture the UK on political self-harm is, of course, the height of hypocrisy. We’ve changed prime ministers six times in the past 11 years, only twice as the result of an election, and we’re quite likely to do it again in 2019. And if any country is going to sympathise with a nation torn by an endless debate over migration, it’s Australia.\u0026nbspOn the eve of the referendum, though, then prime minister Malcolm Turnbull channelled the mood of much of our country: bemused tolerance.\u0026nbsp“If the British people, in their wisdom, decide to stay in the European Union then we would welcome that,” he said a month or so ahead of the vote.\u0026nbspTheresa May to meet opposition leaders as Labour snubs offer of talks More than 170 business leaders urge May to back second referendumCorbyn will do no better than May when it comes to BrexitThere was self-interest too, Turnbull said. Australian businesses like to base in the UK and take advantage of access to the EU.\u0026nbspAnd Australia as a member of the Five Eyes group, sharing intelligence with the UK, felt from a security point of view it was “an unalloyed plus for Britain to remain in the EU”.Then came the vote.\u0026nbsp“We respect the wishes of the British people,” Turnbull said afterwards. Rather optimistically, he added: “I have no doubt that in due course, the British government will negotiate a satisfactory departure from the European Union.”Privately, he held a different view. After being deposed, at a private speech in November 2018, Turnbull said what he really thought.\u0026nbspBrexit was a “catastrophe”, he said – a decision “not even understood by the government, let alone by the people. It was absolutely uninformed consent.”Nevertheless, a significant faction of conservative Australian politics\u0026nbsp(including the then high commissioner in London) threw itself\u0026nbspenthusiastically behind Brexit.\u0026nbspSince the vote, then, our official attitude has essentially been:\u0026nbsp“Ok, what’s in it for us?”\u0026nbspMost obviously, there’s a trade deal. Australia hopes to be the first cab off the rank for a post-Brexit free trade deal. We’ve a lot of recent experience in getting them done fast.\u0026nbspWe’re a relatively minor trading partner for the UK (compared with, say, the US), so there’s less at stake and the UK can use us as a kind of training ground before it takes on the ruthless brainboxes from Washington DC. And there’s the Commonwealth link. Brexiteers imagined Commonwealth ties as a\u0026nbspbasis for post-Brexit UK’s international identity.\u0026nbspAustralia is happy to play along with this, especially as Brexiteers seem to think the Commonwealth consists entirely of Australia, New Zealand and Canada.And, finally, it feels like a historical revenge served cold. When the UK joined the EU it triggered a dramatic change in UK-AU trade.\u0026nbspWe lost a market, and it forced us to refocus on our region. In a way it was a favour: Australia prospered hugely from its growing ties to the developing economies to our north.\u0026nbsp But some (especially the older, more Anglophile corner of conservative politics) have never forgotten this slight. When Britain comes begging for post-Brexit favours, it will be a sweet moment indeed.Nick Miller has been the Europe correspondent for the Sydney Morning Herald and The Age, based in London, since 2013We’ll tell you what’s true.

But they need to know about the UK-EU economic relationship,” he said.\u0026nbsp“These are all global companies and therefore they have other possibilities other than staying.“They may relocate.

Complex and detailed negotiations cannot be conducted in public.”Ms May is pinning her hopes of winning next week’s vote on Mr Cox changing his legal advice, in January, that the UK is in danger of being trapped in the backstop indefinitely.However, that will be far more difficult if the UK is only able to appeal to an arbitrator that the backstop is no longer needed, possibly under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.If the meaningful vote is lost on Tuesday, MPs will have the opportunity to veto a no-deal Brexit and to seek an extension to Article 50 – delaying the UK’s departure from the EU beyond 29 March.We’ll tell you what’s true.

We can take the prime minister’s path. A deal that delivers tariff-free trade and transition. It’s not perfect, but we can work with it.“And then there’s the other choice on the table. More delay. More circling. Perhaps only to be flung off a steeper cliff in the summer.”Citing an IMF estimate, no deal could lead to up to 8 per cent off economic output in the long term, said Mr Allan said.“So our message to politicians is clear. Unite around the prime minister’s deal. Or unite around something else, urgently.”Irish premier Leo Varadkar says his government and the EU are happy to offer clarifications and assurances on he\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspWithdrawal Agreement and the backstop to help get the accord over the line.The Taoiseach said the Republic of Ireland has been “very flexible and very reasonable” over the proposed deal.Mr Varadkar said: “We are entering quite a sensitive phase now over the next week or two as we approach the next round of votes in the House of Commons and the European Council meeting the week after that.“We are happy to offer further clarifications and further assurances if that can help the UK government get the agreement over the line.”The head of HMRC has warned the organisation is still almost 1,000 employees short of the staff numbers needed to cope with a no-deal\u0026nbspBrexit.The chief executive Sir Jon Thompson said HMRC will require 5,500 staff if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement with Brussels.Giving evidence to the Commons Public Accounts Committee, he said the latest figures for the end of January showed they were still only up to 4,200.Wigan MP Lisa Nandy is unimpressed by Theresa May’s new fund for struggling English towns.Here the Labour politician explains why it “doesn’t even begin to make a dent in what has been lost”.The transport secretary Chris Grayling is an “international embarrassment” who should be sacked over the £33m payment to Eurotunnel, according to Labour.Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald told the Commons Mr Grayling had showed “disregard for taxpayers” by failing to defend himself in the House.He added: “Even in this golden age of ministerial incompetence, the transport secretary stands out from the crowd. “He leaves a trail of destruction in his wake, causing chaos and wasting billions of pounds yet he shows no contrition, no acknowledgement of his mistakes nor any resolve to learn and improve... the transport secretary has become an international embarrassment.”Britons are losing faith in the Government\u0027s ability to control the streets, a Conservative MP has told minsters.Julia Lopez\u0027s warning came as she paid tribute to 17-year-old Jodie Chesney, a Hornchurch and Upminster constituent who was fatally stabbed in a park last Friday.Ms Lopez added people want to see and feel a change in the response to concerns over knife crime as she pressed Home Secretary Sajid Javid to act.Speaking in the Commons after Labour secured an urgent question on knife crime, Tory Ms Lopez said: On Friday night, 17-year-old Jodie Chesney was murdered in my constituency.She was a bright, beautiful and kind young woman and she did not deserve to die in this way.The public are losing faith in our ability to control our streets and they need to see and they need to feel a step change in our response to public safety concerns.Labour\u0027s Stella Creasy read out the names of those young people who had been killed by a knife in the capital in 2019.The Walthamstow MP said: I\u0027m not sure that that is a complete list of everyone who has been killed by a knife in London this year alone, but I can tell the Home Secretary that the taskforces, the consultations, the more reports, isn\u0027t working.What on earth will it take for him to recognise this is an emergency that requires an emergency response?Mr Javid said: She reminds this House that it\u0027s such a tragic loss of life.He added: I really wish standing here there was just one simple answer, one single thing that could be done. We require action across multiple fronts and the best way to achieve that is for all us to recognise that and to work together to deliver it.Back in the Commons, Labour\u0027s Louise Haigh, who was granted the urgent question, called the senseless murders in recent days a national tragedy that requires national leadership.The shadow policing minister said in 2000 the then-PM Tony Blair convened an emergency Cobra meeting to set up a taskforce to bring down a similar rise in violent crime, urging Theresa May to do the same now.She also hit out at the cuts to policing under the Conservatives, telling the chamber: We cannot pretend the cuts to policing have not made our country less safe.Sadly, the Prime Minister and other members of her Cabinet continue to deny this crucial link.Ms Haigh also described the most recent police funding settlement as completely inadequate and called on Mr Javid to urgently review it to ensure those forces that have seen the biggest increases in violent crime are give whatever they need to fight this outbreak.Sajid Javid has said there is no single solution to tackling serious violence after the government came under fire for a recent rise in knife crime.The home secretary was called to answer an urgent question in the Commons today after two 17-year-olds were stabbed to death in separate attacks over the weekend.Mr Javid told MPs: We all wish there was one thing, just one thing, that we could do to stop this violence, but there are no shortcuts, there is no single solution.Tackling serious violence requires coordinated action on multiple fronts.Please allow a moment for the liveblog to loadWe’ll tell you what’s true.

It didn’t work like that in the Cameron renegotiation either,” he told an event at the Institute for Government think tank.Labour will order MPs to support fresh Brexit referendum- McDonnell“That stuff is not done in the way British politics works, leader to leader. It’s done via the bureaucrats, and the Sherpas, and the people at the top of the institutions.“The Brits constantly either misunderstand that or just don’t realise that circumventing that and thinking ‘Oh, we can go direct to Berlin or Paris or any other capital and square that off\u0026nbsp– and that will be different from the orthodoxy we’re getting out of Brussels’ – never works.”The government has been frustrated throughout Brexit talks at the lack of direct negotiations between the prime minister and other EU27 presidents and prime ministers.\u0026nbspDespite lurid predictions in some corners of the British press that Angela Merkel would ride to Britain’s rescue and cut a special deal, the bloc has insisted on keeping negotiations between Michel Barnier and his constantly resigning UK counterparts.\u0026nbspThe prime minister has generally only been given limited time to speak on Brexit at European Council summits, with a two-way back and forth generally off the table. When they have happened – as at the summit in December – they have not always gone well.\u0026nbspThe EU has put the unity of the 27 EU member states at the centre of its negotiating strategy during Brexit. Officials close to talks say the UK has tried to split off member states, but with little luck.\u0026nbspBefore he was appointed Brexit secretary, David Davis laid out his strategy in a series of tweets, one of which read: “The first calling point of the UK’s negotiator immediately after Brexit will not be Brussels, it will be Berlin, to strike a deal.”The former UK diplomat Mr Rogers told the same event on Monday that he did not think a customs union would be an option for the UK outside the EU.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliament“I don’t think it will be sustainable long-term to be in a customs union and not have a greater degree of autonomy over our trade policy,” he said.“We would get consultation rights, sure, we might get superior consultation rights – but they would only be consultation rights – and ultimately the negotiating mandate would reflect the interests of the 27, no doubt articulated carefully to take account of British interests.”He also described the prospect of an extension of Article 50 as “quite problematic” because of the issue of the UK having to take part in European Parliament elections.\u0026nbspMr Rogers stepped down in early 2017, reportedly after a row with Theresa May’s advisers. He had reportedly told ministers privately that Brexit could take a decade to resolve, angering them.We’ll tell you what’s true.

She said she feared she would be detained and tortured again if her latest attempt\u0026nbspfailed.In March last year she was reportedly driven across the Oman border by Tina Jauhiainen, a friend and Finnish capoeira teacher who worked at the royal court, before taking a jet ski to a waiting boat manned by Hervé Jaubert, an-ex French special forces officer. Indian coastguards later intercepted the boat and Latifa\u0026nbspre-appeared nine months later in the Emirati\u0026nbspcity.\u0026nbspThe UAE has repeatedly denied that Sheikh Latifa was forcibly returned home or harmed but has never explained what happened between her dramatic capture in March 2018 and December when photos were released of her back in Dubai.Neither has the young princess been given an opportunity to speak for herself.She is the second of the Sheikh Maktoum\u0027ss daughters to allegedly disappear.\u0026nbspLatifa’s older sister, Shamsa, was reportedly seized on the streets of Cambridge after fleeing the family’s Surrey estate in 2000 and has not been seen or heard from since.The Dubai authorities did not respond to The Independent’s request for comment but has repeatedly denied charges of wrong doing.Rashid Al Maktoum recently flew £250,000 in aid to Haiti in his private jet (Getty Images)In a statement written to Sky News in December, the authorities said were “deeply saddened” by media speculation regarding her situation.They said Latifa was “safe in Dubai” and “looking forward to … building a happy and stable future”.They denied the “false allegations’ and released photos of her with Ms Robinson, who agreed to visit Dubai to meet her in Princess Haya’s home.Ms Robinson said after the visit that the princess was mentally unwell and claimed a ransom had been demanded when she disappeared.“Latifa is vulnerable, she is troubled. She made a video that she now regrets and was part of a plan of escape… under circumstances which need to be examined, Ms Robinson told BBC Radio 4 in December.\u0026nbsp“You have to bear in mind this a troubled young woman who has a serious medical situation. She is receiving psychiatric care. They don’t want to endure any more publicity,” she added.The UAE has not cooperated with the United Nations enquiry into her abduction, and that investigation is ongoingThe former Irish president faced a torrent of criticism from rights groups who said she failed to ask key questions about what why the princess had vanished for so long.Ms Robinson declined to comment on Monday when The Independent reached out to\u0026nbspher.Detained in Dubai’s Stirling said Ms Robinson “appeared to be reciting almost verbatim from Dubai’s script” and dismissed it as a “PR stunt”.“The UAE should have not circumvented normal UN protocols.”Speaking to The Independent Hervé Jaubert, 62 who tried to help the princess escape,\u0026nbspsaid he last spoke to her when he claimed he saw her being dragged off his vessel by the Indian coast guard.\u0026nbsp“I’ve not heard anything from her ever since. I believe she is under watch 247 and they won’t leave her or let her have a phone, he said.\u0026nbspHe said that the princess had first reached out to him in 2011, after a reading his book detailing his own escape and had been planning her flight for seven years.\u0026nbspRecounting the escape, he said his US-flagged yacht was in international waters and off the coast of India when he contacted Detained in Dubai and other rights groups as he noticed they were being tailed by the Indian coastguarHe claimed the 4 March 2018 was a “full-blown military attack” involving three boats and a surveillance plane, and that he was beaten up by the Indian authorities. \u0026nbspHe said he saw Sheikh Latifa be dragged off “kicking and screaming of political asylum.\u0026nbspI believe she is under watch 247 and they won’t leave her or let her have a phone“This is a human right violation. We never saw her again. They took her away on helicopter,”Rights groups have long complained of rights abuses in the UAE and the lack of freedom particular for women, who are subject to a ship system, which means male relatives can take women to court for being disobedient.\u0026nbspThe most recent case of a woman trying to flee the country is Hind al-Bolooki, 43 who made a desperate plea last month for asylum in North Macedonia after escaping the UAE when her family would not grant her a orce.She posted a video online when her asylum claim was rejected, and aid she\u0026nbspfeared being deported back to the UAE.Mr Kinney said “Between Sheikha Latifa and Hind al-Bolooki, you have two very public examples of women who felt compelled to flee in dramatic fashion because of male chauvinism and violence.We’ll tell you what’s true.

But what will happenit doesn’t pass is truly appalling.If Mrs May’s deal hasn’t won a Commons vote by March , the Commons will vote on whether to proceed with No Deal.The Parliamentary arithmetic is such that No Deal will be defeated.The next day, Parliament will then vote on whether to request an extension from the EU. This vote will almost certainly pass.At this point, the UK would be in the weakest position it has ever been in this negotiation.Whether to grant an extension or not would be up to the EU and would require all  member states to agree.Any extension would almost certainly come with conditions.The French President, Emmanuel Macron, has already said it would have to be “justied by new choices by the British”.It would also be up to the EU to decide how long an extension to offer.If Parliament accepted the terms of the extension, then there would almost certainly be another effort by MPs to take control of the Brexit process.A cross-party group of MPs is already preparing to do this.If they succeed, Brexit would become softer still.Parliament would try to commit the UK to staying in a permanent customs union with the EU.Some MPs would even like to keep the UK in the single market as well, following EU rules on everything from financial services regulation to free movement.Others would use an extension to push for a second referendum.The only way to sidestep this scenario is for Mrs May’s deal to pass by the th.But given that it lost last time round by  votes — a record defeat for a Government bill — this is a hard ask.Mrs May’s plan for getting it through has been to get something on the backstop to reassure MPs that it won’t be permanent.Geoffrey Cox, the Attorney General, has been tasked with doing this.The key to getting the deal through is persuading the Tories’ confidence and supply partners, the DUP, to accept the deal.If they do, the Tory rebellion will reduce substantially.After all,the DUP are satisfied that the deal won’t end up splitting Northern Ireland off from the rest of the UK — the principal criticism of the backstop — then it is hard for any Tory to object to it on these grounds.Along with the Government chief whip, Cox met the DUP on Wednesday night.The verdict of one senior DUP source after that meeting is that the Government is “not there yet” on getting enough for them to come on board.Some leading DUP figures think the move by Cabinet ministers to try to take No Deal off the table has made it less likely that Cox can get enough to satisfy them.“It’s tricky. Barnier isn’t yielding, the Irish aren’t yielding,” complains one Cabinet minister.At the moment there is little optimism in No about being able to hold a meaningful vote next week.That means the Government will have only one chance to turn round a -vote defeat.But Brexiteer MPs should remember that things will only get worseMrs May’s deal hasn’t passed by the evening of March .THE prospects of Mrs May’s deal passing depends on what the DUP and the European Research Group, the main Brexiteer bloc in the Tory Party, make of any changes Geoffrey Cox can secure to the backstop.The ERG has now set up a  of legal eagles to examine what Cox comes back with.The signicance of this group is twofold.First, the DUP’s Westminster leader Nigel Dodds – a Cambridge-educated lawyer – is a member of it. This, as one former Cabinet minister tells me, shows “the symbiosis between the DUP and the ERG”.It means the DUP and the ERG are likely to take the same view of whatever Cox delivers. The second is that it provides a structure for examining any changes that Cox secures.Some in the ERG leadership were concerned that the veteran Eurosceptic Tory MP Bill Cash – also a lawyer – was determined to rubbish whatever Cox gets.They feared that an instant verdict from him could commit the group to opposing the deal come what may.But no one should think that the other lawyers in the group will be looking to give Cox’s work an easy ride.One leading Tory Brexiteer tells me: “If they unpack the stuffing of Cox’s codpiece and find it is a vainglorious appendage, then they’ll say so.”I understand that Cox is concentrating more on a clearer exit mechanism for the backstop than a time limit.But whether this will be enough to satisfy these lawyers remains to be seen. TOM WATSON’S group of Social Democratic Labour MPs is expected to have its first meeting next week.The question of what Watson, the party’s deputy leader, is up to with this group is preoccupying Labour insiders.One option is that he could use the group to pile pressure on Jeremy Corbyn to adopt positions this group want him to.Labour’s electoral prospects cannot survive many more defections.If Watson regularly made clear thatCorbyn didn’t do X, Y or Z then this group might walk, he could change Labour’s approach in a host of areas.Fear of more defection is what explains why Labour is now moving towards backing a second referendum, and why Corbyn loyalist Chris Williamson has been suspended for saying the party is too apologetic about anti-Semitism.But by setting up this group, Watson also makes it easier for it to one day declare its independence from Corbyn’s leadership and stand on its own two feet as a new political party.The group will, over the coming months, work up the policies that any new party would need.IN private, Tories are eagerly speculating about the leadership contest they expect later this year.Allies of Boris Johnson had been confident that he would, eventually, secure the support of Amber Rudd.They didn’t expect the pair to run on a joint ticket.But they were hopeful that she would back himshe was knocked out in the early rounds of the contest.Securing the support of a Remainer from the One Nation wing of the party would have been a big boost to Boris’s campaign.It would have shown that – contrary to what his critics say – he COULD bring the two wings of the party together.But some of those close to him now fear that the Brexit dferences between them are too big to make such a pact possible.They worry that Rudd might now look for someone  to throw her support behind.One Boris backer tells me: “Amber is playing a very clever game.”If he had done that, Cameron would – probably – have won the referendum and would be coming towards the end of his second term as PM.In both recent negotiations with the EU, the UK has reduced its bargaining power by never properly preparing to walk away.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s coming soon . . . and it’s going to be ruddy marvellous.I don’t think I’m giving too much away when I say there will be some big personalities trying to work as a team. And that’s always seriously entertaining.But also, the thing about The Apprentice is that none of the celebs realise when they sign up that it is probably the single most full-on thing they will ever do in their le.How do I know this  I was a ­contestant in  Lord Sugar’s aide.And when Lord Sugar asked meI would be on the Comic Relief show, I honestly thought: “How hard can it be ” How wrong I was.The girls asked me to be their project leader and we all quickly found out that you don’t know how much you will do for charity until you are part of an event raising money for Comic Relief. There is almost no limit.Also, it’s hard to do justice to the exhaustion. We were on the go from am until midnight. I was surviving on about two hours’ sleep a night.Probably my most vivid memory of the  show is cleaning two tonne of squid — what we misguidedly decided to serve at the fun fair we were organising. I was the only one who knew how to clean squid.Plus, as project manager I decided to take most of the rubbish jobs myself. And cleaning squid is very messy, as each one squirts ink.Just when I was pretty much ­covered in the stuff, I got a call from Trinny Woodall, who’d gone home to put her kids to bed.She said there was a party at PR guru Matthew Freud’s house and I had to join her to canvas the room for donations. While she turned up looking — and smelling — ine I had to rush there straight from the kitchen, stinking of fish.But boy was it worth it — we raised £million. Oh, and let the records show that £, of that was raised by the girls — with the help of some very generous friends.As well as bringing money to a brilliant cause, it’s highly entertaining viewing. And this year is going to be top notch, with some amazing players.The girls’ team consists of Amanda Holden, Ayda Williams, Kelly Hoppen, Rachel Johnson and Tameka Empson. The boys’ team is Omid Djalili, Richard Arnold, Russell Kane, Rylan Clark-Neal and Sam Allardyce. Their task is a ­cabaret-themed event.Sam Allardyce, former England football boss, was also my football manager at West Ham for several years and he was very, shall we say, authoritarian. But during this process he had on a hairnet and was making canapes — and, ahem, wore a bright neon dress with panache.I can reveal Claude Littner had a much better time than me overseeing the girls’ team. They were unbelievably dynamic, organised and focused.Meanwhile, the boys were all ­wandering around saying, ‘Er, what do we do ’ Believe me, it took all my willpower to hold my tongue and not try to get them organised.While the girls struggled to hold their ticket price, the boys stood firm and Simon Cowell put huge pressure on Ayda and Amanda with a surprise demand for the girls.But at the end of the day, one major donation to either team means anyone can win, organised or not.There is a jaw-dropping moment when one of the boys “entertains” the audience with balloons strategically placed to hide his, ahem, “three-piece suite” as Lord Sugar puts it. And when the balloons pop . . . you won’t believe what you have just witnessed.After the task, back in the boardroom, Claude was full of enthusiasm about how fantastic the girls were and what a brilliant time he’d had.I said nothing. When Rylan askedI had anything to say, I said: “Plenty — and none of it good.”They would have done anything for the charity. And I mean anything. I could hardly watch at one point. It really is laugh-out-loud funny.Boy is this show going to be worth the ten-year wait.Celebrity Apprentice for Comic Relief is on BBC on March  and .ONLY Elle Macpherson could manage to look a million dollars while wearing cosy winter warmers.She arrived as a special guest at Vienna Opera Ball in Austria wearing a grey knitted polo neck and white, wide-leg trousers – yet somehow managing to look the very definition of effortless chic.I am particularly envious because although I know I can brush up well, when left to my own devices my look is either bag lady or corporate stf.NEW figures showing how dramatically domestic violence has risen in London are truly sickening. There was an appalling  per cent increase in offences between  and .The sheer quantity is horric – in  there were , domestic abuse crimes recorded by the Met Police, compared with , in .These figures are for London but – obviously – it’s happening all over the country.I can’t help thinking thatit was revealed that , MEN had been attacked, assaulted and hurt by the women in their lives, more would be done to stop it.But what I really want to know is: Why are so many men intent on hurting women The good news is that Sadiq Khan, London mayor, announced an extra £million of funding for support services for domestic violence victims, saying cuts had left them at “breaking point”.Also, Clare’s Law means people will be able to check whether their partners have been domestic abusers.The legislation was named after Clare Wood, who was murdered and set on fire by her partner, who she did not know had previously served a three-year prison sentence for harassing another woman.These changes are positive.But isn’t it terrible that either thing is needed in the first place  Any domestic abuse whatsoever is shocking, tragic – and unnecessary. And we need hardline action to make it illegal.That involves stronger sentencing and an absolute zero-tolerance approach, until anyone guilty of it becomes a social outcast.She wants the cash to fund specic projects chosen by us – with more oversight to make sure the money is not squandered.I’ve got an even better idea. How about we don’t spend ANY money on foreign aid – except emergency disaster relief – and use it instead to fund our own hospitals, schools, housing and mental heath care NINE men were jailed in Bradford this week for a total of  years for grooming and sexually abusing vulnerable teenagers.A harrowing impact statement from one victim was read in court saying she was “nothing but a toy to play with”, which is vile.I want to know when we’re going to stop reading about these gangs of men who prey on and abuse young girls, ruining their lives.What is needed is prevention. Action must be taken in the care system to protect vulnerable young people and in society so people can speak out when they suspect someone is being groomed.Sentences should be stfer to make people think twice – eventheir moral compass is skewed – for fear of the consequences.This story makes me despair, though. What has happened to our community values to stop us looking after those who need it most HERE is your one-minute Brexit update for the week.There will be three key votes in Parliament.The first is a vote on Theresa May’s deal – her agreed terms for leaving the EU. It’s a “yes or no” question.We can only assume the answer will be no . . . again.Then the second vote – to leave Europe with No Deal.This is another “yes or no”. That, too, will surely be a no.So, MPs don’t want to leave with Theresa May’s deal and they don’t want to leave with No Deal.Then there will be another vote on delaying Brexit while they work out the terms on which we DO leave.That one could run for years and years.Blimey!MY heart goes out to the mother whose daughter’s stillbirth left her terried she would lose her two healthy sons. It really is a tragedy.And it must be unbearable for her that the NHS Trust admitted negligence.If she had a child who needed expensive care as a result of NHS negligence, it would make sense to sue the trust. But asking for £million compensation when the sad truth is all the money in the world won’t bring back her baby is a blow to an NHS already on its knees.In fact, its financial woes may even have contributed to the lack of care that caused this tragedy in the first place.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Only a blank so blank that it screams.”But it was “two-dinners” Watson, before his dramatic weight loss, whose “curry house conspiracy” with Gordon Brown toppled triple election-winner Tony Blair.It was Watson who was forced to apologise after using Parliamentary privilege to smear dead Tory Leon Brittan with “evil” child sex slurs.And it is Watson who aims to wreck free speech by gagging the Press.Jew-baiting Marxist Jeremy Corbyn seems a saint by comparison.His bleak imagery will come as no surprise in Westminster, but it explains the tidal wave of ministers who walked out of her Cabinet in exasperation.To her shame, Amber Rudd and her fellow Ruddites lacked the courage to follow suit last week. Instead, they simply destroyed any last chance of using No Deal as a negotiating card.Ms Rudd once saw herself as a potential Tory leader or a “king maker” to Boris Johnson or Michael Gove.“After last week, any association with Amber would be the kiss of death not just in Westminster, but with the party at large,” said a Tory MP.“She is poison. Everyone wants to leave on March  — other than those who don’t want to leave at all.”That prospect now relies on silver-tongued Geoffrey Cox wangling an escape clause on the Northern Ireland backstop — dubbed “Cox’s codpiece”.The Attorney-General needs to sell his formula not just to Theresa May, but to fellow Leavers — including eagle-eyed veteran eurosceptic Bill Cash, chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee.If they approve, Mrs May might clinch Brexit as promised this month.And then navigate her way to a dignied and honourable Therexit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Maria, , said: “There was a  with two crew members and they were mad with us. “We started yelling to them ‘please, please let us on the cruise is still here’. “But the guys said ‘you are not going to be so lucky and we are closing the doors and leaving’. “Alessandro was in shock because it was his nightmare and did actually happened.“He was so frustrated he wanted to jump to the ship. But [the drop] was so big and dangerous.”Maria, who is also trained journalist, said she has never missed a train, plane or boat before, but because they were relaxing on their honeymoon they let their guard down. It was the ship’s last port before ing to Miami and it was the sixth day of a seven-day cruise.Usually the ship sailed at .pm from its stops, but this time the ship departed Nassau, in the Bahamas, two hours earlier than they expected.In an excruciating twist, they had arrived at the port just minutes before the ship was due to sail but didn’t realise it was about to sail.Maria said: “We thought we were on time. We were there .pm or .pm and we heard the call from the ship but there were so many cruises we thought it was another ship. Then we heard the horn. When we arrived to the pier we were in shock.”Here they saw the gangway had been removed and the vessel was in the process of leaving its moorings.  Maria said: “I think the worst feeling was to see that the boat was still there and knowing we can go inside and see the boat leave without you. “I think I would have preferred to have been at the pier and the boat had already gone.”To make matters worse, the couple realised they had left their passport, visas, and credit cards on board, meaning they were marooned on the island with no money or way out.Fortunately the crew managed to retrieve their travel documents and cards on board before handing them to the pilot who was guiding the ship out of the harbour.He then sailed back to the quayside on his launch and handed Maria and Alessandro their passport and wallets.At the immigration office they learned they were actually one of six people who missed the boat. Maria said: “There two other couples. One were very, very angry so we didn’t keep in touch but the other two were nice. “They were young couple from Calornia.”But when the ship was docked in the Port of Miama they then had to wait hours before all the passengers disembarked and for the crew to fetch their belongings from their cabin.Shortly after they ed home the couple released the video of their ordeal had gone viral but they were light-hearted about their now famous ordeal.Maria said: “Of course it would be betterit didn’t happened. But it could have a positive flipside. “Now I can say it was funny experience and we have a good story to our kids we have kids.”The video of her holiday mishap was filmed from the deck of the nearby Norwegian Bliss and the call to depart came at .pm local time.Workers began removing the gangway and closing the door with the ship leaving at .pm.The hapless couple showed up five minutes later with shopping bags from their excursion.Frantically waving, they tried to get the attention of people on the dock and on the ship.Other passengers on the cruise ship can be seen looking at the couple from their balconies as the propellers start to churn in the water.Maria is a household name in her home country and found fame as a  year old or the TV show Recreo Grande.The star — who is also a top model and social media star — is best known for the weekly show RG Elementos.In , she co-starred in the movie Buscando a Marcos Ramirezm a box office success in her home country."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT0004733063212.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa may brexit vote countdown labour voters","story":"Writing for The Sun, PM reveals details of the mammoth ‘Stronger Towns’ fund and declares it the first step towards “spreading opportunity more widely” across the UK.She adds it delivers on the call made by The Sun after the  Referendum, when we urged Downing Street to invest in Brexit-backing communities that had felt ignored by successive Governments.At least £million of an initial £billion will be pumped into the North of England - as the PM desperately tries to woo Labour ‘Leave’ MPs ahead of the Commons showdown on her Brexit deal on March .Furious opposition parties accused Mrs May trying to “bribe” people into backing her deal.Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said it “smacks of desperation”.And Labour MPs targeted by Downing Street warned the money was nowhere near enough.Ruth Smeeth, MP for Stoke on Trent, said it was a “pathetic sum” while Wigan’s Lisa Nandy said the Government wasn’t “serious”.The PM insisted it was a key step in righting the North South ide.But the PM argues: “With great passion, The Sun argued that - while the economy had worked well for some places – wealth was not always spread fairly across the country.

While a recent survey found that British manufacturers are building up reserves at the fastest pace seen in any leading economy since the early . What you should do. Nothing. There is absolutely no need to stockpile food or medicines. In fact bulk buying could actually create shortages. The NHS   Health Secretary Matt Hancock has been accused of boasting about becoming the biggest purchaser of fridges. And the government has created a logistics hub in Belgium where vital medical supplies will be stockpiled to stop the NHS running short of equipmentthere is a no-deal Brexit. Stents, implants and other products needed to ensure that patient care is not disrupted will be stored at the hub. Perhaps more concerning is that the health service has begun stockpiling body bags. But theyre also keeping medicines, vaccines and blood products.  million packs of medicines are imported to the UK from the EU every month, and the NHS is preparing for a doomsday scenario to prevent supplies running dry. But crucially the NHS has insisted that no patients need to stock up on medicine.   AstraZenecahas increased the number of medicines available to pharmacies and hospitals in both the UK and EU by %. All in all the company has spent pound million preparing for no-deal including building labs in Sweden to duplicate product testing. French pharmaceutical giant Sanofihas acquired extra warehouse space in the UK for cold storage of medicines and vaccines. It is also moving some manufacturing operations from the UK to the EU. WHSmith   No one ever runs out of pens right  Well WHSmith is not taking any chances.Instead they are stockpiling six months worth of pens to guard against chaos at the border caused by Brexit .The stationers, who source most of their products from Asia, normally hold between three and four months worth of pens, diaries and notepads. But the boss of the British firm confirmed they were planning to hold six months worth to avoid disruptions to their supplies. Stephen Clarke, WHSmith’s chief executive, told Bloomberg: We’re used to holding quite a bit of forward cover in terms of stock anyway, so what we’ve done is topped that up a little bit to put ourselves in an even better position should there be congestion at ports.   Tesco Tesco chief executive, Dave Lewis, said the supermarket has been holding a talks with its suppliers and increasing stocks of long-le groceries. But, with Britain importing about half the fresh food it eats, Lewis said it was not possible to make similar arrangements for fresh foodBritain crashes out of the EU. “We looked at the lecycle and production of product categories that matter most to customers and sat down with all suppliers to discuss their production capability, where they hold stock andwe can help them hold it,” explained Lewis. “It’s not possible to do that sort of thing on fresh food, so that’s where the pinch point would bethere were to be a no-deal.”  Marks and Spencer Marks  Spencer said its own Brexit planning committee had “upped the ante” and started to make a “few real choices”. The chief executive, Steve Rowe, said: “We have taken some additional long-le stuff but our food business is % fresh and anything that slows down will contribute to cost and waste.”   Dixons CarphoneBritains biggest seller of electricals and mobile phones has said it is prepared for all Brexit scenarios.The group which imports most of its product from Asia had worked with suppliers to make sure disruption was minimised. Some of those had brought stock into the UK early. The companys finance chief said that being the market leader put it in a good position as suppliers were likely to prioritise the company - suggesting that smaller retailers might suffer. Airline food  Companies like Gate Gourmet, which supplies  airlines at  UK airports in the have begun stockpiling frozen main meals, pizzas, dried snacks and sandwiches at warehouses in Peterborough and London. Gate Gourmet produces most of its meals in Germany and Spain. They fear any holdup at the border could disrupt its business model. BMW  Hundreds of trucks carry car parts into the UK on a daily basis to be used in just-in-time supply chains at plants across the country. Manufacturers are concerned about disruption at the border but the way the supply chains work mean stockpiling isnt really a viable option. BMWCustoms Manager StephanFreismuth said that the company could only stockpile for a matter of days. He said that anything longer would require building “the highest building in the world.” “We are looking for additional [warehouse] space but in the end, it’s not possible. We are producing ‘just in time,’ and just in sequence,”Freismuth said, BMW imports about € billionworth of car parts from the EU every year, or double the amount it sources from inside the country. Nissan, Toyota and Honda face similar problems.  Pets at Home Britains biggest pet supplier has begun stockpiling cat and dog food. The chief executive Peter Pritchard has pledged to ensure families do not run out of food for their pets. It is particularly important since % of the companys supplies come from outside the UK. The firm said they were considering holding up to poundm worth. Bentley  The chief executive of Bentley said the company was stockpiling parts. He described Brexit as a “killer” threatening the profitability of the luxury carmaker.   Unilever is stockpiling ice creams in Britain to guard against potential supply disruptions in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The Anglo-Dutch consumer giant, which is the worlds largest ice cream seller, makes British favourites likeMagnumbars in Italy and Germany. It is building up a few weeks of extra stock in Britain in case of any border delays. Likewise, several of its European deodorants, including Axe, Dove and Rexona are made in Britain and transported to the continent. A few weeks of extra inventory is one of the important steps we are taking to make sure that we minimise any disruption to our customers and consumers, said Alan Jope, Unilevers new chief executive.

The Financial Services Bill, a crucial law needed before any No Deal Brexit , was due to pass its final stages tonight. Yet it has vanished from the Commons order of business at the last minute, after MPs used it to launch a last-minute bid to make alleged tax havens more transparent. An amendment led by the Tory MP Andrew Mitchell would have forced the Isle of Man and Channel Islands to publish registers of beneficial ownership. That would allow people to trace the ultimate owners of companies based on the islands due to their secretive financial laws.  But the government claimed it would trigger a constitutional crisis by threatening the independence of the Crown Dependencies. In a rare move, the entire Bill was pulled from the Commons Order Paper today just a few hours before it was due to be debated. MPs from across the House of Commons raised the issue in a point of order.Dame Margaret Hodge described the move as a deliberate and arrogant snub to parliament.While Andrew Mitchell said it was an egregious slight of hand by the Foreign Office.Hilary Benn said: Not only is tackling financial crime and money laundering essential for the reputation of this country butthe government feels that it can get away with changing a date that has been contained in an amendment to legislation which has been passed by this House.If it can do it on this bill then what is to stop it doing it on lots of other bits of legislation  While the Speaker John Bercow said: Its a very odd state of affairs altogether.Naomi Hirst, Senior Anti-Corruption Campaigner at the campaign group Global Witness, said: It’s outrageous that the Government has pulled today’s vote on transparency in the UK’s territories. We cannot wait for the rest of the world to get on board before we open up our tax havens. Anonymously owned companies, many of them formed in the UK’s Crown Dependencies, can act as getaway cars for terrorists, dictators, money launderers and tax evaders all over the world. The Government should be fighting to introduce public registers, not thwarting the will of Parliament.” Shadow Economic Secretary to the Treasury Jonathan Reynolds tweeted: This has nakedly been pulled to prevent the government being defeated.  A government without a Commons majority is in office but not in power. How long can this go on  Duncan Hames of the Transparency International campaign warned the move may allow firms to avoid scrutiny. “For too long the British Government has shielded Britain’s Overseas Territories and the Crown Dependencies from calls by anti-corruption campaigners for greater company transparency, he said. As a result of the Hodge-Mitchell amendment the profound concerns of MPs across the political parties is impossible to ignore. Before this Bill s to the Commons, it’s imperative on the Government to be unambiguous in their determination to see company registries in these territories opened up. Speaking moments before the delay was announced, the Prime Ministers official spokesman said: Thanks to UK leadership all Crown Dependencies and overseas territories are committed to global tax transparency standards, including the exchange of information to help investigative tax evasion. However, Crown Dependencies are their own jurisdictions with their own democratically elected governments. They are responsible for their own fiscal matters. Given the beneficial ownership amendments were tabled on Thursday, it is only right their implications are given proper consideration. An HM Treasury spokesperson said: “The Beneficial Ownership amendments were tabled on Thursday, and we want to give them proper and thorough consideration. The Government will not move the Bill today but will reschedule it to ensure that there is sufficient time for proper debate.” "},{"url":null,"title":"devastated mum jade mcgrath forgives","story":"NewsDevastated mum of Jade McGrath forgives bullies who tormented her daughterSamantha Taylor asked the bullies to honour her daughter Jade McGrath who took her own le last November after suffering long-term mental problemsShareCommentsByTfany Lo:,  MAR NewsJade McGraths mum has shared an emotional message on Facebook\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA grief-stricken mother has publicly forgiven the bullies who tormented her teenage daughter Jade McGrath.

Samantha wrote the post yesterday as she called out the bullies. She said: You know who you are. The damage that you did to her self esteem was profound and long-lasting. Although she fought hard and valiantly to over come the damage that you caused, in the end she lost her fight, just when she seemed to be finally turning a corner. She never got a chance to do her exams at Millburn because she was too terried to go to school. That meant no college, so no qualications, so she was forced to do unskilled low paid jobs.

Gentle, sensitive, quirky people who have trouble fitting in, or try too hard to fit in because they don’t think they are good enough just as they are.

At the end, Samantha spoke of how her le has changed after her daughters death. To see her crumble, slowly,over the last six years of her le has broken our hearts, permanently, she wrote. I am writing this post as a small step towards ensuring that Jades le was not in vain. It’s all I have the energy to do at this point, just three months after the BPD took her from us.

He dialled  on Saturday, February , after suffering a medical episode. Kathryn said: As soon as I picked up the call, I knew something wasn’t right and I had to think quickly of a way to communicate with him as I didn’t know at that point what sort of danger he was in. Thankfully he had contacted police before and his number and address were already on our system. This allowed me to ask him to confirm his personal details by tapping. I then askedhe was in danger andhe needed an ambulance. I even asked himhe could manage to open the door to allow medical services to access his house. As soon as I knew that he was in danger, my colleague dispatched officers to his address who also alerted the Medicar to attend as quickly as possible. Once it arrived, the man was rushed to James Cook University Hospital.

Not much is known about their brief relationship in , but its understood it all ended after she did an interview with the Mirrors James Whittaker .James met Lady Sarah when she joined Prince Charles for a holiday in the Swiss ski resort Klosters. Recalling the event in , James wrote: My mission improbable as a young journalist was to discover who Charles would marry and be first with the news.   So when Sarah introduced me to Diana I should have taken more notice of the shy, gangly--year old. Sarah by contrast was a lively, lovely redhead and I was captivated. Putting obvious obstacles aside – like she was totally out of my league and stepping out with the most eligible bachelor in the land – I chanced my arm. James suggested the pair meet for lunch when they got back to London, and she accepted. He said: Unfortunately another reporter overheard our exchange and also invited himself along, which added gooseberry to the menu. Sarah was disarmingly frank about her boyfriend and declared she would not marry Charleshe were the dustman or the King of England.   That was good news from where I was sitting and Sarah seemed delighted I was so keen to share it with the nation. But when Charles found out, he wasnt happy. He reportedly told said to Sarah: You have just done something incredibly stupid. Despite the slightly awkward history, Sarah was said to completely approve of Charles and Dianas relationship. According to the , she said: I introduced them, Im cupid. Lady Sarah married Neil McCorquodale the year before Diana and Charles tied the know. They now have three children, Emily, George, and Celia. She is still close to her nephews Princes William and Harry, and attended Meghan and Harrys wedding earlier this year.

Potential donors waited in the rain to get tested in the hope that they could help brave Oscar Saxelby-Lee following a desperate plea from his parents .The five-year-old is in a race against time to find a le-saving stem cell donor after he was diagnosed with rare cancer. After his parents became worried about bruising showing up over Oscars body, it turned out to be T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia . Now doctors warn that he only has three months to find a stem-cell match which could save his le.  Over , donors queued up to get tested after Pitmaston Primary School, in Worcester, opened their doors for a donor search over the weekend. His teacher Sarah Keating said: Ive been teaching for  years and Ive never had a child go through something like this. You hear about children getting cancer and you think thats dreadful, then you move on. In this case we havent moved on, we will fight this.  Oscars teaching assistant Laura Senter, , said his diagnosis came as a shock to their class. She added: I couldnt believe it. I saw him before Christmas and he was his usual happy-go-lucky self. Its a nightmare for this to happen. You cant really do anything about it, its heart-breaking. If a child falls over and cuts their knee you can put a plaster on it. With something like this you cant just fix it.   Thats why we have gone into action mode to try and find a donor. I visited Oscar in hospital last month when it was his birthday. All the parents bought gts for him. Because of all the chemo he was very swollen but you could tell he was very much still him inside. When we came out we knew we needed to do everything we could to support him.  DKMS, the charity that tests the swabs, said its record for the highest number of people to take part in a registration event is , people. Volunteers were sat at tables and chairs in two of the schools halls over the weekend, handing out swabs and completing donor registration forms. Oscar was diagnosed with the aggressive form of leukaemia after bruising turned out to be cancer on December  last year.   His desperate parents Olivia Saxelby and Jamie Lee, of St Johns, Worcester, launched an appeal to find a match after his diagnosis. They aimed to get as many people as possible to sign up to a blood stem cell donor register as part of a campaign called Hand in Hand for Oscar. Olivia, , said: We felt like we could not see light at the end of the tunnel, but when looking at Oscars cheeky smile, bravery and determination, we managed to pull our strength together again.  From that moment of fear and confusion, we as a family became stronger than ever. Oscar reminded us how to fight again and just how courageous he is. Not once has he shown weakness, nor has he ceased to amaze us throughout the most dficult times and that to us is a true warrior. Oscar is a fun, loving, energetic five-year-old boy who deserves to live to the full alongside the other troopers fighting such horric diseases. Not only does he need to enjoy a normal le a child should live, he now needs someone  to save him.

And this was doubled when they found out they were expecting twin boys - Harry and Elijah. But then, just two years later, when they discovered they were about to become mum and dad a second time round they couldnt believe it when they were told they were having a SECOND set of twins .The family is now made up of Jessica, Liam, Harry and Elijah, aged two, and their twin girls, Phoebe and Aria, who arrived last September. Both the pregnancies were unplanned and medics told them the chances of having twin boys followed by girls was rarer than being struck by lightening.   And while the pair never imagined theyd have two sets of twins this early in le, they say they wouldnt change a thing and their perfect family feels complete. Proud Jessica, from Deal, Kent, said: It might not be what we had planned when we first met but weve got our whole family done and dusted in the space of a few years. Two boys, two girls, two sets of twins - its just the perfect package. Were the perfect family to me and it feels meant to be. It was four unexpected babies, but now I wouldnt change it for the world. Chef Liam added: To think that Im a dad of four does feel pretty crazy.   People my age are usually living at home with their mum and dad, just thinking about going out or going to uni. Having them has made me want to do more in my le. It makes me want to make them proud. The pair met at work in Wetherspoons four years ago, aged , and admit they werent very good with contraceptives. Bar manager Jessica broke the first pregnancy news to Liam by joking she would have to buy him a Fathers Day card. But while they both have twins in their families, they never imagined theyd have twins until they saw two shapes on the sonogram at the  week scan. The pair admit le was crazy while they got used to Harry and Elijah, who arrived via c-section, on February , , at  weeks, weighting lb oz, and lb oz. Jess said: Id only just got used to the idea of having one baby when I found out it was two.  It was a bit overwhelming. I wanted boys so I was glad to find out it was boys. I do feel like now with the girls I appreciate them being babies more. With the boys I think I was just getting used to being a mum so it felt I was always trying to keep up - doing one thing then the next then the next, whether it was nappies or bottles. But now I know they are fine, I know what Im doing. This time I know what to do. The couple confess they were happy as a family of four and had no plans to have more children. But Jessica found out she was pregnant again just after her sons had turned two and the couple said they were pleased to be having one more. She went to the scan with Liams sister - and just a few moments in realised it was twins when she saw the two little blobs. Liam said: Even the second time it was % a surprise. Jessica added: My first words were oh no, not again. As soon as we told people they thought we were joking nobody would believe us. It wasnt until I put a photo of the scans of both of them on Facebook that I think people really believed us.Jessica had heart issues and fainting episodes during the pregnancy. Doctors made the decision to perform a C-section early. Phoebe and Aria were born on September , six weeks early both weighing lb oz. Both sets of twins are non identical. Liam said: In some ways it has been easier with four than two. With the boys, because we had just got together and we were so young, Jessica would get looks. Now were been together, got the boys, got a house and were settled. But having said that, when you have two toddlers and two newborns, it is a lot to get your head around.  People do still stare, but I think weve got used to it. Jessica said the boys love being big brothers, and have become very protective of their little sisters. She added: Bringing the girls home to the boys was a lovely moment. The boys are really good with them. The first couple of days it was a bit of a novelty, but we soon found our feet. The boys will run around and help, fetching nappies or things, and they are very protective and loving. The other day Harry had a little go at me because I picked up Aria and she started to cry and told me to put her down. They are really good big brothers. With the first twins we hadnt been together long. But this time around weve done it before and we were strong, so people were much more congratulatory. In some ways it has been easier. We had done it all before, we knew roughly how much it was going to cost and we were more prepared. The best thing I learned was to get in as much sleep as possible before they arrived and I started going to bed at about pm because I knew that I wasnt going to get long lie ins for a very long time!

An electronic restriction will apply to all cars made from mid- onwards. The Swedish firm, bought by Chinese firm Zhejiang Geely in , has long had a reputation for prioritising road safety. Volvo is believed to be the first carmaker planning to install the cap across its range however police vehicles will be exempt. The general speed limit for motorways in EU member states is -mph . Germany does not have a general cap for motorways but recommends a speed of up to mph. In a statement Volvo said the electronic restriction focused on driver behaviour because mechanical solutions alone could not ensure safety.   Speeding remained one of the main contributors to road deaths, Volvo said, along with drug and drink intoxication and mobile phone use. Haringkan Samuelsson, Volvo’s president and chief executive, said: “While a speed limitation is not a cure-all, it’s worth doingwe can even save one le. We want to start a conversation about whether carmakers have the right or maybe even an obligation to install technology in cars that changes their driver’s behaviour.”   Volvo said it is also looking at ways to address the problems of driving while distracted or intoxicated. It said it will present plans for technology to address those problems later this month. The European Union is considering requiring whats known as Intelligent Speed Assistance on new cars sold there by . That equipment would require cars to have technology that would make them comply with speed limit signs. However, with the UK having left the European Union by then, it is unclearthat would work on British roads.

Guests are nicely boozed, but not sloppy drunk. Theres often laughter and tears and, of course, a chilled glass of bubbly.On occasion, however, the speeches are memorable for all the wrong reasons. Just ask this seriously disgruntled bride... The bride in question got married last Saturday and her maid of honour, her sister, gave a long speech which got her booted out of the wedding.   So how bad was it  Decide for yourself...Taking to Reddit , the bride said: During her speech, she brought up her depression and how my husband supported her through it and how in that moment, I knew he was the one for me... .I thought her speech was really selfish. I think its super inappropriate to bring up a mental illness during a wedding speech. Not only that, but the entire speech was about her. At MY wedding. Ninety per cent of the guests congratulated her afterwards and talked about how strong she was.   Nobody was paying attention to me, at my own wedding! SorryI sound selfish, but in my opinion there is a time and a place for this sort of thing. So after the guests all greeted her, I asked her to leave and told her she was being disruptive and selfish. She was really upset but just left without arguing. My parents agree with me. But my husband and all of my close friends think I was way too harsh. If the bride was after tea and sympathy, she was barking up the wrong tree. While some people did agree the sister had made a bit of a bad move, plenty of others called the bride out for how she handled it.  The lack of compassion for mental illness is also quite apparent in both the bride and her parents, one comment read. Someone  added: Also, does she not realise this is now the one thing people will remember about her wedding  How she went all jealous gorilla and locked her sister out. Like, wow. Theyre gonna talk about this for years. She seems more upset not every second was focused on her than about the speech itself, another comment agreed. Maybe her sister didnt give the best speech of the year but she certainly doesnt sound disruptive.

Minutes later the aircraft disappeared from air traffic control radar screens. Military radar managed to track the flight, which had deviated massively from its flight path, for another hour. But  miles into the journey, the plane copletely disappeared with all  people - including mothers, fathers and children - on onboard presumed dead. The search for flight MH has been one of the most expensive in aviation history.In the five years since the devastating tragedy just a few pieces of debris have washed up with the mystery of what happened to the plane still to be solved. But what really happened on the doomed flight and where is the plane now  Crashed in the Cambodian jungle  Independent aviation expert Daniel Boyer claims the plane came down in the middle of the Cambodian jungle.Daniel came to his conclusion using Google maps and insists the blue marks on the images are MHs jet outer fuselage.He was so confident that he had found thee xact crash site, he sent an expedition to where he believes the plane is about  miles west of Cambodias capital of Phnom Penh. Daniel says the unit were unable to reach the crash sit because team members were at risk of dehdration or even death. But he insists the mission wasnt a waste as he claims the team chatted to locals who saw the jet and its dragon-like emblem as it fell from the sky. Daniel told The Star: I have been able to identy several parts from what could be the plane. The debris definitely needs to be investigated.” Plane was shot down  Private investigator Noel OGara believes the plane was shot out of the sky by accident on the orders of the Malaysian government. Noel, from Ireland, has spent the last four years looking into what happened on March , . He believes the plane is still lying at the bottom of the ocean but has not ruled out it being secretly removed by the Malaysian government. The investigator says he has spoken to several eyewitnesses who saw the plane cash out of the sky. Oil worker, Mike McKay, from New Zealand, says MH was travelling eastbound when it sppeared ason fire when it was hit by the sunlight from the east and then it fell away as it descended again. Late Dalelah told Noel she thinks she saw the plane as she was flying home from a Hajj pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia. She told the investigator she saw the plane on the sea. A burning plane was also seen by Katherine Tee who was heading to Phuket in Thailand. And Malaysian fisherman are also said to have told Noel they saw the wreckage of a burning plane hit the sea off Kota Bharu. Noel now believes MH was shot down by fighter pilots, convicted it had been hijacked by terrorists. Nowhere near official search site  A satellite engineer claims to have found the flight - and its nowhere near the official search site. Yao Ming, who is studying satellite engineering at Stanford University in the US, believes the plane crshed just off the eastern coast of Vietnam,He told the: One very possible outcome which has been instantly disregarded are the coordinates off the Vietnamese coast where MH was apparently tracked.Yao has said he used algebra to determine where the plane is most likely to have gone down. But his theory goes against the report from the official investigation, which said the plane didnt make it as far as that location. Murder suicide theory  Canadian aviation expert, Larry Vance, isists the plane was crashed deliberately. Larry claims he is certain that either Capt Zaharie Ahmad Shah or co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid stole the plane in what he termed a criminal event. Vance, formerly of the Transportation Safety Board of Canada, told CBC News: It’s not an accident. This was planned and conducted, carried out by one inidual who had control of the aeroplane via his job to have control of the plane. He claimed that the pilot or co-pilot made the decision to take it to a remote part of the ocean and make it disappear forever. But his theory has been dismissed by those linked to the case. Sound waves show where plane is  British mathematician, Dr Usama Kadri, a professor at Cardf University, believes the plane either crahsed a few hundre miles off the coast of Madagascar, or further north in the India Ocean. Neither places are areas where searches have been carried out. Using data from the hydrocaustic microphones aboard the aircraft, Kadri believes he’s managed to pick up sound waves made by the plane’s impact from beneath the water. The results could also indicate MH deviated from its designated flight path, but the professor said that  minutes of recordings from the microphones have mysteriously disappeared.  The waves, Kadri says, carry “vital information on the source of impact, before dissipating.” When MH crashed into the Indian Ocean, three underwater ‘hydrophones’ were active onboard. One of the microphones, called HAs, is currently being held at Diego Gracia, a US bomber base in Chagos Archipelago. It’s this missing data from this microphone that Kadri believes holds the key to solving the mystery. MH is in key unsearched location  It has been widely accepted that the plane is somewhere in the Indian Ocean. But one author, who has written about the disaster, says he believes the jet could be in Kazakhstan, an area that has not been searched. Jeff Wise, who wrote The Plane That Wasnt There, said: f the plane went north, hijackers might have landed in some remote location and the passengers could still be alive. “If the plane went south, the only destination was a watery grave. “But of yet there was no clear way to distinguish between the two options. It can be seen underwater  One conspiracy theorist believes he has found an image of the plane underwater off the coast of Padang, Indonesia. The location is around an hours flight from where MH took off from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in March .The posts unnamed author, publishing on worldpronews , said the plane could be underwater and, therefore, could be MH.However, he could not rule out the possibility of it simply being another plane coming in to land above the water.  The conspiracy theorist wrote: Just putting this out there, whatthis was the MH after all this time  Some will say its just an aircraft coming in for landing caught on satellite, some may say this is just a bogus post. But just imagine the aircraft came in for a slow soft water landing, in calm waters which is below the radar and they knew it was there for a rescue job. If you do a calculation of its size via google tools, its about  to m long on top of the water. I am not too sure for the formula to calculate its size say at -m depth of water. Someone may know it. Huge cargo of lithium batteries on board  The official report confirmed that there was a huge haul of lithium batteries being carried below deck on the doomed flight. It had long been speculated the consignment of lithium batteries below deck could have been responsible for a fatal fire on board. The lithium ion batteries had been manufactured and packed in Penang, north-west Malaysia - and they were too big to fit through X-ray machines installed at Kuala Lumpar at the time. Investigators eventually concluded it was highly improbable the batteries brought down the plane, but the report reveals crucial new detail about the unusual cargo. The batteries did NOT undergo security screening at the factory, although they were inspected by customs officials. And the .-volt batteries were loaded onto flight MH without going through any screening because Kuala Lumpar airport did not have X-ray scanners big enough. Larger scanners were installed in the months after the tragedy. Plane turned round and could have been hijacked  Instead of going straight to Bejing the plane made a right turn then a left turn and went in a south-westerly direction, according to the official report. Investigators confirmed the turn-back was because of manual control and not down to the mechanical systems. Lead investigator Kok Soo Chon said: We cannot establishthe aircraft was flown by anyone other than the pilot, but we cannot exclude the possibility of unlawful interference by a third party. He stressed there was no evidence it had been hijacked. The CIA know where MH is  Former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad believes the CIA know the location of the missing plane. In a blog he claimed that: Clearly Boeing and certain agencies have the capacity to take over uninterruptible control of commercial airliners of which MH B is one. Someone is hiding something. It is not fair that MAS and Malaysia should take the blame. The -year-old claimed in the post, back in , thatthe plane had been hijacked control could have been taken back remotely. Did it land on a US military base  There have been persistent rumours that MH landed on the remote US air base in Diego Garcia. America has repeatedly denied this is the case. Alien abduction Social media conspiracy theorists were soon claiming the plane and all on board were the victims of an alien abduction. It was hijacked remotely  Historian Norman Davies believes tech developed in the aftermath of the   attacks could have been used to hijack the plane. Developed to prevent another atrocity, he claims the technology could have been used to cyber hijack the plane. Norman told The Sunday Times that MH could have been carrying sensitive Chinese information. He added: There are reports that the cargo detailed in the manest didn’t add up. I don’t know what it might have been carrying but it may have been carrying something somebody didn’t want to get to China.” Russia knows where the plane is  One of the volunteer investigators probing what happened to MH claims Russian President Vladimir Putin knows eactly what happened to the aircraft. Andre Milne says Putin knew then plane had landed in the Bay of Bengal in the Indian Ocean and that the wreckage had been seen by Russian satallites. He told the Daily Star: The reason President Putin did not raise his hand and march in and say we found it is because technically he would have been admitting committing espionage. Extra passenger  Could a mystery passenger have taken control of MH and downed it into the sea  It has been claimed there were officially  passengers on board and  crew, and yet  people are presumed dead. Andre said: The extra passenger likely acted in conjunction with larger external operational support to take full command and control of the cockpit of MH. But the official investigation insists there was simply an error with the number of passengers and there were actually  on board. Fault with the plane The US aviation watchdog had flagged problems with Boeing  six months before MH went missing. They claimed the faults could cause a catastrophic drop in pressure or even break up mid-air. Just two days before MH vanished the Fedral Aviation Administration issued a final warning when a -inch crack was found in the fuselage of one of the jets. Another Bermuda Triangle  Conspiracy theorists have raised the point that the area MH is believed to have vanished from is on the exact opposite side of the world to the Bermuda Triangle However, this isnt quite right. The exact opposite would be much closer to the Caribbean rather than Bermuda. Words greatest mystery theory Ex Australian Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, claimed on the third anniversary of the tragedy that that pilot had simply wanted to create the worlds grestest mystery. He said: I have always said the most plausible scenario was murder-suicide andthis guy wanted to create the worlds greatest mystery why wouldnt he have piloted the thing to the very end and gone further south  Then there was the analysis that suggested there might be a prospective placA murder suicide had been ruled out early in the investigation but investigative journalist Mark Williams-Thomas does not agree with this. He claims part of a wing found on Reunion Island could only have been in the position it wasthe pilot had been operating the plane when it went down. North Korea is to blame  A few people have claimed North Korea is the missing link in what happened to MH. The country is one of the most secretive in the world. There have been claims that just three days before MH vnished a Chinese plane was reportedly passing through the trajectory of a North Korean missile just seven minutes after it was fired. Murdered diplomat The Honorary Malaysian Consul in Madagascar Zahid Raza, who had spent years investigating what happened to MH, was shot dead in Madagascar in . People working with him on the investigation claimed he had received death threats and seemed to have been deliberately taregted. Official report The team has been unable to say categorically what happened to flight MH.

Myself and a mate were looking for somewhere to watch the tennis and, by chance, we met up with Pat and a few other United fans,” he said. “We had a good bit of banter and we’ve kept in touch since.”The friendship with Pat and other United fans actually led to the formation of a unique supporters’ club, the BeeArabs, so when Steve was planning his latest charity bike ride, this seemed an obvious route to take.“We thought it would be a good idea to start at Tannadice and head for Grfin Park. I had actually planned it as a practice run before I cycle from London to Paris and back via Guernsey in the summer, but this might be an even bigger task.“That said, my biggest challenge could be surviving the weekend with Pat before I set off on the bike!”Once he’s on his way, Steve will complete the journey in stages and take in Brentford games at Middlesbrough and Sheffield United before arriving at Grfin Park just in time for the clash with West Brom later this month.And thanks to the support he’s already receiving, he hopes to pass a personal milestone with his fund- raising efforts.“I got into cycling a few years back and I’ve done a charity ride to Amsterdam to raise money. It’s a great way to stay fit and, by the time I’ve completed this journey, I should have raised around £, in all for a few charities, so that’s not bad.“I am loving the support I am getting from all in Dundee. It’s overwhelming how many nice people there are from Dundee to Durham, Hartlepool to Leeds, Sheffield to London.”"},{"url":null,"title":"comeback kid paul mcmullan set for new dundee united deal","story":"Paul McMullan’s rebirth as a Dundee United player is set to be confirmed with a new contract for next season.As recently as last August, the former Celtic kid was told he was free to find a new club.At that time Partick Thistle were showing a strong interest but he decided to stay on and fight for his place at Tannadice.And since Robbie Neilson took over as manager in October, the -year-old has made  appearances and is again seen as a part of the squad.McMullan was signed up by Ray McKinnon in the summer of  and was a regular until falling out of favour under Csaba Laszlo early this season.Under the current boss, however, he’s played his part in United hauling themselves back into the Championship promotion race."},{"url":null,"title":"dundee business owner accused of 18000 vat evasion","story":"A businessman accused of avoiding paying more than £, in VAT had his case continued.Iain Wilson, , of Inchyra Place, is accused of evading VAT at Staffa Place and where between April  and October .He allegedly pretended to HMRC officers he paid VAT on goods and received VAT on sales and produced documents he knew to be , receiving £, in a rebate.He willto court on March ."},{"url":null,"title":"dundee duo set up bakery specialising in birthday cakes for dogs","story":"Two Dundee friends have opened a bakery specialising in making birthday cakes for dogs.Cheryl Walker, , and Amy Plummer, , have been inundated with orders since opening Dundee Dog Kitchen – sparking what they hope will be a new trend in the pet world.Cheryl, who lives in Fintry, said she had the idea after struggling to find a fresh cake for her own collie Tess’s first birthday.She said: “I wanted to throw Tess a party and give her a big treat.“I wanted to get her a cake but I couldn’t find anything.“I ended up ordering a cake online which came wrapped in cellophane and had a six-month shelf le – there just wasn’t anyone making anything fresh.”Cheryl and Amy joined forces to fill the gap in the market and opened their pet bakery in December.Their cakes are sugar-free and are packed with carrots, yoghurt, honey, peanut butter and other healthy ingredients which are all locally produced and contain health benefits for the dogs.Amy, who lives in Lochee, said: “We get a mixed reaction when we tell people what we’re doing, but dog lovers are very enthusiastic about it.“It’s taken off really quickly which is all a bit bizarre but very exciting.”Pet owner Imogen Hynd, , couldn’t wait to get a special carrot cake made for her black Labrador Skye on her first birthday.Imogen, of Broughty Ferry, said: “We wanted to mark the occasion because we love her to bits – she’s our little fur baby.“She’s part of the family.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14072284.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_IBP_AYP_130718SAUL_06JPG.jpg","title":"familys new hope 85000 raised","story":"NewsFamilys new hope as £, is raised to send son to America for cerebral palsy treatmentThe six-year-old will be heading to America after the huge sum of money was raised to fund his treatment.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  MAR NewsSaul with brothers Clay and Mylo and mum and dad, Karen and Stuart \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA family’s bid to help their son walk again is set for take-off. Little Saul Wylie will travel to America for le-changing treatment on his severe form of cerebral palsy. The six-year-old, who weighed just lb at birth, has made the waiting list for pioneering surgery. There has been a massive charity effort across Ayrshire to fund the trip, with pound, raised in little over six months.Mum Karen, , told the Ayrshire Post : “To achieve this so quickly is beyond our wildest dreams.“We set a target of two years to get the money but the community reaction has been incredible.” Saul, of Tarbolton, has to go to the States because his aggressive condition is not treated on the NHS. The brave kid lives with spastic diplegia cerebral palsy, which affects his muscle tone and leaves him unable to walk unaided. Karen said: “Saul’s dream is to be able to stand by himself and take independent steps and maybe even one day walk around school with his friends. “Like every parent, we long for endless opportunities for our boy. “Saul is very happy and determined but we just want him to have the best opportunity at a better quality of le and to become as independent as possible.”  Medication, Botox, and even trampoline therapy have all been used to try and limit Saul’s pain. But his spot at St Louis Children’s Hospital in Missouri could be the ultimate answer. Karen said: “The operation is called selective dorsal rhizotomy, which will reduce Saul’s muscle stfness. “Added to intensive rehab, it will allow Saul to stand independently and potentially walk again. Unfortunately there is a waiting list for international patients so Saul’s surgery is not scheduled until . “But because we are in a position to go we have been put on their cancellation list and are keeping our fingers crossed.” Karen and husband Stuart have thrown themselves into a string of fundraising events with the ‘Steps For Saul’ campaign gathering momentum. Karen said: “We’ve done everything from coffee mornings to quiz nights and we can’t thank people enough for their response. “There have been skyes, race nights, sponsored cycles and I also did the Great Scottish Run. “People have taken Saul to their hearts and we’ve even had donations from as far afield as America, New Zealand, Canada and Ireland. “Hopefully he now has the chance he deserves.” • An open ice skate for Saul will take place at Ayr Ice Rink on Sunday, April , from -pm.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnDrugsCerebral palsyCharityAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14082974.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/2_SexBeast.jpg","title":"hmv re opens three scottish","story":"NewsHMV re-opens three Scottish stores after successful negotiations with landlordsThe companys managing director confirmed the move was \"the best outcome for our staff and customers\".ShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsGeneral view of HMV at Ayr Central\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMusic giant HMV has re-opened its shop in Ayr Central shopping centre.

South Ayrshire Council’s attempts to open a pound million market have been hit by more inactivity. Bosses claim they are now targeting a May opening date – almost two years later than scheduled. Officials this week admitted they had suffered “signicant delays” in their bid to reopen the former Clydesdale Bank and Suburbia Bar. An initial revival date of September  was promised when council chiefs began their transformation of the site. Last February former Ayr Renaissance boss David Bell said: David Bell said: “Work is scheduled to be complete in late spring this year, when we’ll open the ground floor as a market square to help create a busy new attraction for Ayr town centre.” But the finished article has never materialised. The ill-fated Renaissance team bought the building in March  with a view to breathing new le into the bottom end of the town. The site is where farmers sold their corn to merchants from the s to . And the vision for a new market was formulated to hark back to Ayr’s glorious status as county town. A council spokesman admitted: “There have been signicant delays to this project. However, we are committed to opening the market and events space as quickly as possible for the people of Ayr and beyond. “We have a short specialist fit-out contract to complete, which should be ready for the start of May so that the building can be used for markets and events from the summer.” Ayr councillor Martin Dowey said: “It has been one sorry excuse after another with this building and frankly the people of Ayr and beyond deserve far better.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnClydesdale BankSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"sleazy oap 72 who took","story":"NewsSleazy OAP, , who took pics of Ayr schoolgirls in mini-skirts told youre guilty all day longRetired architect Ross McKay was told by a sherf he \"should be able to control\" himself at his age.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsRoss Mackay was placed on the sex offenders register \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA pensioner who took pictures of schoolgirls in mini skirts will be on the sex offenders’ register for the next three years, writes Edwin Lawrence. Sleazy retired architect Ross McKay will also be kept under court supervision for the same period. McKay, , insisted he was innocent of the sordid behaviour but he was found guilty after a trial last month. Sherf John Montgomery told McKay: “You have been convicted of conduct which, in my estimation, contains a substantial sexual element and a signicant sexual aspect by clandestinely taking photos of female schoolgirls wearing short skirts. “At  years of age you really should be able to control yourself more appropriately than you have done by indulging in this sort of behaviour.” Sherf Montgomery warned McKay: “I detect an air of defiance from you, both at your trial and in what you have told the author of your criminal justice social work report. “My advice to you is keep a low profile. Do not put yourself in a position where it can be construed you have the aim of self-gratication.” Defence lawyer Gillian McBlane successfully argued against the imposition of a stringent sex offender prevention order against her client. This was requested by depute fiscal Vicky McMillan, and would have kept McKay out of public parks and well away from schools.   Ms McBlane said: “He is first offender and there is little to suggest he presents a signicant risk to the public.” Sherf Montgomery reminded her: “He continues to deny responsiblility.” But Ms McBlane maintained: “He very much recognises the authority of the court and he has assured me of his commitment to any order you might impose.” McKay, of Ardlochan Terrace in Maidens, insisted at his trial that he had not taken the photos of Belmont Academy schoolgirls in mini skirts that were found on his phone. He also denied stopping his car in Peggieshill Road to take the images, although the court heard evidence of a vehicle with the same registration as McKay’s parked there. The offences took place in mid- and again in March .

Bernard Cotton was at Alloway Bowling Club when he collapsed and died on Thursday last week. He had been club champion on ious occasions, the last time in . But it was as manager of the Gaiety from  to  that Bernard made his biggest impact. He took over at a critical time when the theatre’s ownership passed from the Popplewell family to the Royal Burgh of Ayr. But Bernard was the perfect man for the job, having managed the Empire Theatre in his home town of Sunderland. There he had hosted shows featuring The Beatles and Hollywood legend Marlene Dietrich. “He even shared a McEwan’s Export with Marlene,” said son Sam, . “They didn’t have any champagne to give Marlene so she had what dad was drinking - only with ice.”. Bernard was no ordinary theatre manager and often directed big showpiece events like pantos and summer season shows. He quickly became respected by some of the biggest names on the Scottish scene. He booked acts like Jimmy Logan, Billy Connolly, Rikki Fulton, Jack Milroy and perennial Gaiety favourite Johnnie Beattie. Bernard also knew some of the biggest UK stars, bringing Ken Dodd, Barbara Windsor, Pat Phoenix and Lionel Blair to the Gaiety.  He did not shy away from tough decisions, booking the controversial erotic revue ‘Oh! Calcutta!’ in . He later recalled: “It brought much adverse publicity and even the poster was frowned upon - to such an extent that the management agreed to cover over the female posterior that was displayed upon it.” However, the show was a massive financial success with only two unsold seats in a week-long run. Sam remembers his dad sharing a story of a couple walking out of the show in high dudgeon. Bernard asked them why, as it had been advertised as an X-rated show. The shocked couple told him they thought they had booked to see ‘Oklahoma!’. Another of Bernard’s controversial - but highly successful - bookings was ‘The Rocky Horror Show’, which attracts enthusiastic fans who often dress in stockings, corsets and suspenders. For although Bernard principally ran a family theatre, he believed it should cater for all tastes. A post on the Gaiety Facebook page says: “We are deeply saddened to hear about the loss of Bernard Cotton, a much loved colleague, dedicated family man and friend to all. “Bernard was and is a Gaiety institution, from his own time managing our Old Lady to helping us shape her future. We simply couldn’t have done it without his support. “His guidance, golden nuggets from years gone by, witty humour and love for delivering high-quality theatre for all were second to none. He will be sorely missed by us all. “At this sad time we are thinking of his beloved we Vida and children Julia and Sam. “We wish them moments of peace and comfort as they remember a husband, father and friend who was so cherished. “He will forever be in our hearts and minds and will always have a place in his beloved theatre.”  Musician Martin Henderson commented: “Bernard was witty, professional and a family man, a privilege to have worked for many years in the Gaiety while Bernard and Vida were at the helm. “He ran a tight ship but embraced risky ventures like our annual mock panto, which needs no explanation to Gaiety staff. A sad loss to Scottish theatre and his family.” Journalist Alistair Nicol said: “I met Bernard when I was deputy editor of the Ayrshire Post in  and he was always helpful and a great inspiration to all around him in the entertainment world.” Bernard Cotton was a former president of the Rotary Club of Ayr He is survived by we Vida, a stalwart Gaiety volunteer who formerly ran the theatre’s costume department London-based daughter Julia, , a former dancer and Brighton-based son Sam.

and a foot-tapping reminder of the swinging sexism of the late s.For anyone who enjoys those wonderful kitchen-sink dramas of the decade - A Taste of Honey, Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, or Poor Cow - this is for you.Although, in fairness, at times it feels more Sid James than Shelagh Delaney as the humour and slapstick of Carry On provide plenty of laughs.And for anyone, like myself, who doesnt already know Made in Dagenham the Musical, dont despair... the songs, like the early Ford Cortinas, are instantly adorable.Kirsty Cleland has all the allure of a young Rita Tushingham as she enchants, enthrals and entertains in the lead role.As a strike-leader and long-suffering we, the Galashiels actress is both convincing and commanding.And the ever-reliable Stuart Mitchell, who plays hard-done-by husband Eddie, has to be at the top of his game not to be outshone.But, in true socialist fashion, Made in Dagenham the Musical isnt just about the leads... everyone has their part to play - and how well they play it.Tracy Borthwick is having a blast as the potty-mouthed Beryl.And Amanda Blacklock is pitch perfect as the hapless Clare who attempts to keep up with the flow of double-entendres.Ellen McFadzen, with her Viv Nicholson hair-style and shortening mini-skirts, is a delight as sassy Sandra.And the shopfloor resolve is perfectly pitched by Ellen Halliday, as Cassie, and Julie Craig, as Connie.Relationships, friendships and even governments are tested in this factual story which, historically, helped females eventually earn an equal footing when it came to filling up pay packets.Robin Murray could challenge Mike Yarwood with his hilarious performance as Harold Wilson.And hes regularly brought down a peg or two by the feisty Rachel Inglis as Barbara Castle.Made in Dagenham the Musical is a battle of the classes as much as the sexes, with Jodie Millar and Yvonne Mitchell providing some gentried grace.The dialogue is a delight, the foot-to-the-floor pace is perfect, and the choreography, costumes, straight from Carnaby Street, and score makes sure this is a production that will strike a chord for decades to come.But for any musical production to be a success, it needs songs.From the brilliant opening scene, this show doesnt disappoint.Busy Women, Everybody Out and Viva Eastbourne are nothing other than tremendous encore numbers that bring out the very best of this talented cast.But perhaps the highlights are Julie Craigs sensational take on the riveting Same Old Story, Rachel Inglis reaching the high notes in the incredible Ideal World, and the delightful duet of Stuart Mitchell and Kirsty Cleland with the making-up masterpiece Im Sorry, I Love You.Made in Dagenham the Musical is a celebration of women fighting for their rights.While it succeeds, this move away from the comfort zone is more of a testament to just how good Selkirk Musical Theatre Company has become.If you havent yet got your tickets... join the picket line quickly and dont be disappointed.Made in Dagenham the Musical runs every night this week at .pm with an additional matinee performed on Saturday at pm.CASTRita OGrady -

So far,  volumes of Hoggrsquos work have been collected, and  have been published.The project started in the mid s and the estimated finishing date wonrsquot be till .The programme of events is still in the planning stage and the organisers are currently raising money to hold the celebrations around the Borders and in Stirling.They are currently applying to ious sources for a six-figure sum to

Now, with less regulation in place, there are thousands.’True to the name, Viola FC is a family-run agency # his son Johnny joined its ranks in early  # with their main work both in representing players coming to the UK, and ‘brokering’.John explained: ‘We mostly represent footballers transferring to the UK, while brokering involves working with clubs, players and other agents to help bring those players here.‘That said, we have done a lot of work in countries such as Brazil and China in recent years, where there is a huge appetite for football. You make valuable contacts and get to see some exciting players.’However, for John the image of the football agent thrashing out a lucrative deal for himself as well as for the player, fails to tell the whole story.He explained: ‘Of course working in football can be financially rewarding, but it’s a hard job. People think you’re just walking around in a suit with a laptop and phone, but so much goes into being a player representative.‘You need to travel a lot, and that means lots of airport lounges and hotel rooms.‘You’re working long days and doing lots behind the scenes, and all year round,  because that’s what it takes.‘The public see the excitement of the transfer windows on TV and then think that’s all agents do.‘If an agent does their job properly, they are available day and night, looking after the whole package for the player, like houses and children’s schooling.‘We’re more than a ‘necessary evil’, we do an important service for both the club, and the player.’Thinking about Campbeltown visits again, John brings up a memorable trip to the Wee Toon, where his son Johnnybecame an unofficial pool champ.John said: ‘My uncle John took us to the Commercial Inn to watch a game of football on the TV. Johnny was only young but he ‘won’ a pool competition in the pub.‘Of course, the adults had let him win, but he believed for about ten years he was the pool champion of Campbeltown!‘That’s just one but I have lots of good memories of visiting Campbeltown, and the surrounding areas, such as Machrihanish.#For me Kintyre is a special part of Scotland.’Reflecting on a career in football of more than  years, including representing many Celtic and Rangers players, his hunger as an agent remains.John, whose recent travels include talent-scouting missions to Portugal and Ghana, added: ‘I am blessed to do this job.

This was his first goal for the Pupils and just reward for his perseverance.It was good to see two teenagers making their mark for the club, with Ross Brown joining his academy teammate MacBrayne in a fine first half performance on opposite flanks of midfield.Nevertheless, the home side ‘stole’ into the lead in the st minute, a comic-cut situation that saw Ellis Robertson unbelievably penalised for stumbling over his own heels.The resultant free kick was delivered with venom and a headed deflection thundered into the net to restore the home side’s lead.The setback was short-lived as almost immediately the in-form Donald McCallum cut inside past two defenders to drive the ball high into the roof of the net for a superb equaliser.This heralded the Pupils# best spell of the match, with Ross Brown ending a great move with a volley that left the keeper rooted to the spot.But the goal, arguably the best of the match, was ruled out for offside.Ryan McConnachie was next to try his luck with an audacious overhead kick that just cleared the bar.Lady luck deserted the cause when the referee awarded a soft penalty kick to home club.The visitors were a goal behind despite dominating most of the second half.With  minutes remaining the league leaders looked to have sealed the points when a tactical long throw was forced home to give ‘the Port’ a two goal advantage.However, in an exciting end to another close fought match, Lee Allen scored a towering header from a Donald McCallum corner to make the score -.Despite a great effort in the closing minutes, the Pupils couldn’t score to get their just reward.Having played well and given everything, the visitors ed home with nothing to show for their efforts.TomorrowCampbeltown Pupilsto home action with another dficult match against third-placed Hillington at Kintyre Park with a pm kick off.  See social media and posters for confirmation of venue.Fraser MacBrayne in action earlier this season at Kintyre Park. _cpupils"},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane march 1 2019","story":"Ellen Sager, , from Tumbler Ridge, sent a letter to the Courier in August , asking for information about her Campbeltown-born grandfather, Thomas Douglas.Ellen said she knew very little except what her mother, Isabella, who emigrated to Canada in , had written in her grandmother Bessie’s obituary.It read that -year-old Bessie was the widow of Thomas Douglas, a lighthouse keeper who drowned at McArthur#s Head Lighthouse, Islay, in November , just nine months after Isabella was born.Ellen received two replies to her  request, from relatives who gave her the name and address of Robert Douglas, Thomas#s nephew, who was born in Campbeltown in  but moved to Australia in .Ellen said: #When I contacted Robert, he said he did not know that his uncle Thomas had a family.#I have been blessed to have many letters that Robert has written describing le in Campbeltown.

Such days are ones which have been borrowed from another month, and I think given the temperature and weather we have had recently the days have been borrowed from May.In , May will have borrowed Februaryrsquos days, so we can expect some unseasonal weather in that month as well, but in a dferent way.Sunday was a borrowed day for sure it was so mild and the later part sunny with a feeling of spring in the air. It was a perfect day for a discovery.We set off to find a place Irsquod only recently heard about. A friend had asked me what I knew about the lsquoKingrsquos Chairrsquo by Gullane. I had to admit that Irsquod never heard of it. He told me one of the holes at the golf course there has this name, but it seems it is named after a location nearby.This set me investigating. Sure enough, I found it marked on the map and searched for an image, which I found on a website called Ancient Stones: a large boulder, shaped like a throne, guarded by two other stones either side. It intrigued me and so our quest began.The starting point of our adventure was Gullane Beach car park. I knew roughly where to look but purposefully hadnrsquot brought the map so that we had a challenge to find the lsquochairrsquo. We knew what it looked like and that we needed to walk along the upper path, not the one that heads for the beach.We went the wrong way at first and got stuck in a mass of sea buckthorn, but on reflection that just added to the sense of adventure and achievement. We soon found our way and then suddenly there it was, up on Gullane Hill. The kids ran excitedly towards the stones, shouting: ldquoFound it, found it.I felt quite exhilarated at the discovery, and to be honest impressed by the sight of the Kingrsquos Chair. I can see how it got its name, as it looks something like a majestic reclining armchair. The two boulders on either side of it look like sentries keeping watch.The kids sat on it, of course, and I had to wait my turn after my we, who reckoned it could just as easily be a lsquoQueenrsquos Chairrsquo.When I finally got a chance to seat my majestic posterior on the chair, I realised the view was majestic as well, with Gullane Beach very visible in the near distance.I reflected on the fact we had recently visited Edinburgh Castle and seen the Stone of Destiny or Stone of Scone, along with the crown jewels. This rather uninspiring stone in Edinburgh Castle may be the coronation stone used for  years in England, but it is not, I am sure, the coronation stone used by ancient kings of Scotland, despite official claims that it is.I think itrsquos pretty clear that Edward I never got his hands on the real Stone of Destiny and I am convinced it has remained in Scotland, hidden somewhere, ever since. It occurred to me that this stone actually better fitted the early description of the original coronation stone at Scone than the one in Edinburgh Castle.ldquoImaginethis is the real Stone of Destiny and has been here all the time, I said fancully out loud. I know it isnrsquot, of course, but I have to saythis Kingrsquos Chair was on display at Edinburgh Castle it would certainly look more authentic.But sadly there seems to be no recorded tradition connected to this Kingrsquos Chair. I could find no story, or reference to the origin of its name. Perhaps some local people have some information on this There is an entry from the s that records the name, citing locals as the source, so there is some historic veracity in its title. But no suggestion is offered for the origin of the name, or any tradition associated with the stone. Its geology I could not say but it doesnrsquot seem to be a glacial erratic.And so we are left to wonder. We discussed how the stone got here and how it got its name. Maybe some children played here many generations ago and gave the boulder its title. Perhaps a Viking king who landed on Gullane Beach sat himself down on this natural throne to survey his warriors at their bloody work.Whatever the origin, the name, the location and the nature of the stone make this a worthwhile and fun discovery, even without a firm legend attached to it.And as I sat on the chair I watched smoke billowing from the coastline a little further to the west, close to the edge of Aberlady nature reserve. What caused the fire I didnrsquot know, but even from a distance it seemed destructive.It was a prophetic sight to witness from the Kingrsquos Chair. It looked like a burning coastline from a Viking raid. Thankfully the distant screech of fire engines told us help was on the way. The children wanted to go see the fire, but we kept our distance from the flames and let the firefighters do their job.So the trip to the Kingrsquos Chair had been an adventure in more ways than one. On our way back, the children advanced dferent theories about the origin of the name. It was universally agreed that a story must be made, but no agreement on the actual tale.ldquoPerhaps, I said, ldquowe should leave it to the imagination of those who search for and discover it, so they can sit and feel the power of the place and get ideas.My imagination was certainly ablaze. I saw the leader of the ancient Gododdin tribe, King Loth, sitting on the stone, looking out to the Firth as he watched his terried daughter in a small coracle being taken out to the open sea, his brutal punishment for her defiance of his authority.The story would fit as her journey began at Aberlady Bay, and so her small craft would have been seen from the Kingrsquos Chair as it passed by, being pulled out to sea by one of the kingrsquos boats.Itrsquos all a fancy of my imagination, of course, but thatrsquos my story.

Sinclair was the cinematic equivalent of a Postcard single, a walking rejection of all those old tired west of Scotland macho male stereotypes. Bella Bella. Julia SutherlandJulia Sutherland is a stand-up because she was forced to be. A former on-air sidekick to Fred MacAulay on his radio show, she was entered in a stand-up competition as a stunt for the show and ended up having to do five minutes of material. People laughed. She thought: I can do this and she has built a career on it ever since. You might have also heard her interviews with comedians on Radio .Julia Sutherland, New Material Night, Yesbar, March    and Exposed, The Stand, March  Lex McLeanMcLeans nickname was Sexy Lexy which was of course ironic, given the comic had a comfortable face on top of which to place his checked bunnet. But the last of the great music hall comedians always had the last laugh with great Pavilion Theatre gags such as \"To whoever stole my anti-depressants ndash I hope youre happy now.\" The Bodgers Absolutely: Jack Docherty, Gordon Kennedy, Moray Hunter and Peter BaikieThe quartet formed The Bodgers as school friends in Edinburgh and from this emerged Absolutely, the Channel Four comedy that bucked the trend by being a hit on TV then radio. Bred characters like rabbits, but most memorable have to be the stout men and women of Stoneybridge Town Council. If only Stoneybridge had been in charge of BrexithellipJack Docherty: Miekelson and McGlashan ndash Serious Men, Kings Theatre, March  Lynn FergusonFabulous Ferguson, from Cumbernauld, is an award winning writer, performer and stand-up. Now based in the US, running a storytelling coaching business, her first play was Heart and Sole, about a woman who falls in love with a fish. She joined the judging  for the International Emmys and hosted their Comedy Panel in New York. Her brother is comedian and talk show host Craig Ferguson. Arnold BrownIf stand-ups comedians were compiling this list, then therersquos every chance that Arnold Brown would be in the top ten such is his status among people who try to make other people laugh. Why did the Glaswegian not become a bigger star  Perhaps itrsquos because his slow style seemed too slow for television, but Brown was always best on a small stage: he built his reputation in smoky rooms and then, after the smoking ban, in non-smoky rooms and thatrsquos where hersquos continued to this day. If you donrsquot like alternative comedy, then Arnold Brown is one of the men you should blame. Rhona CameronRazor-sharp Cameron, from Dundee, is a stand up comic and writer who shot to fame in  after winning Channel rsquos So You Think Yoursquore Funny  She co-wrote and starred in Rhona, a sitcom about a lesbian Scot living alone in London, which was shown in . She played the first ever female narrator in The Rocky Horror Show. Susan CalmanFormerly a lawyer, Calman switched to stand-up in , and became a regular on  shows and comedy dramas like Fresh Meat. But it was her sparkling appearance on Strictly Come Dancing that made her a household name. Asked, once, when she was happiest, she said, ldquoGenuinely ndash and my we, Lee, knows this ndash dancing with Kevin Clton on Strictly. Calman has also written about her depression, in Cheer Up Love, and joy, in Sunny Side Up: A Story Of Kindness And Joy. Emma ThompsonCan we claim her  Scots mother. House north of the border. Of course, we can. Thompson is best known for her serious turns these days, but she cut her teeth in the Cambridge Footlights, did TV sketch shows Alfresco and Thompson, and then gave us Suzi Kettles in Tutti Frutti. Andwersquore taking Emma, can we take sister SophieThompson too  Jonathan WatsonHis career stretches back to Naked Video and Local Hero, and he is best known for his -year sht on Only An Excuse, but Watson has come into his tragicomic own in Two Doors Down, where he and Doon Mackichan have turned Cathy and Colin into the Liz Taylor and Richard Burton of Glesga. John ByrnePaisley-born Byrne is best known as a painter but anyone who has seen it knows therersquos wit in his work ndash a wit that becomes even more apparent when he swaps canvas for paper and brush for pen. His autobiographical series of plays, the Slab Boys trilogy, is a landmark of late th century Scottish theatre . Meanwhile his cult status as a writer of small screen fare was assured the moment the credits rolled on the first episode of Tutti Frutti, the BAFTA-laden  series which starred Robbie Coltrane, Emma Thompson and Richard Wilson. Iain StirlingldquoBasically, said voice of Love Island, Iain Stirling, as he launched the new BBC Scotland channel last week, ldquoIrsquom the only comedian in Scotland who has managed to make his voice more recognisable than his actual face. Stirlingrsquos crazed, pantomimic, querulous voiceover has been the best thing about Love Island. His voice and face are now wanted all over.. Hersquos even a go-to for advice on the Millennial condition, which he doles out in his book Not Ready To Adult Yet: A Totally Ill-informed Guide To Le. Karen DunbarDunbar was a national treasure in the making right from when she arrived, nostrils-flaring, on our televisions in Chewin The Fat, delivering us classics like Fiona the lonely shopkeeper. Since then shersquos done just about everything from panto and stand-up, to Calendar Girls: The Musical, and a TED talk about comedy. Plus, hers was the voice that delivered the Commonwealth Games to the world, saying, ldquoThis is our house and youre all very welcome. Harry LauderWhen Harry Lauder met Charlie Chaplin in  it was one huge world star meeting another. Itrsquos sometimes forgotten that: just how big a star of music hall and comedy Harry Lauder was. Like Chaplin, Lauder passed the biggest test of comedy and entertainment there ever was: a loud, drunken audience in a music hall. Hersquod also entertained his fellow miners when he worked down the pits and his great skill was the comic song touched with pathos. He knew how to make people laugh but he knew how to cry as well: his son was killed on the Western Front during the First World War. Ken BruceYes, him off the radio. The trained chartered accountant from Glasgow is not, it is fair to say, a well kent face on the stand-up circuit, but his gently humorous, easy-osey manner on Radio  every morning makes everything all right with the world for millions. Jonathan Ross is a big fan. Rab Christie and Iain ldquoNoddy DavidsonPick a hit comedy series over the past two decades ndash Rab C Nesbitt, Still Game, Burnistoun, Scot Squad, Gary: Tank Commander, Chewinrsquo The Fat, Limmyrsquos Show ndash and chances are their names are on the credits. Christie is managing director of The Comedy Unit and Davidson a producer director. Danny BhoyAs you read this Daniel Danni Chaudhry is about to begin a huge tour of Australia and New Zealand where he is, by all accounts, ldquohuge. You can understand why. Originally from Moffat, he is a likeable, adroit purveyor of observational comedy. James FinlaysonEmigrated to America in  and made a living in theatre before moving to Hollywood where he became the fth Beatle to Laurel and Hardy. No-one has ever done a double take head move better than the boy from Larbert. Una McLeanScottish acting royalty McLean, from Strathaven in South Lanarkshire, can turn her hand to comedy sketch shows, panto, serious theatre and film. She is currently appearing in BBC Scotland drama series River City. Her career began at the Byre Theatre in St Andrews in  and in , she starred in Scotlands first one-woman television show, Did You See Una  Chic MurrayThe Godfather of surrealist comedy  Probably. Murray also had a free range style that allowed for music hall gags \"kippers ndash fish that like a lot of sleep\" and the rather more philosophical. \"Get into yourself to get yourself out of your self. Then try to lose yourself.\" They driest delivery this side of Gobi desert milk run also helped him sell surreal jokes such as \"I drew a gun. He drew a gun. I drew another gun. Soon we were surrounded by lovely drawings of guns.\" Most modern comedians worship at the altar of Murrays memory. Sanjeev KohliFor years Kohli, who as a youngster worked in his familyrsquos convenience stores, was the comic king of the cornershop, delivering us laugh after belly-laugh from behind a counter, as Navid Harrid, the grey-bearded shop-owner in Still Game, or as Ramesh Manju in award-winning, cult radio comedy Fags, Mags  Bags. Now a regular on River City, hersquos left the shop behind, playing banker-turned-baker AJ, and recently appeared in the biopic Stan And Ollie. Ivor CutlerIt was George Melly who maybe summed up the late Ivor Cutler best: ldquoVery funny in a sinister sort of way. The Scottish poet, songwriter and humourist grew up in a Jewish family in Govan, appeared in The Beatles film Magical Mystery Tour and was a favourite of John Peelrsquos. Proof that England doesnrsquot have a monopoly on eccentricity. Jerry SadowitzFew comedians dare take their stand-up to the places Sadowitz has been known to go, probably for good reason. The humour is as black as the trademark top hat, the material wince-inducingly controversial and the live shows chaotic and aggressive, meaning TV appearances have been rare . Despite this, the Glaswegian remains one of the most influential ndash and isive ndash stand-ups of the last  years. Bruce MortonBruce Morton did the best comedy show ever. March  at the MacBob in Stirling when he was touring Blood Below the Window, his autobiographical one-man show, which was hilar , but had a sucker punch of hurt at the heart of it. Apart from his dalliance with Channel  , Morton has always been too marginal a figure for his talent. But no one is better at hearing the comic music of the Scots tongue. Dorothy PaulThe undisputed Queen of Scottish comedy, the Dennistoun woman is as funny as she is loved by Glaswegians who love to be taken down memory lane to a world of jeely pieces and fumbles and the dancin. Paul convinced as an excellent actress in the likes of The Steamie, and more recently Still Game, but it was her live touring shows that revealed her glorious skills of holding an audience in the palm of her hand. Robert Florence and Iain ConnellThe duo behind sketch show Burnistoun brought us characters such as Jolly Boy John, Biscuity Boyle and Quality Polis, as well as co-writing the sitcom Legit which starred Clare Grogan, Jordan Young and Raymond Mearns. Florence will front topical satire series, The State of It, on the new BBC Scotland channel.Iain Connell: Work In Progress, Blackfriars Basement, March  and  Robert Florence is Biscuity Boyle: My Bastart Le - One Last Time!, Oran Mor, March  and  Ronni AnconaOne of the best impressionists of her generation, Ancona, who grew up in Troon, is also an accomplished stand-up and an impressive actor. But itrsquos her uncanny ability to capture everyone from Nigella Lawson to Audrey Hepburn, Victoria Beckham to Ruby Wax, Renee Zellweger to Jenner Saunders that continues to amuse. Scotland The WhatThe talented triumvirate of Buff Hardie, Stephen Robertson and George Donald ruled the North-eastin the s, s and early s with the now-neglected art of comedy revue. Dont miss the phone call to the Queen, inviting her to open Oldmeldrums sports day . Fern BradyFern Brady reached the finals of So You Think Youre Funny at the  Edinburgh Fringe and hasnt looked back since. The performer from Bathgate is bold, honest and at times startling ndash listen to her trashing of heterosexual marriages, or her take on Australias abortion laws ndash but never less than very funny. Whats not to like about a former journalist and stripper whos dryer than the inside of a sand lizardrsquos top lip and more blunt than the new Mary Poppins. Janet BrownThe Rutherglen-born actor and impressionist will always be best-known for her memorable impersonation of Margaret Thatcher at the height of her pomp, which cropped up throughout the s and s everywhere from Mike Yarwoodrsquos popular Saturday night show to Bond film For Your Eyes Only. Gerard KellyKelly, from Glasgow, was a panto favourite in the city and a talented serious actor, but his big break was as hapless bank worker and would-be author Willie Melvin in the BBC Scotland comedy City Lights. He was the lynchpin of a stellar cast . He died in  following a brain aneurysm. Jane McCarryShe steals the show as loveable busybody Isa Drennan on Still Game. As the hit BBC Scotland comedy bows out later this month, who wouldnrsquot love to see Isa and shopkeeper Navidget their own spin-off series  The campaign starts here. Robbie ColtraneColtranemade his name in the alternative comedy movement of the s before becoming a household name. He was brilliant as a criminal psychologist in Cracker he appeared in two Bond movies he was an outsize presence as Hagrid in the Harry Potter films. In the  C series National Treasure he was outstanding as Paul Finchley, an ageing comedian suddenly beset with allegations of historical rape and sexual assault. Richard WilsonIf you ever see Richard Wilson in the street, do not shout his catchphrase at him. In fact, donrsquot even think about the catchphrase. Yoursquore thinking about it now arenrsquot you  The thing is, Wilson was, and is, much more than catchphrase comedy. He once said that there was some of his dad in Victor Meldrew, star of One Foot in the Grave, and some of the writer David Renwick too, but the point is that, as he shakes his fist at idiocy, there is some of all of us in him. Arabella WeirShe coined the catchphrase \"Does my bum look big in this \" for The Fast Show, lit up our screens as long-suffering neighbour Beth in Two Doors Down and most recently had a star turn on comedy drama Pure as a mother whose OCD-suffering daughter is plagued by sexually explicit thoughts. Janey Godley and Ashley StorrieFrom Godleyrsquos ldquoTrump is a c*** sign held aloft as the US president visited his Ayrshire golf resort in  to Storriersquos hilarious parodies of Harry Potter, Game of Thrones and The Handmaidrsquos Tale becoming viral hits, this mother and daughter are fearlessly chipping away at comedyrsquos glass ceiling. Godleyrsquos Nicola Sturgeon Theresa May Big Soup Pot skits are on the money.In Conversation with Janey Godley, City of Glasgow College, March  Janey Godley:  Years  Counting, Oran Mor,March - Ashley Storrie: Hysterical is at The Stand Comedy Club, March  and  Greg McHughThe Edinburgh born actor struck comedy gold when he dreamed up the character of Gary McLintoch, a soldier with a fictional Scottish regiment who delivers bon mots in broad Embra in much-loved mockumentary Gary: Tank Commander. McHugh also starred in Channel rsquos Fresh Meat, written by Peep Show creators Jesse Armstrong and Sam Bain. He has since moved on to straighter roles ndash hersquos currently in Channel  spy drama Traitors and Skyrsquos A Discovery Of Witches ndash but donrsquot think wersquove seen the last of Corporal McLintoch. Alan Cumming and Forbes MassonDrama school pals Cumming, from Aberfeldy, and Masson, from Falkirk, performed as musical double act and Kelvinside men Victor and Barry throughout the s and s, before finding success separately on stage and screen here and in the US. They briefly reunited in similar guise for the sarcastic, surreal cabin crew comedy The High Le alongside Siobhan Redmond. Stanley BaxterStanley Baxter once cleared the streets with his television specials that attracted m but the Glaswegian suffered all his le from anxiety and a need to be in control. As a result, Stanley, who lives in North London, offered up product sparingly, the world having the opportunity to see his Dietrich or his Coward only episodically. What he has created however is an incredible Bafta-winning legacy. LimmyIf you like your comedy surreal with a good dash of daft, Glaswegian Brian Limond has been the go-to purveyor for more than a decade. Arguably the first true UK comedian of the internet age, Limmy grew a loyal local online audience with his strangely loveable band of characters ndash who could forget former heroin addict Jacqueline McCafferty or frustrated adventure gameshow host Falconhoof  ndash but has found national recognition thanks to TV, live shows and two books.Limmy, Surprisingly Down to Earth, and Very Funny, Oran Mor, March , ,  and  Alastair SimYou have to be very serious to be good at comedy and Alastair Sim was very serious, particularly about his stage career. But itrsquos the films we love. Like A Christmas Carol. Is Simrsquos the greatest Scrooge  Probably. Or Laughter in Paradise in which hersquos a good man forced to go bad to inherit some moneyAnd The Belles of St Trinians of course in which he plays the headmistress Millicent Fritton. British comedy finds pretty much nothing funnier than a man in a dress but Alastair Sim did it best. Gregor Sharp and Simon CarlyleThe creators and writing partnership behind Two Doors Down which is hands-down one the funniest comedies to grace our TV screens in recent years with echoes of sitcom greats ndash from Abigails Party to The Royle Family ndash in its winning formula. More please. Gregor FisherThe ragtag Govan philosopher Rab C. Nesbitt was, as Fisher once noted, \"somebody who was forgotten, somebody from the so-called underbelly of society.\" Indeed he was, but Nesbitt managed to be one of the funniest comedy characters to emerge from Scotland, and one of the most poignant, too. He made us laugh but the laughs were sometimes uncomfortable ndash there were lots of acute social truths in them. Daniel SlossNetflix-approved and still not , Sloss has the armour-plated arrogance of youth. Sometimes that can come across as simply arrogance. But, as his latest show X, which tackles toxic masculinity, proves, he is ambitious for his comedy. He also has the stagecraft. In other words, hersquos good now, but how good is he going to be  years from now  Michelle GomezFrom unhinged staff liaison officer Sue White in Green Wing to murderous Missy in Doctor Who, Gomez brilliantly nails weirdly offbeat, deeply funny characters. The Glaswegian, also known for comic turns in The Book Group and Bad Education is currently appearing in the Netflix supernatural horror series Chilling Adventures of Sabrina. The KrankiesThe Krankies in the top  best Scottish comedians of all time  Are we mad-dabi-dozi  Not really: remember that Janette and Ian Tough were masters of three neglected areas of comedy: the club circuit, which is where they first made their mark in the s comedy for children on Crackerjack and the likeand pantomime, which the Krankies have dominated in Scotland for years. And no, wersquore not defending the single they released. It was not fan-dabi-dozi. No-one danced all night. And it was not all right. Rory BremnerHeonce fooled Margaret Beckett, then a minister in a Labour cabinet minister, into thinking she was talking on the phone to the Chancellor Gordon Brown. She wasnt, of course: it was the mischievous Bremner, who had Browns distinctive burr down to a T. The spoof was a reminder of his formidable impersonation skills and his gt for political satire. The hit Channel  show, Bremner, Bird and Fortune, is much missed. Rikki FultonNotmany comedians can make us laugh merely by saying lsquohellorsquo. Watch, on YouTube, any of Rikki Fultonrsquos turns as Rev I.M. Jolly on the Hogmanay Scotch and Wry shows, and you see just that: the lights going up, and Rikki, with an almost audible sigh, uttering that ineffably melancholy lsquohellorsquo. Fulton had been one-half of Francie and Josie, had starred in iety and panto, and was a serious actor, too. The Rev I.M. Jolly became a Hogmanay must-see for many Scots. Ashley JensenJensenwas fetchingly eccentric as Ricky Gervaiss best friend, Maggie, in the Gervais Stephen Merchant-penned TV hit, Extras. She has gone on to refine her comedic and acting gts in TV and in film, including Ugly Betty and Agatha Raisin. The good news is that she can be seen alongside Gervais again in After Le, Rickys latest dark comedy, in which he plays a man struggling after the death of his we. It starts on Netflix on March . Ford Kiernan and Greg HemphillThe co-creators, writers and stars of Still Game and Chewinrsquo The Fat have more than earned their place among the upper echelons of Scottish comedyrsquos hall of fame, gting the nation an enduring lexicon that includes ldquoTwo pints, p**** ldquoThatrsquos plenty! ldquoYoursquove taken that too far and ldquoTake a drink!. Ronnie CorbettBoth venerated and under-ratedEdinburgh-born Corbett came for the fore during the satire boom of the s. But it was in the s and s that his star truly ascended, courtesy of his double act with Ronnie Barker and the programme they fronted, The Two Ronnies. Notionally he was the straight guy, but only notionally as subsequent generations of comics knew full well: David Walliams, Matt Lucas, Stephen Merchant and Ricky Gervais were among those who sought him out in his later years. Frankie BoyleDark and pessimistic humour. Close to the bone jokes. Brutal analogies. Boyle stokes controversy with his no-holds-barred subject matter. A rare family-newspaper-friendly sample: ldquoLas Vegas and Glasgow have a lot in common: theyrsquore the only two places in the world where you can pay for sex with chips. Kevin BridgesImpish, irreverent, clever, the natural successor to Connolly on the comedy stage ndashhe has the desire to keep going. Bridges manages to take seemingly ordinary le experience and turn it into something far less than ordinary. And he clearly has a head for political satire. \"Working in Poundstretcher for no wageshellipworking in a shop where everything is worth a quid except you. Elaine C SmithA bona fide national treasure, Elaine C Smithrsquos career to date has encompassed not just comedy but also singing, straight acting , journalism, political campaigning, even teaching, all delivered with the aplomb and brio of a natural raconteur who excels at everything she turns her hand to.Typically, however, she has a more self-effacing take on the motives behind her genre-defying years in the spotlight. The idea, she once said, is to ldquojust keep moving ndash yoursquoll be less of a target. Seriously, though, nobody is likely to be taking aim at the star, who turned  last year: the charisma oozing from her when shersquos in character is unforced, and off-stage shersquos as warm, personable, generous and defiantly un-starry as you would expecther to be.Smithrsquos list of achievements and associations runs the gamut from Ato, wellnot Z than at least as far as W, standing for Wildcat Theatre. Smith first encountered its politically-inspired progenitor, :, at the Citizens Theatre in Glasgow as an -year-old and, suitably inspired, performed regularly with Wildcat throughout the s, including in the original production of The Steamie. Among her other credits in serious acting roles are BBC One drama Two Thousand Acres Of Sky and Kay Mellorrsquos hit series The Syndicate.But itrsquos for her contribution to comedy that shersquos best known and in particular for the role filed under M: Mary Nesbitt, aka Mary Doll, aka the long-suffering spouse to Govan nersquoer-do-well Rab C Nesbitt, he of string vest and filthy gutties fame.Smith clocked up her first of many Rab C episodes when the show debuted with a one-off pilot episode in late , and she was still there in  for the New Yearrsquos Day Special which found Rab fighting the bedroom tax. As an integral part of the much loved and award-winning show, shersquos now firmly embedded in Scotlandrsquos cultural DNA.Nobody will ever hail Mary as a role model for Scottish women or a worthwhile advert for hands-off parenting, but as an iconic comic character therersquos no touching her, and itrsquos hard to see who  in the Scottish acting firmament could have done her justice.Away from the dysal world of the Nesbitt family Smithrsquos comic skills have been put to good use in pantomimeand in less nihilistic TV sitcoms such as City Lights, in which she starred alongside the great Gerard Kelly, and in current hit Two Doors Down .Importantly, Smith also developed her own one-woman show, first mounting it in the mid-s and blazing an inspiring trail for a generation of younger Scottish actresses and comics to follow. And follow they have, another reason Elaine C Smith sits so high on our Scotlandrsquos Funniest People list.An Audience with Elaine C Smith, Kings Theatre, March  Armando IannucciIn an era when fake news is both a reality and a slur to be flung at reputable media organisations by emotionally incontinent politicians, it often feels ascurrent affairs and the reporting off them have moved way beyond satire. Which may explain why Glasgow-born writer, producer, director and arch-satirist Armando Iannucci is heading into space for his next project ndash Avenue , a sci-fi comedy for HBO starring Hugh Laurie.Butthe next chapter in the Scotrsquos comic journey takes place off-planet he leaves behind a treasure trove of earth-bound gems and itrsquos on account of that three decade back catalogue that he ranks so highly in our Scotlandrsquos Funniest People list.Cerebral and opinionated, with a liking for the scabrous and possessed of the outsiderrsquos eye which is vital for satire, Iannucci cut his teeth at BBC Radio Scotland in the late s on the likes of Norsquo The Archie McPherson Show. But those same gnashers first left their mark on the wider cultural landscape when he co-created Steve Cooganrsquos Alan Partridge character for BBC Radio rsquos On The Hour in . In  Iannucci and On The Hour co-star Chris Morris took the show to television as news parody The Day Today but Coogan and Iannucci would continue the Partridge association across three more series following the inimitable Alan, surely one of British comedyrsquos greatest creations, from the highs of television stardom to the lows of a static caravan and a berth on Radio Norfolk.In , Channel  gave Iannucci his own self-titled show. Inexplicably, it ran for only one season but had it not then we may have missed out on the show that came next ndash The Thick Of It, a fly-on-the-wall style mockumentary which debuted in  and burrowed its way into the heart of the New Labour machine where it dispensed satirical headbutts to one and all. Many, though not all, of these were delivered by another inspired Iannucci creation, spin doctor and full-time sociopath Malcolm Tucker. He was played in the show by Peter Capaldi, another Glaswegian of Italian descent whose family were actually near-neighbours of the Iannuccis in Springburn.Of course with so much of the UKrsquos political and media landscape being influenced and affected by the United States, the endlessly ambitious Iannucci was never going to limit himself to these shores. In , he adapted The Thick Of It for cinema and dropped hapless British government minister Tom Hollander into Washingtonrsquos then un-drained political swamp where he was pitted against boorish American general James Gandolfini. The film was called In The Loop and it won Iannucci an Oscar nomination.Three years later he created Veep for HBO. Starring former Seinfeld stalwart Julia Louis-Dreyfus as the US Vice President it took the TTOI format and tweaked it to create a hilarious political comedy which did for le in the West Wing what TTOI had done for the fictitious Department of Social Affairs and Citizenship . Veep is now in its seventh and final season and the previous six were all nominated for Emmy Awards. To date it was won , including Outstanding Comedy Series for the last three years running.So, itrsquos space next for Armando Iannucci, a place where no-one can hear you scream . Butthe Scot remains true to form, donrsquot think you wonrsquot be doing exactly that. Billy ConnollyWHAT makes Billy Connolly not only the greatest comedian in the UK, but the world  Wersquove long attached superlatives to his name, long tried to wonder what makes the Glaswegian so funny. There are those who cite Sir Billyrsquos surrealist streak and highlight how the former shipyard worker was influenced by the great Chic Murray.But what is it about Connolly thatrsquos allowed him to become a global superstar, a comedian, actor, documentary film maker and half decent banjo player  What defines him INSECURITY: All the great comedians are blessed with tragic insecurity and Connolly is no exception. It instils constant searching, an analysis of the world around which they keep trying to make sense of, in the hope that along the way it can provide comedy gold. ldquoI think my securities far outweigh my insecurities, he said. ldquoI am not nearly as afraid of myself and my imagination as I used to be.But that wasnrsquot always the case at all. Recalling the seven year-old schoolboy who fell in a puddle and was laughed at, Connolly realised that being mocked was far better than being beaten by nuns, or the Aunt who looked after him, or his father who sexually abused him. He knew then that escape from perpetual misery involved making people laugh and actually enjoyed his puddle moment. But he also knewhe were to become a comedian he would have to cultivate a personality, to ldquomake myself look windswept and interesting.It took time however. The quest involved the teenager experimenting with several worlds, from libraries to the Scouts, to cycling clubs to a religious group with whom he would travel to houses and read the Rosary to those ldquowaiting to watch the Beverly Hillbillies.CAMPERY: Even during his years in the shipyards, Connolly was never reluctant to draw attention to himself, with outrageous footwear and outfits so far away from the regulation Burton The Tailor two-piece. Later on, this inveterate show-offrsquos stage outfits were never quite a threat to Elton,but he came close. No opportunity was ever missed to surprise, whether appearing in lurex, banana boots or deck chair jackets. The result provided a delicious incongruity the insecure clown on stage telling jokes about his grim childhood, yet doing so with a continuous flick of highlighted hair, or a swish of the silky poncho.HAIR: Connolly certainly put his hair to good use. He has always had a very good head of it, which allowed him to leave the shipyard aged . Anyone with less hair would never have dared to enter the milieu that was the Scottish folk scene in the Sixties. The folk scene was really a front however for his true intent to follow Jimmy Logan and Stanley Baxter onto the entertainment circuit, and make the world laugh. But the hair suggested dferent characters he could be the urban philosopher, he could be a hippie, before later taking on a grander power and nailing his audience with the Crucixion.AWARENESS OF REALITY: Connolly was shaped, moulded, battered and plated by the experience of working as a boilerman in the shipyards, from the ages of -. Yet, while that provided reams of raw material for a comedy act, Connolly hadnrsquot yet worked up the courage to make the leap. Indeed, it took a colleague in the yards who told him to leave and never come back, to see him go off and pursue the dream.Connolly, however, was clever enough to know he wasnrsquot ready to go it alone and for a while held the hands of Humblebumsrsquo musicians Tam Harvey and Gerry Rafferty. And he was aware, that when matched with Rafferty, he was out of his depth. ldquoIrsquove got a voice like a goose farting in a tunnel, he admitted. ldquoAnd Gerry was very good for me. He taught me that I would never be a musician as long as my arse looked south. He was just so outstandingly good and getting better, and although I was getting better too, the space between us remained huge.BOLDNESS: Comedy, not folk music, was the future and success grew in Scotland with the release of his live albums. In , a taxi driver told Michael Parkinson how good the Big Yin was and he landed an invite. But how many comedians when offered the chance to appear on the biggest chat show in the land would tell a joke about we-murdering, sexual depravity and cheeky bicycle-parking  Connollyrsquos manager Frank Lynch figured this career was over before it really began. Wrong, Frank. So wrong.REFUSAL TO BE CONSTRAINED: If Billy Connolly once had to battle with an inferiority complex, being told he was useless by the aunt he lived with, he did a very good job of hiding it as his career rolled on. If anyone every bothered to tell him he could never become a playwright, he certainly didnrsquot listen.If anyone mentioned he couldnrsquot become a pop star, that too fell on deaf ears and he appeared on Top of The Pops several times with pastiches of Tammy Wynettersquos DIVORCE and the Village Peoplersquos In The Navy. .What was also apparent was Connolly wasnrsquot afraid to cause political upset, to create ide, at one time describing the newly devolved Scottish government as ldquoa pretendy wee parliament. The man who at one time owned homes in Aberdeenshire, New York and Malta, believed himself to be a citizen of the world. And somehow he got away with his critiques because, well, he was above it all.SOCIAL CHAMELEONISM: Connolly has been able to adapt to and fit in to a iety of worlds. His film career brought him into the orbit of the showbiz greats, the likes of Robin Williams and the Pythons, but far from feeling out of his depth, the Scot not only thrived but fed on his new source material. He discovered being Glaswegian could be a bonus. He made Glaswegians, for the first time, believe something very positive could come out of a housing scheme.WRITING: But itrsquos his comic writing that confirms the manrsquos genius. Aged , he moved to the Glasgow housing scheme, Drumchapel. He said later, ldquoDrumchapel is a housing estate just outside Glasgow. Well, itrsquos in Glasgow, but just outside civilisation. His similes are close to perfect. After appearing on the same bill as Elton John in the States in , the Scot was hit on the head with a pipe. ldquoThey made me feel as welcome as a fart in a spacesuit, he said later.HErsquoS A VARIETY ARTIST: While Connolly could come up with Chic Murray like aphorisms ndash ldquoMarriage is a great invention ndash but then so is the bicycle repair kit, or brilliant parodies such as the Crucixion, he has never been afraid to bend towards the Bernard Manning ldquoIf women are so bloody perfect at multi-tasking, how come they canrsquot have a headache and sex at the same time. Or how about: ldquoA biker goes to the doctor with hearing problems. lsquoCan you describe the symptoms to me rsquo lsquoYes. Homer is a fat yellow lazy b****** and Marge is a skinny bird with big blue hair!AND A PSYCHOLOGIST: Connolly offers big performance. No Rich Hall -side-of-mouth-jokes. He doesnrsquot just tell you a funny story. He throws it right onto your face. But he also understands and highlights the fragilities and complexities of the human condition, revealed with his line, \"Never trust a man, who when left alone with a tea cosey doesnt try it on.\" Even his throwaway comments ldquoBigotry is a hobby in Glasgow canrsquot fail to resonate.SELF-DEPRECATION: He can be in your face and seemingly confident but knows his limits and when to rein it in. Connolly, for example, points out he is usually killed off in the first  minutes of his movies. But he can act as he revealed in Queen Victoria biopic Mrs Brown, a perfect vehicle for his ability to switch from aggression to tenderness in the flick of an eyelid. But itrsquos also hard to see past his deliciously quixotic role in  dark comedy What We Did On Our Holiday.HErsquoS A SALESMAN: Connolly has sold Glasgow to the world. Okay, it wasnrsquot a shortbread tin version of his hometown, more a rusty Spam tin, with bits of stale meat still inside, but he never, ever failed to make it funny. Where Joycersquos Ulysses transformed the image of Dublin from a backwater to a metropolis, Connolly too has sold his hometown, its colour and vibrancy, its humour as dark as a boilermakerrsquos overalls.HErsquoS A FIGHTER: Billy Connolly offers up the black comedy line, ldquoIrsquove got Parkinsonrsquos Disease. And I wish tae f*** hersquod take it back. But at the same time Sir Billy is entirely aware of the impact hersquos had on so many people. And so he should be. \"Im very lucky in as much as I made a bit of a mark, and you think, well, I must have done something right.The Glasgow International Comedy Festival runs from March -.

The new BBC Scotland channel was about to make history by showing a repeat.Not just any repeat, though. This was Tutti Frutti, the six-part, Glasgow-set comedy drama that disappeared into a television Bermuda Triangle in  because of musicproblems and had not been broadcast on TV since.The dramarsquos absence fed the legend. Danny and Suzi. Eddie Clockerty and Miss Toner. The music. The gallusness. The six Baftas, and none of your Scottish ones either, for this was a hit across the UK.Who are the funniest  people in Scotland Some  years had passed, and now it was coming back. Hence the mixed feelings. Tutti Frutti has been the Alpha and Omega of Scottish popular culture, a touchstone, the lodestar. Would it be as good as we remembered Fears melted away in the first seconds, courtesy of Little Richard proclaiming the finest phrase rock and roll ever gave the English language: ldquoA wop bop a loo bop a wop bam boom! The opening credits rolled and there they were again, The Majestics, the nearly made it band from Glasgow who were just about to embark on a silver jubilee tour when their lead man, Big Jazza, was killed in a crash. Just like James Dean, except Jimmy wasnrsquot on a kebab run at the time.Tutti Frutti sWriter John Byrne opened his tale where all the good ones begin, at a funeral. The mourners are about to lower the coffin when a taxi pulls up at the Necropolis and out steps Danny McGlone, Jazzarsquos younger brother, all the way from New York City. Eddie Clockerty, gents haberdasher talent agent looks at Danny and ponders whether he could take Jazzarsquos place. By the time the funeral is over and Vincenthas led The Majestics in an acapella version of Three Steps to Heaven, you knew it was going to be okay. Test of time: passed with flying colours.Before the series proper began, there was a repeat of a documentary made to mark the National Theatre of Scotlandrsquos  production of Tutti Frutti. While it unfortunately contained a huge spoiler, it also had interviews with Byrne, Richard Wilson and Robbie Coltrane, the latter saying not a day of his career went by without someone asking what had happened to Tutti Frutti.Basically, the BBC failed to get world clearance for the songs. ldquoThat shows how much confidence they had in it, said artist and playwright Byrne, who delivered the series in instalments insisting no changes be made. He would not budge, either, on Coltrane for Danny Jazza - a bold move given the young comedian was then a relative unknown.Certain things inevitably dated the piece: people using phone boxes, men calling women ldquobirds, Swiss cheese plants in West End flats. Yet everything that made Tutti Frutti sing first time around makes it work again today. Get a load of Kettles and Danny sparking off each other like Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn. Check out the settings School of Art the glorious use of language the banter the laughs. Most of the latter are supplied by the partnership of Eddie and his PA bane of his le, Miss Toner. ldquoYoursquore on a verbal warning, McClockerty tells her. ldquoAye, thatrsquoll be right, Janice bats back.Miss Toner is pure dead Glesga, which is another thing that brings a certain moistness around the eye area - Byrnersquos obvious love of the city and its people. He is to Glasgow what Alan Bleasdale is to Liverpool and Alan Bennett to Leeds: the place is in his DNA, he ldquogets it.

But Scottish self-government will not involve a Northern Ireland-type border dispute, andScotland gains speedy access to the EU, will not involve extended trade discussions either. With much of the rest, there are international legal precedents to follow, and I am sure there exists goodwill enough to facilitate an affable parting of the ways. The nuclear issue may involve posturing on both sides, but should be easily resolved with a -year lease for Faslane and the Trident system.GR Weir, Mill Street,Ochiltree.DAVID STUBLEYcompletely ignored the main thrust of my letter of February , which focused on one of the key consequences of the massive imbalance of trade in goodsbetween the EU and the UK which has not only lost us thousands of skilled jobs but costs a net pound billion annually for the privilege. A very bad deal in every sense of the word. Rather he nitpicked on minor issues before having another go about his mistaken belief that Brexit was an ldquoimpending disaster and about the benefits of ldquoEU funding into regions and rural areas which he claimed ldquoWestminster would never have granted _ the fact that it is UK taxpayersrsquo money in the first place was not even mentioned.He also claimed ldquoin common with many Leave voters that I somehow believed the misinformation which was peddled to swing the vote. Wrong. Indeed, as a Eurosceptic I even wrote a letter arguing that people should vote Remain in order to fight the dysal and unaccountable EU along with their unfair trade practices within rather than Leave. However, the majority vote was to leave and the rest is history as they say ndash but with hindsight I must admit that my original belief that there was a chance the EU could be reformed in a meaningful way has been proved wrong by the intransigence displayed by the EU ldquonegotiators thus far.Yes, Brexit will hit us harder initially but in my view Britain will adapt much quicker than than people think and provided we take tough decisions early on we will have a much brighter future ahead of us as a global player free to do our own trade deals.Ian Lakin,Pinelands,Murtle Den Road,Milltimber, Aberdeen.Read more: Conservatives warn Sturgeon against holding new voteIT is a shame that you chose apparently to support the nonsense of those attempting to tear the UK out of the EU with your Letters Page headline ldquoThe betrayal of those who voted to leave will never be forgiven .

It is therefore unsurprising that barn owls in the north of Scotland have a hard time during the winter months, with peak mortality rates being between December and March due to starvation.As temperatures start to drop in winter, small mammals become less active, meaning a lot less food is available for barn owls, and they need to work extra-hard to find it. This often results in the owls being forced to feed during daylight, even though they are naturally nocturnal hunters.This lack of food is particularly dangerous for barn owls as they are poorly insulated and need more food in winter to provide them with enough energy to stay warm.The Barn Owl Trust estimates that between  and  barn owls are killed each year on UK roads.RSPB Scotland site manager Dave Jones recently sent a deceased barn owl to the Scottish Agricultural College in Thurso for autopsy, when some concerned neighbours reported it after finding it at the roadside.The results of the autopsy showed that the bird was fit and healthy, \"in good shape and hunting successfully\", and that the death followed trauma to its wing and abdomen ndash suggesting that the bird died as a result of being hit by a vehicle.Dave said: \"It is extremely sad to discover that a fit and healthy birds le ended in this way. The barn owls in Caithness really are at the edge of their natural comfort zone and are particularly vulnerable in winter, so it isnt an unusual result, unfortunately. Its not all doom and gloom, though. Although we still find some casualties in this way, our population of barn owls in Caithness has recovered from the particularly poor winters of   and  , and they are considered to be the most northerly population of barn owls in the world.\"While we cant control the weather, there are some things we can do to help. If putting up a nest box, please make sure it isnt placed close to any busy roads. If you see a road casualty and it is safe to do so, please stop and report the find to your local wildle officer and to the Barn Owl Trust. This is helpful in identying accident black spots and monitoring for environmental hazards and poisons, and potential wildle crime.\"Monday  Mar  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"Delay to Wick 20 mph speed limit plans","story":"THE brakes have been put on plans to introduce a  mph speed limit on the majority of roads in Wick.The proposal was mooted by Highland Council as a way to improve road safety and encourage walking and cycling.However, Wick members of the Caithness committee this week described the scheme as \"a blunt instrument\" and said other measures to reduce speed would be more effective.

It’s perhaps no surprise that the transport secretary refused to say he had confidence in HIAL’s management the last time I asked him. I continue to offer solidarity and support to Prospect and its members.”The Prospect union said that, following a ballot of air traffic controllers who are members of the union,  per cent had voted for strike action, with  per cent backing action short of a strike.The dispute has come about after the pay rise was sought by the controllers, as they said they were being paid half as much as their counterparts in other areas.

Speaking on behalf of the four Scottish Health charities, Angela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland said: “It’s less than four weeks until March  and people are telling us how anxious and concerned they are about the lack of clarity and detail.#As leading patient voice charities, representing hundreds of thousands of people, we have a responsibility to articulate the very real worries and fears many have about the supply, distribution and storage of medicines in a no deal Brexit.“Insulin, for example, is a daily le-saving necessity for thousands of people with diabetes, and any delay or interruption to access would be incredibly dangerous.“Anti-epileptic drugs are also a daily necessity for people with epilepsy.#Any delay or change in the makeup of the drugmight trigger seizures in someone whose condition has been well-managed for many years with no guarantee they will be seizure free again.#Additionally, emergency rescue medication, like midazolam, is a vital lesaving drug for people with dficult to manage epilepsy. Any interruption to supply raises serious concern and may result in avoidable deaths.“There are many other drugs and medical supplies which are equally critical to health.“We are urgently calling on the Scottish Government to produce the detail required to reassure the Scottish public that all relevant organisations involved in the supply, storage and local distribution of medicines in Scotland, have robust systems and agreements in place.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The turnout was  per cent.Prospect has said it will consult representatives next week before confirming industrial action plans. The action is likely to start in April and continue through the summer.This situation arose after HIAL airport controllers sought a pay rise, as they said they were being paid half as much as their counterparts in other areas. However, HIAL said this isn#t the case and proposals were rejected by Scottish Ministers.Prospect negotiations officer David Avery said: “Our members at HIAL undertake highly skilled roles, much in demand across the UK and Europe, but due to public sector pay restraint their pay has fallen signicantly behind the rest of the industry.“Air Traffic Controllers do not want to have to take this action but ministers’ refusal to engage with the issue of pay has left them with no choice. Prospect remains ready to negotiate at any point to avoid this action but ministers must come back to the table with a new meaningful offer.”HIAL managing director Inglis Lyon, has responded to news of the ballot, saying: “We are disappointed Air Traffic Controlcolleagues have chosen to take industrial action that is likely to have a signicant impact on passengers and the communities we serve in the Highlands and Islands.#The Prospect union has sought a double-digit pay award. As a government sponsored agency, HIAL must follow the Scottish Government pay policy. We cannot implement pay awards more than that directed by government.#HIAL made a pay award offer to all staff which was accepted following an overall ballot of trade union members and paid to all staff at the end of September .  This was backdated to  April  and saw colleagues receive increases of up to three per cent in line with Scottish Government Pay Remit Guidelines.#Prospect ATC members rejected the pay settlement, but nonetheless received the increase.#We are open to holding further talks with Prospect on a recruitment and retention allowance for Air Traffic Control staff that would further bolster an attractive remuneration package that already includes excellent pension benefits and holiday entitlements.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Given that controllers have now voted to go on strike, it would appear that the problems extend more widely than just centralisation.“Given the leline nature of our air services, the impact that industrial action will have on those services must be taken extremely seriously.

It was followed by the University of Dundee, which posted a deficit of £.m, and Glasgow Caledonian University , which finished the year £.m in the red. Six other Scottish institutions made losses in -, including Edinburgh‘s Queen Margaret and Napier Universities, which posted deficits of £.m and £.m respectively. The sector overall finished £.m in the black, thanks to large surpluses at institutions such as the Universities of Edinburgh and Glasgow, which posted figures of £.m and £.m respectively. However, statistics published last year by the Higher Education Statistics Agencysuggest that the finances of Scottish universities are less healthy than they were in -.Their combined deficit that year stood at just £m, almost half the current figure, while the sector’s overall surplus was £m, around £m higher than in -. A spokesman for HESA said it was due to publish its - figures later this month, but that the accounts information reported by universities should be comparable to last year’s data. Universities Scotland said it was the third year in a row that half of the nation’s universities had finished in deficit and called for ministers to take action. “There is a clear pattern emerging at the sector level where the gradual erosion of Scottish Government funding is really starting to make itself felt,” a spokeswoman said. “Every undergraduate student place that the Scottish Government provides is underfunded, and funding for university research does not cover its full cost. “Universities need to see a steady climb to sustainable levels of investment in their teaching, research and capital grantsthey are to maintain their global competitiveness.” RGU said its deficit was mainly driven by the “exceptional costs” of terminating long-term debt, changes to pension contributions and financial adjustments. “The underlying result for the year is a deficit of £.m,” a spokesman added. “The university has a strong, liquid balance sheet and this strength will ensure that it can continue to deliver on its ambitious plans in teaching excellence and impactful research.” The University of Dundee cited a fall in core funding from the Scottish Funding Council, as well as “increasing compliance costs, pension cost pressures and uncertainty in relation to Brexit”. A spokesman added: “We have already recorded a signicant increase in tuition fee income and have set out ways of improving our ability to invest in areas of strength.” GCU said its deficit included a “signicant non-cash charge of £.m for staff pensions”. “Such charges are being experienced in organisations across the country as the valuation of pension liabilities is being adversely affected by the current low interest rates in the UK,” a spokeswoman added.

So does Nicola Sturgeon’s comment about the possibility of forming a coalition government with Labouranother snap election’s called at Westminster. Askedshe might form a Labour-SNP coalition, Nicola Sturgeon said last week she was “ready to work with other parties” to oppose the Conservatives’ disastrous Brexit plans. The Conservatives also seem to be upping the ante. Last week an anonymous government minister warned “there’ll be no escaping the Brexit disaster for Scots”. He or she was apparently just one among “a number of senior figures” briefing the BBC against the prospect of another indyref. Methinks they doth protest too much. Meanwhile there are suggestions that the Scottish Tories have urged the Prime Minister to “keep hold of all the cards” in the event of a second referendum so that London decides the date, question and franchise – a clear acknowledgment that allowing under-s and non-European citizens to vote again would be enough toa small Yes vote right now.In  most EU nationals voted No, after scare stories that an iScotland would be forced to quit the EU. But since the Brexit vote and the UK government’s failure to guarantee rights to folk who’ve made their entire lives in Britain, almost every EU national still here will back independence second time around. They won’t be fooled again.Similarly, , - and -year-olds voted in  and around  per cent backed independence, according to a poll carried out by Tory donor Lord Ashcroft. Since the next indyref will also determine access to jobs in Europe, the result’s likely to be an even stronger Yes vote among young Scots next time. Last week’s ridiculous claim by David Mundell suggests he also knows how Brexit may soon change the political landscape north of the Border.The Scots Secretary said Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP actually want a no-deal Brexit to “pursue their fantasy of independence”. Mr Mundell insisted: “They pretend to oppose no deal, yet no deal is their real aim. They hope it will cause chaos, confusion and boost support for independence. Everything  that they do or say on Brexit has been a publicity stunt.”Now a man who shares party membership with Chris ‘no resignation’ Grayling, Boris ‘zipwire’ Johnson and Jacob ‘backstop-ultimatum’ Rees Mogg has clearly had practice in recognising the hallmarks of the cynical gesture and the empty stunt. But suggesting Nicola Sturgeon wants a no deal Brexit – are you having a laugh  Since Mr Mundell has clearly been on another planet for the last two years, he’s missed the fact that Sturgeon’s been getting pelters from Yessers for appearing more interested in saving Britain than readying Scotland for indyref. Chaos might well look like “the best backdrop for another campaign for independence” to politicians who are quite prepared to break up Britain and wreck livelihoods over hysterical fears about foreign workers and dogmatic beliefs about the benefits of unregulated free trade, but there’s been no occasion over the last two years when the First Minister has forgotten the entirely negative long-term impact of Brexit on Scotland, realising that dferent cross-border trade arrangements aren’t ideal birthing conditions for any new state.You can only conclude that the sudden eruption of rattling by Tories north and south of the Border means Whitehall expects the SNP leader to call for another Section  order sooner rather than later.And why might that be – because any kind of Brexit, hard or soft, on  March or a few months later, opens up a whole new set of scenarios for Scotland.Once Britain has actually withdrawn from the EU, it’s likely that the EU and the smaller trade body EFTA will approach Scotland offering rival membership deals in the event of a vote for independence second time around.Senior officials in Iceland are openly discussing the many advantages of having Scotland as a new member of the EFTA halfway house and thereby creating a powerful bloc with three contiguous North Atlantic states controlling vital sea routes, fishing grounds, oil and gas fields and a vast wind, marine and geothermal renewable energy resource. If Gavin McCrone was writing another memerandum to ministers today about the strategic and economic potential of such a move, he might again conclude an independent Scotland “would tend to be in chronic surplus to a quite embarrassing degree”, eventhe big income from decades of oil and gas predicted  years ago has largely been squandered by successive UK governments.Meanwhile, academics at the recent Oxford conference on Rewriting the UK Constitution have predicted that the EU will make a public offer to Scotland once Brexit means there’s no further risk in offending Britain and no conflict of interest in wooing the Scots instead. And why wouldn’t the EU want us  Regaining five million generally progressive, pro-EU citizens in the wake of Britain’s acrimonious departure would be an important boost to the European project.Any bidding war between EFTA and the EU would serve to bolster the viability of Scottish independence, consolidate a new Brexit-oriented strategy and increase support for another Scottish vote. Of course who knows what will happen next with Brexit Theresa May’s deal may get the go-ahead, but her new assurances on the Irish backstop may not satisfy Brexiteers. An extension to Article , allowing time for a second Brexit vote, might let the SNP trade support for an understanding on a future Section  order. In short, things are hotting up on the independence front even though the issue and the SNP have been virtually cut out of mainstream political debate.Momentum is building and those opposing Scotland’s right to self-determination in the light of Brexit know it.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"dani garavelli celebrities like stacey dooley should think twice about comic relief","story":"There are ways to help developing countries that do not involve fetishising human suffering or ignoring our country#s complicity in their plight, writes Dani GaravelliIt’s a shame an important discussion about the tone of Comic Relief has been focused so directly, and so vituperatively, on one woman – Stacey Dooley, and I can’t help wonderingthe fact she’s glamorous and female has something to do with how she has been targeted. I am not suggesting the Instagram photograph she posted with a random black child on her hip is unproblematic. MP David Lammy was right to point out it plays on all those tired old “white saviour” tropes. But Dooley is not just some C-list celebrity who has popped her head into Uganda to boost her own profile. She may currently be dancing on Strictly, but she is also a documentary maker with a track record of tackling serious subjects: sweat shops, people trafficking and child soldiers. Forcing her to take the flak for the cloying paternalism of Comic Relief seems harsh and lets an awful lot of other people off the hook.Thirty years after Live Aid, most people of my generation, who sang along with gusto to Do They Know It’s Christmas  cannot hear the line: “So tonight thank God it’s them instead of you” without a visceral sense of shame. We recognise, now, the flaws in the privileged pop stars’ approach: the way Live Aid treated the continent of Africa as homogeneous and its people as unormly helpless the way it presented Bob Geldof as a saint and relied on dehumanising shots of starving babies to guilt-trip comfortable First Worlders into donating.We understand – or at least we ought to – that this sort of relief effort risks disempowering those it purports to help and deflects from the UK’s role as an oppressor that plundered many benighted countries of their resources.Yet, despite this – and many high-profile calls for the West to confront the legacy of its imperial past – a sanitised and white-centred attitude towards racism and the developing world remains widespread.We saw it at this year’s Oscars. Two years after Moonlight, a sensitive portrayal of black masculinity, won best film, Hollywood suffered a relapse, handing the award to Green Book, a buddy movie – made by white director Peter Farrelly – in which a northern white bigot agrees to drive a brilliant, but repressed black musician on a tour of the Deep South. And guess what  The white driver is the main character. And the story is seen through his eyes. And it turns out he’s not so bad after all. He teaches the black musician about black culture. They listen to Little Richard and eat fried chicken. And, in the end, the lonely black musician celebrates Christmas with his driver’s big white Italian family. No wonder Spike Lee walked out in disgust.We see it too in the sixth-formers heading out to build clinics across the developing world. It’s all very well-intended, but – as they hold ceilidhs and race nights to fund their trips – do they ever stop to consider who benefits  Is it the local residents who could – with the money raised – have been trained to do construction work themselves  Or is it mostly about their own egos and CVs Founder Richard Curtis saw Comic Relief as Live Aid for comedians so of course it came with a similar condescending vibe. The very first one, at Christmas , saw Lenny Henry broadcasting from a refugee camp in the Sudan.The format was always excruciating. High jinks interspersed with war zones, cake sales interspersed with pot-bellied infants. Happy face sad face, like Alex the Lion in Madagascar .Not so long ago such comments would have you written off as po-faced and tight, but in recent years the backlash against “poverty porn” has grown. In , the Radi-Aid awards nominated three films, involving Tom Hardy, Eddie Redmayne and Ed Sheeran, for the title of most offensive campaign of the year. The one that attracted most attention was Sheeran’s Comic Relief video, in which the singer offered to pay hotel costs for street children in Liberia. Sheeran was presented as a Messiah figure, dispensing western largesse. In the wake of that controversy, Liz Warner, CEO of Comic Relief, which runs Sports Relief and Red Nose Day, pledged the organisation would change its ways, and push African voices to the fore. Last year, a film about street children in Kampala was introduced by Rio Ferdinand, but he did not appear in it. Instead, a Ugandan charity worker and the children explained the issues to the viewer.Unfortunately, Dooley’s Instagram pictures – and the charity’s response to Lammy’s criticism – suggest it has fallen back into its old ways. Instead of reflecting on the validity of the MP’s words, it accused him of failing to respond to its offer for him to go to Africa – again that generic reference to an entire continent – and make a film himself. This was defensive, untrue and missed the point. Lammy did respond, but declined the offer, which is understandable given he wasn’t asking Comic Relief to give a  to British politicians but to indigenous voices.The furore prompted many angry-from-Manchester types to rant on about a lack of gratitude, thus proving Lammy’s point: that the Comic Relief model requires humility and submission from its beneficiaries. In reality, no-one was suggesting the £bn-plus Comic Relief has raised was unnecessary or unwelcome just that there are ways to help developing countries that do not involve fetishising human suffering or ignoring our country’s complicity in their plight. If I were going to tackle the “white saviour” syndrome, I would start in schools and particularly with To Kill A Mocking Bird. With his liberal benevolence firmly rooted in privilege, Atticus Finch is the archetypal white saviour, whose fate takes precedence over that of Tom Robinson, the black man he unsuccessfully defends against  accusations of rape. As long as the politics of Harper Lee’s book go unchallenged in classrooms, her paternalistic perspective is likely to persist.Lammy’s solution is for Comic Relief to have African voices counter lazy stereotypes. One comedian he suggested the programme might promote is Kenyan-born Njambi McGrath. In a clipposted on his Twitter feed, McGrath suggests western backpackers who take off for the developing world are “detoxing from privilege”.“I hear you went to Africa my love,” she says. “Tell me, where in Africa did you go  Let me guess. Did you visit the medieval city built by the Shona people of Great Zimbabwe  Or perhaps maybe you went and spent some time in the ancient kingdom of the Baganda people  And they will say ‘I went to an orphanage. I went to a clinic for HIV sufferers, and I went to a slum’.”Dooley is not a villain. She shouldn’t be expected to carry the can for Comic Relief’s enduring colonialism. But perhapsshe and others were exposed to more voices like McGrath’s, they would think twice about treating black children like some sort of fashion accessory. ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scots outlander fans to get chance to quiz creator diana gabaldon","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Outlander fans are being offered the chance to quiz author Diana Gabaldon at a stately home that features in the hit TV show.The US writer will take part in a conversation event at Hopetoun House near South Queensferry on March .Fans will recognise the attraction from the screen adaptation of her historical time travel series, which concluded its fourth season in January.Author James Crawford will chair the evening in the Red Drawing Room, which appeared as the home of the Duke of Sandringham in series one.Outlander follows the adventures of English nurse Claire Randall, who travels back in time from s Scotland to the th century, where she meets and falls in love with Highlander Jamie Fraser.• : Outlander quiz: How well do you know the Scottish series The first book was published in  and it was adapted for television in .Fans of the series have since flocked from Europe and North America to visit locations featured in the show.The Hopetoun House event has been organised by VisitScotland and Publishing Scotland, with support from United Airlines.Jenni Steele from VisitScotland said: “The Outlander books and subsequent TV series have had a huge impact on tourism in Scotland, inspiring thousands of travellers to visit our shores.• : Outlander continues to drive record figures at Scotland’s heritage sites“It is only fitting that fans will get the chance to hear from the award-winning author in the sumptuous Hopetoun House, which will be familiar to viewers.”Marion Sinclair from Publishing Scotland added: “Books and storytelling have long been the source of cinematic and TV adaptations and Outlander is one of the major page-to-screen stories of the past decade in Scotland.“We are thrilled to have the opportunity to hear from Diana Gabaldon about how her writing served as the inspiration for the series.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

Salmond and Farage, the opposite sides of a nasty #nationalist# coin.And what of British Nationalists Mr Tinkler For example Michael Gove yesterday, banning #Of Mice  Men# and #To Kill a Mockingbird# from school reading lists in England.Can you imagine the SNP doing likewise because the want -% of literature studied to be Scottish Inconceivable.For whatever reason British nationalism # incredibly, even in the form of UKIP # isn#t sneered at the same way as Scottish nationalism.What is your point Carl  Scotland is somehow superior to England because it does not ban “Of Mice  Men” and “To Kill a Mockingbird” from school reading lists. How very petty of you. For information I loathe all nationalism, Scottish, British what is the dference, just raw tribalism by another name.SNP, UKIP, Scottish Independence, United Kingdom Independence, as I said, two sides of a very nasty littlecoin.How verySad andironic, the Scots# inScotland have just elected a UKIP MEP!! I#m glad to hear it Ian.So you are pro-EU and pro-immigration You mean you loathe most of human society from the ancient world to the st century  Nation-states have existed throughout human history and patriotism # or nationalism # is a normal part of human social experience, as evidenced in innumerable great artistic works, for example.Where things go wrong is where one nation-state wants to conquer and control others. But that has a dferent name: imperialism.Well Carl, when it comes to education and this of literature, I would rather have a book written by a british,not scottish, author than this of an american, in which to study or reflect on with regard to literary works used for educational purposes. Quite rightly, these books, written by foreigners##sorry, yanks, should be taken out of the national curriculum and author#s unique to the UK or Scotland selected instead.I must confess, I am a little worried and concerned about the UKIP doing so well in the European Election#s considering Mr Farrage is a more extreme version of the vile Tories, and how he gives the impression of a nationalist, xenophobic buffoon where, I feel,we do leave the EU, he will, like the vile Tories, be in a position to rule and do as he pleases without being answerable to anybody, namely the EU under the European Human Rights Act. Many people may criticize the EHRA, but I would dread to think what this country would be like without it     David, you never fail to amaze me.You start off by arguing that teachers should be banned from using any book written by a foreigner and then go on to criticise nationalism and xenophobia.You really do believe in taking the scatter gun approach to political philosophy.Without the European Human Rights Act there would be an awful lot less terrorists running round for a start, old hook hands would of been deported along with his pals years ago, The   tube an bus bombings may never of taken place, an Cherie Blair would have a few less £millions in the bank. Any and all of these options are preferable to what we have now.At the last general election when the Lib Dems signed a pact with the Conservatives the writing was on the wall, they blew it big time and will never in the future be able to have an influence on British politics.Maybethey had made a coalition with Labour it might have been dferent but now its too late, any vote for Liberal in the future will be a vote wasted.The study of English literature should, in my view, encompass all literature written in the English language, including its many dialects and historic iations. That should include studying local writers, but not to the exclusion of international authors.We study literature for all sorts of reasons, but bolstering national pride or trashing another nation shouldn#t be amongst them.If we were to go down the road of only studying our own literature, Scots students would never study Shakespeare or Dickens, English students would never study Burns or Lewis Grassic Gibson, neither would study Melville or Twain, and all would be worse off for it.The attack on the English curriculum has come from the dreadful Michael Gove, but it could quite easily have come from Nigel Farage who hates hearing non-English accents, let alone reading non-English texts.UKIP under Farage represents a severely authoritarian threat to our liberty which should not be under-estimated. So far we#ve only seen the tip of this particular iceberg.Farage is married to a German so he hears a foreign accent every day, such a pity you only soak up what murdochs media tell you instead of a few facts.How very true John, they, the LibDems, know how to go out with a bang##so to speak. A prime example of# not what to do in a political career # lolGod forbidthe Libdemsshould go into bed with UKIP, I think that would most certainly put a stake into the heart of the party lol Mind you, lets hope that UKIP do not get to that level of power where a they rule the roost or b contemplate a coalition with another party.I do believe they are in the same league as the Tories with regard to the Scottish Parliament, in that they have  single representative####.. too many in my books lol# you never fail to amaze me. You start off by arguing that teachers should be banned from using any book written by a foreigner #lol Malcolm, I was being slightly sarcastic in my response to what literature teachers should be using to teach with ###.but on a more serious point, I do not see why teachers cannot use books written by scottish or british authors to demonstrate literature and its meaning##..within and between the lines. I am sure, as you might agree, there is just as equally good examples of literature within the boundaries of our own country or the UK in which to use for educational purposes  I wasn#t specically saying every foreign book should be banned##.it was, as said sarcastically, yank#..sorry, american in the context of the subject.Theo Smith and the other  Shetland Lib-Dem voters might explain why they like it so much. But they won#t.Are you unable to express your own views Brian  because that link is your longest post by far.Carl Pickard, in answer to # Ian. So you are pro-EU and pro-immigration # I am strongly forUnity of all humanity, that does not mean I carte blancheagree with of all the attemptsand mechanisms to forge those unities by politicians. However the EU is a vast improvement of what went before it. WW and WW were the result of the preceding collection of sovereign nation states.On balance I there for do support the EU, however there are grounds to improve it, not demolish it. I most definitely agree with immigration and the opening of borders to all friendly states and cultures..Britain has benefited hugely due to its ersity of cultures.If anyone advocates banning immigration and sending #them# home, would they expect all UK and Scottish ex pats to be expelled from wherever they are and be sent backThat would be fun would it not I would expect to be deportedfrom whatever country I was in other than my ownI broke their laws. I would not expect that country to feed clothe and house me, nor would I expect free everything, maybe that#s just me as I don#t expect this country to do that for me either . Instead of hysterical rantings of they want to send them all back try actually listening to what they say instead of what the murdoch media say they say.A new experience # Iagree with Ian Tinkler.Robert Sim, in answer to # you loathe most of human society from the ancient world to the st century# I certainly do loath the primitive mentality which is soblind and stupid to realise most of human suffering is simply because Nation States and nationalistsare collectively too selfish to look beyond theirown self interest and belief in racial superiority.. Nationalism is a prime example of that and Salmond and his NATS a great example. Our oil, we are better, fairer, alone we would be wealthier, ect,ect and all that self righteous rubbish. Also nationalism goes a bit beyond great artistic works, a few examples : The Holocaust ,Omagh bombing , Bloody Sunday. Ethnic cleansing . Tribal massacresCambodian genocide , these are a few examples of hundreds of incidents..These killings have little to do with imperialism, more about tribalism and a self belief in racial superiority. #The simple fact is we are all the same species with exactly the same ancestry and emotions.# Very true, Ian.

They provide assurances a companys owners have the wherewithal to honour bills.\"Yet, just two months after the directors of Cairngorm Mountain Ltd signed it off as a going concern for another year, it went into administration owing money to at least  businesses, many of the them local.\"Its time that the four directors of CML were investigated and that the ultimate owner of the company, David Michael Gorton, who provided the assurances to the auditor was held to account.\"He continued: \"This follows four years during which they have been only too happy to see money taken out of Cairngorm Mountain through the large management fees paid to Natural Retreats ndash their main money spinner ndash out of which the CML directors paid themselves most generously.\"This was to the tune of pound, in the last accounts of the UK Travel Company to  shared between three directors.\"Latest papers filed with Companies House last week have revealed there were no requests for a creditors meeting.It will now be for the administrators Campbell Dallas to distribute the proceeds from the pound, sale of the business to Highlands and Islands Enterprise and other assets that were owned by CML.Just over pound, of that will be in fees to the administrators meaning it is highly likely not all of the creditors will be repaid in full.A signicant proportion of the debts ndash some pound, is owed to Natural Retreats-related companies ndash but the rest will have implications for the local economy.Amongst local firms still owed money according to the documents are the Spey Valley Hire Centre, David Ritchie  Sons Ltd, BSW Sawmills, Colin Baxter Photography Ltd and McGowan Ltd.Starbucks, EDF Energy and Screwfix Direct are also amongst the creditors while chartered surveyors Graham and Sibbald are still owed pound,.Rural Economy Secretary and Strathspey MSP Fergus Ewing said everyone is working hard to \"address and mitigate the adverse impact on the local economy\". He said: \"We are sure the administrators will do all they can to try and ensure that creditors, particularly small local companies, are promptly paid.\"Badenoch MSP Kate Forbessaid: \"This shows once again how critically important Cairngorm Mountain is to the wider strath. Thats also why its such a relief the resort has a future with operators that appreciate the local impact.\"I can fully understand why there will be concerns amongst local businesses as they await the outcome of this process. I regularly ask HIE for updates to ensure the local community and economy are front and centre of all decisions they make.\"Regional MSP Edward Mountainsaid: \"I am hugely disappointed that businesses in the Highlands have been left out of pocket and this matter should be investigated fully.\"I strongly believe that the management structure of Cairngorm Mountain that has been used in recent years is not fit for purpose.\"A spokesman for Campbell Dallas, said investigating the conduct of directors is a statutory requirement in every insolvency. He commented: \"The content of the conductsubmitted to the Insolvency Service must remain confidential. As such, the joint administrators are unable to comment any further.\"The Strathy tried to contact Natural Retreats but got no response.

In  he was accepted into the prestigious Hornsey School of Art, where he made his mark in etching and printmaking with his graduation piece ‘At the Ebb’ being selected for exhibition in the Royal Academy Summer Show.After further enhancing his reputation and craft as a member of the Glasgow Print Studio, which he joined in the mid-s, Tommy ed to Portree in  and founded Skye Original Prints.A combination of gallery and workshop # that drew in many visitors- the space also provided a base for the printmaker to create works which he would go on to sell around the world.With the Isle of Skye Gallery opened this week, the former creative hub of the celebrated Sgitheanach artist could act as an exciting  for current talent on the island.. “It just needed a wee bit of decorating really. I think it is a good space for local artists and photographers to show their work.”As well as welcoming new artists, the gallery’s ties to Tommy will also remain intact through a connection with one of his siblings, as Robert explained.“Tommy’s brother Rory has some work in the gallery – which is quite a nice connection,” Robert said. “He does landscapes – mostly small works which are water-based.“He heard I was renovating the gallery and gave me a call – I had no idea he painted, and I was delighted when he phoned up and asked.”The Portree businessman added: “I have about a dozen dferent artists and photographers – six of which are showing work at the gallery already. Jeremy Rossiter is one, he was the first person I spoke to.“I also have work from a couple from Skeabost, Gill Williams, who is a photographer, and her husband Ian Williams – who is more of an abstract painter.“What I like might or might not be what other people like, so I am intrigued to see how things go.”Robert said that he planned to open the gallery through to at least October and would operate on a commission basis, giving the artists the freedom to price the work themselves.He added: “A lot of galleries just focus on professional artists, but I want it to also be a place where amateur artists and photographers can sell their work.”He went on to say: “When people are buying something, especially work that’s expensive, it’s better to see it in the flesh than on a computer. It’s a  for people to sell their work, and I am just acting as an agent, selling it for them and supplying the location.”He added: “We are calling it the Isle of Skye Gallery – keeping it simple. That way everyone knows where it is, and it doesn’t prioritise one type of artwork over another. We have a Facebook page — Isle of Skye Gallery, and we’re on Instagram too — it’s not my forte but it’s a good  to promote it.” that while the gallery was due to open this week, an official launch would take place next month.With th March marking the one-year anniversary of Tommy’s death, perhaps the new crop of artists present will draw inspiration from the indelible impression left by the gallery’s former incumbent as the space is brought back into use."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/visitor-web.jpg","title":"name chosen for skye resort following cash prize","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe hotel will be situated on the site of the former golf course on the Struan Road in Portree.After receiving close to  entries, Mr Charles Garton Jones # a London-based property developer who also owns the Cow Shed, a boutique bunkhouse in Uig # picked the winning name # #The Bracken Hide#, which was submitted by Skeabost resident Ian Williams.“In all, we had nearly  suggestions,” said Mr Garton Jones. “It was great fun going through them and narrowing them down, but there was one that stood out from the crowd. #The Bracken Hide#, we thought, conveyed a lovely feeling of exploring the wilderness.”Mr Williams, who received a cheque for £ for his winning suggestion, said the idea was prompted by a photo of the resort which sparked a memory from his childhood. He said: “For me, it was the image that was in the press of the building and particularly the roof, which was covered in greenery.

As Moy Park celebrates  years in business, Aaron reflects on changes in the sector and milestones along the way. He said: “I first joined Moy Park in  when I was still at school, working part time at the weekends as a factory operative. “As a student, it was a great insight into the world of work and business. It taught me the value of hard work, money earned, and motivated me to want to do more of both! “After gaining a degree in Health and Leisure from Queen’s University Belfast, I was keen to move into a business environment and decided to apply to Moy Park’s Graduate Management Programme, to find out more about a career in one of our fastest growing industries, agri-food. “The two-year programme was the ideal way to find out more about ious strands of a business, from operations to finance, HR and marketing, and what might suit my skillset best. “From my time as a sht worker on the factory floor, I had a healthy respect and interest in the processing side of Moy Park, and the opportunities and challenges therein. “Once I completed the Graduate Management Programme - which we still use as a recruitment tool today - I took up a position as a sht manager, capitalising on my people management skills and interest in operations. “Since then, I have worked my way up across a number of Moy Park’s sites – moving from factory manager to area manager and have now been General Manager at Ballymena for two years. “Ballymena is a great place to work. From a business point of view, it’s strategically located with fantastic transport links and from a social standpoint, you’ll never find yourself wanting for something to do – from shopping to socialising over a drink or a bite to eat. It’s also quickly becoming the spa capital of Northern Ireland! “While Ballymena has faced a number of economic challenges, it’s an area with a rich history and heritage of business success. This spirit is still very much evidenced by the people, businesses and organisations in the town today. “Mid and East Antrim Council has an ambitious integrated economic development strategy for the area to help encourage business growth across the borough, and it’s one we are keen to help support. “It’s a strategy important not just to Moy Park as a business, but to me personally. “I sit on Mid and East Antrim Council’s Manufacturing Task Force Team, a working group committed to supporting and fostering growth. I was delighted to attend Westminster with a delegation from the Task Force recently when Northern Ireland representatives presented their plans for a Belfast City Deal. “Hearing these plans certainly gave us food for thought when it comes to nurturing growth locally. “As Ballymena’s General Manager, I’m responsible for all business s at the site – from technical to HR and finance. “With over , members of staff, it’s a erse and busy job but that’s what makes it worth doing. In the last  years, business management has evolved signicantly. “While there might be more paperwork, regulations, travel and late nights, there is also an incredible amount of collaboration - with customers, industry, educational bodies and government and our local communications. “Managers today cannot afford to work in silos, you need to adopt an attitude of knowledge sharing and foster an environment of innovation to truly succeed. “My key piece of advice to anyone viewing management as a career is to do your research and bolster your skillsyou need to. Being a good manager isn’t a static position, you constantly need to challenge yourself, and a good employer is one who lets you not only challenge yourself but equips you with the skills to overcome these challenges. “One of my own personal highlights over the last  years was been being named ‘Young Processor of the Year’ at the Meat and Poultry Processing Awards in . “Given my background working on the factory floor, it was great to win an industry award. At a business level, I’ve been very proud to see Ballymena evolve to become a Centre of Excellence, focused on driving innovation in food manufacturing. “As General Manager, it’s my ambition to see our facilities continue to grow.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460456.jpg--.jpg?1550570314000\n","title":"mp hails amber light on scotland bridge plan","story":"North Antrim MP Ian Paisley has welcomed talks about a prospective bridge connecting Northern Ireland and Great Britain.Mr Paisley recently, along with South Antrim DUP MP Paul Girvan met with the Secretary of State for Transport, Chris Grayling to discuss the bridge.After the meeting between the three MPs, the Transport secretary said he would be in contact with the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer in order to discuss a feasibility project which would investigate the economics of the bridge and whether it would make financial sence to construct the bridge.The proposed bridge could be placed anywhere along the Northern Irish coast line, either at the shortest distance to Scotland at  miles or at the longest of  miles.

Speaking after attending the coffee morning Carla Lockhart said: “I have a real passion for children and young people with additional needs. When the Assembly was sitting I championed these causes in all party groups and with the then Ministers.What the Special Olympics Cub does for these young people is amazing. The happiness and confidence they get from participation in sport and the socialising at the club is great to see. I want to continue with my work in championing these causes and lobbying for additional funding for worthwhile causes like this.”Picture Update: Royal visitors join children at SureStart scheme

However, committee member Suzanne Warring said she is confident it will open as planned.“We’re looking at everything that is available in the whole postcode,” she said.“There are very few commercial properties in the area, but we have seen everything that there is, so we’re reaching out to everyone to make sure we get an appropriate site. “At this stage we are still confident we will be opening in September. My daughter is one of the ones who will be going to the school in September and we certainly expect that to happen. Over the next couple of weeks we hope to get the building secured and then we will have enough time to prepare. Because we have the money in place and all of the groundwork has been done in advance, we should be able to open as planned.”According to Ms Warring, the naíscoil has already had an unprecedented amount of applications, which are indicative of a growing demand for Irish-medium education in the area.“It is massively encouraging,” she enthused.“To think that your kids can go to a local naíscoil, bunscoil, or meánscoil in the future is fantastic. It really shows how much things have changed here. The naiscoil is the start and we hope to build on that. We’re trying to build a community around it. There are a lot more Irish speakers in the area than we would have known and it will create a place for those people, and for those who just want to learn.”She continued: “Because of the non-denominational ethos of Irish medium education, we welcome applications from everyone in the community and the inclusive, child-centred nature of Irish medium is exactly what the area needs. “We had an amazing turnout at The Ivanhoe in December for our information morning. Many parents don#t have Irish themselves but we know from the success of our existing Gaelscoileanna that this is not an issue. “The momentum is there and the funding is ready to go. “The committee is working diligently to secure suitable premises to open the doors in September  as planned.

Speaking to the Andersonstown News Councillor Baker said the service willas of Wednesday and Thursday this week, but that there will be no evening service on Friday or Saturday night.Mr Baker said he will also be walking the bus route and “jumping on and off the shuttle buses over the next two nights” to restore confidence in the service. “A lot of work has been going on behind the scenes since the service was pulled last week,” he said. “Everyone has got involved to have this restored. “We need this vital service back. We have to be aware that driver safety, passenger safety is what is important it’s about building confidence. I have to be on the ground with inspectors to build up that confidence. “If anything happens at least I am there, I can identy people because at the end of the day what is happening here is a serious offence, young people could end up with a criminal record here,” he said. “We are looking towards sustainability, working together with the community, Translink, the union, working on a strategy to prevent this from happening ever again. The impact since the service was pulled has been huge. “It’s a one-mile walk from the bottom of Lagmore never mind the safety aspect at night. It’s a service we really need but it’s about making sure the drivers and Translink staff are safe doing their job.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"seamuss inside story of life on the blanket","story":"THE COURSE of Irish history has been marked by insurrection against British rule. The impacts of the ious campaigns have been extensively debated, but certain events, such as the republican struggle against criminalisation in the H-Blocks and Armagh Gaol, are almost universally recognised as catalytic in effecting social change. While we know the blanket protest and the deaths of  men on hunger strike would completely alter the political landscape in Ireland, the lived experiences of the blanket men and women and the horror they endured is much harder to comprehend.As part of wider effort to tell the prisoners’ stories, ex-prisoner Seamus Kearney, who is one of hundreds of people who experienced the ordeal of the H-Blocks, is set to give a talk on his time in prison in St Gall’s GAC on Friday.Seamus was arrested during an IRA operation in Finaghy Road North and was imprisoned in January . He was placed on remand in Crumlin Road Gaol where he admits he was looking forward to some rest after years of struggle, but he didn’t know what to expect.His imprisonment coincided with the building of the H-Blocks, where the first blanket man, Kieran Nugent, had begun his protest against criminalisation just three months earlier. At that time, however, Seamus said, “Nobody knew what way the jails were going.” Indeed, during an early encounter with Kieran Doherty, who would die on hunger strike in , he was informed that his comrades were “disappearing off the face of the earth” after sentence. After his own sentencing, Seamus was moved from the Crumlin Road to H-Block  in June . It was there that he first met future hunger strikers Kevin Lynch, Thomas McElwee and the then block OC, Bobby Sands. During their short time in H, which was then used as a transitional block, Seamus and his comrades resolved to join the blanket protest. Non-conformity meant being locked in a cell for  hours a day and a ‘Number ’ starvation diet.“After refusing a unorm you were told to strip ‘everything’,” he said. “It was all men looking at you, so it was a bit weird. They put the clothes into a brown bag and I remember thinking to myself ‘I’m going to get them back.’“It seemed quite daunting because I thought I was getting some R and R,” he added.“We ended up in H and took each day as it came. One day led to another. Your legs start getting tingly from the lack of exercise, but the idea was to keep walking to keep moving. “After a few months, we were lucky, because at the end of January  Brendan Hughes, ‘The Dark’, arrived. I ended up in cell next to him. Bobby ended up at the far wing of H. Getting Brendan Hughes was amazing. He was already a hero, even then.”According to Seamus, the arrival of Brendan Hughes, who took up command in the blocks, was pivotal in the escalation of the prison protests. The blanket men were isolated from the outside world and the British government was “winning the propaganda war”, but with the men voting in favour of Brendan Hughes’ idea of no-wash protest in February , the protest began gaining public attention.“We needed to recalibrate,” Seamus said.“It was then that we were told that this was not a local jail dispute. This was a part of governmental policy and that it was bigger than we thought. I think the Brits thought we weren’t of the same calibre of Connolly or Pearse – that we would do what we were told. But they were wrong. They were hitting a raw nerve and they didn’t realise it, and maybe we didn’t. We weren’t thinking about what it all meant, but our backs were against the wall.”Seamus continued: “It was about attracting national international interest. We had to open new lines of communication to the outside world and get our story out there, because at that time they were winning the propaganda war.“We were already getting harassed on the way out of our cells, so The Dark said we were going to exploit that going into the no-wash protest. The screws were already beating some of the lads. You were going out one cell at a time and it was one man being hit by about  screws.”Seamus was soon moved to H where he lost Brendan Hughes’ counsel, but said he and his comrades were emboldened at the onset of the no-wash protest. Their ingenuity in sending communications within the blocks and to the outside world is now legendary. It was during that time, amid increasing brutality from the screws, that the prisoners took the decision to smear excrement on walls – a decision that Seamus said was taken reluctantly.“We didn’t know how we would even do it – the mechanics of it,” he said.“We were improvising again. Some bright spark, Tom Martin, had the idea of taking a piece of the mattress and using it as a sponge. That seemed to be the only way to do it. Eventually we did it together. We started smearing it on the wall – it was horrible. After about two weeks the screws went ballistic. I remember the screw opening the cell door and saying ‘you dirty bastards – you fucking animals.’ I think that’s when the real hatred started forming. We didn’t feel good about putting it up anyway. We weren’t animals, but we felt that we had to do it to highlight the case.”Seamus recalls  as bad year for the blanket men, particularly in ‘an seachtain dona’of April that year, when “people were literally beaten off the blanket”. He said the remaining blanket men were determined to “save the IRA from obliteration” and, often, it was comedy that got them through. While you were getting beaten you were still laughing,” he recalled. Seamus tells with a smile of a visit from an old neighbour who cajoled him into singing ‘Smoke Gets in Your Eyes’ by Bryan Ferry – a move that brought applause from the visiting room and, later, a beating from the screws. Needless to say, she never visited again.While the torture endured by the blanket men was immense, Seamus faced one of his toughest challenges when he received word that the IRA had executed his brother, Michael Kearney, as an informer in July . The screws initially mocked his brother’s death, but later offered supposed salvation and a chance to leave the blanket. Michael’s name would not be cleared until  when it was revealed that he had been killed at the behest of IRA informant Freddie Scappaticci, codename Stakekne. However, Seamus remained undaunting in his commitment to the IRA during his  years in prison. “I gave him my blessing to join the IRA,” he said.“I felt he betrayed me and he betrayed Ireland. I didn’t know what I was going to do. Everything stood still.“I was in the middle of no-man’s land. I was neither with the IRA or the British and I felt shell-shocked. The first thing that went through my mind was ‘What am I going to tell the lads ’“It was the first time I realised the distinction between mind and body, which you’ll not understand until it happens,” he added.“My body was telling me I’d had enough – I was starving, I had lice, I had dysentery – but my mind was saying, ‘Tell themto fuck off.’ “I told them I had lots of brothers. There were  of them, one of them was dead, but I had Sean on the outside and I had brothers in the H-Blocks.“I told the lads that the only way they would take me out isthey carried me out. They weren’t going to break the back of the IRA.”The H-Blocks saw a hunger strike in  that saw the British government renege on a deal it had struck with the prisoners. Tragically,  men – Bobby Sands, Francis Hughes, Raymond McCreesh, Patsy O’Hara, Joe McDonnell, Martin Hurson, Kevin Lynch, Kieran Doherty, Thomas McElwee and Michael Devine – died on hunger strike the following year. Of the  that died, Seamus knew six of them personally, and he vividly recalls the last time he saw Bobby Sands during Mass in February .“At the end of the Mass Bobby went round the lads clockwise,” he said.“He came to me and smiled and said ‘I see you’re still here,’ and I knew it was in relation to our Michael. I said ‘There’s nowhere  to go, Bobby.’ He looked straight into my eyes and said ‘Good man – goodbye.’“I had doubted him. Most of our wing had doubted him. To me he was just like a Rod Stewart lookalike. I had given him the words to ‘This Old Heart of Mine’ before – he liked that song. When I looked into his eyes that Sunday they were like a shark’s eyes. He had resigned himself and I knew he was going to go through with.“The hunger strike was a formality. Bobby didn’t really die on May the th – he died in February. One after another they died and it was like losing a part of yourself. It was the same reaction I had to losing our Michael. It was like losing brothers. It was so catastrophic – and it still is. “Maybe it’s a physiological thing that I don’t understand, but when I talk about it I can still feel that emotion asit was yesterday and I still struggle to get over it. I know I speak for a lot of the lads who can’t have this conversation, but something broke inside me.”Those who knew the men who died most keenly feel the sadness of . For Seamus, the death of his friend Thomas McElwee, who he knew from H, was most dficult of all, and one that he finds most painful to speak about. He talks about his friend fondly, and will no doubt do so as he tells his own chapter in the dramatic account of the blanket men. “You are trying to bring people into that world and a lot of the lads can’t talk about it – most of them don’t,” he said.“For me, you don’t just talk about the protest, you actually relive it. Once you open that Pandora’s box you don’t know what you’re letting out, so a lot of the lads keep it closed.“Today, with the rise of Sinn Féin, the republican movement is healthy. It is a direct result of the fight against criminalisation. We thought it would be a footnote in Irish history, but it became a pivotal moment. Of the ten men who died on hunger strike I knew six of them personally. It was such an intimate death for all of them that it’s dficult to talk about.”Seamus will give his talk about le on the blanket in St Galls GAC this Friday evening, March , at .pm.

A maximum bus lane speed of mph will apply.The scheme also includes iable message signs to advise when the bus lanes are in operation, upgraded CCTV and the introduction of priority signalling for buses at the Fortwilliam and Duncrue Street junctions.Stephen Pollock from the Department for Infrastructure said: “The investment reflects the Department’s policy to assist key bus and Park and Ride services on the M and M approaches to Belfast which have become some of the most congested sections of the road network, particularly at peak times.”The work to the M lanes includes a revised road layout on the approach and exit of the Belfast bound Lisburn Services , with slip roads ened to allow buses to continue on the hard shoulder and merge with traffic leaving and re-joining the motorway. Drivers and motorcyclists using the Lisburn services should take extra care as they become familiar with the new layout by checking for buses in the hard shoulder and only merging when it is safe to do so. At all times the hard shoulder will remain available for use in an emergency.

Chief among them is they want to examine any agreement to ensure the backstop is temporary.\"We know the current backstop arrangements are meant to be temporary and all the assurances in the world from the EU that they will negotiate in good faith etc, it doesnt change that,\" he told the BBC.\"What we need to have is legally binding change not assurances about what we know already.\"We want to get a deal, we certainly are not in the business of running down the clock towards some kind of no deal scenario.FacebookTwitterHe said any change to the withdrawal agreement would have to have \"legal effect\".\"The more important question is, what is it that has to change \"The problem with it is that at the minutethe agreement is accepted in its current form The UK will only every be able to get out of it either by having a full customs union and high single market alignment for the whole of the UK or Northern Ireland left behind in such an arrangement.

The Government have confirmed that @MattHancock, the HEALTH Secretary will be acting as a human shield🛡for Chris Grayling and responding to the UQ granted to @AndyMcDonaldMP to ask about the Department for Transport’s payment of £m to Eurotunnel.— Labour WhipsMarch , Downing Street said that Prime Minister Theresa May continues to have full confidence in Mr Grayling.Asked why the Transport Secretary was not answering a question from his Labour shadow about ferry contracts, Mrs May’s official spokesman said: “The settlement with Eurotunnel was a cross-Government decision, as the provision of freight capacity was largely designed to secure the ongoing supply of crucial medicines, medical supplies and veterinary medicines.“So it’s entirely appropriate for the Health Secretary to answer the question.”The Labour whips office said the Government had confirmed Mr Hancock was acting as “human shield” for Mr Grayling.Speaking in the Commons, shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said: “Even in this golden age of ministerial incompetence, the Transport Secretary stands out from the crowd.“He leaves a trail of destruction in his wake, causing chaos and wasting billions of pounds yet he shows no contrition, no acknowledgement of his mistakes nor any resolve to learn and improve.“He’s now ridiculed in the New York Times, the mayor of Calais has banned him from his town – the Transport Secretary has become an international embarrassment.”Mr McDonald went on: “The public deserve to know how many more calamities is the Prime Minister prepared to tolerate and how many more billions of pounds will she allow him to waste before saying enough is enough.“This country cannot afford this Transport Secretary. He should be sacked without delay.”SNP transport spokesman Alan Brown added: “Where is the £. billion man  I’ve asked him to step aside several times, I’ve challenged the Prime Minister to sack him and now he’s got his own social media hashtag #FailingGrayling, surely now is the time that he has to go ”The Transport Secretary is working hard on making sure we improve the transport systemHealth Secretary Matt HancockFacebookTwitterMr Grayling was earlier panned by MPs over his role in probation reforms, which prompted Labour’s Diana Johnsonto note: “I must say I think this must be making parliamentary history this afternoon, two urgent questions about the same incompetent minister causing mayhem and chaos in two dferent departments and he doesn’t even have the face to come here and front it out and what we’re left with is Hancock’s Half Hour ”Mr Hancock replied: “In the Hancock family we’re very proud of Hancock’s Half hour and we thought that Tony was a very funny man.”Commons Speaker John Bercow intervened: “Yes, it’s worth pointing out that that Hancock was deliberately funny.”When he was asked directly where Mr Grayling was, Mr Hancock replied: “The Transport Secretary is working hard on making sure we improve the transport system.”It was announced last week that Eurotunnel, which operates the Channel Tunnel, would no longer challenge the Department for Transport’s decision to award deals worth £ million to Seaborne Freight, DFDS and Brittany Ferries to lay on additional crossings to ports other than Dover in the case of a no-deal Brexit.Mr Grayling’s catalogue of controversies gained international recognition in a New York Times article questioning how he survives.The piece said: “He has bumbled his way from one government post to another, accused of making a hash of each, and becoming a byword for haplessness in a golden age of political blundering in Britain.”"},{"url":null,"title":"teacher who reads bedtime stories via facebook live draws thousands of views","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSpring EditionHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The success of Tucked-in Tuesdays has inevitably led to authors reaching out, with some sending books and even offering to come and read at the school.Meanwhile Dr George has extended invitations to authors to join her as guests, while one student has been so inspired that he has been writing a story for her to read.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  But Dr George believes that perhaps the biggest lesson isn’t an educational one.“On Tuesdays I don’t go anywhere after I read because it would be horriblethe kids saw meI tucked them in and then I’m out!” she said. “That’s my Tucked-in-Tuesday as well. “The biggest lesson isn’t even educational, it’s that the kids know their principal cares beyond the end of the day.

As everyone knows, Dromara is a strong club but this year surpassed all expectations with the club being the only one in Ireland to have its members win two INFC Nationals.N Black  Son won the Friendship National and N Edgar  Son won the Skibbereen National.The Edgar partnership had a fantastic young bird season as well, winning the NIPA Young Bird National from Rosscarbery.N Black  Son also won the NIPA section D Old Bird Channel fancier.

I just want to try and put out what Irsquove been feeling for a long time.Conal first developed a love for music by listening to his big brotherrsquos Elvis Presley records.He later began to perform as the lead singer with the local band Bone Idle before moving on to Freak Out and then to Sweet Leaf mdash the band he fronted for  years.ldquoIrsquove been fronting rock bands for the last  years since my early twenties and it was always just covers like AC DC, Led Zeppelin and Lynyrd Skynyrd, Conal continued.ldquoBut when I started to write music, that wasnrsquot what was coming out of me. It was more singer songwriter, folky stuff.ldquoIt wasnrsquot really a surprise to me as the stuff I would have listened to outside my giging would have been the likes of Bob Dylan and Steve Earle.Conal is recording his new songs with the band Stillwater, which also features Killyleagh musician Damien Hanna.While he is experiencing a creative purple patch, the father-of-four does not yet know when the music will be available.ldquoI donrsquot have a title for my new EP yet as Irsquom still writing and Irsquom still recording. I would hope that the EP would be out by the summer and the album by the end of the year but you never know, the EP could turn into the album.He and Stillwater performed two of Conalrsquos new tracks, Venus and All of the People, in an interview on That Like That on NVTV.Conal says that the second track is really resonating with people.ldquoThis track is aimed at society in general, not only young people on Facebook, but all those who point the finger at somebody and gang up on some poor soul, he explained.ldquoThen when something happens to that poor soul, then yoursquoll get the smiley faces and comments of lsquoHe was a great fellarsquo or lsquoShe was a great girlrsquo and hopefully it teaches them a lesson to realise what people might be going through on the inside.Conal is a regular at Denvirrsquos in Downpatrick and will next perform with Stillwater in Portrush Town Hall at the North West  in MayTo watch Conalrsquos interview and performance on NVTVrsquos Talk Like That visit twww.nvtv shows talk-like-that-conal-montgomery Conal and Stillwater on their Facebook pages or ring Conal on  ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"De La Salle head ‘disappointed’ at decision  ","story":"THE principal of De La Salle School in Downpatrick has spoken of his ldquodisappointment in this weekrsquos statement from the Red High Parents and Friends Association.Mr Ciaran Maguire called on all four schools earmarked for the proposed lsquosuper schoolrsquo in Downpatrick ldquoto come together and put their best foot forward.Mr Maguire said he was disappointed for the trustees of De La Salle and St Patrickrsquos, who ldquohave given so much of their lives to the families in East Down.He described their involvement in education has been one of ldquogreat success and achievement.Mr Maguire said De La Salle and St Patrickrsquos were ldquotwo highly effective schools meeting the needs of young men and women in the greater Downpatrick area.He said the trustees had the confidence of staff, pupils and parents at De La Salle and from the wider business community.Mr Maguire remarked: ldquoWithin my last two years as principal of De La Salle, I have witnessed on a daily basis children going to and from St Patrickrsquos, to St Maryrsquos to De La Salle, accessing a curriculum that isnrsquot possible within their own school and sharing both the knowledge and expertise from each of these schools, where the results have been nothing short of excellent for each pupil.ldquoThis collaboration has been up and running successfully for years and is a model of good practice for other post-primary schools to see.ldquoWhat is wrong in having a rsquosuper schoolrsquo  Do the families in the greater Downpatrick area not deserve it  A school where children regardless of ability can achieve their potential He continued: ldquoThe new school will cater for every child. No child will be disadvantaged or be selected to attend this new school. For once they will have control over their choice of post-primary education.ldquoWhat is proposed is a Catholic school, with a strong Catholic Lasallian ethos. No child will be turned away because of not making the threshold grade. They will wear the same unorm, access the same curriculum and extracurricular activities and be treated with the same care and respect that they currently receive in their respective schools.Mr Maguire added: ldquoThis is something that very few communities in Northern Ireland can avail of. The pupils of Downpatrick and beyond have amalgamated through collaboration at GCSE and GCE level.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The Government have confirmed that @MattHancock, the HEALTH Secretary will be acting as a human shield#for Chris Grayling and responding to the UQ granted to @AndyMcDonaldMP to ask about the Department for Transportrsquos payment of poundm to Eurotunnel.mdash Labour WhipsMarch , Downing Street said that Prime Minister Theresa May continues to have full confidence in Mr Grayling.Asked why the Transport Secretary was not answering a question from his Labour shadow about ferry contracts, Mrs Mayrsquos official spokesman said: ldquoThe settlement with Eurotunnel was a cross-Government decision, as the provision of freight capacity was largely designed to secure the ongoing supply of crucial medicines, medical supplies and veterinary medicines.ldquoSo itrsquos entirely appropriate for the Health Secretary to answer the question.The Labour whips office said the Government had confirmed Mr Hancock was acting as ldquohuman shield for Mr Grayling.Speaking in the Commons, shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said: ldquoEven in this golden age of ministerial incompetence, the Transport Secretary stands out from the crowd.ldquoHe leaves a trail of destruction in his wake, causing chaos and wasting billions of pounds yet he shows no contrition, no acknowledgement of his mistakes nor any resolve to learn and improve.ldquoHersquos now ridiculed in the New York Times, the mayor of Calais has banned him from his town ndash the Transport Secretary has become an international embarrassment.Mr McDonald went on: ldquoThe public deserve to know how many more calamities is the Prime Minister prepared to tolerate and how many more billions of pounds will she allow him to waste before saying enough is enough.ldquoThis country cannot afford this Transport Secretary. He should be sacked without delay.SNP transport spokesman Alan Brown added: ldquoWhere is the pound. billion man  Irsquove asked him to step aside several times, Irsquove challenged the Prime Minister to sack him and now hersquos got his own social media hashtag #FailingGrayling, surely now is the time that he has to go Mr Grayling was earlier panned by MPs over his role in probation reforms, which prompted Labourrsquos Diana Johnsonto note: ldquoI must say I think this must be making parliamentary history this afternoon, two urgent questions about the same incompetent minister causing mayhem and chaos in two dferent departments and he doesnrsquot even have the face to come here and front it out and what wersquore left with is Hancockrsquos Half Hour Mr Hancock replied: ldquoIn the Hancock family wersquore very proud of Hancockrsquos Half hour and we thought that Tony was a very funny man.Commons Speaker John Bercow intervened: ldquoYes, itrsquos worth pointing out that that Hancock was deliberately funny.When he was asked directly where Mr Grayling was, Mr Hancock replied: ldquoThe Transport Secretary is working hard on making sure we improve the transport system.It was announced last week that Eurotunnel, which operates the Channel Tunnel, would no longer challenge the Department for Transportrsquos decision to award deals worth pound million to Seaborne Freight, DFDS and Brittany Ferries to lay on additional crossings to ports other than Dover in the case of a no-deal Brexit.Mr Graylingrsquos catalogue of controversies gained international recognition in a New York Times article questioning how he survives.The piece said: ldquoHe has bumbled his way from one government post to another, accused of making a hash of each, and becoming a byword for haplessness in a golden age of political blundering in Britain..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: MPs maul  uinternational embarrassment u Chris Grayling over Commons no-show article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Later he appeared in daytime soaps such as ABCrsquos Loving.Luke Perryrsquos big break came in  But at the cusp of the s he was cast in Aaron Spellingrsquos Fox TV series Beverly Hills,  and his career accelerated.Playing the brooding son of a millionaire, Perry became a household name.He had originally auditioned for the role of jock Steve Sanders but was thought more suited to the morally ambiguous and often conflicted McKay.Alongside Justin Timberlake, Perryrsquos image was found plastered across the bedroom walls of teenage girls in the US and UK.Beverly Hills,  set a template for teen drama that would be reused and repurposed by programmes including The OC and later Gossip Girl.It followed a group of friends living in the exclusive and star-studded community of Beverly Hills as they start at college and face the adult world.Two years later Perry won a supporting role in the film version of Buffy The Vampire Slayer, starring in the movie Terminal Bliss the same year.The US network Fox saw its ratings soar and the media regularly compared Perry to the actor James Dean, who died aged  following a car accident.Feeling he had outgrown the show, Perry quit in  and began looking for more mature roles.Luke Perry and Alyson Hannigan launch the stage adaptation of When Harry Met Sally The next three years saw him star in an independent film and a clutch of science fiction features.But he did not find the career breakthrough he longed for and ed to his role as McKay in  for financial reasons.The late s and noughties saw Perry find consistent work on television including on HBO prison drama Oz from  and  and Windfall, a series following friends who win the lottery, in .Yet all the while he was unable to escape the character he created on the by then ubiquitous Beverly Hills, .A  revival did not include Perry, with him telling fans at the time that a new series which did not feature longtime producer Aaron Spelling was simply a pale imitation.He said: ldquoThe dference between CW bringing something back and Aaron Spelling doing something back is signicant, and I cannot do it without Aaron.Perry cameoed in programmes including The Simpsons and took to the stage in a Broadway revival of The Rocky Horror Show in  as well as a London production of When Harry Met Sally as Harry.Ironically, he would eventually find the steady television work he craved in a programme that knowingly, often overtly, referenced the teen dramas he helped pioneer.Riverdale ndash available in the UK on Netflix and based on a series of Archie Comics ndash nodded towards the intrigue of Twin Peaks with the hormone-fuelled drama of Beverly Hills, .Perry played Fred Andrews ndash father to the seriesrsquo main character Archie Andrews ndash and found renewed interest in the showrsquos transatlantic fan base.His first brush with serious illness came in  when a colonoscopy revealed precancerous growths.Perry married the actress Rachel Sharp in  and they had two children, Jack and Sophie, before splitting in . Jack continues to work as a professional wrestler, performing under the name Jungle Boy Nat Coy.On February   Perry suffered an unexpected and serious stroke at his home in Sherman Oaks in Calornia.

How did you get started in the industry  When we first opened Asia Supermarket in , it was the family’s ambition to bring a taste of home to Belfast. We brought the Chinese culture to the local community through cuisine and provided authentic and tasty ingredients for the hospitality trade here. We branched out due to demand to also provide Indian, Korean, Philippine, Thai and Middle Eastern food and are always looking for opportunities to extend our range. Typically, who are your clients or customers  Our customers would be both wholesale and retail to include restaurants all over Northern Ireland, as well as consumers who want to create some unique dishes in their home kitchens. Do you enjoy what you do, and what in particular  Yes, and in particular having just completed the new build we have enjoyed being involved in the day-to-day aspects, given the bespoke nature of the project, coupled with the hustle and bustle of the day to day challenges of satisfying our customer needs. What is the most dficult part of your job  One of the most dficult parts of the job is sourcing good quality produce at competitive prices and enhancing the range of products available. However, we’re very proud of our new supermarket and warehouse which provides even more quality and choice for our customers. What are the challenges facing your sector, and the economy in general  One of the biggest challenges facing our sector is the cost of goods from our suppliers, particularly those procured in foreign currencies which in turn has a knock-on effect on what we charge our wholesale and retail customers. To maintain our share of the market we constantly endeavour to get the best prices from our suppliers so that we can pass on competitive prices to our customers to maintain and grow our market share. With Brexit looming it will bring a major impact on imports costs and supplier prices which will present a major challenge for our business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cctv.jpg","title":"from cctv to gdpr the people keeping your business safe","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by John Mulgrew Ulster Business examines an ever-changing approach to business security and what companies are turning to in an increasingly digital age Is Big Brother watching you  For many, the idea of a society peppered with cameras and other forms of security harks back to the view of a dystopian Orwellian society. But with the UK having some of the highest levels of CCTV cameras in the world, businesses in particular are ensuring that both their physical security, along with digital and paper footprints, are protected. Angela Bennett, joint managing director of Belfast-based Diamond Systems says the role of the security system has evolved hugely in the last few years to become something of a capital investment. Offering more than surveillance, the new security systems we are using provide everything from analysis of the way a firm works to conventional protection. And she says an “ever-increasing” demand around health and safety in the workplace is encouraging more investment in reliable security that is as integral to a firm’s operations as its IT network. “Businesses now treat security systems as a capital investment in technology designed to ensure business continuity, monitor workflow processes, and help manage the ever-increasing demands around health and safety in the workplace,” Angela says. “We are seeing more reliance being placed on security systems, particularly CCTV, as an integral part of site safety management systems. Intelligent system design is essential at the outset of any CCTV project, to ensure adequate coverage and image usability, even in low light conditions.” There have been sophisticated advances in video camera technology in the last few years which have offered businesses new capabilities including motion detection that records only the things that matter, ‘heatmapping’ to determine where the most traffic flows in an area to people counting and unusual motion detection. These new abilities sht the former role of the CCTV camera to a new level, allowing it to file more information about the operations and trends in your business, and Angela agrees.  “CCTV is also being used as a value-added tool, where analytics are incorporated into the video management system ,” she says. “Software analytics are currently benefiting the retail sector for example, helping to plan store layouts, the locations for promotion points, and the forecasting of required staffing levels.” Increasingly sophisticated security also demands its own security, Angela says. “Businesses do however need to be aware of the emerging cyber risks associated with CCTV systems, and how to proactively address them. Choosing a specialist such as Diamond, will ensure that cyber risks are addressed at system design stage, and that systems installed are both future-proof and intelligent,” she says. Beyond CCTV other trends prevalent in business security include compliance with GDPR , cloud security, and articial intelligence and among the top trends for  will be a boost in heightened cloud security. Wikibon, the open source technology knowledge sharing community, projects that the cloud’s share of enterprise computing will grow from % currently to % by . “In terms of future trends, articial intelligence, sensor integration and environmental smart tech are all future demands that will shape the security industry’s offering,” Angela says. “Through partnerships with the leading global innovators, Diamond are at the forefront of this new technology and we will see change coming at a rapid pace over the next few years.” Headquartered in Lisburn with locations in Dublin, Limerick and London, Mercury Security  Facilities Management is a security firm and facilities management business. And according to boss Frank Cullen, the service it provides has transformed considerably since the company was formed back in . “In order for security companies to truly provide fit-for-purpose security solutions to clients, it is crucial that they move with the times – embracing advances in technology, adapting to changing legislation and understanding the changing nature of crime itself. “Cyber-security, in particular, has become a massive issue so the importance of a high degree of IT competence within your security company cannot be overstated. By their very nature, most security systems require external connections to the public internet and are therefore potentially vulnerable. So very good firewall protection must be employed and the support of a dedicated and knowledgeable IT department is essential.” Some of the firms specialising in cyber-security here include Sophos – a UK-based business which develops products for communication endpoint, encryption, network security and email security. And for the digital and hard copy, Belfast-based Morgan Document Security works with both the private and public sector around storing, archiving, retrieving documentation, records, legal papers and files. As with others, Mercury’s Frank Cullen says that the introduction of GDPR in May last year has had a “massive impact on security with signicantly increased financial penalties for companies that do not carefully protect the rights of iniduals – and this includes how CCTV images are handled and controlled”. While it is now very easy to provide managers with access to images on their mobile phones and portable devices, doing so could well mean that you would be breaking the lawvery carefully controlled procedures are not in place to protect the image data, how it is to be observed and by whom. “From a hardware point of view, it is important for security providers to have the competence and capability to assess potential manufacturers and their equipment at the most detailed of levels and to have awareness of the regulatory requirements in which they must work.” Elsewhere, there’s been some movement in other elements of the security business in Northern Ireland. Newtownabbey firm Environmental Street Furniturehas announced the acquisition of Co Down based specialist perimeter security company, Sentry Posts. Sentry Posts is a supplier of bollard systems, perimeter security and traffic products in Ireland. Since establishing in , the company has partnered with ATG Access, supplying prestigious projects including Arsenal Football Club’s Emirates Stadium, Wellington Arch in London, as well as the Europa Hotel and Charles Hurst and Trust Ford dealerships in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cleaver_1.jpg","title":"is the future bright for the ni energy market","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by Ulster Business It is clear that there are a number of signicant challenges facing the energy sector in Northern Ireland but where there are challenges, there are also opportunities, according to law firm Cleaver Fulton Rankin.The ExecutiveNorthern Ireland has just completed its second year without a ing local government and in the words of David Sterling, head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, the Civil Service is “… doing everything we can in the prevailing circumstances…but civil servants cannot take the place of ministers when it comes to strategic policy development or in taking transformative decisions”.  This is very much the case with regard to energy policy. The Department of the Economy’s Strategic Energy Framework, which was endorsed by the Executive in , has over the last nine years, led to some very positive changes to the energy generation and supply mix, particularly from renewable sources.However the  year framework is nearing its end and needs to be replaced. The Department is making such preparations as it can on a draft Strategic Energy Framework across the areas of heat, electricity, transport and energy efficiency which it aims to make public some time in the spring. Whether or not this region has its Assembly back to adopt such a framework will remain to be seen, but in the meantime it will ensure the subject remains live and high on the agenda.Brexit and I-SEMThe new wholesale electricity market known as the Integrated Single Electricity Marketwent live on October , . It is designed to deliver increased levels of competition which, it is hoped, will help put downward pressure on prices as well as encouraging greater levels of security of supply and transparency. While the island of Ireland is now integrated more closely with European markets, there is a risk that Brexit could halt this integration. British and Irish business groups and energy trade associations such as the CBI, IBEC, Electricity Association of Ireland, RenewableUK, British Irish Chamber of Commerce and EnergyUK all refer to the delivery of I-SEM, or to the UK’s continued access to the IEM, as post-Brexit priorities for security of supply and or consumer protection. I-SEM is clearly a priority that must be preserved.While Brexit may present challenges and continuing uncertainty, there are certainly opportunities for investment and acquisition in the electricity market as more complex, specialist expertise will be required to effectively trade power on the I-SEM. Policy barriers or inaction cannot be allowed to prevent I-SEM from realising its potential of fully integrating the market by efficiently moving energy from producer to demand.Renewable incentive schemesDespite being on track to hit its target of % of electricity generation from renewables, Northern Ireland risks being left behind. The lack of a replacement for the development support mechanism, Renewables Obligations Certicateafter its closure in April , means Northern Ireland is lagging behind Great Britain which has established the Contract for Dference regime and Ireland, which has started work on its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme . While neither scheme is perfect, doing nothing is not an option. The devolution of energy presented Northern Ireland with the opportunity to shape its own policy but without a government, will the sector and the infrastructure be able to remain fit for purpose GasWith its development over the last  years, the gas network in Northern Ireland, with its low population density, must be seen as a success story. Consumers and businesses have been offered greater choice in terms of price and security of supply. Nevertheless there are certainly further opportunities for gas distributors and suppliers to expand the natural gas network, particularly in the west of the country and east Co Down. So despite the apparent obstacles and challenges, there is opportunity for development and progress in Northern Ireland’s energy sector. The benefits for Northern Ireland will be in terms of security of supply, price and environmental sustainability. Cleaver Fulton Rankin,  Bedford Street, Belfast BT FW.
