Photograph: iStockIf you buy a plane ticket and your flight is cancelled, you are protected under European law. The airline has to either give you a refund or reroute you on a flight of your choosing. If you are overseas when the cancellation happens, the airline has to look after you until it can bring you home. And if it – rather than, for example, the weather, war or a pandemic – is to blame for the delay, then you might be able to get some compensation too.If you buy something in a shop and it breaks before you get it home, or is otherwise not fit for purpose, or not as advertised, the place you bought it has to look after you with a refund or a repair or a replacement with the bottom line being you should not be left out of pocket if it fails to live up to its side of the contract, or if it overpromises and underdelivers.But when it comes to matters of the heart, many of the protections we take for granted seem to vanish, or at least that was the experience of a reader by the name of Paula.Last summer she signed up to a matchmaking service and paid about €1,000 to go on the company’s books. And what did she get for her money? Obviously a successful relationship is not something that any agency could have promised, but she was promised that suitable introductions would be arranged between her and other agency clients.And Paula was happy enough with that. But she didn’t get her happy ever after. Or even happy for a few weeks.So, what happened to get her to that point?Well, Paula joined the dating agency last summer and paid the pretty hefty joining fee. “Once they took my money, I didn’t hear anything so I contacted them in September. They told me they were very busy so I gave them the benefit of the doubt, they then found a match a week later. I had not one thing in common with this person.”Paula says this was in spite of promises made at the outset that matches would be based on a particular set of elements to ensure a certain level of compatibility. “They claimed they put a lot of effort into the matches, which was not my experience.”More time passed and “again I heard nothing from them, so I contacted them again at the start of December. They told me they don’t contact people unless they have a match and told me to read the terms and conditions. I said one bad match in over four months isn’t a very good service.”A few days she heard back from the company to say it had a match, and Paula said okay.Then she heard the new match “was away and I would have to wait till the new year. I replied to say that wasn’t good enough and they said it had been a match, so they had fulfilled their contract.”“The company said it would ‘do me the courtesy’ of arranging another match with another man who was more polar opposite than the first one. Again I heard nothing from them and contacted them at the start of March, eight months on from when I signed up, for them to tell me they had fulfilled their contract of three introductions and it wasn’t their fault that one was unavailable.Paula says she was told that the company had “found you three matches so far, and I understand that it was not up to you that one was unavailable, but it is also not our fault as we cannot control when people are and aren’t free”.Well we had not come across this before so we contacted the the CCPC to find out what, if any, protections Paula and people like her had in circumstances like this. After all, €1,000 is a lot of money to part with without any comeback on behalf of the purchaser.ResponseThe CCPC said that under Irish law Paula had the right to expect that the service was “carried out with proper care and attention” and that the “business providing the service has the appropriate skills to do the job”.A spokeswoman for the commission said that if someone believes a service provider did not meet these standards, “for example, if they felt that the proper care and attention in finding suitable matches was not given, the consumer is entitled to go back to the business and negotiate a suitable redress option. Depending on the circumstances, this could either be a full or partial refund of the service fee or an alternative option that the consumer would be happy to accept.”The spokeswoman noted that Paula had already been in touch with the business and said that “in such circumstances, we would suggest that the consumer sends a formal written complaint to the business, outlining the difficulties they are experiencing and include the above information in relation to their statutory rights under the Sale of Goods \u0026amp Supply of Services Act. They should also clearly set out how they would like the matter to be resolved.”Unfortunately, the law does not specify what a consumer is entitled to in such cases, so it’s up to the consumer to negotiate a suitable redress option with the business directly.“We suggest referencing any specific sections in the T\u0026ampCs that may support their case for redress and outline how they would like the issue to be resolved,” the spokeswoman said.Elaine Fahy felt she had no choice but to make contact with Pricewatch over the “terrible time” her father has been having with Virgin Media. She says that despite the fact the company was unable to provide him with much by way of service over the course of the lockdowns – a time when he, like the rest of us, needed a decent way to communicate with the outside world – he kept paying his bill, and even after he moved out of his home following the death of his wife, he kept paying the bills.The last came in the form of a text from the company to him demanding a further payment.“I am a 76-year-old pensioner and recently a widower living alone and am blind in one eye,” his letter to the company started.“I now no longer live there. I lost phone and internet reception during lockdown and contacted Virgin Media – without much success. After several further phone calls, long holds, much cost and highly confusing attempts to reroute me to platforms I do not understand, I called to notify that I was leaving Virgin Media.”His letter says that he has “not been able to live in the house since then for a variety of health and other reasons. I had notified Virgin Media that I had no reception for a very long time and that I was unable to deal with such woeful customer service at such a difficult point in my life, in addition to lockdown. I have not received any bills or statements of account from Virgin Media since August 2019 but kept on paying nonetheless over the years €108 per month regularly without fail, which I regret very much, thereby accepting the disgraceful, unaccountable and non-transparent customer service of Virgin Media.”In January he received the text message looking for payment. “I am disgusted to be sent such a demand as the letter of January 21st, 2022. I am shocked also to be treated this way and will not pay any threatening letter accusing me of wrongdoing. I hereby request a refund of all services since August 2019. Please note I am hereby notifying the relevant regulator and will go on social media to expose this threatening and upsetting behaviour and failure to provide customer service. I will not be held liable for the woeful customer service of Virgin Media under any circumstances.”We contacted Virgin who immediately started looking into the matter for our reader. But in the meantime he got a letter from a debt collection agency demanding immediate payment of just less than €400.“We’ve been attempting to engage with you in an attempt to arrange payment of the outstanding amount you owe Virgin Media,” the correspondence started. “Unfortunately our attempts have been unsuccessful and so we’re considering legal action to recover the balance.“The next step involves passing your account to our solicitor for legal action. Any claim that is issued will be for the full outstanding amount in addition to any additional interest that is still to be added under the terms of your loan agreement. We’ll also seek to recover all costs, and any approved court legal costs. The result of this will be an increase in the amount which you’re required to pay.”ResponseWe contacted the company who investigated the matter and subsequently confirmed that it has been resolved “on good terms with our former customer. The account has been cleared, there are no monies owed and debt collection has been cancelled. Most importantly we have apologised for the length of time it took us to respond and correct this.“I have a query about a television that I purchased three years ago,” starts a mail from a reader called PJ.The television was bought in November 2018 and just after Christmas this year it started to malfunction. “I went to the shop where I bought the television to find out what they could do for me.“They said I did not purchase an extended warranty and there was nothing they could do for me as they only have a two-year limit on fixing problems that arise. I was looking on the consumer website and on this they said it was six-year period over which a problem could be raised. I informed them about this and was told they would get back to me. I had to go back three times and talk to three different people over a three-week period before I got an answer.”And what was the answer? He was told that “they could not do anything for me as it would cost them money to fix the problem. I was told that I could go to the small claims court and I would more than likely win the case but that is all they wouldcould do.“This seems like a lot of wasted time and more expense to me when they think they will lose the claim.”So, what PJ wants to know is if there is a six-year limit to bring a problem to their attention in which they need to fix the problem? If so, do they need to fix the problem free of charge? Who does he need to contact to get the problem resolved?Well, under EU law consumers across Europe have the right to seek redress when a good is faulty for a period of up to two years. It is better if you live in the Republic of Ireland. Under Irish law, the limitation period is actually six years.If a fault arises within the first six months of purchase, it is presumed to have existed at the time of delivery and it is up to the seller to prove otherwise or provide remedies. After six months, the consumer may be requested to show that the lack of conformity (for example, a hidden defect) already existed at the time of delivery. The seller should first offer a repair or replacement (liaising with the manufacturer if necessary) and provide this free of charge. If this is not possible or fails to correct the problem, then the consumer may request a refund.But that six years depends on multiple factors. The amount you pay for a product and the reasonable expectations as to how long it lasts are key here. If you spend €3,000 on a sofa and it falls apart after three years through no fault of your own, you can most likely seek redress under the Sale of Goods Act. Similarly, if you spend €1,000 on a smart phone that just stops working after 14 months, you can seek redress. If the digital watch you bought for a fiver in a discount store breaks after five years, 11 months and 29 days and you wander in looking for a refund, you can most likely whistle for it.So, it depends on how much PJ paid for the telly. He would not be entitled to a free repair or a replacement. And as with many products, it might end up costing more to repair the television than it is actually worth. But at the very least he should expect a significant percentage of the price of the television to be knocked off the purchase of a new television.A reader called Sinéad contacted us after dealing with a particular company took a heavy toll on her.“I have recently had a miserable experience attempting to resolve an erroneous request for payment and fixed penalty arising from the M50 eFlow toll,” her email began.“I am currently resident in the UK, and drove my GB-registered car to Ireland in October 2021 to visit my family for the first time since March 2020. In the course of my stay, I passed under the M50 electronic toll sensor three times. For each trip, my partner paid the toll online within 24 hours, as per the terms and conditions, and we thought no more about it.”That is not, obviously, where her story ends, as she made clear when she contacted us last week. “Last Saturday, I received a standard payment request from eFlow stating that I owed the toll fee for all three journeys along with an STR penalty for unpaid fees, to be paid to Euro Parking PLC, which is apparently their preferred UK debt collector.”Sinéad “naively” thought that this would be easily cleared up once she forwarded payment confirmation. “However, after four days of circular online chat ‘help’ and emails bouncing back from their only complaints point of contact, I am not so sure. I have written a formal complaint, and will make one to their governing body TII, but there are multiple tales of woe online, especially for company cars, rental vehicles and non-Irish registration plates.”She says that surely the main functions of an electronic toll system “are to accurately identify the registration number of vehicles using their service, and correctly correspond the recorded journeys and payment references. The amount of time spent trying to resolve the issue has been infuriating, but I am not inclined to pay a fine I did not incur.”ResponseWe contacted the company and received the following statement: “eFlow is aware of recent payment and service difficulties experienced by an M50 eFlow user. The user correctly paid for their eFlow journey upon completion and within the required timeframe. However, due to an isolated system error, the payment was not registered correctly which led to the user being issued a fine.“When the user queried this fine with eFlow customer service, they did not receive a satisfactory resolution or customer experience in line with our service expectations. eFlow has addressed the user’s issue and has apologised to the customer for the inconvenience caused. Customer service is a top priority for eFlow, and we are committed to continuously working and improving to benefit our service users.”Next up we have a reader called Susan who was fortunate enough to receive several gift vouchers for Christmas for various high-end restaurants and a spa hotel.She says she was “delighted with life until I tried to use them”.She tried to make restaurant bookings but was told by one place that it was fully booked for the next six months and the system had been closed for new bookings until June. She said that even then she would be lucky as the online booking system was a lottery.Then she comes to the spa hotel. “My daughter is getting married in April and was planning to do a spa break,” she writes. She says the spa hotel advertises “lovely packages” including dinner and treatments for €335 for two nights.“I have a voucher purchased in December for €500, so happy days,” she writes. Not so fast. Susan has been online in recent weeks trying to book a stay but can’t find availability.“I emailed the hotel and was told that it was best to call as they often have cancellations. So I called the hotel today and looked to book a package of some sort, even the midweek B\u0026ampB and dinner rate, but I would have preferred the spa package. The only option I was given was a date midweek in April, B\u0026ampB only at €169 per person, with no packages available until next year.”She spoke to a manager but came away from the conversation unsatisfied.“So much for me hoping in my 60th year I would get to enjoy the so-called finer things in life. Think from now on I’ll stick to my local cafes and bars. Rant over. I hope my stress levels return to normal soon as it is only a first-world problem I know, with all that’s going on, but it still upsets me.”It is an interesting issue and raises a question as to whether or not priority in bookings should be given to voucher holders who have – effectively – already paid for the hotel or restaurant. It is not something that is covered in law but, from a moral perspective, it would seem like the right thing to do. While we understand that demand for popular restaurants can be high, it surely is not beyond them to even set aside a percentage of tables when bookings open for those with vouchers to ensure no one is left feeling hard done by."},{"url":null,"title":"college","story":"Options to consider \u0026ndash and reasons to be cheerful \u0026ndash when selecting your move after the examMaking important life decisions is never easy - but there are tools to helpJunior Cycle and Leaving Cert exams to commence on Wednesday, June 8thThe fairness of some aspects of the college application system is open to questionMinister for Education confirms move for Leaving Cert and Junior Cert studentsSudden shift to pre-pandemic standards is not expected, says Department of EducationYou need to register now to apply for college through the CAO, but you have until July 1st to make a final decision on your course choiceCAO 2022: Most applicants get an outcome which enables them to successfully progress to the next stage of their educational journeyFrom nursing to engineering and environmental studies, there\u0026rsquos plenty of choice"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"In Richard Nairn\u0026rsquos second book on the Irish coastline, he has bad news to shareStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"covid cases surge 63 954 cases reported in last five days","story":"As of Monday morning there were 1,308 people in hospital with Covid-19 of whom 49 are in ICU – the most since April 2nd of last year.

Removing the mask requirement in congregated settings particularly with poor ventilation, is clearly having a detrimental impact in our hospitals.”She also criticised the lack of ventilation in hospital pointing out in the week beween Feburary 28th and March 6th a total of 129 Covid-19 outbreaks were detected of whom 116 were in healthcare facilities.“Air hygiene in hospitals is poor, Covid is an airborne pathogen and despite all the evidence the HSE has attached very little urgency, to the very real need for the introduction of hospital-wide air filtration and measurement systems,” she said.On Sunday Tánaiste Leo Varadkar cautioned that approximately half of those who have been admitted to hospital and have tested positive for Covid-19 have been admitted for something else.He also said Ireland was entering a second wave of the Omicron virus, but it was unlikely to see the re-imposition of restrictions.Speaking at Sunday’s national day of commemoration for those who had died from Covid-19, Mr Varadkar said while the current case numbers are “a cause for concern” they are “not a cause for panic”. “We are monitoring the situation very tightly.”He said the Government is considering whether a fourth vaccine dose needs to be started for those who are elderly or medically vulnerable. He said the expectation is that a fourth dose would be recommended to commence “around the middle of the year” rather than closer to the end of the year.The number of people in ICU remains stable throughout the second surge of Omicron. There were 49 people in ICU on Monday morning, an increase of one.Meanwhile, the HSE’s director general Paul Reid has called on the 700,000 people who are now eligible for their booster vaccination (ie their third dose in most cases) to do so.Mr Reid also urged the public to “make their own judgement” and to continue to wear masks in congregated settings, on public transport and in care home settings.There had been a “significant increase” in the last 14 days in the numbers being hospitalised. “We are still dealing with a highly transmissible virus.” A high percentage of patients were aged over 75 which led to further problems as there were fewer places in nursing homes because of Covid outbreaks.The health system was under pressure, he said.While the Omicron variant had a less severe impact, hospitals still had to implement infection controls which put pressure on spaces. Some hospitals had to cancel elective surgeries, but private hospitals were being utilised for elective care.The situation would continue to be monitored, he added. “It all revolves around bed capacity.”The higher levels of Omicron in the community had also led to increased levels of staff being absent – 4,200 last week. At the peak between 6,000 to 7,000 were not at work because of Covid. A further 900 staff at nursing homes were also absent because of the virus, he said.It was not an unusual occurrence for some people to be reinfected in March having had the virus in January, said Mr Reid. After holiday weekends it was expected that levels of the virus in the community would rise, he added and that was also likely following the longer St Patrick’s weekend.Mr Reid also encouraged parents to have their children vaccinated as only 25 percent of children aged five to 11 had received their first vaccine and only 18 percent had received their second vaccine. This was very important especially at a time when transmission levels in the community were so high. The more people who were boosted, the more protection there was for everyone.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"british and irish relationship should be based on equal respect says starmer","story":"Labour leader Keir Starmer speaks to the Labour Party Irish Society Annual St Patrick’s Day reception at the London Irish Centre. Photograph: Stefan RousseauPA WireBritish Labour party leader Keir Starmer has called for a relationship between Britain and Ireland based on equal respect that acknowledges both governments’ roles as co-guarantors of the Belfast Agreement rather than simply consultees.He said the relationship had been dominated by Brexit in recent years but it had a rich and long history that was bigger than the current dispute over the Northern Ireland protocol.“And I felt they were some of the most uplifting years in my working life because there was so much progress going on, so much change going on. You could feel it, you could see it, you could sense it when you were there. And that has given me a really strong sense of the importance of that partnership.“The relationship requires respect, equal respect and understanding of what it means to be a country and to have that status, that friendship, that relationship and that respect.”Mr Starmer was speaking at the Labour Party Irish Society’s St Patrick’s Day reception at the London Irish Centre in Camden, which is in his constituency of of Holborn and St Pancras. Other speakers included Trade Union Congress (TUC) general secretary Frances O’Grady, Labour MP Conor McGinn, who chairs Westminster All-Party Parliamentary Group on the Irish in Britain and Adrian O’Neill, Ireland’s ambassador to Britain.Mr O’Neill said that this year’s St Patrick’s Day events in London had been conceived as a celebratory return to personal contact after two years of the coronavirus pandemic but they had been overshadowed by the war in Ukraine.“To some extent, we have to kind of dial it down a little bit or at least recognise that while we are enjoying this opportunity to meet in person and celebrate all the things that we really cherish, our democracy, our human rights, our independence, sovereignty, all of those core values that they are absolutely now being trampled on in Ukraine,” he said.“In Ireland, we’re working very, very closely with the UK, with the US with like-minded partners in the Security Council of the UN, within the EU, the Human Rights Council in Geneva, the International Criminal Court, using all the mechanisms at our disposal to isolate and increase pressure on Putin and his regime.”"},{"url":null,"title":"myanmar army committed genocide against rohingya says us","story":"Rohingya refugees walk through a shallow canal after crossing the Naf River as they flee violence in Myanmar to reach Bangladesh in Palongkhali near Ukhia in 2017.

Photograph: Orestis PanagiotouEPAMyron Cohen, a garment district silk salesman turned popular comedian in the Ed Sullivan era, loved to tell this chestnut: Picture a skinny little guy, a shrimp, a nothing. He walks into a lumber camp looking for a job. The foreman is sceptical, so the shrimp steps up and fells a towering oak in 90 seconds. “Where’d you learn that?” says the foreman. “In the Sahara Forest,” replies the guy. “You mean the Sahara Desert,” the foreman corrects. “Sure, now,” the guy says. Hubris guided Vladimir Putin’s malevolent and maladroit invasion of Ukraine. As the Associated Press pointed out, US military officials assumed Russia would deploy electronic and cyber warfare to blind and paralyse Ukrainian air defences and communications. But the Russians did not take control of Ukrainian air space when they launched their attack.Putin was cocksure, dismissing Volodymyr Zelenskiy as a shrimp, a nothing. But Zelenskiy has shown the world what true stature is. Putin has always had a Napoleon complex, puffing out his bare chest on horseback fishing shirtless in Siberia winning staged judo and hockey displays. But Zelenskiy understands that stature is not about phoney macho photo shoots. Stature is a physical quality, but, more important, it is a human and moral quality. Keats was barely over 5 feet, but look at his spiritual size. Our military leaders have lately been quoting Napoleon, who said, “The moral is to the physical as three to one.” We have seen this with the Ukrainians, who are not only courageously resisting the Russians but also launching counteroffensives.Parking tanksAs the New York Times reported, the number of Russian casualties has hurt morale our intelligence reports have described Russian soldiers simply parking their tanks and wandering into the woods. Putin doesn’t realise what the world knows: You don’t show your muscularity by razing cities, by bombing a maternity hospital, a boarding school for the visually impaired, a bread line, a community centre and a shelter painted with a message in Russian pleading that children are inside. What kind of monster treats the word “CHILDREN” as an invitation to kill? This just proves that the Russian dictator is, as President Joe Biden and his secretary of state contended, a war criminal.You don’t show your power by starting a war that reveals how weak and mediocre your army is and strengthens European bonds when your goal is to ide and weaken Europe. No matter what happens in Ukraine, Putin will be a loser with no moral stature and Zelenskiy will have towering moral stature.Donald Trump, who called Putin’s barbaric strategy “genius” and “savvy” after spending four years legitimising that malefactor, also comes out a loser. Trump is stuck on the fringe of his party, sharing the wrong side of a moral ide with Tucker Carlson, JD Vance, Madison Cawthorn and Marjorie Taylor Greene. Trump and Putin, what a pair, shrinking in stature in the eyes of the world. Tiny, tiny Trump and cruel fool Putin. The corrupt, paranoid germaphobes love surrounding themselves with sycophants, conjuring delusional worlds and giving unhinged rants.Putin let loose on those who question his misbegotten war: “Any people, and even more so the Russian people, will be able to distinguish true patriots from scum and traitors and simply spit them out like a midge that accidentally flew into their mouths. Spit out on the pavement.”He even went after his pals, the oligarchs, “who can’t do without foie gras, oysters or the so-called gender freedoms” in Miami or the French Riviera. Sowing seedsTrump and Putin sowed the seeds of their own destruction. They wanted all of the attention and credit. Now they deserve all of the blame. Grandiosity and fantasy worlds will trip up these poisonous authoritarians. Neither man has a democratic bone in his body. And both think they know better than anyone else. “When you have an autocrat who’s been in power for too long, they don’t listen to people anymore, and this war was afflicted by very bad decision making,” Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a historian who teaches at New York University, said on MSNBC. This has left Putin vulnerable and humiliated before Russian elites and the world, she said. But it has also, parlously, left him without an off-ramp “because autocrats don’t negotiate”.Stephen Kotkin, a professor of history and international affairs at Princeton, told the New Yorker’s David Remnick that the Russians have a fractured identity. Culturally and scientifically, they are a world-class power. But economically and politically, they have a hard time matching the West, so “they resort to coercion”.“The worst part of this dynamic in Russian history is the conflation of the Russian state with some personal ruler,” Kotkin said. “Instead of getting the strong state that they want to manage the gulf with the West, they instead get a personalist regime. They get a dictatorship, which usually becomes a despotism.”Zelenskiy spoke to a joint meeting of Congress on Wednesday, comparing the terror in Ukrainian skies to the death hailed down from the skies on Pearl Harbor in 1941 and on New York and Washington on 911. He also showed a devastating video that brought tears to lawmakers’ eyes.Underlining his role as David to Putin’s Goliath, Zelenskiy said, “Strong doesn’t mean big.” Strong means supporting human rights and freedom and demanding the right to die when “your time comes and not when it’s wanted by someone else, by your neighbour”. – This article originally appeared in The New York TimesFull coverage of the Russian invasion of UkraineStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"Phenomenal success of Nigerian artists is bringing both opportunities and criticismAuthors are tackling topics from transgender rights to Islamic extremism, and picking up plenty of awardsTom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"eligible brits can start booking","story":"Eligible Brits can start booking fourth Covid- jab from today -

The Government has announced that certain sections of the population will be able to sign up for a second booster from this week. The move comes almost exactly two years on from the first coronavirus lockdown in the UK, and against a worsening domestic pandemic picture. A new, more infectious strain is spreading and case rates are up.On Saturday Boris Johnson teased the latest vaccine drive at the Conservative Partyaposs Spring conference - and hinted itaposll be extended to more people later on this year.He said: I hope youaposve all had your boosters. Weaposre getting ready for a fourth jab, because weaposre going to need it. And Health Secretary Sajid Javid today said there will be more boosters “probably for those who are  or over” later this year. Here is everything you need to know about the fourth jab: When does the rollout begin  As of today the NHS has started inviting eligible people to come forward for their le-saving Spring booster jabs.Those who fit the bill have been able to to book from am.Who is eligible now  The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has advised a spring jab should be offered to those most vulnerable to Covid- as a precautionary measure.People aged  and over and those who are immunosuppressed over the age of . In total five million people will be able to get a jab during the Spring booster campaign. The NHS will be contacting over , people to invite them to book their vaccine this week. You become eligible when you hit six months since your last booster, which is why not everyone is available straight away. For most of them it will be the fourth dose, though for immunosuppressed people it might be the fth. Who might become eligible in future The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationis still debating whether to extend fourth doses more widely.Last week Health Secretary Sajid Javid gave the strongest hint yet that there will definitely be a wider rollout.But is understood no decisions have been made about who exactly would get the jab as part of this. I.e. whether to offer a fourth jab to all adults - or, instead, widen access but still keep it to certain groups such as the over-s. Today Mr Javid emphasised the JCVI have said theyaposre looking at an Autumn dose for over-s, but with no decision yet. Askedthe JCVI would say we needed more people jabbed, Mr Javid told ITVaposs Peston: I think at some point they will. And theyaposve actually been clear and their most recent advice is that they think that towards the end of this year, maybe in the autumn, there will be a need to give a lot more people a boost, an offer of a boost. But Iaposll wait for that advice.Why is the government rolling this out now Coronavirus cases and hospitalisations are on the up, and experts fear that deaths could soon begin to rise as well. Since the beginning of the month daily infections have more than doubled, from , cases a day on average per week, to , now. At the moment case rates among the elderly are at a record high, with one in  people over  in England infected. Although the vaccine has helped to keep the impact of those infections lower than in  and the start of , hospitalisation rates are now rising again. There are currently about , Covid admissions a day across the UK - a % rise on this time a month ago. The rise is being fuelled by more social interactions and BA., a new a mutation of the Omicron iant of coronavirus that accounts for the majority of new infections in the UK.Nikki Kanani, GP and Deputy SRO for the NHS COVID Vaccination Programme, said: “Sadly, we are still seeing large numbers of people seriously unwell in hospital with Covid so it remains vital that those most at risk come forward when they are invited to do so. “The response so far from the public to the largest and most successful vaccination programme in NHS history has been incredible, with more than nine in  people aged  and over getting their initial booster. The NHS Covid vaccination programme is once again ready to get people protected, so when you are invited please do come forward for your spring dose.” How can I get the second booster NHS health chiefs are expecting high uptake of spring boosters amongst people aged  and over after . million of them got their top up jab over autumn and winter, and have recruited additional call handlers for the  service to help people book their vaccine appointment. Calls to book an appointment can be made to , which are free from mobiles and landlines. Lines are open every day from am to pm, and  can provide support in  languages. Local NHS teams will be contacting care homes in their patch as they have done previously to arrange for spring boosters for people who are eligible and have been invited. Hundreds of sites including community pharmacies, vaccination centres and hospital hubs are offering spring boosters to those most vulnerable to coronavirus.Booking can also be made on the NHS website.

While having three jab signicantly decreases your chances of falling badly ill or dying from coronavirus, the impact of the vaccine wears off over time. Having a booster jab helps to keep immunity levels as high as possible.  Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said: “Spring boosters will help top up the immunity of the elderly and the most vulnerable to ensure they are protected and will help us continue to live with this virus.“Thanks to the NHS for rising to the challenge yet again to get people boosted. Please come forward as soon as you are contacted.” Vaccines Minister Maggie Throup added: “We are absolutely determined to protect those most vulnerable to Covid. “Please take up the offer of a spring booster as soon as you are contacted by the NHS – it will protect you and ensure we can continue to enjoy our freedoms.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSBoris JohnsonCoronavirusCoronavirus vaccine\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Wales today made it illegal for parents to hit kids, meaning any type of corporal punishment - including smacking, slapping and shaking, has been made illegal. Scotland had already brought brought in a ban in November . But parents in England and Northern Ireland still have a defence of “reasonable punishment” , for example, they do not leave a red mark or use an implement like a cane or belt. Critics of Wales’ law change have said it will criminalise parents, but the Welsh Government has insisted the move is about protecting childrenaposs rights. And today Sir Keir - a former Director of Public Prosecutions - called for other areas to follow suit. Speaking on a visit to Stevenage, Sir Keir said the move was welcome.  What it does is give children the protection that adults already have, and that is the right thing, he told reporters.I would like to see the rest of the UK step into line here, because I think, well, Welsh Labour have taken a lead here and theyaposre absolutely right to protect children in the way that they now have.In England and Northern Ireland smacking is unlawful, but such an assault is allowed as long as it constitutes reasonable punishment. Whether the defence is accepted depends on the circumstances of each case. It takes into consideration factors such as the age of the child and the nature of the contact, including whether it left a red mark or was carried out with a fist or implement such as a cane or belt. Wales’ smacking ban, as it is known, was brought in under the Children Act . It means children will get the same protection from assault as adults, and the law will apply to everyone, even those visiting Wales - as is the case with all Welsh laws.  Parents or anyone who is responsible for a child while the parents are absent can now face criminal or civil chargesthey are found to have physically disciplined a young person in any way. Labour First Minister Mark Drakeford said: The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child makes it clear that children have the right to be protected from harm and from being hurt and this includes physical punishment. That right is now enshrined in Welsh law. No more grey areas. No more aposdefence of reasonable punishmentapos. That is all in the past. He added: There is no place for physical punishment in a modern Wales. Deputy minister for social services Julie Morgan called the day a historic moment for children and their rights in Wales. Viv Laing, from NSPCC Cymru Wales, said: Until now, children were the only group in our society who it was acceptable to strike in certain circumstances. We donapost allow the physical punishment of adults or animals, so it is absurd that we have for so long with children. NSPCC Cymru Wales has long been clear on this, and now, at last, the law is too. Chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners Wales, Dr Rowena Christmas, said: The evidence is absolutely compelling that physically punishing a child can be harmful to the wellbeing of both child and parent. It offers no benefit that cannot be gained from another method of discipline but is associated with a broad range of harms that can last a letime. Stephen Thomas, headteacher of Ysgol y Bryn Llanelli, said: Physical punishment has no place in raising children. Providing consistency, good routines and being role models for our children in the values we would like them to display creates good people.

Ministers believe PO may have broken the law by failing to follow “clear rules” on firing staff.It has emerged that ministers knew on Wednesday what PO planned to do, but failed to act.Labour will try to force a vote banning “fire and rehire” on Monday night. Shadow Transport Secretary Louise Haigh said: “Labour will fight every step of the way.”PO Ferries is under threat of legal actionit fails to give satisfactory answers to  questions about the sacking of  seafarers by tomorrow’s pm deadline. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the information given by PO would “inform next steps”, but could lead to a “formal complaint to the relevant prosecuting authority”.PO Ferries has replaced the seafarers with cheaper agency staff, some on as little as £. an hour, it has been claimed. Its ferries are registered to Cyprus, the Bahamas and Holland, the RMT say. It could mean some foreign crews are not protected by UK employment law requiring a minimum wage of £. an hour.Karl Turner, Labour MP for Hull East, has claimed Filipino crew on PO’s Pride of Rotterdam service to Holland were paid just £. an hour. Mike Lynch, general secretary of the RMT union, said the “flags of convenience” practice had led to “widespread exploitation”. He said: “It’s one reason we used to have , seafarers in the country but now we’re lucky to have ,.  “It is a race to the bottom.” He called on ministers to take control of PO’s ferries. He said: “If they won’t honour the law then they should take control of those vessels and put our people back to work and be the operator of last resort.” Department for Transport civil servants were told on Wednesday about PO’s plan to replace staff, who were sacked on Thursday in a Zoom call.The Sunday Times revealed ministers were told the sackings would ensure PO “remain a key player in the UK market for years to come through restructuring”. The Department for Transport said the memo had “outlined what officials had been told by PO”. As soon as they were informed, ministers had “made clear their outrage”. In a letter to PO Ferries CEO Peter Hebblethwaite on Friday, Mr Kwarteng wrote: “Failure to meet the notication obligation is a criminal offence and can lead to an unlimited fine.” Get the stories you want straight to your inbox.toone of the Mirroraposs newslettersThe Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby described the sackings as a “sin”.As PO sailings were suspended for a third day, Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the BBC: “The way they have treated their workers is awful, it’s wrong.We are examining not just those actions and whether they comply with the regulations, but our own relationship with the company.” PO did not respond to the Mirror’s questions. DP World, the Dubai-based owner of PO Ferries, has been urged to plug a £million hole in its pension scheme, money said to be owed to the Merchant Navy Ratings Pension Fund.

And she claimed Vladimir Putin could exploit refugee flows to send agents to Britain.In her keynote speech, she said: Iaposve been asked why couldnapost we suspend security checks on people escaping Putinaposs war  Times of conflict, my friends, emphasises our need to remain watchful. I know from the briefings I receive from the intelligence and security services that instability around the world brings with it greater threats.  Only four years ago the Russian military intelligence services used a chemical weapon on British soil. She went on: The truth is that a very small number of people can wreak utter havoc. Russia has a history of covert hostile activity.And Iaposm afraid it is naive and misguided to think that only men can be covert operatives, or that refugee flows could not be subject to some form of exploitation.  Ms Patel went on: There are those who would come to our country, to this country, who mean us harm and who plot to strike at our very way of le. The processes that we have put in place closely follow the advice of our intelligence and security services. They mean we can help Ukrainians in need without making our country less safe. It comes as the Home Office said , visas had been granted under the family scheme for Ukrainians fleeing the war by pm on Friday. Ms Patel added: State threats and terrorism take many forms. They also thrive on indference and appeasement and now we are seeing them bolstered by new types of targeted biological, chemical, cyber warfare, ransomware and online threats. Our duty is to safeguard our countryaposs interests and we will never take our eye off the ball when it comes to the safety and security of our country. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said , places had been created in schools for children fleeing Ukraine and virtual lessons created during the coronavirus pandemic had been translated into Ukrainian. Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove confirmed more than , households had now offered to house Ukrainian refugees, the majority of whom have made their way to Poland.

And then he wonapost. What heaposll do instead is slice a few pennies off fuel, and while you might think this is a dandy idea all it does is reduce the governmentaposs cut, and leaves the profits to oil companies who may, or may not, decide to lower the price you pay at the pumps.By cutting the cost of petrol and diesel, Rishi Sunak will take money out of the NHS, road repairs, schools, bin collections, social work, home help, and a thousand other things you donapost notice as much as the cost of a full tank, but need in order to survive, just the same.The fact heaposll do it while telling you heaposs making le easier for the average man on the street is a flat lie from someone who is at no risk of ever having to choose between filling up on fuel, or food. Itaposs classic Torynomics - the maths of keeping rich people rich, as opposed to making the poor better off.But what more could he do, the backbenchers cry. Vladimir Putinaposs put up the price of oil and gas, the pandemic has caused supply chain problems, and working from home has pinched the economies of our cities. Weaposve lost £bn of trade since Brexit, there are traumatised Ukrainians and Afghan translators to accommodate, weaposre full, weaposre broke, weaposre buggered. Plus, it isnapost easy, being green! There are some quite cheap and easy ways that he COULD put some money in your pocket, though. And heaposs not going to bother with any of them.. Insulate every home in the UK The quickest way of saving money on energy bills is to insulate your home. The rate of doing this has stalled, and while not everyone wants or can afford full net-zero compliance of the sort which Insulate Britain crackpots demand, it is possible for lots of us to do better -we had help. Cutting % VAT on insulation of any sort, plus the same for adding solar , wind turbines, or heat pumps, would make a big dference. Heaposs not going to, because itaposs not sexy, and why should you lot get something for less. . Windfall tax on the energy firmsShell is on track to post a £.bn profit this year, while BP is likely to make £.bn. Oil firms are taxed high already - %, compared to most companiesapos % - but letaposs face it, theyaposre at no risk of the workhouse. And it would produce a massive, immediate, undodgeable payday for government which could use it to bring down bills. He wonapost, for fear that it sets a precedent, which was the opposite of his reasoning when he said heaposd have to raise taxes because of the pandemic.. Raise the NI thresholdNext month everyone with a job, and every firm, will be paying more for the privilege. The .% hike Rishi will talk about is more accurately described as % - because NI contributions will be going up by about a tenth, from % to .%. Itaposs expected to raise £bn a year for the next  years, and will be given to the NHS to repair pandemic damage.But heaposs also asking the NHS to save £.bn in waste. If you think the NHS is currently wasteful, itaposs not clear how throwing another £.bn at it will help. If you think the NHS is underfunded, giving it billions with one hand and taking billions with the other also wonapost help. So whataposs happening is youaposre getting taxed % more for something thataposs not helpful, in any scenario. In any event, it should not be paid by the poorest. Raising the threshold at which you start paying from £, to the same as the income tax floor of £, would be fairer - and he wonapost do it because it effectively creates a tax-free basic income for everyone in work. It would mean less poverty, less disease, better nutrition, better health, and in the years to come lower costs for the NHS and social care, but why should the bleeding obvious matter a jot   . Make Brexit betterThe UK waved goodbye to £bn of cross-border trade with Boris Johnsonaposs bad Brexit deal this year, at just the time the effects were worse thanks to the pandemic and, now, the war crime spree in Ukraine. Thereaposs a simple way to restore every penny of it, though, which is to end all tarfs and customs checks by complying with EU standards on goods and services.It turns out, they werenapost so bad after all. And there is not a human in the world who wants to fill in  pages of customs declarationsthere is an option to not do so. This wonapost happen either, because it would involve a government built on hoods and ignorance admitting publicly that it doesnapost know the first damned thing about what itaposs doing, which would make Rishi look like the best economist while stood in a field of financial morons. Read more . Resign The worst Chancellors in British history are the ones who presided over growing poverty because they did not know what it felt like. They never went hungry, never shivered, never missed out because they could not afford to exploit an opportunity. The better ones did experience that, and knew the price paid for being poor - they knew that it led to sickness, squalor, worse workers, lower tax takes, public health problems and generational, national failure. They could see how hungry children led to lower GDP, and wanted to fix it.Little Rishi argued that feeding children was too expensive. He said helping the self-employed was too dficult, unless they were able to provide some PPE and had a Toryaposs phone number, in which case he happily threw billions at them, no questions asked. He didnapost have a problem giving visas to rich Russians, and now the government heaposs part of is rationing the welcome mat for poor Ukrainians. He seems to resent helping to keep factories open and Brits in work, sohe pulls POaposs freeport contracts on the basis itaposs fired a third of its UK workforce and employed Filipinos on £ an hour, realism itself will seek the therapistaposs couch.There are global, and dficult, economic problems to resolve. It requires someone with empathy, experience, and imagination to tackle them. Instead this chancellor will do tiny things - bijou cashbacks, petite lies, small-minded solutions that solve nothing. Thataposs why heaposs Little Rishi - thinks little, knows little, does little. The Spring Statement will be nothing more than Torynomics - bedtime stories from a man whose only real goal in le is to replace the party-mad pillock in Number , rather than nurse a nation back to economic health.Youaposll never get any financial sense from a man who spends £ on a coffee cup and £ on slippers.Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON PO CompanyConservative PartyBPEuropean UnionNHSBoris JohnsonVladimir PutinTaxEnergy billsOil pricesWar crimesCrimePoliticsSolar powerRishi SunakThe BudgetSpring Statement\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Those eligible for the jab are likely to be contacted soon as the rollout targets a fresh spike in casesThe NHS has announced the rollout of a second booster jab Image: Getty ImagesByBenjamin LynchTrends Writer:,  Mar Updated:,  Mar |commentsA second booster jab is to be offered to vulnerable Brits this spring in a bid to keep Covid cases down. It is hoped that the campaign for people to get jabbed will help keep infections down, ensuring restrictions like Plan B can remain a thing of the past.The rollout comes as Englandaposs NHS service prepares for a -week Covid campaign, lasting from September to December. A minimum scenario to offer vaccination groups one to six is being prepared for. This includes care home residents and staff, frontline NHS and social care workers, people at risk due to underlying health conditions as well as all those aged  and over.A maximum scenario would include everyone aged  and over. Cases gradually fell after skyrocketing to record levels over the New Year, allowing the government the opportunity to cease restrictions in England including mandatory self-isolation and mask-wearing.With a booster programme in place to try and lower the risk of infections and keep cases down, Brits are being encouraged to get their fourth jab over the coming days and weeks.So how can people get their hands on a booster  How can I book a booster  The NHS vaccination programme will continue to contact people who are eligible for boosters. Once a person has been contacted, they can book their jab by calling NHS  or by using the National Booking System online here.Even as the country has opened up and there are no plans to move back to old restrictions, the health service has recommended the jab as a way of people continuing to protect themselves. The NHS said: The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has advised a spring jab should be offered to those most vulnerable to COVID- as a precautionary measure. Health secretary Sajid Javid said: Spring boosters will help top up the immunity of the elderly and the most vulnerable to ensure they are protected and will help us continue to live with this virus.Most restrictions in Scotland ended today, including an end to businesses requiring peopleaposs contact details, but the legal requirement for face coverings in most public places is still in place.With Plan B long gone, some are concerned about the sharp rise in cases as the ONS suggested that around one in  people were infected in the UK last week.

The British Medical Association also said “realistically every GP practice should close its patient list” due to unsafe patient numbers.The comments came at the launch of a joint campaign with ex-Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt calling on Boris Johnson to tackle the crisis in general practice.Mr Hunt, a former sworn enemy of the BMA, said we are seeing the “Uber-isation of general practice” with patients forced to see a dferent doctor every time. Lack of GPs means that on average each is seeing  patients a day. The previous safe maximum was . Dr Kieran Sharrock, BMA committee deputy chair GP Committee England, BMA, said: “Your practice may soon no longer exist. On current trajectory your local surgery may have to close.  “In the last eight years over  practices have closed. Two and half million patients have lost access to their family doctor.“If the Government doesn’t act now every family who relies on the NHS will find basic healthcare under threat.”Mr Hunt, the BMA and the GPDF, which represents local medical committees, yesterday launched the “rebuild general practice” campaign. Mr Hunt said the GP workforce shortage had meant an end to “continuity of care” - where a patient sees the same GP. At a media briefing in Marylebone, central London, he said: “The best thing about the NHS is having your own family doctor. “We know from studies that there’s a % less chance of a patient going to hospital and a % less chance of a patient dyingthey have the same GP over a long period of time.  “And that is because it is fundamentally safer to make a diagnosisyou know a patient’s context, you know their family, their social situation. You’re more likely to see those red flags when you should. “What I’m afraid we’re moving towards is the Uberisation of general practice where you see a dferent GP every time.” He joked he was “surprised” to be sitting on the same  as BMA members after being embroiled in a bitter row with the union over new contracts for junior doctors in . Mr Hunt acknowledged he failed to increase GP numbers by , as promised by the Tories during his stint as health secretary from  to . He said: “I didn’t fail to recruit enough GPs. I failed to recruit enough to make up for those that were leaving the profession”. Dr Sharrock said the main issue was stopping GPs leaving the profession, adding: “I speak to colleagues day in day out who have gone part time. “They say its because the job isn’t do-able. It isn’t safe. They don’t want to sully their career by not safely caring their patients. So they’re getting out.  “There are processes where practices going through a short term problem can close their lists for a period of time. “But realistically every practice should close its list because we can’t take the workload we are already doing. “If the pressure on GPs continues so they think it is unsafe, it can take one or two of them to leave and suddenly you can’t run the practice. “We have a contract with the NHS and at any point we can gave three months notice and say ‘actually we can’t run this contract any more.” The Rebuild General Practice campaign has released polling from , British GPs which found that nearly nine in  fear patients are not always safe at their surgeries.Asked about the survey on Times Radio, current Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: “We’re investing more in NHS workforce than ever before in history, and just in the last year there’s some , more people working for the NHS - that includes around , more doctors.“And we have more doctors in training at medical school than any other time in history.” In  the Tories promised , new GPs by .

Heres everything you need to know about why free-range eggs are being labelled as barn eggs insteadFree-range eggs will be labelled barn eggs across UK supermarkets Image: Getty Images iStockphotoByMalvika PadinTrends Writer:,  Mar |comments Cases of avian flu, which began rising in the country in November, , have led to the biggest ever outbreak of bird flu in Great Britain and the death of thousands of birds. In order to keep cases under control amid the outbreak has resulted in the government enforcing an Avian Influenza Prevention Zone across the UK.While it should help to prevent case numbers from increasing, the prevention measures will mean that free-range eggs will not be able to be labelled as such in the near future. They were given a -week grace period, whereby farmers were able to maintain their free-range status, but this ended on March, , .Hereaposs why free-range eggs are being replaced in UK supermarkets.Why are free-range eggs no longer available in the UK   Free-range eggs, which accounts for % of all eggs produced in the UK according to RSPCA, come from birds that enjoy unlimited access to outdoor pastures during the daytime. Free-range laying hens can be kept indoors only for up to  weeks for their eggs to still be labelled free-range, however, this period has ended, with birds still being kept in containment, due to there still being a high level of risk to birds of catching flu.  A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairsexplained: The -week grace period we allowed for free-range eggs has now been exceeded, and eggs must now be marketed as ‘barn eggs’. We have worked closely with the sector and retailers to implement these changes as smoothly as possible. The avian, or bird, flu outbreak controls mean that there is a legal requirement for all poultry farmers in the UK to keep their birds, whether pets or commercial flocks, indoors and follow strict biosecurity measures as well. What are barn eggs  Eggs in UK shops will no longer classy as free-range because the birds have been kept inside for more than  weeks. The eggs will therefore be labelled as barn eggs. This is the name given to eggs produced by permanently indoor birds. The British Retail Consortium said that signs will be put in supermarkets to inform shoppers of the change in labelling, adding that the previous free-range label willonly after the hens are permitted to go outside again. Andrea Martinez-Inchausti, assistant director of food at the British Retail Consortium, said shops and supermarkets would continue to support British farmers. What is avian flu and is it dangerous  According to the NHS, bird flu or avian flu is a highly infectious type of influenza that spreads among birds. The disease typically poses a very low risk to humans, though people have previously been infected by it around the world.With the UK facing its largest-ever outbreak of avian flu, the government has stated that it would work with farmers and retailers to implement any branding changes to eggs as long as the housing measures to protect poultry remain in place.

On March  alone there were , cases reported, however, health secretary Sajid Javid has said there is no particular cause for concern, as we now strive to live with the virus. The legal requirement to self isolateyou catch Covid has been dropped in England, and the government is ending the provision of free tests from April . People are now being urged to act with personal responsibility, although the NHS is still advising that you should stay at home and avoid contact with other people. If you do test positive for coronavirus, hereaposs some things you might want to know, including how long youaposll test positive and how long to self isolate for.How long will I test positive for Covid   Most people will stop testing positive for Covid within  days of starting to experience symptoms, or receiving their first positive test. However, itaposs possible to still test positive for weeks, or sometimes months after having the virus. Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance says itaposs possible to test positive for Covid- for weeks, but people are not likely to be contagious for very long.It explains: The time taken to test negative after contracting Covid- depends on the severity of the case, and also on the test itself. PCR tests that hunt out parts of viral genetic materialin our bodies and amply it so we can detect it are extremely sensitive and can even pick up the presence of few viral fragments. This is because fragments of viral RNA can remain in our bodies long after the infection is over and the virus has been cleared from our system.” In general, itaposs reported that asymptomatic people can test positive for one to two weeks, while those with mild-to-moderate disease continue to test positive for a week or more. How long should you self isolate for  You are no longer required by law to self isolate in England and Northern Ireland. However, the NHS recommends you stay at home and avoid contact with other people. You also no longer need to take daily Covid testsyouaposve been in close contact with someone with coronavirus in England. According to the NHS, you should stay at home while youaposre infectious to others. It adds: This can be up to  days from when your symptoms start. Many people will no longer be infectious to others after five days. The NHS recommends you do rapid lateral flow tests from five days after your symptoms startedand another the next day. It adds: If both tests are negative and you do not have a high temperature, youaposre less likely to pass Covid- to others and you can go back to your normal routine. If your test result is positive on day five, you can carry on doing rapid lateral flow tests every day until you get two negative test results in a row. In Scotland and Wales you are still required by law to self-isolate after testing positive for Covid. How long do symptoms last   According to the NHS, most people feel better within a few days or weeks and most people make a full recovery within  weeks.However, Covid symptoms can last longer.According to the Zoe Covid Study App, most people recover within two weeks, and one in  people have symptoms after three weeks. Those who suffer for longer than usual may have something called long Covid, which describes symptoms you may have after infection.

The team’s work is expected to be completed by autumn.” The decision to can the probe has raised questions about whether or not the case’s prime suspect will be charged with the disappearance of the girl. Who is the prime suspect in the Madeleine McCann investigation German police have named their prime suspect as -year-old Christian Brueckner, who is currently in prison for separate crimes. German prosecutors say they have “concrete” evidence against him and is their only suspect, who is current serving a jail sentence for the rape of an American woman in . Brueckner was named as the prime suspect after phone records placed him at the Portuguese resort on the night Madeleine went missing. He has accused prosecutors of making “scandalous” claims against him, saying they bring “shame” on the German legal system. Why is the Madeleine McCann case going to end  The budget for the investigation is due to run out at the end of March, despite former Met Police chief Cressida Dick saying that the operation would only end once every lead had been probed. In the past few years, the size of the team working on Operation Grange has shrunk from  officers down to just four. Led by Detective Chief Inspector Mark Cranwell, the investigation is believed to have cost around £ million. The investigation has been spearheaded by German and Portuguese authorities, with Met cops in a supporting role. A request for more money has reportedly been sent into the Home Office, which would take the operation to the end of September. Could the Madeleine McCann case be reopened   Yes,there was a further breakthrough the case would be reopened - although detectives will not be actively investigating in the meantime. Madeleine’s parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, have vowed they will never stop looking for their daughter and may look to use the specially created fund - Madeleine’s Fund: Leave No Stone Unturned - which currently has over £, available.

Daniela Elser pointed out the Queen has never given a single interview and said one lesson the Monarch can teach us is the power of silence. Andever there has been a time in royal history when the -year-old has put that philosophy into blistering effect it has been over the last -days and change, Ms Elser wrote, in a piece for news.au.The royal commentator compared this approach to Meghan and Harry giving their famous tell-all interview to Oprah last year, in which they dropped several bombshells, from the duchessapos thoughts of suicide to damaging claims of racism. Following this, Ms Elser wrote, the world waited for how the Queen would react. She highlighted how the Queen released a short statement days after the interview, but has stayed silent since then. It took nearly two days for courtiers to put out a -word statement of truly breathtaking economy and which infamously read in part, apossome recollections may yapos, Ms Elser wrote.  She added that the remarkable thing is that still, one year on, there hasnapost been any word uttered on the matter. But she pointed out that Harry and Meghan have since then appeared in ious interviews - including Harryaposs podcast with Dax Shepherd, and had only just started speaking their truth after their TV interview in March . At the time, Ms Elser went on, it seemed like the palace was being woefully shortsighted, clinging to their time-honoured modus operandi of impervious silence, rigidly refusing to engage or considering doing things dferently in the face of even this unprecedented mess.However, with the benefit of hindsight, that has proven to be a shrewd approach to a febrile situation. Ms Elser added she was not suggesting Meghan and Harry did not have legitimate grievances that need to be addressed. But she said the repeated, self-righteous repeated airing of family dirty laundry has in fact only really dealt them a PR blow. Both Harry and Meghan told Oprah how much they respected Her Majesty but they both seem to have missed the crucial lesson she could have taught them about not only the power but the dignity of silence, Ms Elser added. Now there are fears Harry could “disrespect” Kate Middleton in his tell-all memoir of his le, which is due to be published later this year.There has been much speculation about what he will include in the book and how members of the Royal Family will be portrayed in it, withprevious commentarysuggesting the book has sparked a “tsunami of fear” in royal circles.The -year-old prince is expected to cover his letime in the public eye, including his time in the military, marriage and fatherhood in the book, which is to be published by Penguin Random House.

One of them was Mondayaposs Commonwealth Day service, also at the Abbey, with the decision to cancel her appearance understood to be related to her comfort travelling the -mile journey from Windsor Castle to London and sitting through the event, rather than a specic illness. The -year-old monarch has faced increasing issues with her mobility in recent months, leaving her “on certain days” struggling to get about, according to palace sources. Have your say on the plan in the comment section  And now the Sun reports Buckingham Palace officials are thought to be looking at a wide range of operations for getting her to the Abbey - and prevent photographers getting a picture.Sources told how senior palace aides are looking at having the Queen flown from Windsor Castle to Buckingham Palace by helicopter. The trip would take just  minute by chopper, and staff would then drive the monarch the short distance from the Palace to the Abbey, sealing off the entirety of Deanaposs Yard to prevent anyone getting near before parking the car by a side door.  Despite having just last week been on her feet for face-to-face engagements at Windsor, it is reported her closest aides are concerned at the prospect of Her Majesty walking the  yards from the Abbey entrance to her seat. Sources told the Sun that options including six-foot privacy screens or a football-style tunnel are being looked at, to block photographers from trying to capture a shot of the Queen exiting the car. The Queen is thought to be determined to continue walking and is understood to have dismissed the idea of using a wheelchair.But it is reported the option has been considered by her aides so she can move around the Abbey in comfort - with the aging royal being brought to Poetsapos Corner before a short walk to her seat in the Sanctuary. Ingrid Seward, who is editor-in-chief of Majesty Magazine, told the paper: “Understandably, the Queen doesn’t want to be seen in a wheelchair. “But as the Head of State and someone who wants to be seen and needs to be seen, she might concede to a wheelchair. The best way of doing that is to make sure there are no photographs taken.  She added: “She would really hate to miss it. It is a headache for her staff as it would be dficult for anyone of her age who suffers mobility problems. It would be a painful process for her.” Another option being considered is having the Queen ready at her seat before the rest of the audience arrives for the memorial ceremony, eschewing for the sake of her comfort the tradition of having the monarch arrive last.A source told the Sun that t he Queen has told her staff she does not want to use a wheelchair.Get all the royal news you want straight to your inbox.toone of the Mirroraposs newslettersHowever, she has agreed to be given assistance in order to enter through the Abbeyaposs side entrance quick enough. There, they said, she will be able to exit the car in prive and using her walking stick, whilethere are efforts being made to keep photographers away.They add that,she needs the wheelchair, then that must be done behind screens or once she is in the side entrance. Meanwhile TV broadcasters will be requested to be considerate in their coverage. The source added that aides believe this is to be the only way the Queen can get into the Abbey and are determined the process be out of the public eye.

Amy Jewell has faced the torment of stabbing pain near her eye which happens in an attack that can last for months, Liverpool Echo reports.The -year-old bar worker said her agonising head pains make her feel like sheaposs possessed by a demon when she is affected. And she compares her trauma to a horror film character rocking, shaking and throwing up and reckons her head pains are worse than childbirth. The bar worker from Liverpool, Merseyside said itaposs like sheaposs possessed by a demon when she has a headache, comparing herself to a horror film character rocking, shaking and throwing up and says the pain is worse than childbirth. Mum-of-one Amy told the Liverpool Echo : I wouldnapost wish this on my worst enemy.It disturbs your le so much, your mental health is really affected, and thereaposs just no understanding. Society just thinks itaposs a headache and itaposs not. During an attack, which started when she was seven, Amy hides in her blacked-out room next to a bucket.Her senses are so sensitive even the red light of a TV on standby makes her vomit, and the weird, musky smell of summer rain gives her headaches.She vividly remembers a headache in  when she hadnapost eaten in days, saying: I remember watching the telly, and the pain in my head and my eyes. I remember screaming to my dad, aposYouaposve got to turn the telly off, I just canapost live like thisapos. After Amy was diagnosed with cluster headaches as a child, doctors advised her to ride out the headaches and attempted to prevent them with beta-blockers and epilepsy medication. She stopped feeling like she was going mad when doctors there diagnosed her with cluster headaches in . She said: I always knew that there was something up with my head with the pain.  But then I was like, aposs***, Iaposve got to live with itapos, butyou can live since you were seven with the migraines, you can live with these. Cluster headaches are known to take their toll on a personaposs mental health due to their intense nature. They can occur for  minutes, multiple times a day for a recurring period of weeks or months. Amy broke down when she finally set foot in The Walton Centre again after lockdown to receive her treatment of nerve-blocking botox injections. I was like, aposI literally cannot take any more, I donapost know how much more I can takeapos. The pain at that moment in my head was horric. When her attacks are particularly bad, she is sometimes taken by ambulance to the specialist neurology and neurosurgery hospital, where she finds the staff more understanding of her condition. She said: I think society as a whole, when you say you suffer with migraines, theyaposre just like, aposOh you need to take some paracetamol and some waterapos. They can be quite dismissive.  Theyaposve got no understanding that when Iaposm walking into AE with a pair of sunglasses on and a towel wrapped around my head so I canapost see any lights, with a sick bowl, I cannot sit in this waiting room. But I think in The Walton Centre, theyaposve got more understanding of the pain youaposre in. The pain has been so bad she has banged her head against a wall and there are months at a time when she vomits daily. The -year-old said: Iaposve never felt pain like it. It feels like your head is in some sort of vice, and you just know thereaposs no ending in sight for a good week. She praised the Walton Centre for helping her: The empathy towards me and the compassion towards the pain in my head, and the time that theyaposve got to sit there and give you treatment, is unbelievable.

His sacking was deemed unfair at an employment tribunalHe was sacked despite an unblemished  year career Image: SOPA Images LightRocket via Getty ImagesByKelly-Ann MillsNews Reporter:,  Mar |comments A veteran postman has won more than £, after he was sacked for taking a piece of chewing gum out of his mouth and sticking it on a lantern on a garden gate. Graham Harvey was spotted by the homeowner who complained to his bosses, showing CCTV evidence of his aposdisgustingapos behaviour.The then  year old was sacked for gross misconduct after the video also showed him driving without a seat belt and leaving his Royal Mail van unlocked. But an employment tribunal ruled he was unfairly dismissed as none of these actions should have amounted to a sackable offence. He has now been awarded £,. in compensation. The Scottish tribunal heard Mr Harvey had worked for Royal Mail for  years when he was sacked following the incident in .  He was based at its Prestonpans office near Edinburgh, where he had a predominantly rural route to deliver to. The hearing was told that in October that year, a customer visited the office to make a complaint about Mr Harvey. The complaint was that he had aposremoved a piece of chewing gum from his mouth and placed it on a gate lantern at the propertyapos. The incident was captured on CCTV footage which was emailed to his manager along with a photograph. The customeraposs email described the conduct as aposdisgustingapos, but he said he and his we did not wish to aposmake a huge fuss about itapos. The tribunal heard the video also showed Mr Harvey driving his vehicle without a seatbelt and leaving items of mail on the front passenger seat. On histo work the following Monday, Jordan Cree, the delivery office manager, asked Mr Harvey to have a word in his office. Mr Harvey admitted to driving without a seatbelt and leaving items of mail on his passenger seat but denied placing chewing gum on the customeraposs premises.  The tribunal heard he was suspended at the end of the meeting pending aposfurther investigations into an alleged incident where you have defaced a customeraposs propertyapos. A disciplinary meeting was held in October, when Mr Harvey admitted all of the allegations against him including the placing of chewing gum on the customeraposs property. He described it as a aposstupid decisionapos and said he had done it aposon two occasions at mostapos. He offered to apologise to the customer. He also admitted driving without a seatbelt in rural locations and added it was aposcommon practiceapos for him and for many others over many years,not decades, to drive without seatbelts in certain situations at certain locations. Concerns were also raised of potential aposmassive reputational damageapos to Royal Mail arising from the CCTV being placed on social media, but the tribunal heard no evidence any video being posted. The tribunal heard he was sacked at the end of the meeting after bosses ruled all three offences were gross misconduct. He then lost an appeal with another manager saying he believed the chewing gum issue was a aposdeliberate act on [Mr Harveyaposs] part to cause anxiety and distressapos. Employment Judge Ronald Mackay ruled the dismissal was unfair, as not wearing a seatbelt and leaving mail on the passenger seat were aposcommon practicesapos known to management, while the chewing gum issue was not serious enough to be deemed gross misconduct. Royal Mail bosses told the tribunal that they believed Mr Harvey should be treated more harshly given that with hisof service he should have known the rules. Criticising this approach, Judge Mackay said: To dismiss, for a first offence, an employee with a clean record and  years service, should not have been approached with that mind-set.

Infected patients who took part in this latest study were three times as likely to have a blood clot - known medically as a thromboembolism, scientists discovered. Thromboembolism can cause a blockage in the main artery of the lung or form where and become le threatening. Overall, the coronavirus raised the risk of a severe maternal illness two-and-a-half times, researchers found.Pre-term births during early, middle, and late terms of the pregnancy doubled, while birth may need to be induced early when the mother has a condition such as pre-eclampsia, the study revealed.Dr Assiamira Ferrara, a lead author of the study at Calornia-based care consortium Kaiser Permanente, said: These findings add to growing evidence having Covid- during pregnancy raises risks of serious complications.The findings were based on , expectant women in the US of whom , became infected. Dr Ferrara added: Coupled with the evidence the Covid- vaccines are safe during pregnancy, these findings should aid patients in understanding the risks of perinatal complications and the need for vaccination. This study supports the recommendation for vaccination of pregnant iniduals and those planning conception. Calornia-based care consortium Kaiser Permanente tracked participants from before conception to delivery to identy links between before and after birth complications.  Covid was diagnosed through a PCR test by the researchers. The racially and ethnically erse group was followed from March  to March . Those who tested positive were more likely to be younger, obese, Hispanic, have had multiple babies or live in a poor neighbourhood, scientists said. Dr Mara Greenberg, a co-author of the study and a maternal-fetal medicine specialist, said: Our study was large, erse, and supports the need for vaccination by pregnant iniduals and those who plan to get pregnant. The most important thing people can do to protect themselves and their baby is to get vaccinated.  The analysis found almost six per cent of patients with a coronavirus infection during pregnancy had a related hospitalisation. That was most likely for black or Asian or Pacic islanders and patients with pre-gestational diabetes, the study found. Researchers compared patients who gave birth before and after December , when universal Covid testing of pregnant patients began. They found a positive test rate of . and . per cent, respectively. The same health risks applied to both groups. The US team is continuing to research Covid and pregnancy, focusing on telemedicine and health care delivery during the pandemic.  Dr Monique Hedderson, another study co-author, said: We are also planning to follow both mothers and children to study possible short and long-term health effects of coronavirus infections during pregnancy. In November analysis of , pregnant women in France found those with Covid were  times as likely to die during childbirth, scientists said. The study was published in JAMA Internal Medicine.

When they were working members of the Royal Family, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle embarked on two royal tours together.The first was an action-packed trip to both Australia and New Zealand in , when the couple packed in  official engagements in just  days, including stops in Fiji and Tonga.It came following the announcement that Meghan was  weeks pregnant with son Archie - and despite the hectic pace she managed to keep up. But amid the formal dinners and royal duties, Harry and Meghan did apparently manage to sneak away to enjoy a completely secret evening on a double date in Sydney.In the biography Finding Freedom, it claims they spent their time off with Meghanaposs best friend Jessica Mulroney and her husband Ben, where they indulged in a luxury five-course dinner cooked by a private chef.The book claims: In Sydney to take on engagements and host the fourth Invictus Games, Harry and Meghan managed to sneak out for an evening off with Jessica and Ben Mulroney, the latter of whom was covering the Games for Canadaaposs CTV network.

Royal tours are now a thing of the past for Harry and Meghan, who in  quit royal le and now live in Calornia with their children Archie and Lilibet. However, last September the couple did make a number of appearances around New York City, which some compared to a royal tour.It marked Harry and Meghanaposs first public appearances since they quit as senior royals and moved from the UK to Calornia as well as Meghanaposs first appearance in public since giving birth to daughter Lilibet. And according to royal expert and author Duncan Larcombe, the trip could be a sign of things to come from Meghan and Harry.  He told Closer magazine : They essentially did a royal visit, like they used to in the UK – just on their own terms and in their own way. So it seems they have quit le in the UK to do exactly what they did here over in the States.“There will no doubt be a lot of meetings at the Palace and talks over how they are going to approach Harry and Meghan’s plans. This visit was a huge two fingers up to the royal family and shows the royal feud is far from over.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Meghan MarklePrince HarryRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

First Minister Mark Drakeford introduced the new law, which makes all forms of physical punishment prohibited, under the ChildrenAct. Children will now have the same protection from assault as adults - and the law will also be applicable to anyone visiting Wales. Wales joins  other countries with such bans. Drakeford said of the legislation: “No more grey areas. That is all in the past. There is no place for physical punishment in a modern Wales.” Scotland introduced its own ban in November .Previously in Wales, and as is still the case in England and Northern Ireland, smacking a child was unlawful, but such an assault was allowed as long as it constituted reasonable punishment.  Whether the defence was accepted depended on the circumstances of each case, taking into consideration factors such as the age of the child and the nature of the contact, including whether it left a red mark or was carried out with a fist or implement such as a cane or belt. Deputy Minister for Social Services Julie Morgan called the change in law a historic moment for children and their rights in Wales. It comes after a study found that smacking children does not improve their behaviour and may actually increase behavioural dficulties. Researchers from University College Londonanalysed  years of research on physical punishment by looking at  global studies. They followed children over time and assessed data on smacking, finding that approximately  million children around the world are subject to physical punishment. The study came to the conclusion that smacking can in fact make things worse. Lead author Dr Anja Heilmann, from UCLaposs Department of Epidemiology, said: Physical punishment is ineffective and harmful, and has no benefits for children and their families. This could not be clearer from the evidence we present. We see a definitive link between physical punishment and behavioural problems such as aggression and antisocial behaviour. Even more worrying are findings that children who are the recipients of physical punishment are at increased risk of being subjected to more severe levels of violence. The findings, published in medical journal The Lancet, suggest the link between physical punishment and increased behaviour problems is causal. However, there were no signs that smacking resulted in a reduction in bad behaviour. The study added that smacking also showed no improvement in childrenaposs attention, cognitive abilities or social competence..

Carl said: I always wanted to change but I was always so lazy. It was always ‘I’ll do something tomorrow’ or ‘I will start on a Monday’ but nothing would ever happen. I needed to have some accountability. Smoking cannabis really impacted my lestyle. I smoked it every day without fail since probably the age of . I wanted to quit, so I thoughtI joined the gym, that gives me more reason to. During the working day, he would drive to the nearest McDonaldaposs for breakfast every day before indulging in a Greggs for lunch. He said: I had no interest in exercise, I had no motivation. I was really lazy and unfit. I spent most of my time sat on the couch. I had no idea about nutrition so I just ate whatever was easiest and most convenient. But Carlaposs lestyle concerns came to a head when he realised it was causing him to feel depressed and suffer low energy.He signed up for a -week programme with his we, Cheryl, , at Ultimate Performance gym in Spinningfields last summer.Before his transformation, Carl described himself as aposskinny fatapos - with skinny arms and legs but a larger belly.  After training at the gym three times a week and by overhauling his diet, he lost two stone in weight and his body fat percentage dropped from  per cent to nine. Cheryl, who is a specialist nurse, also lost almost two stone after cutting out junk food and training with her partner. They plan and prep all of their freshly cooked meals, which consist of boiled eggs or porridge for breakfast, salmon salads for lunch, and chicken and vegetables for their evening meal. Although the change was tough initially, Carl claims the transformation has helped him in every aspect of his le and others have noticed the dference too.  Walking into the gym was nerve-wracking and overwhelming but I was made to feel at ease straight away, Carl said. It was a big change that was hard at first, but once we got used to it, I started really enjoying it and the meals. Eight months on, the couple have sustained their healthy regime and even hit the gym together four to five times a week with their son who enjoys Lego club and swimming lessons while they workout. Carl said: I’m a lot more confident, I’m out more, I’m able to do more in work and it’s easier, I’m more active, more sociable. I’m definitely happier. I was stoned all the time so I was always insecure and wanted to be left alone. The gym gave me something to do, it was probably more through boredom that I used to smoke and then eat sh*tty foods all the time. One habit led to another. Carl added: It’s completely changed my le. The way I used to live then to the way I live now, it’s completely dferent two completely dferent people.

They are avoided by aeroplanes because they create in-flight turbulence.  But larger lenticular formations were pictured over northern Scotland and the borders earlier this year.A Met Office spokesperson told EdinburghLive : These strange, unnatural looking clouds sometimes form downwind of hills or mountains.They are quite unusual in the British Isles but do occasionally occur.“They look a lot like the traditional shape of flying saucers in science fiction, and real lenticular clouds are believed to be one of the most common explanations for UFO sightings across the world.When air blows across a mountain range, in certain circumstances, it can set up a train of large standing waves in the air downstream, rather like ripples forming in a river when water flows over an obstruction. If there is enough moisture in the air, the rising motion of the wave will cause water vapour to condense, forming the unique appearance of lenticular clouds. Lenticular clouds are a visible sign of mountain waves in the air. However, these waves can be present beyond the clouds, and may exist even when no clouds are formed. On the ground, they can result in very strong gusty winds in one place, with still air only a few hundred metres away. Pilots of powered aircraft tend to avoid flying near lenticular clouds because of the turbulence that accompany them. Skilledglider pilots, on the other hand, like them, because they can tell from the shape of the clouds where the air will be rising.

The balmy conditions wonapost last forever, but Met Office forecasters say this week will still be a warmer than average period for March.Richard Miles, Met Office spokesman, told the : The warmest day of the week in this dry period is going to be today and tomorrow. In one or two places it might creep up to as high as C, and it will drop down at the weekend. The temperatures for the rest of the week will be above average but it just wonapost be as warm.  Mr Miles says that by Thursday, there will be a noticeable temperature dference, but conditions will still be fine and dry. He added: You have isolated places that will see C today and tomorrow and on Thursday you will be looking at C or C - which is still above the March average. You will have more cloud around the second half of the week where it will feel a bit milder, but it will be fine and dry.  The mercury is likely to sit at C to C today but Met Office forecasters are predicting highs of C on Tuesday. Temperatures should then hold steady in most of England at around C or C through the rest of the week and into the weekend - warmer than the average for March. Met Office meteorologist Greg Dewhurst said: This week is going to be very similar. Weaposre going to keep high pressure just to the east of the UK and that means it will be largely dry and settled with plenty of sunny spells.  There is the odd exception, there could just be an isolated shower across the Midlands on Monday, perhaps northern England on Tuesday, but theyaposre going to be very isolated and most places will be dry and sunny. Mr Dewhurst added sheltered areas will continue to be on the pleasant and warm side. The temperature is expected to remain above average into the weekend but will then drop slightly into the following week. The mercury hit .C in Kinlochewe in Scotland on Saturday. This is some way off the highest UK March temperature which was .C recorded in Cambridgeshire on March  .

From pm to pm on Tuesday in London, Brits could enjoy highs of C, Netweather predicts, and there is a chance of the same on Wednesday.How will you enjoy the weather  Join the discussion in the comment sectionBy comparison, weather predict that temperatures in Barcelona will only hit C on Tuesday - a whole C lower.The UK will also be warmer than Monaco, Madrid and Lisbon this week. BBC forecaster Chris Fawkes reckons the weather “is going to get a lot, lot warmer” this week. As the southerly winds continue to push northwards through Tuesday and Wednesday, those temperatures are going to surge signicantly, he said. Tuesday - a fine day with some sunshine - maybe a few isolated showers developing through the afternoon but most of you will have a dry day though.  Temperatures will reach a high of  degrees C in London,  degrees C in Glasgow and  degrees C in Belfast. Jim Dale, meteorologist for British Weather Services, says it may be even warmer this week. He explained: We are expecting a very pleasant spell of spring weather.  It is certainly going to bring the warmest spell of weather so far this year in time for the spring equinox. We expect plenty of sunshine through the next week, and there is a chance that we see C in parts. There are also hopes that this warm spell lasts into next month, with odds for the warmest April on record tumbling. Coral now have the chances at -. Met Office verdictMeanwhile the Met Office told the LiverpoolEcho that much of the UK can expect to see more warm weather and sunshine this week.Forecasters said there are plenty of sunny spells to come and temperatures will rise a little bit in the week ahead, after a cooler Sunday. The mercury is likely to sit at C-C on Monday but Met Office forecasters are predicting highs of C on Tuesday before temperatures hold steady in most of England at around C or C through the rest of the week and into the weekend - warmer than the average for March.

The north of the UK is expected to see highs of between C and C. The pleasant conditions are due to the jet stream tracking well to the north of the UK, letting high pressure dominate from the east. Met Office meteorologist Greg Dewhurst said: This week is going to be very similar. Weaposre going to keep high pressure just to the east of the UK and that means it will be largely dry and settled with plenty of sunny spells. There is the odd exception, there could just be an isolated shower across the Midlands on Monday, perhaps northern England on Tuesday, but theyaposre going to be very isolated and most places will be dry and sunny. Mr Dewhurst added sheltered areas will continue to be on the pleasant and warm side. The temperature is expected to remain above average into the weekend but will then drop slightly into the following week.

On one night out, we saw a group of lads from Cardf. They were all dressed as babies getting a tattoo. It was one of the group stag weekend. They had diapers on and everything. I was walking passed and I was drunk. Out of the blue, something popped into my head and I thought aposI will have a tattoo,apos quite a lot of people do when they are in places like Magaluf. This guy who I got chatting to in the group, said aposwhy donapost you have my name tattooed on you, I will pay for it.apos At first I thought he was joking. So I did and he payed for it. It must have been about €. It was so random.The next morning, I realised he was staying at the same hotel as me but he was leaving that day. That was the last I ever saw of him. It was not a holiday romance type of thing. The tattoo was simply a aposyes, letaposs go for it.apos I donapost regret my tattoo at all. I will never get rid of it either. It is a nice little reminder of our girls trip away. My partner at the time just used to laugh it off. After  years and a refusal to get rid of her aposDaniel Fordeapos inking, she has decided to try and find him on social media. She added:  years on, I am thinking I should try and find him, it is his name on my bum after all. We have a Daniel Forde, but I do not knowit is a Daniel Forde or the Daniel Forde. I am waiting for him to open the message. It will be good to to get back in contact with him just to seehe remembers. If I do manage to find him, I have no idea what I will say to him.

Explaining why she continued to work even after such a serious procedure, Ruby said: “I can never bring myself to stop working and I took nudes in the bed in my hospital gown the day after surgery.

Ruby explained: “I wouldn’t have thought anything of it [the headaches] but I had two friends who had brain surgery within the same year. I also heard of someone who had been diagnosed with brain cancer. “I’m so glad I [got checked out] because I went for an MRI, where they found out what I had. [The surgery] was approximately three hours long and I was so nervous, because I’ve never had surgery or anaesthetic before. I had to have a catheter in for  hours and couldn’t lt my head properly for a while She continued: “It was really scary waking up in the ICU where I had to stay, as I was being checked on every hour to make sure I didn’t have any brain damage. I’ve been in a lot of pain but it’s all going to get better from here and I will hopefully not have any ongoing issues with it. “It was one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to go through, but I’m so grateful I have my job with the money and flexibility to get through it. [My fans] were mostly concerned and I feel like we are very close – they’re like my friends. “They loved the nudes but they told me I needed to take a break from working.

After going into labour with her daughter Phoebe Belle, -year-old Bethany Collins was given Pitocin, a synthetic hormone that helps stimulate a womanaposs uterus muscles and cause contractions, so as to speed things along.However, despite this, Bethanyaposs cervix still wasnapost opening. She was experiencing severe contractions and, given that her babyaposs heart rate was dropping, she opted for an epidural. After pushing with all her might to help deliver her daughter, Bethany felt an intense pressure in her left eye and realised something was wrong. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Bethany said: “I heard a pop and asked the doctor ‘is my eyeball still in my head ’ He said yes, but I opened my eyes and everything was blurry. I felt so much pressure in my left eye, but I pushed again for the third time and she came. “They took her to make sure she was okay, before handing her over to me. I asked my husband ‘is my eyeball really in my head  It can’t be – I feel so much pressure and I can barely see anything, something has to be wrongapos. He said that it was definitely poking out more than the one, but it wasn’t too bad. After  minutes had passed, Bethanyaposs eye began poking out even further, with the situation continuing to worsen overnight.As he was stitching her up, Bethanyaposs doctor remarked that heaposd never seen such a thing happen before, and so decided to call an optometrist to have a look. Bethany said: “I told him [I wasn’t in any pain] but he just continued looking at my eye. I had pretty much the whole unit come and look too – I became the talk of the unit that day. My sweet nurse askedI wanted a patch, so I could at least see out of my good eye without any interference. She got me a pack of nipple covers and I used them instead. She added: “The next day, the optometrist looked at my eye and also commented that he had never seen something like this before. “Ultimately, the final verdict was that there was just a lot of pressure from the force of the push, so said to wait and seeit would go back. I noticed improvements at the two-week mark and it was like I got a black eye. It was protruding and bruised.Thankfully, Bethanyaposs eyes are back to normal now, and sheaposs enjoying le as a new mother to little Phoebe Belle. Bethany continued: It took six weeks for my eye to finally flush back into my face and even it out with the other, but I really thought I was doomed. Things are now great, as I have a beautul two-month-old baby girl and two normal eyeballs.In a video shared via TikTok, Bethany opened up about her ordeal, clocking up more than . million views and , likes at the time of writing.Bethany begins her vid by lip-syncing: “I think I would look so sexy pregnant”, going on to reveal a photo of her shortly after giving birth. The text reads, “My eye popped out while I was pushing, with the pic clearly showing how one of Bethanyaposs eyes was notably lower than the other, protruding from her face. One viewer shuddered, “New fear unlocked, while another wrote, “Hi ma’am I’m six months pregnant and I need you to keep things like this to yourself.

But thataposs not the experience one woman on Reddit had after her mum completely took over the planning for her wedding and controlled things so much she pushed her daughter to want to elope instead. In her post, the woman claimed she initially only wanted a maximum of  people at her wedding, but her mum had made a guest list of  and had been pushing her to go down the traditional route. She said: My fiancé proposed in October of ! I was thrilled of course and immediately told my mum and dad - Iaposm an only child so they were also thrilled. My mum immediately began planning which is great, I can use all the help I could get, but it turned into multiple daily texts and demands.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Our list was - people, hers was . I wanted a smaller unique wedding, she wanted traditional. I wanted a vintage style gown from , she wanted me in a ball gown. It was driving me CRAZY. The stress was making me sick and I was avoiding all contact with her because I just couldnapost do it. Eventually, the woman asked her partnerhe would be okay with eloping instead, and when he was on board they decided to tell her mum about their plan - which only made things worse. She added: She handled it surprisingly well at first, and we thought we may actually get what we wanted - a private, no fuss, quiet time with a friend there to sign the paper and spending the rest of the day just the two of us doing whatever we love. But no. My mother had to make it about her.  It started with her trying to plan a small ceremony at my future mother-in-lawaposs house with my fiancéaposs stepfather officiating. Not once had we mentioned wanting to have the ceremony nevermind at someoneaposs house, but my mum brought the plans up to my mother-in-law, despite me telling her thanks but no thanks. I had to be blunt with my mother after that. Not only had she tried to take charge of this, but she had gone behind our backs and tried to make it happen when we said no. The woman told her mum that all she wanted was to sign the marriage certicate with her fiancé and have her friend - who is also a photographer - witness the signing as well as take a few photos.  Earlier this month, the woman and her now-husband went ahead and eloped as planned, and even let her mum plan a celebratory dinner after the event as a compromise. She explained: We eloped on March . My friend did the photoshoot for us and we exchanged rings and vows, even got to have our first dance in a beautul old train station - it was everything we wanted. My mother wasnapost happy about not being a part of our vows photoshoot ring exchange dance but we had compromised and had dinner with the entire family. She chose the place, picked a cake, chose who we invited, and all that rubbish. But you know what - I had an amazing time with my new husband and my amazing friend, we were still able to keep our spirits up despite her taking over the dinner, and we got married! And while the woman is over the moon with her marriage and the way the wedding turned out, her mum is now refusing to speak to her and has made little to no contact with her since the wedding day. She said: Since then, my mum has been little to no contact despite letting me know she would be kicking me off her insurance for my car and I needed to figure it out. Iaposm honestly fine with the limited contact and my stress has been greatly reduced because of it. It sucks that I canapost ever be the daughter she wants but Iaposm sick of my boundaries being ignored. My husband and I are planning a reception during the summer to celebrate and are making sure she has absolutely nothing to do with it until she receives the invite a month before. F**k it.

House-hunting horror fans had a bidding war at an auction for the stone-built chapel which is built next to a graveyard. It was once surrounded by woodland when it was built in the th century - and legend says it is even haunted by a baying hound after claims a former minister heard its blood-curdling howls. Folklore has it that a former minister saw the great black beast before striking it between the eyes with his Bible. The property is believed to be haunted by the black hound of the underworld in Cwmbran, South Wales.  The mythical creature is said to have burst into flames and disappeared - leaving the clergyman with a singed beard. The chapel in St Dials went under the hammer with a guide price of £, - but sold for £, more after  bids from three bidders. Property seekers will soon discover, it is built in the centre a new suburb. And sellers say it could be let out as a quirky airbnb let and would provide peace and quiet and be unlikely to be disturbed by new-build home owners. The chapelaposs spooky history and legends are likely to deter many would-be owners butsomeone has an interest in the supernatural, it might make a dream home a dream. They say its history would make it a fine property which could be converted for everyday use. Despite dating back to the th century, it has no planning restrictions in place and is not a listed building. This will give the new buyer a bank canvas and either allow them to preserve its ancient history or incorporate it in any development.  Debra Bisley, of Paul Fosh Auctions, said: I donapost know about the mysterious Black Hound and the ministeraposs beard but the chapel and graveyard is certainly unusual plonked as it is in the middle of the modern estate.

The critics say: “Despite the current war, Switzerland continues to host an accomplice of Putin’s regime.” It added that it was time for the neutral country “to take action” and send her home to Putin, .Kabaeva is seldom seen in public - but was caught on video dancing in Moscow in December amid fears Putin was planning to go to war in Ukraine. Recent reports have claimed she is seeing out the war with her rumoured children in a mountain retreat in Switzerland.“We, the citizens of Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, which is currently undergoing immense suffering, are uniting to appeal to the Swiss authorities,” states the petition in German, French and English and posted on change.org, so far signed by almost ,.“The public has just learned that the Russian political and media figure, and former [rhythmic gymnast], Alina Kabaeva, is hiding the consequences of the sanctions imposed on the Russian Federation in your country.  “She is the favourite we of [the] delusional dictator and war criminal who has been treacherously attacking Ukraine over the past weeks. “As she is supportive of social activities in Russia, she has been attempting to get Russian citizens accustomed to the reality of sanctions after , and personally proclaimed: ‘The worse it gets, the better for us!’” The signatories question why “given the volume of sanctions placed on Russia” the authorities continue to host her and her family at a time when Putin “is destroying the lives of millions”. The West has so far not sanctioned Kabaeva - although as well as being Putin’s rumoured secret partner, she is also chairman of the board of directors at National Media Group, a major Kremlin-obedient TV and newspaper behemoth, at a salary of almost £ million a year. The petition tells the Swiss: For the first time in modern history, your country has violated its neutrality, which it did not even do vis-à-vis Nazi Germany in the th century, and joined the sanctions against Putin and his surroundings.“And now you are allowing his favourite mistress and her children to hide within the borders of your state.” There is as yet no independent evidence that Kabaeva, a former pro-Putin MP, is hiding in Switzerland, where she was rumoured to have previously given birth in the country. It adds: “We want to remind you that Alina Kabaeva is not only a woman who stained herself with an association with the Russian dictator, but also a criminal against humanity. “In particular, she was among the initiators of the draft law, which in Russia was called the “law of scoundrels” or “the law of Dima Yakovlev. “This shameful move deprived thousands of Russian orphans of the possibility of being adopted abroad. “Consequently, many applications already open at the time for the adoption of seriously ill children were canceled and applicants for qualied medical care simply died. “Alina Kabaeva, [then] a member of the State Duma [parliament], obediently approved any unconstitutional initiative of President Putin, which later became almost genocidal against the internal population of Russia.”  They call for the Swiss to “investigate very carefully the legal basis on which she is present in your country. It adds: “Please consider it especially against the backdrop of sanctions imposed on her as a top executive of Russian propaganda media. “Please decide whether the residence of this inidual in your country is warranted. “We also ask you to check the ‘cleanliness’ of the funds used for the purchase of real estate in Switzerland, of which this person uses. “We will seek justice in any way possible, andthe fact of corruption of inidual political officials of Switzerland is found out, which has allowed Alina Kabaeva to obtain citizenship bypassing all procedures, then we will ensure that this information isn’t kept a secret. “At times like this, filled with tremendous uncertainty, you must be severe with your actions and in regards to the beneficiaries of Putinaposs regime!“It’s time you reunite Eva Braun with her Führer!” Separate reports suggest Kabaeva is not in Switzerland but at a hi-tech underground bunker in the Altai Mountains of Siberia. Political scientist Valery Solovey, , linked to the Telegram channel, said earlier this month: “In fact, it is not a bunker, but a whole underground city, equipped with the latest science and technology.” He warned: “I hope this means something to you  “That the President sends his family to this bunker.” In her only statement linked to the war, Kabaeva slammed the refusal to allow the Russian team to compete at the Beijing Paralympics.  “There has never been a more shameful page in the history of world sports,” she said. “They did not worry and did not remove from the competition any country that participated in the destruction of hundreds of thousands of civilians in Yugoslavia, Iraq, Libya, and Syria. “But sports officials were very angry when Russia decided to protect the Donbas and Luhansk from the Nazis. She complained that Olympic officials “tried so hard to humiliate the Russians, banned our symbols, flag and anthem”. But still Russians succeeded due to the talent of our athletes. “Russia was, is and will be a great sports power - and you canapost do anything about it. Rumours first linked her romantically to Putin as long ago as  when she was a pro-Kremlin MP. Tabloid Express Gazeta recounted in May when she was still out of sight: “She literally vanished. “After the giving-birth-to-twins reports nothing was heard about Kabaeva, asshe had disappeared. “Alina is not giving interviews, nor attending social events, nor participating in any TV programmes. “One can only guess what is happening in her private le.” Putin - who in  announced his orce from we Lyudmila, a former Aeroflot stewardess - has previously said: I have a private le in which I do not permit interference. It must be respected.” He deplored those who with their snotty noses and erotic fantasies prowl into othersapos lives”. Kabaeva is on record as saying she had met a man who I love very much”, gushing: Sometimes you feel so happy that you even feel scared. However the Russian media - including her own newspaper and TV group - throws no light on whether they are or were a couple. In  Kabaeva was temporarily banned from competing in rhythmic gymnastics after failing a doping test. A year earlier she had won gold at the  summer Olympics. Once regarded as Russia’s most eligible woman, the only other suitor she has been linked to by the media was a married Georgian policeman. This relationship petered out in  amid complaints of tabloid intrusion into her le. She once posed almost nude for Maxim and was described as “full of sex” by a photographer. There have been many reports of her wearing a wedding ring, but no records of a marriage. She is reported to have a fleet of Maybach limousines at her disposal, and was seen surrounded by a squad of machine-gun toting security guards on visits to a Moscow cafe. Many Russians saw her as the reason for the breakup of Putin’s marriage to ex-first lady Lyudmila, , mother of his two adult daughters. The dictator of neighbouring Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko hinted that Putinaposs orce decision came about because Kabaeva put pressure on the president.

As the country marks its th anniversary, a coalition of Jamaican politicians, business leaders, doctors and musicians have called in an open letter for the British monarchy to pay slavery reparations.The letter reads: We note with great concern your visit to our country Jamaica, during a period when we are still in the throes of a global pandemic and bracing for the full impact of another global crisis associated with the Russian  Ukraine war.We see no reason to celebrate  years of the ascension of your grandmother to the British throne because her leadership, and that of her predecessors, has perpetuated the greatest human rights tragedy in the history of humankind. The group Advocates Network, a human rights coalition of Jamaican activists and equalities organisations, will stage a protest outside the British High Commission in Kingston at .am just hours before Prince William and Kate arrive.  Co-organiser of the protest Nora Blake told The Independent: “It is important as we turn  years old as an independent nation that we stand as “adults” on solid ethical, moral and human justice grounds to say to Britain, who was once our “parent”, that you have done wrong in enriching yourselves off of chattel slavery and colonialism. “Morally this requires an apology, and it is only just that reparations be made. “Many precedents have been set for this.  “Today we are setting the conversation of our future generations, for them to have something to build a brighter future.” Numbers willing to participate in the protest have not been confirmed but organisers say it is backed by  figures from a wide cross-section of industries including politics, business, the clergy and arts. Signatories also include iconic reggae artist Big Youth and Mike Henry - one of Jamaica’s longest-serving MPs.  Directly addressing Prince William, who with we Kate is undertaking the tour to firm up relations with the Caribbean realms and celebrate the Queen’s  years on the throne, the letter states: “We will not participate in your Platinum Jubilee celebration! It adds: We are of the view that an apology for British crimes against humanity, including but not limited to, the exploitation of the indigenous people of Jamaica, the transatlantic trafficking of Africans, the enslavement of Africans, indentureship and colonialisation, is necessary to begin a process of healing, forgiveness, reconciliation and compensation.”  In sync with Jamaica’s th independence later this year, the protest group has issued the royals with a -point breakdown detailing reasons why this is warranted. The apparent opposition in Jamaica comes after the tour began in controversial circumstances when opposition from villagers in Belize, who cited a range of issues including objections to the Cambridgesapos helicopter landing site, forced a royal trip to a farm on Sunday to be scrapped. It was replaced with a visit to a chocolate producer before the royals travelled to the cultural centre of the Garuna community in Hopkins.  The Cambridges are todaydue to visit stunning ancient Maya ruins deep in the heartland of Belize. William and Kate will be given a tour of the site and have the chance to take in Caana, or sky palace, which remains the tallest man-made structure in Belize. The duke visited Belize as a teenager in , when he reportedly learned jungle survival techniques with the Welsh Guards who were receiving training from the British Army Training Support Unit as part of Exercise Native Trail.  William was beginning a gap year before university at the time and while in the jungle, the then -year-old duke learned his A level results. The last engagement of the day will see the couple attend a reception hosted by the Governor-General of Belize at the Maya ruins at Cahal Pech, near San Ignacio. This special reception will be held in celebration of the Queenaposs Platinum and William will give a speech. During their first full day in Belize on Sunday, the couple toured a cocoa farm and danced during a cultural visit to a nearby village.

Now that heaposs invaded Ukraine in what has been widely criticised as an unjust war, the speculation continues to run re.Putin, , has been in the Kremlin since  and public statements about his health are few and far between. As the Ukraine war appears to be waging longer than Putin planned, more questions have arisen over his health, from a physical perspective to mental capacity. Any statements from the Kremlin have dismissed all claims - but theyaposve remained tight-lipped on Putinaposs health since the invasion began on February . Here are some of the signs that explain why many suspect the former KGB agent is ill. Is Vladimir Putin seriously ill   aposSteroidsapos Recent photos of Putin have appeared to show him with a more bloated face, which some suggest mean he might be under a steroid treatment for a condition. It has been speculated that steroids could be part of a treatment for potential back issues. The side effects of steroids include mood swings and behavioural changes. A high dose of steroids can even cause confusion or changes in thinking, according to Macmillan Cancer Support. The charity says: This can include having strange or frightening thoughts.Fiona Hill, the British former senior White House expert on Russia, told Politico : Putin’s not looking so great, he’s been rather puffy-faced. We know that he has complained about having back issues. Evenit’s not something worse than that, it could be that he’s taking high doses of steroids, or there may be something . There seems to be an urgency for this that may be also driven by personal factors. She added: He may have a sense that time is marching on - it’s  years , after all, and the likelihood after that kind of time of a Russian leader leaving voluntarily or through elections is pretty slim. Most leaders leave either like Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko thought that he might leave, as the result of massive protests, or they die in office. If those claims are true, former foreign secretary and medical doctor Lord Owen said taking steroids can make you more vulnerable to Covid.  Lord Owen told Times Radio: Look at his face, see how that has changed - he now has an oval face. People who said, oh, itaposs plastic surgery or Botox, I donapost believe that at all. Heaposs on either anabolic steroids as a bodybuilder - and heaposs very proud of his muscles and strips to the waist and everything like that - or heaposs on corticosteroids. If youaposre on these drugs, this gives you this face. It reduces your immunity and makes you more vulnerable to Covid.  He added: This man has been in complete isolation, quite extraordinary, wonapost see anybody, stays miles away, tremendous pressures. Which indicates heaposs on a steroid and probably, maybe, a combination of both. And we ought to fess up to it, that carries with it, particularly anabolic steroids, bodybuilders, aggressiveness that comes through. I think his personality has changed, but donapost believe heaposs mad. Heaposs a very clever and able, and somebody who you donapost want as an enemy, and heaposs ruthless. Cancer claimsPolitical scientist Valery Solovei has previously claimed Putin has cancer as well as symptoms of Parkinsonaposs Disease.He also claimed Putin underwent emergency surgery in February . In , Prof Solovei said of Putinaposs twin health traumas: “One is of psycho-neurological nature, the other is a cancer problem. “If anyone is interested in the exact diagnosis, Iaposm not a doctor, and I have no ethical right to reveal these problems. ”The second diagnosis is a lot, lot more dangerous than the first named diagnosis as Parkinson’s does not threaten physical state, but just limits public appearances. “But there is a fatal diagnosis.  “Based on this information people will be able to make a conclusion about his le horizon, which wouldn’t even require specialist medical education.” Parkinsonaposs speculation Last week, Putin held a pro-war rally in Moscow where many speculated he limped off stage. Footage of his limp added to growing speculation the leader may be suffering from Parkinson’s disease, which could be influencing his behaviour. And Prof Solovei isnapost the only one to speculate that Putin may have Parkinsonaposs. Sir Richard Dearlove, an ex-MI boss, has recently told GB news there is often a link between the disease and a “loss of restraint”.  Sir Dearlove, who headed up the secret service from  until , said: Maybe Putin’s behaviour - maybe his rationality - is prejudiced or compromised by illness. The best explanation, that we don’t know whether it’s correct or not, is that he may have Parkinson’s. That certainly I’ve heard from several neurologists who say that loss of restraint, psychosis, are very common Parkinson’s symptoms.  Neurological concerns Marco Rubio, a US senator and senior Senate Intelligence Committee member, recently speculated that somethingoff with the Kremlin boss.Mr Rubio told the: “I wish I could share more, but for now, I can say it’s pretty obvious to many that something is off with Putin.“He has always been a killer, but his problem now is dferent and signicant. Putin, he went on to add, “appears to have some neuro physiological health issues.” The Times reported Tatiana Stanovaya, of the political analysis firm R.Politik, saying: “Hehas withdrawn into himself a lot during the past two years.He has become distanced from the bureaucratic machinery, from the establishment, from the elite. He spends a lot of time alone stewing in his own fears and thoughts. Covid fears During Putinaposs recent meetings he can be seen sitting far away from others, leading some to speculate whether this is a power play - or whether he is terried of catching Covid. If previous claims about his health are true, he could be more vulnerable to the virus and it could explain his caution. However, Putinaposs attempts to stay far away from those he meets has not been consistent. In a recent meeting with French leader Emmanuel Macron, the two were seen sitting a few metres apart - and it looked ridiculous. It later transpired that Macron had refused to take a Covid test before meeting Putin over fears of supplying his DNA. Putin was then seen shaking hands with close ally Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko earlier this month - meaning his ally could have produced a negative Covid test before the meeting. Lukashenko recently told Japanese TV that Putin was in great health. He said: “The West, and you, should get this stupidity, this fiction out of your heads,” he told the interviewer. “Putin is absolutely fit, he’s in better shape than ever … This is a completely sane, healthy person, physically healthy – he’s an athlete.” “As they say here – he’ll catch a cold at all our funerals.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Macmillan Cancer SupportMIMarco RubioAleksandr LukashenkoLord OwenVladimir PutinPlastic surgeryParkinsons diseaseSteroids\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The hunt for the aposLemminkäinen Hoard’ is reaching its decade-long climax - and it is one of the largest and most valuable treasure troves in the world. Some , gemstones, including rubies, sapphires, emeralds and diamonds, have supposedly laid hidden in an underground temple near Helsinki for hundreds of years. Amateur archaeologists from at least five countries, including the UK, have vowed to assist “in any way possible” to find them. Several -carat gold le-size statues in human form are also thought to have been entombed within the labyrinthine Sibbosberg cave system in Sipoo, a town  miles east of Finlandaposs capital.At least , antiques dating back thousands of years are also thought to be inside. Until now, a -strong group of “penniless” friends have excavated the huge site alone, armed with little more than cheap buckets and spades. Over the last  years, members of the so-called ‘Temple Twelve’ have each dedicated up to six hours-a-day, seven days-a-week, removing hundreds of tonnes of rock and clay.  Their efforts hit the headlines last year when it was revealed they could be just metres away from reaching the fabled temple door. The Temple Twelve have since received thousands of enquiries from people wanting to join its ranks or to lend a hand. According to historian Carl Borgen, the group’s biographer and sole point of ‘outside’ contact, this “small army” of unpaid volunteers could start arriving on site within a matter of weeks in readiness for when digging resumes in spring. He said the extra helpers would “substantially” increase the Temple Twelve’s chances of reaching the jackpot,it exists, this year.  “The existence of an undiscovered hoard of this vast scale has, quite naturally, captured the public’s attention and generated unimaginable levels of support,” he said. “A small army of people from a iety of countries including the United States, the UK, Australia, Canada, France and Finland have been in touch askingand how they can help with the dig and with the multitude of preliminary activities. “If only a handful of those people turn up then the Twelve believe strongly that this season could be the big one and that the cave will finally give up her secrets, whatever they may be.”  The hoard’s alleged existence first emerged in  when the local landowner Ior Bock claimed that his family, one of the oldest in Scandinavia, were direct descendants of Lemminkäinen, a prominent figure in Finnish pagan mythology. He said the cave, which lies on his sprawling ancestral estate, was home to the fabled Lemminkäinen Temple where the collected treasures from countless generations of ancient Finnish pagans had been stored. Tens of thousands of jewels, ancient artefacts, and le-size gold statues of Lemminkäinen himself had been stashed in several interconnected chambers over thousands of years, he claimed. According to Bock, the temple entrance was sealed up with huge stone slabs in the th-Century to protect the treasures within from invading Swedish and Swiss armies.  His aged family line, the Boxström, had been keepers of the secret and s of the cave since then. Bock, who never married or had children, revealed the temple’s existence to The SKS Archives in Helsinki, which documents the oral and written cultural heritage of Finland, to ensure its untold story would not die with him. By , news of the so-called ‘Bock Saga’ had spread worldwide and the possibility of finding the temple’s entrance had attracted the attention of historians, corporate sponsors, and professional archaeologists. It also captured the imagination of amateur treasure hunters, who flocked to the site in search of gold and glory.  Among them was a group of  “like-minded strangers” who joined forces with Ior Bock to become the site’s first and only permanent, self-funded excavation team. Since that time, most of the original party have left or died, including Bock himself, who was murdered by a personal assistant in .Their number gradually dropped to  and has since been maintained with new members from Finland, Sweden, Norway, Holland, Germany, Australia, Russia, and the United States.The ‘Temple Twelve’, as they have become known, camp nearby and spend each summer hunting for proof that Bock’s claims of an undiscovered ancient civilisation were true.  No hard evidence of the hoard has yet been found, but the Temple Twelve believe they have the aposapostenacityaposapos and the necessary explosives to locate and remove the giant granite slabs from the temple door, which is said to lie ft below the surface and more than ft from the cave entrance. Using rudimentary tools including spades and buckets, the group has so far removed several four-tonne blocks from the cave’s entrance and have excavated around  tonnes of sediment below it. They now believe they could be just metres away from the fabled temple door.  The remaining sediment, and the granite slabs covering the temple door, could be removed within a matter of months thanks to a recent ‘donation’ of dynamite, they say.But the inclement Finnish weather means the digging season is confined to the summer months before the cave starts filling with freezing rainwater.The group pumps out more than .million litres of water annually at the start of every season. When digging resumes in May, the team is confident that they will reach the temple entrance –it exists.  Borgen, a friend of Bock and the world’s leading authority on the hoard, has been following ongoing excavations at the site for more than  years. He has been in regular contact with the group since excavations began in , and is one of only a handful of ‘outsiders’ they confide in. His book, Temporarily Insane, chronicles the Bock Saga and follows the fanatics—or ‘Bockists’—who have devoted their lives to finding its supposed treasure. He said the site, which is now owned by one of the members of the Temple Twelve, could yield its treasures by the summer, adding: “We’re entering the end game and,we win, the treasures to be found there will be unimaginable.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Treasure TroveGoldBanks\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

From Knapdale, they headed up the west coast, sailing to Lewis and Harris before arriving at their final destination, Iona.Covering almost , miles in the series, they visit places of worship, from pagan stones to an early Christian cave and a contemporary mosque and Sikh temple. The journey tests the pilgrims not just spiritually, but physically too.TV celeb and comedian Scarlett Moffatt, , said: #At school, I spent a lot of time just reading books and on my own and so that’s how I got into faith really. It just felt calming. There’s almost a stigma attached to sort of being religious.#Whenever I would tell my friends, they’d laugh and I’d be like, #why is that funny # I believe in God, there has to be something that started all this.#I would describe myself as Christian, but not a strict Christian. I don’t go to church, but I definitely believe and religion to me is security.#She added: #In my head somebody on a pilgrimage is in a loin cloth and they have really long hair#and they look a bit dehydrated like they need a good moisturiser mask.#I’m doing the pilgrimage as I want to know what my religion is. I want to be able to answer that question with confidence.#TV personality and interior designer Laurence Lewellyn-Bowen describes himself as a #non-conforming pagan#.

I’ve looked forward to this date since we entered and it’s what I’ve been working towards. My aim is to defend my gold,possible, but I want to see how well I can do and give him [his dad] a good run for his money.“I’ve made a few changes to my training, my bike and my run style slightly so we’ll see how that all pays off, but I love racing at Oulton Park, it’s a really nice track, a lovely atmosphere, it should be a really good day of racing.”Preparing to defend his M- British title, Leahn added: “This time around it’s at the beginning of the year so it’s going to be interesting, especially as the fields are much deeper this year which is great because that’s what it should be for a British Championships. But I’m going there to try and defend my title, I’ve got a taste for it now after last year and then it’s building up to the Worlds and Europeans later in the year.”Reflecting on the moment they shared on the podium together, Leahn said: “It was such a proud moment to see Dylan on the podium and to be able to share it with him made it even more special.“You are focused on your own race and your own effort, and it can be hard to work out who is in which age group when you’re racing, so until you cross the line you never really know where you’ve placed.“So, to find out I had won and then to see Dylan crossing the line to win his age group was a really nice feeling, especially having seen all the training and hard work he put in last year. It was a nice surprise to be driving home with two gold medals in the car.”.removeLast year’s championships was Dylan’s first standard distance duathlon and his first experience of a British Championships.“I had raced at Oulton Park earlier in the summer, so I knew the track and I really enjoyed racing there,” Dylan said. “I felt a lot more confident in October than at the race in June, but it was a whole new experience for me because it was across a distance I had never raced before.“It was a lot of unknowns, a lot of guess work, but it was an amazing feeling to cross the line and to be told you’re British champion. To be able to stand on the podium with my dad was amazing.”Last year saw Leahn claim world bronze at the World Triathlon Duathlon Championships in Spain. Later this year he will be back in Spain for the European Standard Distance Duathlon Championships in September, when he will be joined on the GB Age-Group Team by Dylan for the first time.“I’ve had the opportunity to travel and compete in dferent places and meet so many dferent people at races who I genuinely call friends, and now seeing the development and progression of Dylan within the sport is fantastic,” Leahn said.“When Dylan was youngerI was doing a long run, he would cycle alongside me and then at the weekend we would both run. Now we’ll do sessions together, we train together after Dylan comes home from school or at the weekend, and we also compete against each other at cross country. I’m so proud of him to see how he’s come from someone who used to follow me around on the bike to now I’m following him, and that’s purely down to his own effort and determination.

Also standing by was the steamer Brora, which was bund for Belfast.The conditions were so bad from the point of view of visibility that the leboat had to receive bearings from the Brora and other ships by means of the Aldis signal lamps while ships’ searchlights assisted them in getting into position. For a time the ships could only see each other on the radar screen.Coxswain Duncan Newlands, who knows this dreaded part of the estuary like the back of his hand, edged his leboat in astern of the coaster and proceeded to begin operations, but at .am came this dramatic message over the leboat’s radio: ‘Arrived alongside casualty at .hours got rope aboard and commenced towing at . hours.‘Rope now parted.

Its kirkyard gives testimony to the thriving trades that existed here, and the personal struggles and tragedies of families who lived in harsher times.The Witches Stone in Spott I heard once that a minister not so long ago oversaw the recording of the graves, many of which are now worn by the sea winds which sweep over this beautul but exposed place.One gravestone is so worn by the weather a hole has appeared in its centre. I stood by it and hoped that the story it once told had been caught before the words finally vanished.I showed Suu the jougs which hang at the entrance to the kirk: a metal collar attached to the wall by a chain.Here its victims would be chained up, humiliating them and exposing them to the judgement of other members of the community who deemed themselves morally superior, or at least hoped their own transgressions would never be discovered.It was the poor, of course, who were subject to such humiliations, and women in particular, not the rich and powerful men who made the rules they set for others.As we stood by the kirk, I told Suu the well-kent tale of the Rev John Kello, who was minister at Spott after the Reformation.A memorial to the women ly executed as witches Despite his pious pontications and apparent high moral standards, he murdered his poor long-suffering we Margaret because of greed. He then tried to make it look like suicide.The fact he stood in the kirk, giving a sermon on morality, holding the Bible with the same hands which he had used, just an hour before, to strangle his we to death, is breathtaking in its horror and hypocrisy.But actually at the heart of this crime is misogyny, a contempt and hatred of women, which was, and is, far from unusual.Kello was eventually caught out and confessed that is the unusual part of the story, not the murder. Women regularly died at the hands of partners and, despite changes and progress, they still do.The jougs were just part of that system of misogyny, a terror of humiliation that dangled before them as they went to church, a reminder that they had a place set for them by men they best not challenge.I took a photo of the jougs and accidentally caught Suu’s shadow as well.The image seemed symbolic of the many women history has forgotten, or didn’t even notice, who remain unnamed shadows in the events catalogued by self-important men.Further down the road, there is another place which shows the final societal conclusion of this perception of women: the Witches’ Stone.Jougs at Spott Parish Church It stands on a site where, it is said, women were horribly executed for the trumped-up crime of witchcraft as late as .There is no space here to get into the debate about which women actually met their end here, and when, and what the evidence tells us.There are times that historical pedantry is promoted on this issue, usually by men, which ignores the very real horror of these events.Suffice to say, this is a location that bears the memory,not all the names, of many women who were persecuted by a system and ideology which had misogyny at its heart.There are statistics, of course: , accused of witchcraft in Scotland, the vast majority women, with evidence that more than , were actually executed, many in or from East Lothian.The real number will be more, and even then statistics don’t tell even half the story.Many of those accused who managed to avoid being ‘worrit’ at the stake will still have had their lives ruined in so many ways. They will have lived with the vilication and suspicions.None of these women were guilty of being witches who had made a pact with the Devil.That was nonsense.They were mothers, healers, midwives, grandmothers, poor servants, old women, young women, usually poor women many were convicted on evidence we would now recognise as compassion and care for others.They were victims of the misogyny cast in the iron of the jougs. Their real crime was being a woman.That’s why I support the move by the Scottish Government to have a full legal pardon for all those who suffered from the insane brutality of the witch hunts. Men were victims too, but it was overwhelmingly women.It’s not just about historical justice, it’s about recognising that while, thankfully, times have changed a lot, they still haven’t changed enough.Misogyny isn’t historical, it’s very current and very real today, all over the world, as well as on our doorstep.That’s why a national monument would be a good idea too, in addition to recognising the local memorials such as the one at Spott, and in my home town of Prestonpans.They need to be made accessible too, not tucked away on a dangerous corner of a road where there is no safe place to stand and remember.And let’s stop calling the women witches, because they weren’t what they were accused of being.And as we commemorate their persecution, let’s also celebrate their role in society, their bravery, their talents and contributions."},{"url":null,"title":"schoolchildren-visit-scottish-parliament-first-time-since-pandemic-began","story":"Students visited Holyrood as part of the Scottish Parliament’s education visits programme to learn more about the work of MSPs – a trip that was not possible for almost two years due to coronavirus restrictions.Two Higher modern studies classes attended Holyrood last Tuesday and were met by Martin Whitfield and Brian Whittle, South Scotland MSPs.Mr Whitfield, who was previously East Lothian’s MP and a teacher at Dirleton Primary School, was delighted to welcome the pupils to the Capital.He said: “The suspension of public visits to Parliament has been one of many disappointing impacts of the pandemic over the last two years.“It was a pleasure to meet the Knox Academy students and answer some of their questions, and I look forward to welcoming many more young people from other local schools over the course of this parliamentary session.”S pupil Mara Popa described it as “an amazing experience for everyone” and said: “During this time, we were able to ask our MSPs questions about what an MSP does, committees that they are members of, and how they can hold the Government to account.”"},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-peeps-past-1997-1972-1922","story":"THE school bell was ringing for the last time for Dunbar Grammar School’s headteacher, reported the East Lothian Courier on March , .Will Collin today walks through the gates of Dunbar Grammar School for the last time as headteacher.After almost  years in the senior post, and five years before that as assistant head, he is taking early retirement at the age of .Explaining his decision, Mr Collin said: “I feel I am ready for retirement and putting my feet up.”Born and raised in Eyemouth, he began teaching maths and physics at the high school there in .Five years later he moved to Arbroath before coming to Dunbar as assistant headteacher in .Following an -month sojourn as the deputy head of Selkirk High School in the early s, he ed to Dunbar in .Looking back over a career spanning three decades at the school, Mr Collin, who lives with his we Val in Rosebery Place, said: “The best part of the job is working with young people.”...and  years agoVandals created ‘a reign of terror’, told the East Lothian Courier on March , .A wave of vandalism in East Lothian recently was likened to a “reign of terror” by a county official this week.He said damage amounting to almost £, had been done to a pavilion in Prestonpans.“We are fighting a losing battle,” said Mr George B.

That all has planning approval and work will proceed on site before the summer.

I have for the last several months been working with these parents and iniduals.We are aware that skateboarding and BMX bikes are now Olympic sports and the idea of linking these facilities with the fantastic sporting facilities we have at Hallhill developed into the idea of locating it on the land we have available at Lochend. We have been developing this idea and, along with the changing rooms, we feel that a community cafe would be fantastic for our young people when they use this area. It would provide some supervision for the area and provide toilets and refreshments for the people using the facility.We are all aware of the anti-social behaviour that has been taking place within our community. Our young people are currently using Lochend Woods at nights and over the weekends to meet up but have no supervision and are getting involved in anti-social behaviour. We see lots of complaints about our young people on social media and now all young people have been banned from using McDonald’s in the evenings. The situation will not improve and will become dangerous unless we do something to support them. We need to provide these young people somewhere they can meet up in a safe area along with some supervision.The outdoor activity can be used by anyone despite their age, sex or ability. I would expect to see adults and children using this facility at the same time along with some quality coaching in all activities. We are fortunate in Dunbar that many of our young people use skateboards, scooters, roller skates and bikes they will all benefit from using this facility. My hope is all our young people can feel this is a place they can come and feel safe and be involved, or just sit in the cafe with friends for a chat.As for the woodland, I am fully committed to doing everything I can to protect it and the wildle within it. We need to find a way of engaging with our young people to respect it and support the work we need to do protect it and its wildle.

That would be undemocratic.I trust Peter A Russell, since he backs the proposal, would apply the same supermajority to all proposals in the referendum – status quo, independence or “other”. But that won’t happen, and the whole nonsense just sounds like imperial rules from a century ago.I have the gravest doubts that a fair Scottish referendum can take place under the media rules proposed by the UN for “territories” Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland by this Tory Government seeking independence. The media is entirely Anglo-centric and unionist. The BBC that operates in Scotland lacks the bandwidth, forum or journalistic quality to debate anything, never mind independence.As Margaret Thatcher stated, negotiations for independence should start when a majority of pro-independence MPs are elected from Scotland. That would also sideline a whole lot of angst and bitterness.GR Weir, Ochiltree.SNP FOCUSING ON WRONG ISSUESNICOLA Sturgeon would have us believe that she is in tune with what “the people of Scotland” want. Clearly not. Time after time, surveys show that on top of the majority not wanting separation from the rest of the UK, a clear majority do not want the Government to be wasting time, money and effort on preparing for a referendum. How many civil servants are tied up preparing the latest fictional release called a White Paper  Could they not be put to better use getting accommodation and support in place for our homeless and those in poverty as well as helping with the Ukrainian work Not on the First Minister’s watch. All she wants is the headlines and the photo opportunity of helping Ukrainian refugees and to keep dangling the carrot of a referendum just over the next hill. The Ukrainians deserve all the help they can get from the many countries around the world offering support. Our own most vulnerable deserve help too.Theresa May said it was not the time a few years ago, pre-Covid and pre-Ukraine. What will it take for Ms Sturgeon to get the message that she is focusing on the wrong issues Jane Lax, Aberlour.WHY HAND THE KEYS TO BRUSSELS DESPITE wars and energy crises your Letters Pages still contain many missives from both pro and anti-independence camps.There is almost no doubt now that the referendum proposed for  is a non-starter. If those who are massively in favour of independence will draw some breath and admit this then perhaps a more basic question can then be answered. Does independence mean what it says or is it inextricably linked to handing the keys and responsibilities to Brussels Calling for an independent Scotland is simply wrongthat independence is promptly given away. The very word \"independence\" ought to be the centre of the debate and, as such, the answers from the nationalist side must include solid solutions to the currency, debt, pensions, national bank, interest rates and borders issues, not wish lists.Europe comes later,at all, so membership is simply conjecture based upon how well Scotland doesindependent. The current world situation does not favour small non-aligned countries, nor will this change in the foreseeable future. This needs very much to be taken into account. We are better together.Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow.DEFINING A WAR CRIMINALPRESIDENT Biden has publicly called Vladimir Putin a war criminal, a charge undoubtedly accurate given his bloody actions in Ukraine. The number of innocent civilians murdered on his orders is now well into the thousands and will continue to grow so long as this war continues.Let us not forget that Russia was at no time threatened by Ukraine nor was ever likely to be this was simply an invasion to reclaim territory ly claimed by Putin to belong to Russia. He calls Zelenskyy a Nazi and seeks \"denazication\" yet it is Putin, like Hitler, who invaded another nation’s sovereign territory it is Putin, like Hitler, who is a dictator it is Putin, like Hitler, who has total disregard for human le. Yes, Putin is a war criminal all right, and should be convicted as such.But let’s back up a moment. President Nixon together with his Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, in illegal direct defiance of Congress, indiscriminately bombed Cambodia and Laos, two countries not involved in the Vietnam War. They unfortunately just happened to be in the way. Half a million innocent civilians from each countrywere killed by bombs dropped from Bs with barely a word of protest that I can recall. Nixon is dead but Kissinger, now , still lives a le of contented luxury in the US. No retribution for him.Then there are George W Bush and Tony Blair, both partners in a \"coalition of the willing\" although in direct defiance of the unwilling majority of the population of the UK, who, on the flimsiest of pretexts, bombed and killed more than , innocent Iraqi civilians. For Mariupol in Ukraine read Fallujah in Iraq.Putin is a war criminal and must be held to accountKissinger, Bush, and Blairalso have civilian blood on their hands and should be arraigned immediately, not that that is likely to happen.A war criminal is a war criminal, a dead civilian is a dead civilian their provenance is irrelevant.Bob Buntin, Skelmorlie.UN AND NATO HAVE FAILED USOVER the last three weeks, the United Nations has shown itself to be an impotent and toothless organisation, serving solely as an elite members club for the well-paid representatives of national governments, whoseis to provide a mouthpiece of their respective governments on the world stage. Both the Security Council and the General Assembly have failed to achieve unanimous condemnation of Russia’s illegal war or the illegal targeting of civilian targets and hospitals.We are one minute before midnight on the path to World War Three, yet the UN has spectacularly failed to achieve its prime and founding objective of preventing war. Even the mighty Nato, the worlds strongest military force, has cowered in the face of Vladimir Putin’s expansionist war and its crimes against humanity.Surely now is the time to rethink the purpose and usefulness of these dysal and bureaucratic organisations that have failed Ukraine, failed democracy, and failed the world.Ian Forbes, Glasgow.FOLLY OF A NUCLEAR ARSENALWHEN there is a war on, its convenient to criticise the SNP-Greens alliance for their Nato- and nuclear-sceptic stance .Any rational person opposes nuclear weapons, especially those parked in Scotland’s backyard. The shared consequence of radioactive fallout are only too obvious from the  Chernobyl explosion.Russia wisely took back its Ukrainian-based weapons when pro-Nato independence was declared.The other eight nuclear countries are the US, the UK, France, Israel, India, Pakistan, China and North Korea with a collective total of , bombs. Only one of those countries has used such weapons on innocent civilians, at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.The US kindly shares its nuclear arsenal with other countries, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Netherlands and Turkey.It is a bit like saying the gun lobby acts as a deterrent for shooting incidents.Malcolm Macqueen, Fairlie.MASKS DID NOT DO THEIR JOBDAVID Clarkclaims that the current spike in Covid cases is due to people not wearing masks.

These should include training and recruitment, the availability of sub-contracting and supplier opportunities, and that it is intended to improve the economic, social or environmental well-being of the area.If no community benefits are sought in a contract, a statement must be published on justying the decision.When CMAL announced the Turkish shipyard firm as the preferred bidder no benefits to any Scottish community were listed.CMAL says that as the contract has not been officially awarded yet, it cannot provide any detail about the bid.Now it has emerged that CMAL has amassed £,. in overseas travel over the last five years. It was spending an average of £. a month over six months during the Covid pandemic in  and  having previously forked out £. a month in the five years before the virus restrictons.Alba Party deputy Kenny MacAskill criticised the spend.“CMAL’s remit doesn’t extend beyond the Minch but they’ve run up almost £, in overseas travel since  and struggle to sail the seas they’re supposed to serve,\" he said. \"This even includes periods when foreign travel was precluded through lockdown. \"It’s bad enough that CMAL are giving contracts for ships that should be built in Scotland. But it’s adds salt to the wound that whilst the ships they’ve provided for remote communities lie idle, berthed or being repaired, they’re jetting around the globe.”Ministers have previously been warned that they may have acted unlawfully by failing to give nationalised shipbuilder Ferguson Marine a look in for a £m contract to create two new leline ferries to serve Islay.The Turkish yard won in front of four overseas companies to bid for the contract to build the two vessels - and excluded the Inverclyde shipbuilder.Finance secretary Kate Forbes has stated that in line with the Procurement ReformAct , bidders for the Islay procurement process were required to detail the community benefits they are able to offer within their response to the invitation to tender.Submissions from the four yards were evaluated including the responses to the community benefits section included within the original contract notice.Ferguson Marine which runs the last remaining shipyard on the lower Clyde was nationalised after it financially collapsed in August , amid soaring costs and delays to the construction of two leline island ferries.It came five years after tycoon Jim McColl first rescued the yard when it went bust.The delivery of new island ferries MV Glen Sannox and Hull , which were due online in the first half of , was found to be between four and five years late, with costs doubling to over £m.Earlier this year it emerged that the completion of the long-overdue ferries had been delayed again.The Islay route is already one of the busiest services for freight on the Clyde and Hebrides network, and CMAL says that the incoming ferries will support the island’s vital economic activity.The four shortlisted shipyards were to submit their technical and commercial proposals for the design and construction of the two vessels.The successful initial bids were from Damen Shipyard in Romania, Remontowa Shipbuilding in Poland, and Turkish shipyards Sefine Denizcilik Tersanecilik Turizm, and Cemre Marin Endustri.It was confirmed Ferguson Marine embarked in a bid for the contract through the initial Pre-Qualication Questionnaire process but failed to make the shortlist.A CMAL spokesman said that Mr MacAskills comment demonstrated a \"profound lack of understanding of CMAL’s role and the work we do to support Scotland’s ferry infrastructure – including the Northern Isles, beyond the Minch\".The spokesman added: “We have spent considerable time in past years searching the global second hand market for ferries to bring resilience to the fleet. It is vital that our vessels team inspect these ferries first hand to assess their suitability for the network.“We also visit shipyards during the evaluation stage of the new vessel procurement process to correlate the bid response from each yard with their reality, and attend factory acceptance tests for machinery. In terms of travel during lockdown, ferries are a leline service and many of our team were given critical worker status during the pandemic to maintain infrastructure.”"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-island-life-capsizing-government-must-assure-us-better-future","story":"We know better than anyone  that we are suffering a backward-moving economy along with the rest of the known world, so she can skip those avenues of guff and get straight down to analysing the historic failure of the Scottish Parliament to deliver even adequate vessels and infrastructure to our islands. The damage to confidence and simple predictability of island le done in the last  years, against the stream of official rhetoric, is causing an unhappy reality to be faced by islanders that they do not have a sustainable future on the islands as long as the Scottish Government is failing to back them with real measures, rather than transparent political yack.How do we know island le is capsizing  Simple measurements. Static or falling incomes in an already marginal area while fuel costs head for £ per litre. Calmac ferry spaces set to a constant “unavailable”, months in advance, on its website. Residents working or moving away. Second-house ownersunable to find handy locals to clean their business premises.Much blame has been heaped on the weather for ferry failures, but this argument is as redundant as a rusting hulk in Rosyth or the Clyde. Ships in mid-Atlantic don’t suddenly sink when the weather blows up a bit but they would struggle to tie up in a decent swell. The example of Tiree and Coll shows that the investment in link spans has not been sufficient to assure service. These ports also need protected by sea walls to kill the swell and the undeniable savings all round that would come from the creation of a causeway across the Gunna Sound would mean that only one protected link span was needed.What is Ms Gilruth going to do Peter Isaacson, Hynish, Tiree.INQUIRY IS NOW OVERDUEI WRITE with reference to recent letters and articles and in particular Ferguson Marines inability to quanty a perceived further delay in delivery of MV Glen Sannox due to cables of inadequatebeing installed . Fergusons claim that these cables were installed pre-nationalisation is hardly credible.To have installed electrical cables at that stage, pre-launch, would have required cable supports in place, including structural penetrations and routings compatible with piping, ventilation and other services being defined. If such services were not in place, why would cables be On a previous occasion, the yard declared that the bulbous bow was reconstructed because \"it did not look nice\". I think Lloyds Register, the classication authority, might take a dferent view of this action.The yard can only claim delay in delivery due to force majeur or owners additional requirements and any self-inflicted wounds have to be absorbed in the yards delivery schedule. We are of course well beyond such niceties.A public inquiry is now long overdue, the only criteria for which is \"the existence of public concern\", but it must be convened by a Government minister. Some hope.Norman Brown, former director and general manager, Ferguson Shipbuilders Ltd, Largs.WORRY OVER EV CHARGE POINTSIT was interesting to read Thomas GF Gray’s letterabout the lack of incentive for an energy supplier to provide a smart meter that actually works. Meanwhile it seems likely that a considerable number of consumers are about to lose grants for installing domestic charge points for electric vehicles, work which, under a UK Government scheme to encourage the move away from internal combustion engines, must be completed by the end of this month.Whether this situation is unique to those in the area where Scottish Power Energy Networks is the private monopoly supplier of infrastructure is not clear but what does seem sufficiently clear is that the lack of action or even contact from SPEN towards necessary upgrades to \"looped\" mains supplieswill prove expensive and frustrating for people who with reasonable expectations started the move to an emissions-free vehicle, sometimes many months ago.It is too long since the last storm for there to be a credible excuse that every engineer was needed for restoring damaged supply infrastructure. There is inevitable curiosity about whether this company, andso others, have had a financial incentive not to carry out timeous upgrades to their outdated domestic supply cables.William Patterson, East Linton.* I WAS interested in Thomas GF Grays experiences with Smart Metering Systems .Ive recently had two smart meters installed by this company. I am also a Shell Energy customer by default and have an In House Display unitwhich I was told would supply me with useful information. Its now been two weeks since the install and the IHD is \"still waiting\".Shell has informed me that the whole data-sharing process could be six weeks, which was contrary to the SMS installer, who said it would take around  hours.The IHD I hoped would alert my fellow household colleagues of the pain they were inflicting on me as the bill payer.Instead I foolishly installed the Shell app on my phone which works perfectly, but only I am aware of the pain. It s great you can watch your le force slowing ebbing away with every shower or cup of tea.From conversation with the SMS engineer I understand the smart meter readings go to a \"hub\" where the ious energy suppliers can access this data. The new IHDs get their data from this hub and this will facilitate the moving of customers between energy companies without having to change any equipment. It does seem to make senseit actually works.Anyway, good to know from Mr Gray that there is £ waiting on me once my patience dissolves.Iain McDermid, Alexandria.LET THERE BE LIGHTMAUREEN Sugden’s article on Daylight Saving Time in the US becoming permanentis very interesting.

That was only admitted by them because we got some correspondence from the PO management a couple of years ago which was leaked to the RMT. We produced those documents to ministers at the time. It’s grotesquely exploitative.Mark Dickinson, general secretary of Nautilus said: \"We need PO to be held to account legally.Theyve broken the law, let them feel the full force of UK law. If I break the law,I do anything to try and organise industrial action, you can be rest assured within minutes Ill never have writ served upon me. Yet it doesnt seem to apply to companies who blatantly break the law.\"And were not just talking about the redundancy issue. Weve got issues around, of course, the unfair dismissal issue.\"Weve got discrimination, with the wage rates that theyre offering to the agency crew that theyre trying to recruit who by the way, are leaving as fast as theyre joining.\"But theyre offering dferent wage rates and dferent roster arrangements to seafarers from Romania, from Latvia and from India and this is blatant discrimination. This is a legal morass that this company has created by their own failed, ridiculous strategy.\"In the UK, when  or more employees are proposed to be made dismissed, a -day consultation has to take place and collective redundancy rules apply and the business secretary has to be notied.PO say that the sacked staff were Jersey-contracted seafarers, which has raised questions over whether the depth of their legal employment rights in the UK.Three years ago, PO said it was shting the  registration of its UK vessels to Cyprus ahead of Britain’s departure from the European Union, in part to keep its tax arrangements in the bloc.PO say they are compensating all  Jersey-contracted staff for lack of notice with enhanced severance packages and it is understood they have a deadline of Thursday to accept or reject them.Mr Dickinson said the staff deserve, salaries and conditions that reflect their commitment, to safety professionalism, and the time it takes them to get qualied.He told Sky News: \"Those legal options are coming while the company has set a deadline of Thursday for many of them to decide whether they want to take redundancy or they want to stay and work on on agency terms. So its going to be a dficult call for them and I dont Im glad Im not in their shoes.\"I wouldnt want to be in their shoes. Its a really dficult call. I dont know why the company is holding a gun to their head in terms of these redundancy terms. They should give them time to think and reflect about it but over the next few days our support for our members is going to have to focus on that very dficult decision and give them a clear pathway in terms of their options, take the redundancy or fight unfair dismissal, seeking protective awards.\"And thats going to have to be on a one to one basis because each member of ours, each officer will be will have a dferent context.\"RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said: \"They [PO] should face the severest sanctions possible.\"We think they are importing Indian workers, Philippinos and Ukrainans at the moment to work on these vessels. That cannot be acceptable. We cannot dismiss our people to bring in other people on a discount rate.\"We were due to have a meeting with the business on Friday, then on Thursday they sacked all our members.\"PO, which has received over £m in UK government contracts and subsidies in two years suspended its services on Thursday before axing the staff.Services between Cairnryan to Larne, Dover to Calais, Dublin to Liverpool and Hull to Rotterdam would be out of action for between seven and  days.PO attributed the move to £ million of losses built up during the pandemic, although its owner, DP World, reported record profits this month of £.bn.An analysis revealed that PO Ferries received £.m in UK government contracts since December .They include a £.m deal in  to provide transport services between the key Scotland to Northern Ireland route – Cairnryan to Larne.The ferry company has also received more than £ million in public subsidies in a year to support jobs and services during the pandemic and there are calls for them to be refunded.Mr Turner said: \"What PO has accepted previously in meetings with me and the RMT, theyve said . an hour .\"That was only admitted by them because we got some correspondence from the PO management a couple of years ago which was leaked to the RMT.\"We produced those documents to ministers at the time.

Some have been known to pitch tents for a fortnight.”The International Transport Workers Federationand European Transport Workers Federationare calling on DP World to engage in meaningful dialogue with affiliates RMT and Nautilus International about PO Ferries future.\"These kinds of brutal shock tactics are reminiscent of the infamous Patrick dispute, that represents nothing more than an outmoded and discredited management style,\" said Paddy Crumlin, president of the ITF and chairman of ITFs Dockers Section.\"DP Worlds callous decision to sack and attack  hard-working seafarers represents a brutal attack on their dignity,\" said Mr Crumlin. \"In doing so, theyre breaching laws and failing to meet their own companys standards.\"PO sources said said wage figures cited were wholly inaccurate but could not clary what they were actually being paid. Protesters gathered outside the London offices of DP World on Monday afternoon, before marching to Parliament.Mr Lynch accused the logistics business of refusing to meet him and his counterparts at unions Nautilus and the TUC, who all attended the demonstration.He said: “This company are quite happy to sack our members by Zoom but they are not prepared to meet us face to face. That speaks volumes about their complete contempt for their staff.“We will continue to use political, industrial and public pressure to secure justice for the PO workforce and we are at Parliament today to step up that campaign.”Labour will force an emergency vote in the Commons on Monday afternoon demanding that the Government takes action to outlaw the so-called fire and rehire of staff, which involves making workers redundant before giving them their jobs back with worse terms and conditions.The party will also call on the Government to suspend contracts with DP World until the matter with PO Ferries is resolved.Labour Leader Sir Keir Starmer said: “What I want to see is those workers reinstated to their jobs, as they should neverbeen dismissed from them.“I want to see the Government take action here to ban this fire and rehire, which is the cause of this in the first place.“There’s a vote on that this afternoon.

requires very close contact with an infected bird so the risk to humans is considered very low.The Food Standards Agency has said that on the basis of the current scientic evidence, avian influenza also poses a very low food safety risk for UK consumers. Properly cooked poultry and poultry products, including eggs, are safe to eat.Transmission from an infected bird to a human is very rare with fewer than five cases recorded in the UK. While previous cases were confirmed as the H strain, January  was the first time H has been detected in a human in the UK.The UKHSA said the risk to the wider public from avian flu continues to be very low but said people should not touch sick or dead birds.Food Standards Scotland advises that avian influenzas pose a very low foodsafety risk for consumers, and it does not affect the consumption of poultry products, including eggs.The main symptoms of bird flu can appear very quickly and include: a very high temperature or feeling hot or shivery, aching muscles, headache, and a cough or shortness of breathOther early symptoms may include: diarrhoea, sickness, stomach pain, chest pain, bleeding from the nose and gums, and conjunctivitisIt usually takes  to  days for the first symptoms to appear after youve been infected.There is no bird flu vaccine, and the seasonal flu vaccine does not protect against bird flu.If its thought you might have symptoms of bird flu youll be advised to stay at home, or youll be cared for in hospital in isolation from other patients.You may be given an antiviral medicine such as Tamlu or Relenza.Antiviral medicines help reduce the severity of the condition, prevent complications and improve the chances of survival.They are also sometimes given to people who have been in close contact with infected birds, or those who have had contact with infected people, for example family or healthcare staff.In March, three outbreaks of avian flu were identied among birds being kept at premises in Aberdeenshire and North Ayrshire prompting restrictions to be put in place for the surrounding area.The highly pathogenic avian influenza HN was found in a backyard flock of mixed poultry near Collieston, Aberdeenshire on March , and more recently at a premises near Strichen, Aberdeenshire on March , and Hessilhead Wildle Rescue Centre near at a premises in Beith, North Ayrshire on March .A

the overall health and productivity of flocks by helping keep out poultry diseases and limiting the spread of disease in an outbreak.Housing measures are now in place across the UK to protect poultry

The day is open to all ages and sexes, so please bring your kids along also.”Previously, Orkney enjoyed success in the North of Scotland Cricket Association.Mr Rae continues: “If we can get back to that level, it’d be a huge bonus. At this stage it’s just baby steps, andthe interest is enough, we’d like to resurrect the indoor winter league, which hasn’t been played since  .“If there is enough interest over in Caithness, we’d like to get the inter-county going too. The tours we used to do in August were also very popular, playing a game at Balmoral Castle in Aberdeenshire while the royal family was in residence.”Communication through their Facebook page has been encouraging, boosting Mr Rae and others that there is renewed interest in raising the profile of the sport once more.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

After Easter — from April  — we will stop recommending that people who don’t have symptoms, should test for COVID.“This change will apply across the population — including in most workplaces and in early years centres, schools, universities and colleges.“Then, at the end of April, routine testing will end — even for people who have symptoms.“At that time, physical test sites will close — although some mobile testing units and capacity will be retained for possible future use. Contact tracing will also end.“Free testing will not generally be available to the wider population. Instead, our advice will be thatyou have symptoms of COVID — or indeed symptoms of the flu, or any other infectious illness — you should stay at home in order to aid your recovery.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The comments were made as the UFU launched its annual schools’ competition. Open to all playgroups, nursery, primary, and special schools, this year’s theme relates to the UFU’s food and farming education resource “Dig in!”, which encourages pupils to learn more about food, farming, and the countryside. UFU deputy president, David Brown said, “This year’s schools competition theme ‘Dig in! to food, farming and the environment’ provides an opportunity for teachers to start the discussion in the classroom about the importance of food and farming in NI, allowing pupils to learn more about how farmers work hard to produce the delicious, high-quality produce on our tables, and their contribution to shaping our landscape in NI, which everyone enjoys. “Climate change has been the front runner in NI this year and our farmers play an essential role in combating the global issue, as they are a key part of the solution. The schools competition helps pupils to enhance their understanding of how farmers create dferent environments in NI which support our economy, rural communities, tourism and recreation.” Mr Brown says every year the competition judges are impressed by the number, standard and creativity of entries for the schools’ competition. “We would encourage all nursery, playgroups, primary and special schools to participate in what is a very worthwhile competition. It’s a great opportunity to express their creativity while learning about one of the most important sectors in NI as they will discover the importance of local food production,” he said. The UFU is pleased to have competition sponsor Asda on board for another year with a range of prizes available for the lucky winners. Joe McDonald, Asda NI corporate affairs manager said, “Asda is a proud sponsor of the school’s competition. It is great to see competition entries grow year upon year, especially with the introduction of a dferentiating foundation category last year - the standard is superb. It is vital to create an awareness of where our produce comes from, and this competition is a great opportunity to do so - educating children on the ‘farm to fork’ story.” Now in its eleventh year, BOIOFW is the perfect partner for the schools’ competition. As part of the prize, the winner of each category receives free transport for their class to the nearest participating BOIOFW farm, and all competition entries will be on display throughout the weekend. Mr Brown says schools don’t need to be competition winners in order to visit real, working farms. “This free event showcases NI’s world-class ‘farm to fork’ journey and reconnects consumers with our farmers, the primary food producers.The weekend underlines the importance of supporting local producers to benefit the rural community and wider economy in NI. BOIOFW is taking place on Saturday  and Sunday  June, and I would certainly encourage all schools to consider organising a trip to a local participating farm on the schools’ day, Friday  June,” said the UFU deputy president. Entry forms have been sent electronically to all playgroups, nursery, primary and special schools. Schools’ competition templates are available by visitingwww.ufuni.org.The closing date for entries is Friday  April .

Throughout the club’s development over the last five years, we have placed a great emphasis on working for the betterment of our community.”The spokesman said that, in the past week, Larne FC has launched its post-Covid community engagement plans, which include mini soccer, after schools football, coffee club, over s exercise and wellbeing, and MEN United five-a-side. Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Read More‘Stock will be arriving in coming days’...

It is therefore not surprising that local fuel poverty charities now suggest four in  households are in fuel poverty.“This means those who were already in vulnerable situations are struggling even more and a new group of householders, who may have not had to worry about the price of energy before, will now be concerned about paying their bills.”Although the Consumer Council said it welcomes the £ support payments provided by the Department for Communities, the organisation called for further support in the Chancellors’ Spring Statement on Wednesday.Meanwhile, financial expert Martin Lewis said the time had come for government intervention.“I am out of tools to help people now,” he told BBC’s Sunday Morning programme.“I’ve been the Money Saving Expert since … I’ve been through the financial crash, I’ve been through Covid.

Credit: Gareth FullerJohn BreslinMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailFreight operators and passengers were scrambling on Thursday night to switch plans following the sudden mass sacking of  PO Ferries employees, including dozens of skilled crew operating the Larne-Cairnryan route.The company announced the action via a video message, then sent private security staff — some wearing body armour and balaclavas, and carrying stun guns and handcuffs — to remove staff from the European Causeway docked in Larne.Sailings on the route are now suspended for at least five days and possibly a week, prompting concern over a serious disruption to the supply chain.Around  lorries use the route daily, many of them carrying perishable goods on what is the shortest Irish Sea crossing.Captains, engineers, electricians and other skilled deck and engine staff were sacked on Thursday, including around  operating the ferries between Scotland and here.They were immediately replaced by cheaper agency staff, unions said. Other workers, mostly hospitality and already employed through agencies, remained on board.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Read MoreThey have treated us all like c**p, says -year PO veteranMargaret Canning:OpinionPO Ferries: Operator of busy link with Scotland recorded £.m profit in , but other factors at play hereWhile PO was silent on Thursday night on why the services are suspended, it is believed the new crew needs to be trained up and may require the green light from maritime regulators to sail.Fears were growing among the approximately  to  Port of Larne ground staff employed directly by PO.East Antrim MLA John Stewart said they had heard nothing from the company as events unfolded quickly on Thursday, adding that the crew members were “treated despicably”.PO, owned by Dubai-headquartered conglomerate DP World since , said it had to take the action because the company was not “viable” after posting losses of £m in the last financial year.The sackings came two years after , staff were made redundant at the same time investors were paid a £m idend, which the company said it was legally obliged to disburse.“Our survival is dependent on making swt and signicant changes now. Without these changes there is no future for PO Ferries,” the company said.“These circumstances have resulted in a very dficult but necessary decision, which was only taken after seriously considering all the available options.”Unions representing the seafarers told members to stay on board, but those stepping off the ship said they had little choice but to leave after being confronted by the security staff and warned they were trespassing, and that the redundancy package would be withdrawnthey did not do so.Local politicians reacted with shock at the developments. It also caught industry insiders completely by surprise.East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson, who spoke with chief executive Peter Hebblethwaite, said he was assured the jobs of ground staff at Larne were secure, but added he was “appalled” at the treatment of the seafarers.“The way in which staff were removed from the ships is totally unacceptable and is not how any employer should treat their employees,” Mr Wilson said.“Despite operating purely between UK ports, PO will now be paying Third World wages to their crew.“This raises serious concerns about the company’s morality.”Immediate clarication is needed over the future of Larne Harbour, East Antrim Alliance MLA Stewart Dickson said.“Given PO owns Larne Harbour, urgent questions now need asked as to the potentially vast impact locally,” Mr Dickson said.Passengers, hauliers and cargo are being redirected to Stena Line ferries, with the company saying it is trying to accommodate but is extremely busy. It confirmed it was trying to accommodate those booked on the PO ferries between Scotland and Northern Ireland.“Most freight companies have accounts with all ferry operators and they are doing what they normally do during periods of disruptions and move via alternative routes operators where space is available,” Stena Line said.Logistics UK, the trade body for freight transport, warned there will be disruption but that those in the business of moving goods were flexible and used to quickly switching methods, either using other ferries or,needs be, air transport.But Seamus Leheny of the organisation said: “This has just come out of the blue... really shocked the industry.”Rail, Maritime and Transportunion general secretary Mick Lynch said: “We are seeking urgent legal action and are again calling for the Government to take action to stop what is fast turning into one of the most shameful acts in the history of British industrial relations.”Tom Long of law firm Shakespeare Martineau said: “PO’s decision to fire  staff with immediate effect appears to contravene the requirements needed for a normal mass redundancy.”Related topicsJohn StewartAlliance PartyStewart DicksonMore On John StewartJohn Traynor, Ballycastle man who died in Carrickfergus work accident, ‘a very, very popular inidual’Birth Mothers, which represents mother and baby homes victims, urges Stormont to act on ’s recommendations PremiumSuzanne BreenOpinionProtocol meeting: Stormont ide is clear in discussions with EC vice presidentDoug Beattie includes Mike Nesbitt and John Stewart in UUP spokespeople changesDoug Beattie includes Robbie Butler and Andy Allen in UUP leadership team Most ReadPaul McKenna: Grieving widow tells of her last moments with DJ husband‘Stock will be arriving in coming days’...

The Government has to step in now and take control before it’s too late.”The minimum wage in the UK for people aged  and above is £. per hour.But companies using UK ports often register ships in other countries, allowing them to pay lower wages.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up For example, some vessels operated by PO Ferries are flagged in Cyprus.PO Ferries refused to comment on the pay of agency workers.When the firm informed staff on Thursday they were losing their jobs, it told them it was aiming to halve crewing costs.No sailings have operated since that date.The company posted on Twitter on Monday morning that services will remain suspended “for the next few days”.Protesters gathered outside the London offices of PO Ferries owner DP World on Monday afternoon, before marching to Parliament.Mr Lynch accused the logistics business of refusing to meet him and his counterparts at unions Nautilus and the TUC, who all attended the demonstration.He said: “This company are quite happy to sack our members by Zoom but they are not prepared to meet us face to face. That speaks volumes about their complete contempt for their staff.“We will continue to use political, industrial and public pressure to secure justice for the PO workforce and we are at Parliament today to step up that campaign.”Labour will force an emergency vote in the Commons on Monday afternoon demanding that the Government takes action to outlaw the so-called fire and rehire of staff, which involves making workers redundant before giving them their jobs back with worse terms and conditions.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_bcf-b-e-bde-adbca_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_bcf-b-e-bde-adbca_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_bcf-b-e-bde-adbca_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_bcf-b-e-bde-adbca_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Protests were held at ports after the staff were sacked PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueProtests were held at ports after the staff were sacked The party will also call on the Government to suspend contracts with DP World until the matter with PO Ferries is resolved.Labour Leader Sir Keir Starmer said: “What I want to see is those workers reinstated to their jobs, as they should neverbeen dismissed from them.“I want to see the Government take action here to ban this fire and rehire, which is the cause of this in the first place.“There’s a vote on that this afternoon. So, what I don’t want to hear is ministers, Government ministers, complaining about what PO have done.“Now they’ve got the chance to do something about it, vote this afternoon for reinstatement and banning fire and rehire.”Safety is paramount in our new crewing management modelPO Ferries spokesmanPO Ferries hit back at claims by unions that its decision to replace staff with agency workers puts the safety of ships at risk.A spokesman for the company said: “Safety is the utmost priority for PO Ferries and our crewing management partners.“They have recruited high-quality experienced seafarers, who will now familiarise themselves with the ships, going through all mandatory training requirements set out by our regulators.“Safety is paramount in our new crewing management model, which is used by many of our competitors and has been proven to be the most successful model in this industry and the competitive baseline.“We will not be reducing crewing numbers.

But that could be about to change.Last year, the estimated repair bill for the clock, whose interior mechanism was removed over three decades ago and placed in storage, was in the region of pound,.Many are concerned to see the historic landmark falling into continued disrepair, but hopeful that it can be restored to be enjoyed for generations to come, reinforcing its connection with the villagersquos industrial past.Shrigley was founded by the Martin family, who came from Pott Shrigley in Cheshire in  and who owned the spinning factory in the village.The factory was powered by water supplied from the nearby Clea Lough and while the mill mdash which is reported to have employed  people at one time mdash has long gone, the clock tower erected by the people of Shrigley in  in honour of the Martin family remains.Now there is fresh hope that it can be restored to its former glory.Strangford MLAs Michelle McIlveen and Harry Harvey, who have been campaigning for the clockrsquos restoration, are also hopeful that progress can be made.Welcoming the recent developments, they hope plans to acquire the clock and restore it to its former glory will prove successful.The MLAs said Housing Executive chief executive Grainia Long made it clear last year that the huge cost of repairing the historic clock was something the organisation was not willing to meet at the time.The housing chief said at a time when it was experiencing a signicant funding shortfall for investment in tenantsrsquo homes, it was not be appropriate to use income derived from rents to fund the considerable costs that would be required to undertake a full restoration of the Shrigley clock.Ms McIlveen and Mr Harvey then raised the issue with Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey, who has overall responsibility for the Historical Environment Division.They detailed the clockrsquos history and its local signicance, explaining that it is one of the last remaining pieces of Victorian architecture in Shrigley.The MLAs said it was ldquounacceptable that an old clock of such important signicance and splendour should be allowed to fall into such a sad state of disrepair.ldquoWe urged the communities minister to take the necessary steps to prevent this important listed monument from further deterioration and urged her to consider a partnership approach with ious interested bodies, explained Ms McIlveen.ldquoI am pleased that the Housing Executive is now in discussions with an interested local party regarding a proposed feasibility study to consider options and prepare design concepts for the area that would involve the acquisition and restoration of the historic monument.Ms McIlveen said discussions are ongoing and that she and Mr Harvey have made clear to the government

controversial decision to restructure the districtrsquos museum services is to be reviewed.Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos decision to appoint a joint curator to oversee museum services in Downpatrick and Newry mdash which was taken without consulting local councillors mdash is to be reviewed by the local authorityrsquos Audit Committee.The newly appointed curator will be based in Newry, a move which has angered a number of councillors and highly respected organisations, including the Friends of the Down County Museum.Council officials have been accused of downgrading the status of the Downpatrick museum with stinging criticism continuing of the decision to have one curator in charge of the local authorityrsquos two museums.Council officials insist they are ldquofully committed to the continuous improvement and development of both museums and that updated staffing structures for both ldquoprovides an unparalleled opportunity to build in this work.The restructuring process has been referred to the Audit Committee by Downpatrick councillor Gareth Sharvin, who is disappointed that despite signicant opposition to the move, the new joint curator is already in post.He wants the process which led to the councilrsquos decision to be reviewed, with the referral coming on the back of an update on the new staffing structure recently provided in secret to members of the local authorityrsquos Strategy, Policy and Resources Committee.Cllr Sharvin said while the press and public were prevented from hearing the update, he understands that the new curator will be based in Newry and shared across both museum sites.He continued: ldquoThe new staff structure is seen as an activity under the so-called scheme of delegation that enables the councilrsquos senior management team to conduct the change without the need to consult or inform any stakeholders in the process.ldquoThe new staff structure is currently being implemented and cannot be subject to change, as the roles have been offered out. We are told this is an operational matter that councillors are not involved in.Cllr Sharvin says he is disappointed to have to confirm that the new staff structure will be implemented at Down County Museum, which means it will have no permanent curator in the building.ldquoGiven the lack of information around the new roles and how the existing complement of skills are being integrated into the new museum structure, it can only raise concern as no one outside the senior management team have the information and understanding of how the fantastic services provided in Downpatrick will continue to be offered and delivered, he continued.ldquoThe campaign by the Friends of the Museum and the many groups associated with the Down County Museum was very much focused on the skills needed to run the museum and offer the excellent experience many hundreds of thousands of people have enjoyed over the years.Cllr Sharvin insists that a strategic review should have been undertaken first to understand the vision for the museum services in the district, design a plan around that vision and identy the staffing structure needed to support it.ldquoWhat has happened in this case, is that the staff structure is being implemented and a strategic review being held afterwards. The strategic review could easily identy that a dferent staffing structure is needed as opposed to the one being implemented now, he continued.ldquoI want to see the Down County Museum grow in size, reputation and service offerings. When you research the top  museums in Northern Ireland on Which Museum, the Downpatrick museum is placed th compared to Newry which is st.ldquoSimilarly on TripAdvisor, the Downpatrick museum is listed th, with Newry in th place. This shows a clear dference in status for each museum and where the councilrsquos main museum asset is.Councillor Sharvin explained he has referred the museum process and procedure to the councilrsquos Audit Committee for a number of reasons, even though he accepts the review will have no signicance in relation to the staffing structure as that will continue.However, he said the move will ensure that ldquolessons are learnt for any future changes and the Downpatrick museum is protected and respected.Cllr Sharvin explained the role of the audit committee is to review internal procedures and that is what he has asked to be examined.ldquoThere is no clear one approach when it comes to restructuring in council and the review of the procedures undertaken in this case will help the organisation identy were gaps are, what risks have been identied and the improvements that need to be implemented, he said.Cllr Sharvin said he has asked for a timeline of the start and completion of the strategic review being implemented and how key stakeholders such as the Friends of the Museum will be consulted as part of the process.He added: ldquoThe strategic review is now the focus of the campaign to ensure that the Down County Museum is not downgraded in any way. I will be approaching the strategic review with the sense of growth in visitor numbers, educational outreach, advertising campaigns, collection and exhibition offerings and the wider service offerings..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Dawn launches debut novel  ","story":"THE debut novel by a local childrenrsquos writer is already one of the top selling books in its age category on Amazon.Felicity Flipflops is the work of Dawn Gelston, a teacher living in Dubai but who has strong links with Drumaness and Teconnaught.She is the daughter of Paul and Maura Gelston and sister to Shona, Aisling, Janine and Paul.Aimed at children aged  to  years old, the book tells the story of mental well-being, adventure, and friendship by a young girl named Felicity.Dawn explained: ldquoAs teachers, we encourage children to believe in themselves and to work hard and dream big.

","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has been urged to do all it can to quickly deliver Newcastlersquos new multi-million pound leisure complex.The appeal was issued by the local authorityrsquos chairwoman, Cathy Mason, following a recent meeting she had with senior council directors who provided her with a progress report.A detailed report on building the eagerly-awaited pound leisure centre is expected to be completed shortly, with senior council officials working with consultants to develop an outline business case which is designed to pave the way for construction work to start.The rear of the existing Newcastle Centre and the outdoor Tropicana swimming pool are to be bulldozed to make way for the new town centre leisure complex which will feature an indoor leisure pool which includes three  metre swimming lanes and a dedicated heated play pool for children.The new leisure facility will also feature an ultra-modern gymnasium and once demolition work has been completed, the new complex will be bolted on to the side of the existing centre.Redeveloping the existing Newcastle Centre has been ruled out due to the scale of the costs involved and itrsquos understood that the planned new-build will be larger than the current centre which is a listed building, posing major problems for the council in transforming it into an energy efficient facility which meets current building regulations and standards.Cllr Mason described confirmation of plans for new leisure facilities in Newcastle as ldquowelcome news and is delighted that the development plans are in the final stages of development.ldquoThese new local amenities will be of great benefit to local residents, their families and tourists alike, she said, confirming that the proposes new complex will feature a new leisure pool and state of the art gym facilities.ldquoFor too long, people of Newcastle have had to put up with these substandard facilities, the chairwoman continued. ldquoThe plans highlighted safety concerns with the old part of the building which is to be demolished as it simply isnrsquot fit for purpose.Cllr Mason said she hopes to see the finalised plans and formal site approval in the coming months so that contractors can start working on the project as soon as possible.ldquoIt is essential that the council moves in a timely manner to ensure this project comes to fruition so that Newcastle residents can access these new facilities as soon as possible, said the chairwoman.ldquoSinn Feacutein will continue to do all it can to ensure these much-needed leisure facilities are delivered and I will continue to stand up for rural families across South Down to deliver these essential services right in the heart of communities.Last week, formal planning approval to bulldoze the rear extension of the existing Newcastle Centre and the adjoining Tropicana swimming pool was agreed by the local authorityrsquos Planning Committee.Detailed work has already been carried out at the town centre site, including geotechnical surveys which examined ground conditions to provide architects and designers with key information ahead of construction work getting underway.While no detailed timescales are in place, politicians hope that major progress to deliver the project can now be made, with planning permission and all other associated approvals secured in a timely fashion..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Fin tasic with formation of new angling club  ","story":"A NEW course angling club has been formed in Downpatrick.Known as Quoile Angling Club, the organisation is holding its inaugural meeting this Friday night at Murphyrsquos Bar in the town at pm, with an open invitation extended to anyone who would like to attend.The club was formed in response to the growing interest in course angling at the river and with coronavirus restrictions largely gone, anglers have joined forces to form the new club and aim to encourage greater involvement in angling, particularly for coarse fish in the lower reaches of the River Quoile.The picturesque river is home to rudd, roach, hybrids, bream, pike, and eels.The new club is hoping to run a few competitions and, in the future, provide coaching courses for young anglers.A key concern for the new club is addressing the current state of the fishery which runs from the below the Belfast Road bridge to the Steamboat quay.The aim is to engage with a raft of statutory agencies to raise the profile of the river and its angling potential, alongside improved access for anglers and visitors.While there has been signicant investment over recent years and additional upgrades in the pipeline, the anglers will hope this paves the way for greater emphasis on the Quoile area as a recreational and tourism asset.Anglers say the Quoile basin is a designated nature reserve and, as such, there are ious regulations which govern its usage, with those who fish along its banks keen to maintain the waterwayrsquos biological ersity and general appearance, ensuring it is an asset everyone can enjoy.At the clubrsquos inaugural meeting this Friday evening, members will adopt a constitution and select a new management committee.

The funding provided by the Department means it will be assisting Downpatrick in a very substantive way over the next few years.ldquoThe planning has been completed. The next stage is to get things done.

He was inch-perfect through the morningrsquos slippery conditions, quickly building up a sizeable advantage and catching his rivals on the hop.This continued his fine form after the local driver also won the opening stages.In the space of two stages, he had amassed a lead of more than  seconds ndash a huge margin on the single venue event.From there, he managed his lead and with the sun shining, Greer powered home in his Citroen C to eventually win by . seconds and claim another maximum points haul in his bid for this yearrsquos championship spoils.ldquoIt was a brilliant day, said Greer.ldquoThe car was faultless and was really well suited to the event. We kept it clean and everything went to plan.In the battle for second overall, Derek McGarrity and Graham Henderson held an early second in their Skoda until a stage two overshoot cost them around ten seconds.Aaron McLaughlin and Darren Curran also hit trouble with a puncture and a broken rim, while Darren Gass and Sam Hutchinson were already out of contention after they spun and stalled on stage one.That left McGarrity and McLaughlin battling for the runner-up spot. McLaughlin quickly recovered from his puncture and moved into second after stage three. McGarrity tried hard to fight back but in the drying conditions, McLaughlin had the edge in his Fiesta WRC.He was really enjoying himself and an attempt to secure the fastest time on the final stage saw him come to within one-tenth of a second of rally winner Greer.ldquoHersquos a machine, said McLaughlin.ldquoI was really hoping for a fastest stage time. I just wish we had started the day as good as we finished it.Derek McGarrity and Graham Henderson had to be content with third overall in their Skoda. Their stage two overshoot potentially cost them a position but they still secured an armful of points for their McGrady Insurance NI Championship campaign.ldquoIt was a silly mistake on the second stage, said McGarrity.ldquoThen we had a small misfire on the last stage but it is what it is.Joe McGonigle and Ciaran Geaney clipped a bale and damaged the front wing of their Fiesta on stage two but they survived to tell the tale.Seventh after the test, they climbed back up the order to secure fourth overall ahead of Joe and Ashleen Hegarty, who were lucky to escape a high-speed spin on stage four.ldquoWe were using new tyres and the car broke away from me at high speed, explained Hegarty.ldquoWe went over a few trackside tyres and ended up on the grass.Darren Gass and Sam Hutchinson would have been in the mix too but they took a wrong route on stage five and were handed a stage maximum. Instead, Michael McGarrity and Damien Garvey were overjoyed to claim sixth overall in their Fiesta.They lost time when a boost pipe came adrt and also struggled with some brakingissues during the closing miles but were full of smiles at the finish.Also in a Fiesta, David Kelly and Dean OrsquoSullivan finished seventh ahead of Mark Massey and Alistair Wyllie.Massey was lucky to escape with some superficial bodywork damage after a stage five altercation with some trackside stage furniture so a top eight finish was a good result for the crew.Emma McKinstry and Kenny Hull lost time with some intercom issues but finished ninth while Robert Erwin and Andrew Wilson completed the top ten and secured the two-wheel-drive honours in the process.In the two-wheel-drive category, a titanic battle developed between a number of crews. James and Heather Kennedy were quickest out of the blocks, closely followed by Andrew White and Paul Hughes.Then White lost ground with an overshoot, leaving Kennedy to fend off a challenge from Robert Erwin and Andrew Wilson.As the track conditions improved, Erwin started to pile the pressure on the Kennedys who were suffering with a down-on-power engine.The chasing Toyota MR crew moved in front after the fth test and another strong run over the final stage sealed the category win as well as tenth overall.James and Heather Kennedy had to settle for second on this occasion as well as th overall, with Matthew McGaffin and Ryan Lowry coming home third in class.The McGrady Insurance NI Rally Championship now has a two-month break before the Maiden City Stages on May .In the interim period, a rally social night is being held at the Millbrook Lodge Hotel on Friday, March .

In  it was decided to move both date and venue to have the best chance of fitting in with Covid- restrictions.While the event at Bishopscourt Racing Circuit last June was well received, many were glad to see the race brought back to its origins as a road race taking in the iconic sites of East Downrsquos home town.Months of planning go into a race and this year was no exception. The EDAC race committee had an A and B routes on file in case of flooding on the Quoile towpath.They had worked with and through Covid- restrictions, secured road licences and Athletics NI permits, and employed professionals for timing, first aid and traffic management among others.The club rallied members and friends of the club to marshal the roads, man the water station and prepare the post race food tables.The race committee were out at am on Sunday to finalise the cones and signage when news broke that a fallen tree had brought down a power line directly impacting the planned route.East Down AC volunteers were straight into action. They were at the scene in minutes and had even a tree surgeon on speed dial, but they could not gain access.They were determined not to cancel and set about re-routing the race. This is not as simple as it may seem. With a traffic management plan to take into account and new sections to measure as well as the clock ticking, there was a lot of pressure.The wind and rain didnrsquot help and mindful of the wellbeing of runners, a delayed start was not even considered.With some sharp thinking and speedy manoeuvres a new route was hurriedly drawn up.Having advised the athletes that it was no longer a measured K, the start team herded them on to the start line in Ballydugan Estate and the hooter went only a minute or two behind schedule.With a huge sigh of relief Mags Mathieson, the official starter, waved the  strong crowd on their way. Thankfully everything  went to plan and post race comments have been nothing but positive from those who took part.There was high praise for the volunteers along the route, who cheered, clapped and gave out water. It was not the race that East Down AC had planned but with  fresh in our memories, most were simply glad that they got the chance to run.With all that had gone on pre-race there was barely time to consider who the winner might be, but there was a wave of excitement when Neil McCartan of East Down appeared in the home straight and crossed the line  seconds ahead of Owen Carleton of Annadale Striders.This was a bucket list moment for Neil as he is a longtime club member and he ran well to achieve it.It tops off a great season so far and leaves him primed for the track season which is his first love. When Aaron McGrady, also EDAC, was third, the stress of the morning was washed away in the joy of having two members on the podium.Mal McGrady of M.B. McGrady and Co Chartered Accountants presented Neil with the Jimmy Murray Memorial Shield at the finish line and the top three received cash prizes.The ladiesrsquo race was almost pre-determined when Emma Mitchell ndash the current , metre track championndash decided to throw her hat in the ring.However, given that she has been targeting half marathon timesand that the pandemic has played havoc with both racing and training, it is hard to gauge where iniduals are form wise.In the end she had a clear win finishing in . with Sinead Murtagh of Newcastle and District AC taking second place in ..Eimear McCracken of City of Lisburn came third in . to complete the podium.Emma was presented with the Joe Quinn Perpetual Trophy for first female and she took the time to say that she was delighted to support the magnicent Jimmyrsquos Ten and that the hospitality from the host club was first class.From an athlete who has raced at top level all over the world, it was praise indeed.Two shields are presented for club teams in the K and this year Newcastle and District took the honours in the menrsquos race and East Down AC retained the ladiesrsquo title.It is based on the top four men and the top three women home. There is also a relay event where two people split the K with one runner starting on the line and then passing over a wristband at the changeover point.Their team-mate then heads home to record a joint time. Ollie Robinson and Jacob Crawfordwere the quickest all male team.Holly Scott and Willow Farrington of Scrabo took the all female prize and the mixed title went to mother and son duo Maureen Kelly and James Wright .With the podiums decided the spectators turned their attention to looking for friends and family.The race is a highlight for local runners, many of whom do not belong to a club. This does not mean that they are not well able and plenty of fast times were recorded as the runners flooded in.Some were running to test their pace, some to seethey could run the distance with no speed in mind, others were raising funds or dedicating their run to causes.In short, there were all sorts of reasons and all sorts of runners but they were united in their efforts and the thrill of crossing a line to cheers.The fact that they were then brought to tables laden with food was a big surprise as for so long hospitality has been withdrawn, but with restrictions eased and a bit of careful planning the hosts were able to entertain their guests outside.Even the weather played ball by that stage as the rain had stopped and there were shreds of sunlight to lt the atmosphere.Jimmyrsquos Ten is always a memorable event but the  event will definitely be lodged in peoplersquos minds as the race that went ahead against all odds.EDAC would like to pay tribute to their full list of sponsors McMahon People Solutions, PCG Fitness, MC Dental Laboratories, Duffyrsquos Killough, JS Flooring, Murdock Brothers , P. Gardiner Carpets, Bells Supervalu Crossgar, McDonalds Downpatrick, Gordons Chemists, Plusprint, Wrap and Roll, McVeigh Traffic Management, Soaring Productions and main sponsor M.B. McGrady and Co Chartered Accountants. The financial backing is what makes this race an event.Thanks are also due to the members and even more so to those who are simply friends of the club, who give up their time to make the race happen. The hard graft that they put in cannot be underestimated.Finally, last but not least, there is heartfelt gratitude towards every single runner who signed up.Without runners there is no race. The smiles of the finishers and the kind words of support post race make all the hard work worthwhile. Well done and see you all next year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Kilmore overrun Grove in league  ","story":"KILMORE Rec kept their promotion hopes on track with an impressive one-sided victory over a physical Grove United outfit at Robert Adams Park on Saturday.An early penalty kick converted by Anton McGrattan and two further second half goals from Eoin McGrattan and Joe McKinney was enough to see The Blues home and dry in bitterly cold yet sunny conditions.The Blues came firing out of the traps from the first whistle with Kilmore striker Joe McKinney the first to try his luck within the opening minutes, although his effort trickled harmlessly into the gloves of Grove number one Michael Davidson.However, it wouldnrsquot be long until the home side opened their account and after six minutes they were awarded the opportunity to do just that.Following a long ball over the top, Kilmore midfielder Eoin McGrattan spun his marker before he was clumsily clattered from behind inside the danger area.The referee had no hesitation in awarding the penalty kick, which Anton McGrattan dispatched confidently by drilling his effort low and hard to the bottom left corner beyond the reach of Davidson.The Bluesrsquo good start continued as they relentlessly pressed the opposition and didnrsquot allow Grove out of their own half.McKinney danced his way past three opposing defenders before his opportunity at goal was thwarted by a wonderfully timed last ditch tackle from Grove defender David McCallen.This wouldnrsquot deter the ever-dangerous Kilmore marksman, who continued to be a thorn in the side of his United counterparts when he battled to win back the ball before laying off team-mate Patrick Grant for a shot at goal.Grantrsquos effort did swing wide of the post but it was an encouraging sign for the Kilmore team, who clearly had their tails up.Man of the match, Barry Walsh, was enjoying the freedom of the middle of the park, as the Kilmore newcomer flung himself into every tackle necessary in order to gain possession for The Blues.Grove were very much stuck in first gear and were being overran in essentially every area of the park. Kilmore were dealt a blow when Grant came off second best in a crunching tackle with Grove defender Adam McKnight, leading to The Bluesrsquo defender to be substituted on  minutes.However, the silver lining for the hosts came in the form of substitute Joshua Smyth, who made an immediate impact when he entered the fray.Smyth quickly gained possession and whipped in a fast-paced cross to the head of incoming team-mate John McCarthy, whose effort was stunningly saved from point blank range by the reaction of Davidson in the Grove goals.This garnered applause from the sizeable home crowd, who had turned out to support their local side.With half an hour played, Kilmore looked to inflict further damage and almost did so following an eye-catching move which was unfortunate not to double the deficit.Smyth was yet again involved as he played a delicate one-two with the back heel of McKinney before his pass inside to the chest of Eoin McGrattan allowed the midfielder to find team-mate Michael Carvill unmarked at the edge of the box.Carvill unleashed an effort towards goal but it was smartly stopped yet again by Grove custodian Davidson, who was quickly becoming his sidersquos top performer.Any hint of a counterattack from the visitors was quickly dealt with by the confident backline of Christopher Magee, Gary Kennedy and captain Jack Larkin, with Magee in particular winning his inidual battle with Grove striker Jake Long time after time.With less than ten minutes to the interval, Carvill played a short free-kick to McCarthy, who swtly passed to Kennedy  yards from goal.After examining his options, the Kilmore defender decided to take a touch forward before firing a long ranged effort with conviction which ultimately crashed onto the post before falling to the feet of skipper Larkin.The Kilmore captain turned his rebound over the bar although his blushes were saved by the offside flag.Despite Grove proving they were a physically strong side ndash as they never shied away from a tackle ndash they failed to garner any substantial chance throughout the opening  minutes.The half ended with Grove midfielder David Johnston picking up a yellow card for a late challenge on Anton McGrattan.The first real opportunity of the second half fell to Kilmorersquos Walsh, who after a pinball of passes, saw his effort from the edge of the box saved.However, just two minutes later and The Blues would double their scoring tally after marksman McKinney latched on to a long ball before squaring his pass to team-mate Eoin McGrattan for an easy tap in.To their credit, Grove were certainly showing more of a presence in the opposing final third, although they were lacking the end product required to trouble the hosts.Kilmore continued to cause problems and goal-scorer Eoin McGrattan almost added another when he once again showed his marker a clean pair of heels and barrelled down on goal.This time his effort struck the side netting as Grove momentarily escaped conceding a third.The home side refused to settle for just two goals and were almost granted a third when McKinneyrsquos whizzing pass across the box marginally escaped the boot of the onrushing McCarthy.Grove managed to manufacture a seldom chance when captain Michael McNerlin struck a first time volley from  yards which required Kilmore lsquokeeper Christopher Turley to spring into action and tip the ball over the crossbar.However, this seemed to ignite the Kilmore flame further and with  minutes to go they registered their third, courtesy of a surging Walsh run which ended in a pass to McKinney inside the box.The Kilmore striker kept his cool and confidently placed his right footed effort into the net to drown out any chance of a dramatic comeback.Eoin McGrattan made way for substitute John Patterson, who almost added to the scoreline when once again McKinney was allowed to play a pass across goal.However, the substitute fluffed his lines and sent his effort over the bar in what was an escape for the now weathered looking Grove outfit.The visitors were gted a consolation goal in the th minute, after substitute David Long was adjudged to be fouled in the area by Kilmore captain Larkin.Grove midfielder Johnston confidently tucked his effort into the top right corner but seconds later the final whistle sounded.Following the match Kilmore goal-scorer, Anton McGrattan, gave his thoughts on his sidersquos performance.ldquoI thought we controlled the game, he said.ldquoWe could have gotten two or three goals before half-time but we didnrsquot panic.ldquoWe will just take it one game at a time now, we had a setback against Dromara Village a couple of weeks ago but we have now won two on the bounce.He added: ldquoThere is a massive week ahead, we travel to Rosario for a big three points.Kilmore Rec: C Turley, C Magee, P Grant, J Larkin , G Kennedy, B Walsh, J McCarthy, A McGrattan, J McKinney, M Carvill, E McGrattan.Subs: J Patterson, J Smyth, C

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe independent report, published by campaign group Keep Wales Tidy, is described as the first report of its kind since the start of the COVID- pandemic.  It recorded , littered face masks during the period and it said PPE litter, which was included in street cleanliness surveys for the first time, was present in eight per cent of streets. The ‘How Clean Are Our Streets’ report brings together results from thousands of street cleanliness surveys and is intended to give a ‘snapshot’ of litter and other environmental quality issues.  It only covers streets and doesn’t include parks and green spaces. The report found litter related to smoking is the most common type, found on . per cent of streets. While the report outlines the continued challenge of litter, and its prevalence across the nation, it also reported that recorded dog fouling is at its lowest level since street cleanliness surveys began in - and was present on just eight per cent of streets. Litter from confectionery, including sweet wrappers and crisp packets, was found on nearly half of streets and drinks litter remained at pre-pandemic levels and was found on  per cent of streets. Keep Wales Tidy has highlighted the results as supporting its calls for the implementation of Extended Producer Responsibilityin the UK which would place new duties on packaging producers to pay for the treatment or disposal of their goods. The charity, and other environmental groups, believe that would encourage producers to reduce waste and promote more sustainable product design as, it says, is in the case in many European countries. Keep Wales Tidy chief executive Lesley Jones said a public consultation has demonstrated support for such a scheme:  “The prevalence of littered packaging across Wales further strengthens the case for EPR. The responsibility for tackling litter does not rest solely with local authorities and the financial burden on the public purse must be reduced.” .removeWelsh Government deputy climate change minister Lee Water said it agrees with the principles of extended producer responsibility and will make an announcement in “due course”. The street surveys cover a six per cent sample of streets, selected at random, from full lists of adopted highways provided by each local authority.This article originally appeared on our sister site The National. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityResearchers found the wild animals have distinct vocal personalities that are created depending on the social groups in which they live and communicate, instead of a fixed range of sounds as traditionally presumed.The findings contribute towards the understanding of the origins and evolution of language, experts suggest.They indicate thatcommunication is socially shaped, then this was also likely the case with the direct extinct ape-like ancestors of humans.Dr Adriano Lameira, lead author and assistant professor at the University of Warwick’s Department of Psychology, said: “Great apes, both in the wild and captivity, are finally helping us to resolve one of the longest-standing puzzles in science – the origin and evolution of language.“We can now start conceiving of a gradual path that likely led to the rise of the talking ape, us, instead of having to attribute our unique verbal skills and advanced cognition to ine intervention or random genetic jackpot.“Many more clues await us in the lives of our closest living relatives, as long as we manage to guarantee their protection and their preservation in the wild.“Each disappearing population will take with it irretrievable glimpses of the evolutionary history of our species.”The researchers lived alongside orangutan communities in the swamps and low rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra in Southeast Asia, recording the calls of around  inidual apes across six populations.This is thought to be the largest sample ever analysed in this type of study.In high-density populations, the orangutans communicated using a large iety of original calls, trying out lots of new sounds that were continually changed or dropped while the animals in sparser, lower density populations favoured more established, conventional calls.Although these more dispersed groups did not experiment with such a huge number of novel sounds, when they did introduce a new call they kept it..removeTheir collection of calls was therefore richer than orangutans in high-density populations who continuously discarded new call iants, the study found.The findings are published in Nature Ecology and Evolution..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Orangutan vocabularies  ushaped by social mingling, like in humans u article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Exhibitors will include Flood Marine, McAlinden Boats, Swim Ireland, Royal Yacht Association to name but a few, and it will be packed full of activities from fun and interactive workshops, to on the water demonstrations and experiences.“We’ve hosted successful events for over  years now, including the Ireland Angling Show in Dublin, so we honestly believe that the increasing passion and interest in marine leisure over recent years calls for a bigger and better show.“For those interested in perfecting their techniques or learning about new products, the show will feature talks from a range of experts in all areas of the marine leisure sector, while also giving guests the opportunity to chat to professionals and visit our exhibitor stands.“We are also delighted to have the support of Lisburn Castlereagh City Council who recognise the enormous potential of Northern Ireland in providing these kinds of homegrown holiday activities.“This is a very lucrative market for everyone in the wider tourism industry and from this exhibition alone we estimate that around £, will go into the local economy. Northern Ireland has so much to offer with quality accommodation and catering, superb activity facilities and of course unparalleled access to water be it lakes, rivers or coast, said Hugh.”Officiating at the event launch and welcoming it to the city, Alderman Amanda Grehan, Chair of Lisburn  Castlereagh City Council’s Development Committee, said that this is exactly the kind of event to show off the versatility of their tourism offering.“Eikon Exhibition Centre which is conveniently located beside the main arterial routes to Belfast and Dublin is now a signicant centre for International events being held in Ireland and the United Kingdom. It will draw in thousands of visitors and millions of pounds in consumer spend and sectoral investment.“Supporting events like this is a core part of our economic strategy for the council area demonstrating that we are also a critical economic generator benefiting the whole of Northern Ireland.“The countdown has now started, and I look forward to visiting Ireland on the Water Expo next year. It will be a true partnership across the marine, tourism, accommodation and hospitality sectors,” said Alderman Grehan.Details on further activities will be announced over the coming months and you can check out our website www.irelandonthewaterexpo.ie or follow us on social media @IrelandonthewaterexpoIf you would like to know more about the Expo please contact us here, email [email#protected] or telephone Grace Mc Dermot, Mara Media Sales Manager, on +  .Northern Ireland  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most PopularWoman left badly shaken after van hijacked in Co Armagh...NewsSerious road traffic collision in Magherafelt...NewsNI strike: school buses, bin services, leisure centres and o...NewsSuspected petrol bomb attack at County Tyrone house...NewsAlcohol taken from youths in response to anti-social behavi...NewsMost Popular                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us           \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The comments were made as the UFU launched its annual schools’ competition. Open to all playgroups, nursery, primary, and special schools, this year’s theme relates to the UFU’s food and farming education resource “Dig in!”, which encourages pupils to learn more about food, farming, and the countryside. UFU deputy president, David Brown said, “This year’s schools competition theme ‘Dig in! to food, farming and the environment’ provides an opportunity for teachers to start the discussion in the classroom about the importance of food and farming in NI, allowing pupils to learn more about how farmers work hard to produce the delicious, high-quality produce on our tables, and their contribution to shaping our landscape in NI, which everyone enjoys. “Climate change has been the front runner in NI this year and our farmers play an essential role in combating the global issue, as they are a key part of the solution. The schools competition helps pupils to enhance their understanding of how farmers create dferent environments in NI which support our economy, rural communities, tourism and recreation.” Mr Brown says every year the competition judges are impressed by the number, standard and creativity of entries for the schools’ competition. “We would encourage all nursery, playgroups, primary and special schools to participate in what is a very worthwhile competition. It’s a great opportunity to express their creativity while learning about one of the most important sectors in NI as they will discover the importance of local food production,” he said. The UFU is pleased to have competition sponsor Asda on board for another year with a range of prizes available for the lucky winners. Joe McDonald, Asda NI corporate affairs manager said, “Asda is a proud sponsor of the school’s competition. It is great to see competition entries grow year upon year, especially with the introduction of a dferentiating foundation category last year - the standard is superb. It is vital to create an awareness of where our produce comes from, and this competition is a great opportunity to do so - educating children on the ‘farm to fork’ story.” Now in its eleventh year, BOIOFW is the perfect partner for the schools’ competition. As part of the prize, the winner of each category receives free transport for their class to the nearest participating BOIOFW farm, and all competition entries will be on display throughout the weekend. Mr Brown says schools don’t need to be competition winners in order to visit real, working farms. “This free event showcases NI’s world-class ‘farm to fork’ journey and reconnects consumers with our farmers, the primary food producers.The weekend underlines the importance of supporting local producers to benefit the rural community and wider economy in NI. BOIOFW is taking place on Saturday  and Sunday  June, and I would certainly encourage all schools to consider organising a trip to a local participating farm on the schools’ day, Friday  June,” said the UFU deputy president. Entry forms have been sent electronically to all playgroups, nursery, primary and special schools. Schools’ competition templates are available by visitingwww.ufuni.org.The closing date for entries is Friday  April .
