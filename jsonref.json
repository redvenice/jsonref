Ankara considers the YPG a terrorist group because of its ties to PKK Kurdish militants in southeast Turkey.On Friday Turkish armoured vehicles drove across the border to join their Russian counterparts, according to television footage filmed from the Turkish side of the border. Around four hours later, they returned to Turkey.Ground and air units were involved in the patrol around the Syrian border town of Darbasiya, the Turkish Defence Ministry said on Twitter, showing photos of soldiers studying a map and of four armoured vehicles.         The Turkish-Russian deal last week allowed Syrian government forces to move back into border regions from which they had been absent for years (pictured: Turkish and Russian patrol is seen near the town of Darbasiyah)                Soldiers stretcher someone injured and charred during the attack on the marketplace On Wednesday, President Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey had information that the YPG, which Ankara sees as a terrorist group because of its ties to Kurdish militants in southeast Turkey, had not completed its pullout.Russia is the Syrian government\u0027s most powerful ally and helped it turn the tables in the country\u0027s civil war by retaking much of the country from rebels since 2015. The Turkish-Russian deal last week allowed Syrian government forces to move back into border regions from which they had been absent for years.         Ankara launched its offensive against the YPG following President Donald Trump\u0027s abrupt withdrawal of 1,000 U.S. troops from northern Syria in early October (pictured: Turkish and Russian patrol near Darbasiyah, November 1)         Turkish and Russian military vehicles return following a joint patrol in northeast Syria, as they are pictured near the Turkish border town of Kiziltepe in Mardin province, Turkey, November 1         Syrian National Army soldiers stand inspecting the remnants of a building gutted in the blast          Syrian National Army forces cover the body of someone killed during the bomb attack          Soldiers drive the wounded away from the scene of the attack as the injured clasp their bloody wounds         A child weeps from an upstairs room as she looks on the scenes of wreckage below Ankara launched its offensive against the YPG following President Donald Trump\u0027s abrupt withdrawal of 1,000 U.S. troops from northern Syria in early October. The YPG helped the United States smash the Islamic State \u0027caliphate\u0027 in Syria.Four Russian vehicles and a drone also took part in Friday\u0027s patrol, conducted in an area between 40 km east of Ras al Ain and 30 km west of Qamishli, a Turkish security source said.The source said patrols would extend further along the border strip and drones would be used to ensure YPG fighters had left the area.The source added that there had been no direct clashes with Syrian government forces during the incursion.         Overnight, the defence ministry said Turkey had handed over to the Russians 18 Syrian government soldiers detained in Syria near the Turkish border this week (pictured: Turkish military vehicles return following a joint Turkish-Russian patrol in northeast Syria)       Erdogan said on Thursday that Turkey planned to establish a \u0027refugee town or towns\u0027 in a \u0027safe zone\u0027 between Tel Abyad and Ras al Ain (pictured: Turkish forces)Overnight, the defence ministry said Turkey had handed over to the Russians 18 Syrian government soldiers detained in Syria near the Turkish border this week.The 18 men were seized on Tuesday during operations southeast of the Syrian town of Ras al Ain, part of an area where Turkey\u0027s incursion took place, stretching some 75 miles along the border to the town of Tel Abyad.Erdogan said on Thursday that Turkey planned to establish a \u0027refugee town or towns\u0027 in a \u0027safe zone\u0027 between Tel Abyad and Ras al Ain, part of a project which state media have said would cost 151 billion lira ($26 billion).He met U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Friday and had said he would ask him to call for a donors\u0027 meeting to help finance Ankara\u0027s plans to resettle Syrian refugees in the region.\u0027I will say: \u0027\u0027You make a call for an international donors\u0027 meeting. If you don\u0027t, I will make this call\u0027\u0027,\u0027 Erdogan said on Thursday.         Ankara has said it plans to resettle in Syria up to 2 million of the 3.6 million Syrian war refugees that it hosts (pictured: Turkish and Russian military vehicles return following a joint patrol in northeast Syria)         A man passes the wreckage of a motorbike as the flames reach as high as him after the bomb explosion today          Last week Defense Secretary Mark Esper said the United States would beef up its military presence in Syria with \u0027mechanized forces\u0027 to prevent Islamic State militants seizing oil fields (pictured: Turkish and Russian military vehicles return following a joint patrol in northeast Syria)\u0027If it doesn\u0027t happen, we will establish a refugee town or towns between Tel Abyad and Ras al Ain,\u0027 he said, addressing a building contractor in the hall and saying he would ask him to play a role in the project.Ankara has said it plans to resettle in Syria up to 2 million of the 3.6 million Syrian war refugees that it hosts.Erdogan and Guterres discussed Turkey\u0027s plan, U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq told reporters in New York on Friday.\u0027The Secretary-General stressed the basic principles relating to the voluntary, safe and dignified return of refugees. He informed the president that UNHCR (the U.N. Refugee Agency) will immediately form a team to study the proposal and engage in discussions with Turkish authorities,\u0027 Haq said.According to plans Erdogan presented at the United Nations General Assembly in September, Turkey would resettle some 405,000 people between Tel Abyad and Ras al Ain.Erdogan said leaders at the General Assembly had looked positively on the plans but declined to offer money.\u0027We have for years hosted millions of refugees in our lands. The support we have received from the international community has unfortunately just been advice,\u0027 he said.\u0027The mentality that regards a drop of oil as more valuable than a drop of blood does not see anything but its own interest in Syria and everywhere in the world.\u0027Last week Defense Secretary Mark Esper said the United States would beef up its military presence in Syria with \u0027mechanized forces\u0027 to prevent Islamic State militants seizing oil fields.

An East German border soldier looks at a man hammering a section of the Berlin Wall at Markgrafen Strasse Rudi-Dutschke Strasse in Berlin, Germany on June 2, 1990. Nora Miethke said: ‘Politicians paid too little attention to communicating to people in the East the values of democracy and freedom\u0027Chemnitz has been at the core of Germany’s far-Right surge as extremists sought to exploit tensions both over reunification’s perceived failures and Merkel’s decision three years ago to allow one million refugees and migrants to stay in Germany. The AfD, already the third biggest party in the federal parliament, won European elections earlier this year in Chemnitz. Last month it recorded its biggest-ever vote when coming second in state elections for Saxony with 27.5 per cent of the vote, then it shared almost half the vote with the hard-Left Die Linke in neighbouring Thuringia state.There were violent protests in the city last year after a man was fatally stabbed by a Syrian. Meanwhile, eight alleged neo-Nazis in the ‘Revolution Chemnitz’ terror group have gone on trial in Dresden, accused of plans to attack immigrants and political rivals.         An East Berlin citizen embraces a West Berlin woman after the opening of the East German border in Berlin on November 9, 1989. Thomas Bärsch, author of a book on life growing up under Communism, said: ‘We could not dream the wall would ever come down. It seemed so much bigger than it really was\u0027So why does the far-Right’s message of fear and loathing find such fertile terrain in these parts, especially given significantly lower influx of refugees and migrants than in Western states?Nora Miethke argues that reunification needed social transformation alongside political and economic reform. ‘Politicians paid too little attention to communicating to people in the East the values of democracy and freedom,’ she said.Frank Heinrich, whose parents used to smuggle bibles into GDR, is now the MP for Chemnitz and local chairman of Merkel’s centre-Right Christian Democratic Union party. ‘It’s unbelievable to see how the city has been remodelled,’ Frank said. ‘But some people expected more from reunification.’He believes East Germans were unused to foreigners after decades under a closed dictatorship so when some arrived they presented a major culture shock, provoking fears that ‘alien’ attitudes were being imposed without sufficient debate. This was intensified by a lack of anti-Nazification projects under the Communists, making it easier for far-Right ideologies to take root again.Yet Torsten Krauel, chief commentator for the Die Welt newspaper, believes many in the West have forgotten how their fellow citizens saw their world turned upside down with some families living through their fourth collapse of a regime in three generations.He said: ‘No one is really interested any more, so the AfD have found a way to articulate their concerns. I do not agree with them but I can understand why some might feel concern and fear over their future.’He added that the language restrictions of new identity politics on gender and race can resonate badly with people once indoctrinated with words and ideas they knew to be false under Communism, making them susceptible to conspiracy theories.Georg Milbradt, an economist, was intimately involved with reunification as Saxony president for six years. ‘It was quite a challenge but it was a success,’ he said.Yet even Milbradt, one of the architects of the extraordinary efforts to crunch a ramshackle communist country into a thriving capitalist economy, accepts mistakes were made and there are problems still to be eradicated.         A group of men arrange tools to be rented for tourists to chip off parts of the Berlin Wall, in June 1990‘I knew it would take a generation or more because I saw historic comparisons such as Italy’s reunification after 1860 or America after its Civil War. It is an illusion that you can do these things in a very short time.’Without doubt, Germany is in gloomy mood as this key anniversary approaches. The long reign of ‘Mutti’ Merkel – often seen as mother of the nation – is coming to an end.Politics has become fractured with 13 different coalitions governing the 16 states, while the economy is shedding jobs and sliding into recession.Among those I spoke to during my time in Saxony was Thomas Bärsch, author of a book on life growing up under Communism, who told me of his first visit to the West after the wall was torn down three decades ago.‘It sounds stupid but even the light seemed brighter than in East Germany,’ he said. ‘We could not dream the wall would ever come down. It seemed so much bigger than it really was.‘I know some people are disappointed but I still think this is a dream come true for Germany, and especially for us living in East Germany.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"Now RAF offer pilots VEGAN boots brass ordered amend military dress policy","story":"Share this article Tens of thousands of military personnel currently wear berets made of wool and leather as well as leather boots, while other clothing items worn on parades such as trousers and jumpers are also woollen.The dispute between the technician at 7 Squadron RAF and the Ministry of Defence has resulted in dress standards being amended to appease vegans – presently just 1.6 per cent of the UK population.The new guidelines, which include grilling all applicants for vegan clothing to ensure requests are based on deeply held ‘philosophical beliefs’, are contained in an internal memo obtained by the MoS.

But the MoD is also aware of the huge rise in the popularity of veganism among the next generation – up to ten per cent of teenagers are vegans.Last night the MoD said: ‘Vegan dietary options are available for almost all personnel and the Armed Forces have not raised concerns over provision of vegan-compliant clothing for service personnel.’   "},{"url":null,"title":"Jeremy Corbyn sits Labour voter 60 years living room","story":"Share this article Unsurprisingly, she disagreed with critics who claim that Mr Corbyn might be too old to be contemplating stepping across the threshold of 10 Downing Street. ‘To me, he seems to be getting younger,’ she declared defiantly. ‘Well, younger in his attitude, I mean.’She added: ‘I’ve known him quite a few years now.

The incident is alleged to have happened at Strangers Bar in the House of Commons (above) He claimed the Tory had ‘drunkenly’ intruded on his conversation with a group of friends before repeatedly fondling him and trying to thrust a hand down the front of his trousers.The 30-year-old MP said he initially feared speaking out about what happened because he did not want to be labelled as ‘the MP who was sexually assaulted’.But he felt a ‘moral duty’ to report the alleged attack – which happened in October last year – to Parliamentary investigators after the allegations against Mr Thomson came to light in February.Mr Sweeney, a former shipbuilder from Springburn, Glasgow, said the incident has seriously impacted his working life – he is uncomfortable facing his alleged abuser in the chamber and dislikes having an office on the same corridor. Meanwhile, seven months after the Parliamentary Standards Commission launched an investigation into his claims, he says he is frustrated with its slow progress, branding it a ‘shambles’.         Paul Sweeney (pictured above) claims the alleged incident has \u0027seriously impacted his working life\u0027Mr Sweeney now says Mr Thomson should be deselected by his party and barred from running in the General Election – for fear he could strike again.He warned that if Parliamentary investigators do not censure Mr Thomson, he may report the matter to the police.Mr Sweeney said: ‘He’s not fit to hold public office. I don’t think he’s fit to be a Member of Parliament.’He said the alleged incident took place last October after he had invited a group of his old Glasgow University friends for a tour of the Commons.Afterwards, they went to the Strangers’ Bar for a drink.He claims they were interrupted by Mr Thomson, who was ‘drunk to the point where he was barely able to stand up’.Mr Thomson, 32, then allegedly grabbed at Mr Sweeney’s private parts through his clothes and tried to put his hands down the front of his trousers – all while making suggestive, sexual noises in his ear.In the following minutes, Mr Sweeney said he repeatedly told Mr Thomson to stop touching him and asked him to leave.Mr Sweeney said: ‘I felt paralysed. It was just such a shocking thing. I was in a cold sweat, it was mortifying.’He added: ‘Nobody knew where to look at the table. It’s embarrassing.         Mr Sweeney took guidance from a Women’s Aid charity on the advice of Labour MP Jess Phillips (pictured above)‘In the back of my mind, I was thinking that if I just punched the guy, who knows where that could end up when there’s a bar full of journalists.‘I couldn’t fight, so I took flight.’He said he went to sit with another group of MPs, telling them that Thomson had just allegedly sexually assaulted him.He claimed Mr Thomson followed him across the room and continued to ‘pet’ him against his will, before eventually giving up and leaving the bar.The Scottish Mail on Sunday has spoken to people who were in the bar at the time and witnessed the alleged attack.The revelation will be an embarrassment to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who has adopted Mr Thomson as a key ally.In June, Mr Johnson selected the Aberdeen South MP to help co-ordinate his leadership campaign north of the Border.After the alleged incident, Mr Sweeney took guidance from a Women’s Aid charity on the advice of Labour MP Jess Phillips.But in the months afterwards, he tried to bury his embarrassment and shame for fear he would be labelled as ‘the MP who was sexually assaulted’.For Mr Sweeney – who won his Glasgow North East seat in 2017, and has since fiercely campaigned for the rights of asylum seekers and to improve local services – his focus was instead on his blossoming political career. He said: ‘I downplayed it at first – because it wasn’t rape.‘I sat on this for ages because I didn’t want to make a fuss out of it. But when I go into the chamber and he’s there doing a speech, it’s still there – that intimidation. He knows, and I know, what went on there. I can’t get away from him. The House of Commons is 650 MPs in a very confined environment – it’s not like you can just not see the person.‘It’s not like a nightclub where it would’ve been an unfortunate situation but you never see that person again. You could just brush it off.’In May, Mr Sweeney asked his party’s whips if he could move from his office – which is just 60ft along the corridor from Mr Thomson’s – but no action has been taken yet.He said: ‘Basically, I have to work on the same corridor as someone who sexually assaulted me.‘Imagine someone has sexually assaulted you and they won’t do anything about the fact that the guy sits at a desk across from you every day. How would that feel for you?’In February, Mr Thomson was publicly accused of groping men in the same Commons bar.Despite initially deciding against reporting the alleged attack on himself to Parliamentary authorities, Mr Sweeney was galvanised to file an official complaint when he heard Mr Thomson had been accused of groping the other men.Enraged by Mr Thomson’s denials, he felt he had a ‘moral duty’ to take what happened to him to the Parliamentary Standards Commission.He said: ‘It was predatory behaviour and, after seeing that other thing break in the press, I thought I needed to say something because that’s not right.‘How many other people have had this happen and not felt the power to come forward? Especially in Westminster where, for a staff member, there might be a fear that you might be blacklisted or you might never work in politics again.’Despite his efforts and engagement with the process, Mr Sweeney says that the investigation has barely progressed.He added that he may have reacted differently if Mr Thomson had apologised.‘I never wanted to be the guy who was groped by Ross Thomson,’ he said. ‘I had a willingness to sort of let this go because if he had acknowledged he was wrong it might have been OK.‘I want him to accept that it was wrong, accept that he has to get a grip of himself and deal with whatever issues he’s got.’Last night, Mr Thomson confirmed he was at the Strangers’ Bar on the night of the alleged incident and had been socialising with Mr Sweeney.He added that he had been drinking, but declined to discuss in detail what happened.Vehemently denying any wrong-doing, Mr Thomson said that he had provided a detailed breakdown of the night to Westminster’s standards watchdog – and insisted he was ‘confident’ that their imminent report on their investigation would prove he was a fit and proper MP.He said: ‘Every single report of bullying and harassment deserves to be treated with the utmost seriousness.‘This has been a confidential process, and confidential for a reason to protect people who are genuine victims, and I have co-operated fully with the standards investigation even though I knew the allegations against me were completely false.‘Given that Paul Sweeney has broken this confidentially, I have no choice but to defend myself.‘The process is still going on and I find it very surprising that after several months of this process, Paul Sweeney has decided to go public at this time in making entirely false allegations for the purpose of political point-scoring.’He added: ‘I am going through a full, transparent, rigorous investigation whereby I am absolutely confident it would show that I am a fit and proper person to be an MP because I have done nothing.’A Scottish Conservative Party spokesman said: ‘We await the outcome of the Parliamentary Standards Commission investigation.’"},{"url":null,"title":"Massive car collection including Ford hot rod early Dodge goes sale","story":"Share this article          Auctioneers NCM said: \u0027This is an opportunity to purchase a genuine barn find classic car\u0027 ahead of the auction in Preston yesterday          Car-enthusiasts were able to bid for the cars in person or online and were sold without documentation or warranty at the NCM auction.

He and Rebaka Sultana married the next year in Bangladesh and she joined him in Australia in 2013. Later that year their son, Adyan, was born at a Geelong hospital.A few months after his birth, Bhuiyan and Sultana noticed Adyan was struggling to lift up his head. Tests revealed he had a mild cerebral palsy, likely caused by a stroke shortly before or after his birth.Bhuiyan, who has a Bangladeshi degree and a South Korean masters, finished his PhD in engineering at Deakin University in 2016. He was granted a Victorian state government nomination for a permanent skilled migration visa, which would allow his family to build a life in Australia.However, because of Adyan’s disability, it was rejected under Australia’s strict “one fails all fail” visa health criteria.Bhuiyan’s family appealed the rejection through the administrative appeals tribunal.Two-and-a-half years later, the AAT upheld the refusal, noting it was “bound to accept” the findings of Adyan’s medical assessments in 2016 and 2019.The 2019 medical assessment found Adyan had a “mild functional impairment” which was likely permanent, and would likely require community services “including but not limited to additional support at school”.“I do not have any idea why a kid having little weakness in his left hand will need special education,” Bhuiyan said. “As far as I can understand, special education is required for those who are unable to attend in the mainstream schools.”A separate medical assessment seen by  Australia says Adyan is independently mobile and only requires a support rail to navigate steps and uneven surfaces. It notes he is very vocal, enjoys playing with a soccer ball and has developed movements to adapt around his disabilities.It does not assess cognitive function, which the report recommended prior to starting school, and does recommend continued therapy support in Australia or Bangladesh.Bhuiyan said Adyan goes to kindy every day and that the parents help him with physical therapy.“He’s very good now, very good,” he said. “No learning difficulties, he’s going to school and learning everything and watching kids videos at home.“Now he can grab things, when before he couldn’t grab anything.”In its ruling, the AAT said it had no discretion to take into account the contributions the family had made to Australia.The family has appealed to the immigration minister, David Coleman, as their last chance at staying in Australia. The minister’s discretionary powers allow him to grant or deny a visa. He is not compelled to make a decision, or explain it.Bhuiyan is on a bridging visa E, a restricted three-month visa that allows the family to legally live in Australia while they wait for the outcome of their appeal to the minister.He works a casual job while Sultana keeps studying for the exam to have her qualifications as a doctor recognised in Australia.“Every three months my visa is extended,” Bhuiyan said. “This situation is very difficult for me. My Deakin university supervisor told me he would include me on a project as soon as my visa situation is resolved.”Bhuiyan said he was not worried about his future in either country but wants to stay in Australia and have his son educated here.The minister has previously granted visas to families in similar situations, including a Bhutanese family who lived in and worked in Australia for seven years who were facing deportation because their deaf son would be a “cost” to the taxpayer.The minister also granted a visa for a Filipina nurse working in Townsville, and her 10-year-old son whose visas were rejected because of his autism diagnosis. They arrived in Australia when he was two and he was diagnosed shortly after.In 2017, Bangladeshi doctor Nasrin Haque was given a last-minute reprieve after she was rejected for permanent settlement after eight years living and working as a GP in Australia, because of her daughter’s autism.

Or, at least, the fantasy wasn’t mine alone. The escapades were thanks to my compulsive reading of Philip Pullman’s His Dark Materials. Northern Lights, the first book in the His Dark Materials trilogy, was published in 1995, when I was four, so it was a few years after it came out that I fell for Pullman’s writing. But when I finally did … boy, did I fall hard. I zoned out of sleepovers with friends, family dinners, and – on one occasion – my brother’s wedding as I joined Pullman’s heroine, Lyra, on thrilling Arctic voyages and skirmishes in parallel universes.If I detailed all the reasons I loved the trilogy, I’d take up the whole newspaper. But it comes down to three things. First, I loved Lyra who, thanks to her daring and mischief, allowed me to glimpse what life would be like were I not such a timid teacher’s pet. Second, there were Pullman’s irresistible “daemons” – a kind of animal self. A companion who could shape-shift from seal to snow leopard seemed an improvement on my drab imaginary friend, Cheryl. And third, it felt … rebellious. I had a cosy Church of Wales upbringing where the history of Christianity was presented as an uninterrupted stretch of benevolence. Pullman’s scrutiny of the authoritarian side of religion was as invigorating as a blast of the Arctic air I’d read about in his books.I grew up, and finally consented to read a few other books – but my devotion to Pullman never diminished. Which is why I’m positively writhing with excitement about the all-star TV adaptation which kicks off on Sunday night on BBC One.The palpable hype among my generation is proof of something I’ve always suspected: that the books we encounter as children are the ones to which we’re most attached. After all, while it’s not inconceivable that one would throw a viewing party for a TV adaptation of the work of a writer discovered in adulthood, it seems more likely to happen with a children’s author. (My flat. 8pm. “Armoured bear” makes a good cold weather costume.)I’d argue, then, that our fondness for children’s books not only comes from the familiarity forged through re-reading but from the reason we re-read, too. As Mangan says, children’s books are where we first encounter myriad aspects of life. Such intense periods of discovery tend to lodge in the memory.There’s also another factor: time. In youth, entire days are spent in uninterrupted stretches of reading. It’s harder when you have a job and WhatsApp. Mangan also notes that higher expectations mean these “days of effortless immersion” are harder to come by in adulthood. “As an adult, your tastes (andor prejudices) are more developed, your time is more precious and your critical faculties are harder to switch off.” Children, on the other hand, are joyously uninhibited when they read – in other words, they’re not fretting about whether the book will fit with their #personalbrand on Instagram.In addition, author Katherine Rundell has suggested that children’s books work on two levels, simultaneously satisfying kids’ thirst for adventure and incorporating the adult author’s awareness of the knottier aspects of life. Indeed, they’re required to operate on two planes if they’re to avoid boring parents who are reading to their offspring. So, in a way, children’s books work harder than books for adults, conveying many-layered meaning with the sort of lightness required to hold short attention s. Such finesse doesn’t go unnoticed by readers.All of this is why, when someone inquires about your favourite book and you insist it’s a toss-up between Bernardine Evaristo’s Booker prize-winning Girl, Woman, Other and Virginia Woolf’s To The Lighthouse, they’ll know you’re lying. Neither of these can be your favourite book – or, at least, the book that has had the greatest influence on you. The books that mark us most profoundly – that burrow into our psyches and shape how we see the world – are the ones we read as children.Of course, some sneer that children’s books are rife with nostalgia. But the nostalgia in question isn’t a “take back control” yearning for a simpler time – but for a simpler way of seeing. Childhood reading overlaps with a period where the future seems wide open. What we’re looking to resurrect through kids’ books isn’t the past, but this beguilingly cheery perspective.Besides, the great gift of Pullman’s stories set in Lyra’s universe is that they’re part of the present as much as the past. Along with the TV series, anyone who’s been in a bookshop recently will know Pullman is still adding to the series – The Secret Commonwealth, the second book in The Book of Dust trilogy (which is interlinked with His Dark Materials) was published last month. It revisits Lyra in her 20s. I’ve already read it twice. Perhaps it’s not only childhood that gets lost to literary escapism, after all.I was addicted to Little Women and the three books that followed it. I adored reading about sensible Meg, Tomboy Jo, ailing Beth and spoilt Amy with her blond ringlets (I envied her those). I am not sure that I identified with any of the Little Women but the narrative escape was as complete as vanishing into another country (Massachusetts, America, to be precise). Nowadays, I think the main reason these books enslaved their readers was to do with Alcott’s virtuoso sentimentality. We are so used to disdaining sentimentality,we forget what a force it can be. Kate Kellaway, Observer writerMy mother gave me Frances Hodgson Burnett’s A Little Princess when I was princess-age, and its story of the suffering of Sara Crewe was once my favourite. But that was because I hadn’t read The Secret Garden yet. Reading it this September, through a depression that was starting to lift, Mary Lennox taming her tantrums in the Yorkshire air and lifting her sadness as the daffodils bloomed felt like the metaphor I needed. Sara Crewe is always good, just tested by circumstances Mary Lennox is spoiled but learns to be good to herself, and to others. It is a very Victorian rewilding – the stiff father repents and returns, and love for nature is elided into love for God – but it gives a girl hope, because it shows that her happiness is in her own hands. Joanna Biggs, writer and assistant editor of the London Review of BooksI’m envious of children who grew up with The Gruffalo or The Amber Spyglass. My juvenile reading lacked such contemporary wonders. We read what our parents had read. The landscape of the postwar child’s imagination was dominated by Victorian classics (Alice), or Edwardian stalwarts (Swallows \u0026amp Amazons). For me, reading was about transgression not fantasy. My favourite was the adventures of 007. Casino Royale was published the year I was born, 1953. James Bond is my Harry Potter. Addicted to reading – the flashlight beneath the bedclothes – it was Fleming’s thrillers (Dr No, Goldfinger, From Russia with Love) that became the literary drug I look back on with longing, shame and regret. Robert McCrum, writer and associate editor of the ObserverI don’t remember when I first read Mary Norton’s The Borrowers. It seems it was always part of my childhood. As with the very best children’s books, it filled my world with magic. In each place we lived I looked for nooks and crannies where our family of Borrowers might live. When small things went missing, I would be convinced it had been ‘borrowed’, and puzzle at how tiny people might use one plastic Barbie shoe (perhaps a soup bowl?). The Borrowers kept my imagination alight and, in a childhood where I moved frequently and often felt lonely, those tiny creatures became secret friends and I, their beloved, watched over, ‘human bean’."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e2c666cc5fa4a02f7e0758552ed809e09aa789f/0_283_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aed2b3e5dca00e442507239369f3af4e","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of them Welcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.First up, an admirable post from steevieb, who has had a change of heart about Elizabeth Strout’s Olive Kitteridge:Some time ago (years) I began reading Olive Kitteridge. Just couldn’t get on with it though, got bored with the small town America bit. Last week I decided to give it another go, I am so glad I did, totally blew me away, beautifully written, I loved every page so much that I immediately bought Amy and Isabelle, which to me was even better. How I could have been bored by it (Olive K) the first time around is a puzzle. Moods, I guess.Tom Mooney has also been rereading some classics:Hemingway’s The Old Man and the Sea, not for the first time. It is wonderful, perfect even. I found some of it a little tougher to read this time, particularly the killing of the sharks (I had been reading a LOT of Cormac McCarthy around the time I read it before so was likely very desensitised!) but it stands up magnificently to repeated reading.I must be in the mood for old stuff as I also recently reread The Swimmer, John Cheever’s glorious masterpiece of a short story. It’s one of my all-time favourites and shows what a sharp writer he was.Night Waking by Sarah Moss has satisfied BobHammond2:Set on the fictional Scottish island of Colonsay, academic Anna is trying to juggle the challenges of motherhood, marriage, her academic career and a fair amount of sleep deprivation - and then a mystery around a baby’s skeleton buried outside her house on the island. Overlaid on top of this is a separate timeline where we see, throughout the book, a series of letters written by a midwife sent to the island back in the late 1800s to improve infant mortality. So, Moss has a lot to juggle but she does it brilliantly and the two separate stories and all the loose threads are brought together at the end of the book for a very satisfying conclusion.fuzzywuzz has enjoyed The Body by Bill Bryson:What a marvellous adventure I have been on, taking a tour of the various organ systems within a human being. Although I studied biochemistry and physiology in my student days, I have learned some interesting new things and revisited already known facts.What I particularly like about Bryson’s style here is that he has taken some complex subject areas such as immunology and transfusion science and distilled them into something which can be mentally digested by those without a scientific background and does so without patronising the reader.ID673795 has enjoyed Caravan of the Lost and Left Behind by Deirdre Shanahan:The story of a woman traveller and her son returning from chaotic lives in England to live on a traveller’s site in Ireland with her father, where she also hopes to find her daughter, left there as a baby. The landscape is beautifully described and the story very sad but in the end hopeful.BanjoGuru has just finished But Beautiful by Geoff Dyer “which I enjoyed a lot”:I was expecting straight biographies of some jazz greats, but it’s an altogether stranger beast - part imagined, part true, full of shifting perspectives and illusions and some really perceptive and evocative prose. I can recommend it if you like jazz, or even if you don’t.Now this is a funny and wise book. The quips and cultural insights are ridiculously true. Especially about the X and Y generations. Professor Chandra himself is a true delight … I found myself asking, “So who IS this smart guy who wrote this fine book?” That’s when you know it’s a good’un. This book is smart, hilarious, and best of all ... kindhearted. Yes, filled with an open hearted way of looking at the people we love and our struggles as well as struggles of our world and culture today.Finally, MarGar65 has just finished Penelope Fitzgerald’s Innocence:I loved it. I am so glad her books have come into my life! What an observant author ... What trust she places in us as she unfolds her stories. She refuses to bend to the expectation of a happy ending. I fear I am running out of To-Be-Read Fitzgeralds ... This is most alarming in a sense because I will run out of new Fitzgeralds, but I am relieved when I think that I can go always go back and reread them all.Going back to reread Fitzgerald sounds like an admirable idea. Just the kind of thing that should get us through winter…If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

But it is perhaps a building that portrays him better than nicknames.In the woodland of Paris’s Bois de Boulogne, the Louis Vuitton Foundation rises like a displaced iceberg in a pool of meltwater: the £80m structure, designed by American architect Frank Gehry, is creative, complex and visionary, but not entirely admired or popular. Imposing and inspired, it is also sharp and cool, as in chilly rather than trendy.The same could be said of Arnault, 70, a trim, cultured and slightly awkward man who started his life as the son of an industrialist in Roubaix, a poor town in France’s post-industrial rust belt. He rose through hard work and a certain creativity to become the undisputed master of the luxury goods universe as president of LVMH, the €196bn (£169bn) group whose name is an abbreviation of its cornerstone brands: Louis Vuitton, the world’s biggest luxury house, and Moët Hennessy, the champagne and cognac producer. He is the world’s third-richest man, with a fortune worth $97bn (£75bn).Last week LVMH said it was looking to add US jeweller Tiffany \u0026amp Co to its stable with a $14.5bn bid. Tiffany said it was reviewing the proposal, which has been driven by Arnault’s desire to bolster LVMH’s presence in the “hard luxury” – or jewellery and watches – market, where it owns Bulgari but still trails Swiss rival Richemont.It would be the most valuable deal of a career that always seemed destined for the top. After graduating from the elite engineering school École Polytechnique, whose alumni include three Nobel prize winners and three former presidents, Arnault spent a short time working for his father’s construction business before convincing Arnault senior to ditch the building side and concentrate on real estate. In 1984, he acquired Boussac Saint-Frères, a failing textile company hiding a gem – the Christian Dior brand.After a spell in the US, Arnault returned to France determined to take on the country’s traditional corporate leaders – the aristocrats, major wine chateaux and family dynasties – with an aggressive American-style approach to business.In 1989 he made a hostile takeover of LVMH and it became a launchpad for the acquisitions of some of the world’s most prestigious labels. Today, LVMH is made up of more than 70 companies, including haute couture labels Dior and Fendi, watchmakers Tag Heuer and Hublot, upmarket jeweller Bulgari, and the Veuve Clicquot and Dom Pérignon champagne houses. It made a profit of €10bn on €46.8bn of sales in 2018.Lloyd Blankfein, the former chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs, says Arnault’s skill was in realising the global demand for luxury products. “He was a complete visionary. He saw the increase of wealth in the world,” Blankfein said last year.Pierre Mallevays, former head of acquisitions at LVMH, who now runs the boutique financial advisory firm Savigny Partners, said: “Arnault is a man of great vision. He did not invent luxury brands but he invented the luxury industry. He singlehandedly helped transform a landscape which was a collection of family-run businesses into organised, professionally run groups with synergies and benefits of scale. He anticipated that more and more people would want to buy luxury products and organised himself to ride that growth.”In business, Arnault is considered ferocious and predatory. At home he is by all accounts an attentive father and family man. He is a trained and reportedly talented pianist and a keen tennis player. He is proud of having once played Roger Federer – a birthday gift from his children – against whom he scored a single point.He has five children. He had two with his first wife Anne Dewavrin: daughter Delphine, who is being groomed to take over the LVMH empire, and Antoine, head of communications for the luxury group. He has three sons with his second wife, the French Canadian concert pianist Hélène Mercier. The couple live in an upmarket district of Paris’s Left Bank, where Arnault’s art collection includes works by Damien Hirst, Pablo Picasso, Henry Moore and Andy Warhol. He also owns a large villa in St Tropez.Arnault is often described as a man more interested in culture and creativity than cash. He insists his reputation as an asset-stripping cold fish is undeserved. “It’s true that I am not from the south and I have a certain reserve,” he once said. “I take time to get close to, and I don’t immediately throw my arms round someone. But it is more a question of style.”Running LVMH is a balancing act in which Arnault gives his star designers – who have included fashion bad-boy John Galliano and Alexander McQueen – funding and a free creative rein, while expecting results in the long term. “What I always say to my team is: I am not that much interested in the numbers for the next six months. What I am interested in is that the desire for the brand will be the same in 10 years as it is today,” he said last year.However, colleagues and business associates, who rarely go on the record, describe him as impatient and unbending, ruthless and driven in only one direction: forward. His failures are rare but have included an unsuccessful bid for control of Gucci, now owned by France’s third-richest person, François Pinault, chief executive and founder of the French luxury group Kering. (The pair’s notorious rivalry hit the headlines after the Notre Dame cathedral fire, when Pinault’s pledge of €100m to help rebuild the cathedral was trumped by a promise of €200m from Arnault.) He was also thwarted when he went after Hermès five years ago, but the consolation prize was a huge profit on the shareholding LVMH had amassed.He has said it is novelty rather than money that drives him in business. “Profit is a consequence of what we do well it should never become a goal,” he told the Financial Times this year.He is, however, rich and getting richer. Arnault jumped to second place on Bloomberg’s wealth league in July, overtaking Microsoft’s Bill Gates to rank behind Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, but dropped back to third shortly afterwards. His Tiffany bid could see him make another tilt for the top: “I always liked being number one,” he said in the Financial Times interview.The late Steve Jobs could not see Arnault losing his fortune any time soon. “I don’t know if in 50 years my iPhone will still be a success, but I can tell you I’m sure everybody will still drink your Dom Pérignon,” the Apple founder once told him.Wine and spiritsChâteau d’YquemMoët \u0026amp ChandonHennessyDom PérignonFashion and leather goodsBerlutiCelineLouis VuittonChristian DiorPerfumes and cosmeticsFenty Beauty by RihannaAcqua di ParmaKenzo ParfumsGuerlainWatches and jewelleryBulgariHublotTAG HeuerChaumet"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b63d0a9786b98010933ba4def069e642e1ed6f01/0_181_4443_2666/master/4443.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af32d0ee9e625e2b77fb0c6fb37b33c4","title":"retail gloom christmas into shopping centres","story":"Fragile consumer confidence, rising costs and online shopping leave shops vacant and cost jobsIt’s Christmas! Well, nearly. Last Friday, Argos was the first retailer to broadcast a festive TV ad, signalling the start of what has traditionally been an orgy of consumption in Britain’s shops.But behind the in-store displays of tinsel and looped selection of past Christmas hits, there isn’t much cheer for Britain’s high streets and shopping centres. Fragile consumer confidence, rising costs and increased online shopping have left shops vacant and cost tens of thousands of jobs. Familiar names such as Bathstore, Bon Marché and Debenhams have gone into administration this year.The economy is barely growing and while Britain avoided crashing out of the EU on Halloween, Boris Johnson’s hard Brexit deal remains a big worry. These woes were only added to by the prime minister deciding to call a general election less than two weeks before Christmas.This isn’t bad news just for retailers. Intu Properties and other shopping centre owners are feeling the strain as investors start to wonder whether their once-prized assets have a future. These companies have had to swallow falling rents as struggling retailers such as New Look and Topshop owner Arcadia demanded cuts to stay afloat. The value of their properties has fallen, putting strain on finances and scaring investors.Intu, whose sites include Manchester’s Trafford Centre and Lakeside in Essex, will issue a third-quarter trading report on6 November. As Britain’s biggest shopping centre owner, it is the most vulnerable, and has seen a chaotic year or so following two failed takeover attempts.Intu’s chief executive, Matthew Roberts, has said his first priority is to cut debt. The idend has been suspended and Roberts is trying to sell assets, mainly two shopping centres in Spain. He is also ersifying into flats and hotels, and lining up more non-retail experiences. But with investors questioning the long-term survival of bricks and mortar retail, the assets will be hard to shift. And buyers will drive a hard bargain, knowing Intu is desperate for cash.Kieran Lee, analyst at stockbroker Berenberg, said Intu was “uninvestable” in its current state despite having the best-quality venues in the sector. Retailers’ woes would increase, he said, and the company would struggle to escape a spiral of declining sentiment, falling property values and burdensome debt.“Intu owns the best centres in the UK but its balance sheet is broken,” Lee said. “Though it has these really good assets, its debt is too high. It’s trying to sell assets but the market isn’t open for them to do so.”There are two main routes out of this bind for Roberts, who was Intu’s finance director before becoming chief executive in April. He can try to raise £1bn or more from shareholders in an emergency rights issue, or he can sell the company.Physical retail probably won’t die. Despite the gloom, footfall at Intu’s centres is holding up, and even Amazon is opening high street shops. Reports of interest from private equity indicate that there may be buyers out there.With the right surgery, Intu’s centres could be enjoying ringing tills for many Christmases to come. Whether Intu will own them is another matter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a51868f129df06fc97d4c8b99bffdd3921789516/0_113_3134_1880/master/3134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e53d312fc509791178cff068402ed56","title":"tory plan to outspend labour turns partys principle on its head","story":"The Damascene conversion to a spending splurge funded via borrowing may not wash with voters, let alone the IFSBy any standards, the UK’s economic performance in the 2010s has been poor. Workers are still earning less in inflation-adjusted terms than they were when the financial crisis erupted in 2008, productivity growth has collapsed, business investment has been weak, the trading performance wretched.Despite all that, Britain has had nine uninterrupted years of Conservative rule and, if the polls are right, is on course for another five. Has the state of the economy ceased to determine election results?Not really. Labour lost in 2010 because Britain had just been through the deepest recession of the postwar era and while recovery was under way, it arrived too late to keep Gordon Brown in Downing Street. The surprise was that David Cameron did not win an outright majority.The story of 2015 was that of a classic housing-market-inspired pre-election boom carrying the sitting government back to power. Cameron won the overall majority that had eluded him five years earlier because his chancellor, George Osborne, aligned the economic and political cycles at a time when the rest of the world was on the up.So how do things look this time around? The short answer is they look better for Boris Johnson than they did for May but not as promising as they did for Cameron in 2015.But it’s not all good news for Johnson. Despite almost full employment and rising real wages, consumer confidence is low and has been further depressed in recent months by Brexit uncertainty. In days gone by, a combination of record low interest rates, jobs growth and rising living standards would have prompted people to move up the property ladder and buy a new car. But spending on the two biggest ticket items of consumer spending is weak.What’s more, the economic data between now and the election is likely to be mixed. The upside for the government is that the GDP figures due out on 11 November will show that the economy returned to growth in the third quarter. But the labour market data due out the following day are likely to confirm that unemployment reached a trough in the summer and has since started to rise gently.Tory attempts to blame all the problems of the economy on the alleged profligacy of the last Labour government become less effective as the years roll by. After nine years in charge, it is no longer good enough to say the lost decade was the other lot’s fault Johnson and his team have to convince voters that the 2020s are going to be better.Their way of doing so seems to involve Labour’s clothes. Sajid Javid’s pledge to raise the minimum wage to £10.50 an hour by the end of the next parliament is not as generous as Labour’s promise to raise it to £10 an hour immediately, but it means the two biggest parties are now locked in a bidding war to see who can promise to raise the minimum wage the fastest.Similarly, the spending increases Javid announced in September are intended to show voters with austerity fatigue that a page has been turned. Jeremy Corbyn understood that voters had had enough of belt-tightening in 2017 May did not.Both parties now think it makes sense to exploit low interest rates to borrow for public investment, which represents a Damascene conversion for a Conservative party that took the axe to infrastructure spending in 2010. The only real difference is that Labour intends to pay for its spending programme through a combination of extra borrowing and higher taxes for companies and better-off iniduals, and the Conservatives plan to cover higher spending and lower taxes through borrowing.This is curious in two respects. Firstly, it means that when the two parties have their tax and spending homework marked by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, Labour is likely to get the higher marks. Secondly, it means the Tories will have taken the platform on which they fought the 2010 election and turned it on its head. On Tuesday, the Conservatives will seek to attack Labour’s economic credibility by costing Corbyn’s spending pledges. Given what the Tories themselves are planning, this will be a case of the pot calling the kettle black."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5050815bda10b0e50b7a61cb696d823a4f427918/0_0_3300_1980/master/3300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=521837c9c3b7a565a8ef136f9bd7b383","title":"if we bar politicians from lining their pockets in office we might trust them","story":"Britain’s electorate, having been tutored in the ways of open democracy and parliamentary accountability for longer than most, is regarded as sophisticated. We will hear the encomium “the voters are our real employers” many times over the course of this election. It suggests we are wise to the ways of our elected representatives and that we seem to possess a sixth sense for knowing when the time has come for change. Yet, in so many other ways, we are as easily reassured as a child hoping to find silver under the pillow where a tooth used to be.We fondly believe our MPs are beyond the reach of corporate wealth and that the interests of their constituents, or at least what they think are those of the country, always come first. But what do we imagine those Conservative party dinners at £100,000-a-pop are really for? Do we ever dwell on what fuels the lobbying industry? Has the concept of one-person-one-vote ever been a reality?We fondly assume that, in exchange for a handsome salary and not insubstantial pension and benefits package, our politicians work exclusively on our behalf during their political tenure. Allegations of Tories and their families being up to their oxters in hedge funds originating in the South Pacific flit in and out of our Facebook pages and the dark money at the heart of the Brexit campaign simply can’t be denied. Yet little or none of this will come to feature significantly on the stump of this election.At the end of last month, Ruth Davidson, until recently the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, decided to seek to enlarge her income stream. She decided that her job representing the citizens of her Edinburgh Central constituency left her sufficient time to represent a global PR firm for a per diem rate of £2,000. Admittedly, she would only have added an extra £50,000 for 25 days’ work to her MSP’s salary of £63,579. After a week or so of negative headlines, she wisely opted to drop this arrangement.Davidson is an astute and canny politician who found herself at the top of the Tory tree in Scotland shortly after becoming an MSP in 2011. Under her leadership, the Tories replaced Labour as the main opposition party in Scotland, a feat once considered less likely than Scotland’s footballers qualifying for a World Cup. What was most puzzling about Davidson’s brief flirtation with a lucrative second income isn’t that she felt a salary of £63,579, plus generous expenses and pension, didn’t quite meet her lifestyle needs, it’s that she seemed oblivious to how this would be understood by voters. No wrongdoing was attached to her first steps into the world of lobbying and PR, nor did she try to conceal it.What first attracted Tulchan Communications to the former Scottish Tory leader, Ruth Davidson? She is a very charming and charismatic woman but it wasn’t just for these qualities that her new commercial bosses were keen to pay her £2,000 a day. Even if any of her constituents did understand her need to earn more money, they might have had a problem with the potential for a conflict of interests: theirs and her new employers.However, Davidson is only one of many among our elected representatives across the spectrum of party politics who doesn’t seem to have grasped why attempts to maximise their parliamentary experience are regarded dimly by the public. Most MPs, including the indefatigable Davidson, work hard at their job and are dedicated to the idea of public service. However, the public also regards the task of making laws and representing them in the highest chamber in the land as a privilege that requires their exclusive devotion. There may be scant long-term security in a job that is at the mercy of the public’s capriciousness every few years but this is more than offset by generous pension arrangements and the opportunities to connect with potential future employers.Findlay’s proposed legislation is welcome and long overdue. but if we were serious about ending access to these streams, we might go further and prevent former prime ministers and ministers of state from monetising their tenures for a reasonable period after they are over. It would be like draining a swamp with a plunger, though.Four years ago, a senior Scottish Labour MP chastised me for suggesting during a radio show that he and some of his colleagues all too eagerly threw themselves into the lucrative arms of high finance after their 2015 election apocalypse. “Don’t you know I could have been earning hundreds of thousands during the time I was at Westminster,” he said, looking genuinely hurt.From a population of 65.5 million, it must be possible to find 650 MPs and 129 MSPs who are happy to forfeit outside financial interests in exchange for a remuneration package more than twice the average wage and not expect to be hailed as heroes for their sacrifice."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e48825651147a5299c13fec6918c0538656618e8/0_628_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f8e6fa1a43734d72e1a05b8f709601c","title":"only in ottawa top 10 unmissable summertime experiences in canadas capital","story":"Summer visitors to Ottawa will be rewarded with a vibrant arts and outdoor scene, with galleries, festivals and waterways. Then there’s the beerOttawa is relaxed, but at the same time an adrenaline-seeker’s dream. It’s funky and kitsch and yet effortlessly cool with brewing, dining and arts scenes to rival anywhere in North America – and its absolute best comes in the summer months.Cruising the Rideau canalWhile Ottawa’s Rideau canal plays host to hundreds of daily ice skaters carving across its frozen surface during winter months, the Unesco world heritage site is just as appealing in summer. Jump aboard Rideau Canal Cruises’ fully electric barge – the only vessel of its kind in North America – and savour the perfect vantage point for some of Ottawa’s most scenic spots. You can take in Lansdowne Park and Dow’s Lake to the south and the gothic revival splendour of the Fairmont Château Laurier hotel closer to downtown.Political manoeuvring – with a twistZen can be found in surprising pockets of Ottawa but none more surprising than in its very epicentre – Parliament Hill. Inside the doors of the nation’s halls of power, things may be particularly frenetic with a federal election coming up this autumn, but on the lawn outside the stunning house of commons, things are decidedly more chill every Wednesday afternoon. The free weekly yoga class is an absolute must for yogis and non-yogis of all abilities. Even prime minister Justin Trudeau, an enthusiast himself, has stopped in at a class or two. Just bring a mat – and some sunscreen – and get your downward dog on while the politicians get their debate on inside.Brewing up a stormWhen former US president Barack Obama rekindled his bromance with Trudeau during a visit to the capital earlier this summer, it was pretty fitting that the pair caught up at a brewery. Ottawa is teeming with taphouses pouring out some of Canada’s best brews. Obama and Trudeau opted for Big Rig Brewing where they sampled the Canadian Amber and Alpha Bomb IPA respectively. But there is hoppy goodness to be found across the city. Beyond the Pale in Little Italy is a gem with great eats to soak up even better beers, while Canada’s first Kickstarter-funded brewery, Dominion City, is so worth the trip to the east end. Can’t decide between the options? Then let the experts at Brew Donkey guide you on an always-fun brewery bus tour.The best season? Patio seasonSummer is patio season. There’s nowhere better to enjoy those great local beers or some of the best cuisine in Canada than in the open air. The uber-stylish Andaz hotel in the ByWard Market may lay claim to the city’s best patio, a rooftop escape that offers stunning views. But there are scores of rivals. Tavern on the Falls boasts soothing waterfall views, while Tooth and Nail Brewing Co has a recently opened sun-kissed courtyard to go with great beers. The Brig Pub may have the most Insta-perfect open-air space of all – a canopy of hanging greenery that still leaves gaps for blue skies to pierce through.Sounds of summerThe capital reverberates to music all summer long. Bluesfest is the biggest and boldest festival of the summer and boasts much more than just blues. Headliners this year include the Killers, Alt-J, Wu-Tang Clan and the Backstreet Boys. But from June through to September there really is something for everyone: Escapade sates all EDM lovers’ appetites Chamberfest is the world’s biggest chamber music festival there are five days of fireworks at the Canadian Museum of History with the Sound of Light competition and, yes, there is also a 10-day jazz festival that features some of the world’s biggest acts.Please the palate at a walking paceOttawa’s food scene – a melting pot that bubbles over with flavours and aromas – is as erse as its population. The city ranges from award-winning fine dining to adventurous ethnic holes in the wall, with plenty in between. But there are so many funky new places opening up that wrangling them all in can seem like a challenge. So why not pass the job off to someone else by joining a walking food tour? C’est Bon Cooking offers great guides to the city’s food culture, snaking through the top foodie neighbourhoods. Centretown and The Glebe might be the most happening neighbourhoods right now.Waterways to pass the dayIf the blue lagoon part of the Goliath sounds appealing, but little else, then keep things upright and a little lower on the adrenaline scale by hitting the waterways that course around the city. With temperatures on the rise, the summer months in Ottawa are made for water lovers. You can take to the Rideau canal in your own personal vessel, with kayak, paddleboat, canoe and stand-up paddleboard (SUP) rentals all available at the marina at Dow’s Lake. Venture beyond the canal to either the Ottawa or Gatineau rivers. Urban Ocean may be the pick of some great rental and guide firms, offering the chance to SUP in the shadows of Parliament Hill or SUP yoga by the Ottawa locks.Live the high life … then dropNot everything has to be chill in Ottawa – there are thrills too. Nowhere does the adrenaline flow freer and faster than at the Rock. Just a 20-minute drive from downtown, this stunning limestone gorge is a site to behold but looks even better upside down. Great Canadian Bungee offers the highest fall on the continent of North America — fully 61 metres (200 feet) into the aquamarine lagoon below. Even the 49-metre (160-foot) rebound is higher than the next biggest bungee in the US or Canada! If you’re not feeling the urge, watching others drop below is a thrill in itself!Culture cravings satisfiedOttawa is not just the country’s political centre. It lays claim to being Canada’s museum and gallery capital too. The sprawling National Gallery of Canada finds room for almost 100,000 works, by a distance the country’s biggest. This summer’s highlight sees the world’s first-ever exhibition devoted to the portrait work of post-impressionist master Paul Gauguin. But make time for the Canadian and Indigenous galleries too, where the country’s cultural heritage can be traced back 5,000 years. At the Ottawa Art Gallery’s stunning new home – shared with Le Germain hotel – catch the Wrapped in Culture project, a powerful reclamation project between Indigenous artists from Canada and Australia.Go wildSo many summer visitors eschew Canadian cities and make straight for the great wilderness. Ottawa offers the best of both worlds. Drive even 10 minutes outside the city and you’ll find your natural paradise. Gatineau Park is over 350 sq kms of green goodness and yet its main entrance is just 4km from downtown. Hike to the Pink Lake lookout where the deepest aqua-green waters ensure that no filter is required for the perfect selfie. There are trails for all levels of hikers, and rookies and experts alike should finish up at the genteel 1900s surrounds of the Mackenzie King Estate, where tea and scones at the former residence of Canada’s longest-serving prime minister are just reward for the hike.Explore all Canada’s capital has to offer with Canadian Affair"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a3f7e5e587883057275ab322ed2a7bab2cb8f88/0_200_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0934396a1fcb20fb5ccb680372b62200","title":"10 unmissable autumn experiences in ontario","story":"Visit Ontario in the autumn and you’ll discover food festivals, migrating birds and a kaleidoscope of foliage colour. Relax at Muskoka or fly to Frying Pan Island for its famous local fish and chipsOntario explodes into colour in autumn as the lush greens of spring and summer give way to the reds and golds and scorched orange and browns that are the hallmarks of the harvest time. The best time to see the autumn colours is from mid-September to mid-October when Ontario Parks publishes a colour report on its site of the autumn colours across the province. As you can imagine, the colours vary, depending on your location. In truth there is no better time to hit the road, get out of the city and soak up the kaleidoscope of change for a true Canadian autumn adventure.The natural heart of the provinceNowhere do the seasons change with as much vivid, coursing colour as in Algonquin provincial park. There are more than 100 provincial parks in Ontario, but none can rival Algonquin for popularity. Why? Because it lives up to the hype … and then some. Almost 3,000 square miles – a bigger expanse of land than Luxembourg – of unspoiled natural wilderness, the park is located between Toronto and Ottawa and is less than three hours’ drive from either city. Camp under the tapestry of stars or rent a ranger cabin for some rustic comfort. But, at first light, get out and catch the rich red maples and blinding yellow aspen trees in all their swing season glory.Pull up a chair in MuskokaIf Algonquin is Ontario’s natural centre, then the nearby Muskoka region is its relaxation hub. When Torontonians speak wistfully of a need to get out of the city to “cottage country” it’s likely that the Muskoka region is on their mind. From Insta-perfect tiny cabins to multi-million dollar lake homes, Muskoka has the full gamut of getaway options, almost all of them carving out a corner of tranquility among the pretty towns that pepper the region. A buzzing food scene, great breweries, spas and golf courses – the area has everything. Most of all though, it’s made for lounging lakeside in a low-slung Muskoka chair and forgetting about city life.Why 1,000 Islands make for a delightful trip …Head upstream from Lake Ontario to the mouth of the mighty St Lawrence River and you’ll reach the 1,000 Islands, an archipelago of more than 1,800 islands that straddle the Canadian and American border. A lazy but so rewarding cruise of the islands from Kingston, Gananoque or Rockport all the way up the St Lawrence is not to be missed, with stunning seasonal views guaranteed. And yes, these same islands are forever commemorated in a condiment – the eponymous salad dressing originating here.… Or up the ante with 30,000 IslandsIf you’re a go big or go home type then please don’t go home. Ontario offers a supersized island experience on the eastern shore of Georgian Bay as speckled out from Parry Sound lie the 30,000 Islands. The largest freshwater archipelago in the world, the islands can be enjoyed on water or, if you’re in the mood to splurge, by air. Georgian Bay Airways offers outstanding tours of the Unesco biosphere reserve, including one that stops in at Henry’s, a fish and chip shop that serves up the local delicacy – battered pickerel – on the quite brilliantly named Frying Pan Island, which can only be visited by plane or boat.Give the Highlands a flingJust three hours north-east of Toronto, the Haliburton Highlands offer some of the most spectacular trails and lookout points in the province – especially during the autumn colour season. In late September the four-day Hike Haliburton festival is the largest annual hiking gathering in the entire country. As the tree canopy really begins to find its best burnt crimson, climb the Dorset Lookout Tower and have your breath taken away by the panoramic visions from the top. Once your trail is finished, rest weary limbs and quench that thirst at the Lake of Bays Brewing Company in Baysville to the west.All aboard for northern exposureThe expanses of Ontario that stretch northwest from Georgian Bay can seem intimidatingly vast. But they needn’t be. Sault Ste Marie, a steel town on the rebound with some real gems among the rebirth, is a great starting point for a northern excursion. The rugged appeal of northern Ontario may be best taken in on the Agawa Canyon Tour Train, a journey into the wilderness on tracks that hug the sides of lakes and traverse rivers on their way through towering rock outcrops. Just make sure to book a window seat.A capital ideaNot the provincial capital – that honour falls to Toronto – Ottawa more than makes up for it as the epicentre of national governance. But better to leave the indoor stuff to the politicians because autumn is arguably when Canada’s capital city is at its most charming. Take a paddle along the Rideau Canal (before it freezes over for the winter) to get the best views of some of the city’s autumn foliage.Feast on the fruits of harvest seasonYou can quite literally wade into the riches of Ontario’s agricultural output as harvest season gets into full swing. Strap up your chest waders and take the plunge in Bala, Ontario’s cranberry capital. Autumn fairs crop up across Ontario as the boundless bounty of produce piles up. From the Pumpkinfest in Port Elgin to Oktoberfests across the province’s south-east, tis the season to e right in. Food festivals are popular across the province, and run the spectrum from sweet to savoury. Anything from blueberries, strawberries, peaches, apples and cherries can be found. Ribfests, garlic, bacon fests or buttertarts also feature.Wine for the winding roadThe Bruce Trail is the longest and oldest trail in the country and winds its way more than 550 miles north from Niagara Falls to Tobermory, Ontario. An entire section of the trail snakes along some of the spectacular cliffs of the Niagara Escarpment and other sections along the route make for nice day hikes. It would be a sin not to visit during the Niagara Grape and Wine festival, a two-week toast to the region’s finest tipples in September. It’s Canada’s biggest wine festival and a Discovery Pass pairs the wines with some of the best of the region’s vaunted cuisine.Heading south before the next seasonAutumn is not just moving season for farmers. Some of Ontario’s native fauna are getting their act together too. Upwards of 300 bird species begin to pack up and head south to avoid the winter, while hundreds of thousands of monarch butterflies do likewise. The great migrations are perhaps best witnessed at Point Pelee national park, less than an hour from the border with Michigan and the best time to catch the birdlife is mid-September.Start planning your visit to Ontario this autumn with Canadian Affair"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a7b12462f58d578b58360f4db6e4dfb7c47d442/0_0_2121_1273/master/2121.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ce0bf1e7b7d972a2e08cb3c63c6475d","title":"from fringe theatre to walking on water 10 experiences that make alberta unique","story":"Alberta is a breathtakingly beautiful province. Home to the Canadian Rockies, farmland for miles (and miles and miles), all-season escapades, and a friendly and erse population, it’s a great place to get a whole lot of adventure for your moneyWalk on (frozen) water at Maligne CanyonStrap on your ice cleats and get ready for an afternoon journey through the frozen Maligne Canyon. During the summer months, visitors pass high over the canyon on a series of bridges, but once the river freezes over, the real adventure becomes possible. Trek over the ice and into the frozen depths of the canyon, and witness sheer icy cliffs on either side of the path – you’ll have definitely earned a mug of hot chocolate by the end.Become a fringe theatre fanatic in EdmontonFirst-timers at Edmonton International Fringe Theatre festival are often surprised to learn that Alberta’s unassuming capital city hosts the second-largest fringe theatre festival in the world (after Edinburgh). Those in the know, however, can attest to the massively fun explosion of wackiness and dramatic creativity that add colour and life to Edmonton’s hip Old Strathcona neighbourhood for 10 days each August.See Indigenous history at Writing-on-Stone provincial parkAlberta’s most recently minted Unesco world heritage site, Writing-on-Stone provincial park, is near the southern border in the area known as the Canadian Badlands. Tall, imposing rock formations called hoodoos populate the plains near the Milk River. On the rock walls are carvings and drawings that record the dreams and stories of the Áísínai’pi (Blackfoot) people, who have been in the area for the past 10,000 years. You need a guide to take you out to the art on the stone – book online to reserve your spot.Challenge yourself with the Crypt Lake Hike in WatertonThe trailhead of the Crypt Lake Hike in Waterton national park is accessed by boat, which is the first clue that this is not just going to be a walk in the park. Follow the trail up the mountain (approximately three hours each way) past four alpine waterfalls over a loop that runs roughly 11 miles. Avid hikers are, of course, drawn to the trail for the challenge of negotiating obstacles such as the 60-metre tunnel through the mountain – but it is the thrilling cliffside stretch near the top, which features stunning views down the ravine of the crystal-clear blue Crypt Lake, that truly makes this adventure something special.Photograph ice bubbles at Abraham LakeSometimes nature does some trippy things, like make a lake that freezes with bubbles in it. Decomposing matter forms methane bubbles in Abraham Lake in central Alberta. When it’s really cold, the bubbles get trapped in the ice rather than bursting at the surface. High winds can polish the ice and clear the snow away, making for perfect bubble viewing conditions.Go underground with a Canmore Cave TourJust outside Banff national park is the town of Canmore. It has all the trappings of a charming mountain community, plus a little extra: Rat’s Nest Cave. The name is straight out of a horror movie, but a tour of Rat’s Nest – one of Canada’s longest caves – is a perfectly safe way to get your thrills. Challenge yourself with the four-hour Adventure tour, or for something more moderate opt for the two-hour Explorer tour. If you are feeling extra adventurous you can book a private “solitude” experience.View larch trees in Banff and KananaskisEastern larches, a variety of pine also known as tamaracks, turn a deep golden yellow or rich copper for a short season – generally mid-September to mid-October – before dropping their needles for the winter. Pack a bright coat to pop against the colours in photos and head out to viewing hotspots like the Sentinel Pass in Banff’s aptly named Larch Valley, or the more easily accessible Chester Lake in Kananaskis country outside Calgary.Play palaeontologist at the Royal Tyrell MuseumDedicated to all things dinosaur, the Royal Tyrell Museum is Canada’s home of palaeontology, featuring one of the world’s largest collections of dinosaur displays alongside more than 130,000 fossils and an unbeatable programme of special exhibits and interactive learning experiences. Located just an hour-and-a-half drive out of Calgary, the Royal Tyrell Museum offers a great day trip out of Alberta’s largest city for people of all ages, not just kids.Touch the top of the world in Lake LouiseIf skiing isn’t your cup of tea, or you need a break from carving down the mountain, the Lake Louise Ski Resort offers a different kind of alpine experience – snowshoeing! Book a tour with a guide who will lead you off-piste for a peaceful snowbound hike around the summit, taking in panoramic views of some of the most stunning scenery in the Canadian Rockies from the spectacular vantage points dotted across the trail.Star gaze in Wood Buffalo national parkIn the far north of the province, with an area larger than Switzerland, lies the largest national park in Canada, Wood Buffalo national park. It is also the world’s largest dark sky preserve, making it the perfect spot to escape light pollution and star gaze or hunt for northern lights. With about 18 hours of daylight in the summer months, you will need to be a night owl to stay up for the show, or consider a visit in the autumn, winter or spring.So what are you waiting for? With all these fantastic experiences and so much more, surely now is the time to explore the vast – and vastly beautiful – province of Alberta.

In many cases, the pupils have underlying conditions, such as autism or attention disorders, which are not being properly supported because of cuts to special educational needs and disability (Send) budgets in schools and councils. A damning report published last week by the cross-party education select committee concluded that the government’s Send reforms were failing children and “setting local authorities up to fail”.The problem is compounded by the crisis in mental health provision. Pupils with “school phobia” cannot obtain the medical evidence they need to be classed on registers as an authorised absence rather than a truant.Using money raised through crowdfunding platform CrowdJustice, and with legal aid, the families are looking to mount a legal challenge against the Department for Education’s absence codes and guidance, which they claim discriminate against those with school attendance difficulties.Nationally 783,425 pupils were classed as persistent absentees in 2017-18, with 325,685 of all pupil absences recorded as “more than 25 days”. Local authorities issued 260,000 penalty notices to parents for unauthorised absences in 2017-18, an increase of 110,000 on the previous year.Not Fine In School (NFIS), an organisation that supports families with school attendance difficulties, has 8,200 members on its closed Facebook group, with an average of 24 new members joining daily since September. Beth Bodycote, founder of NFIS, said: “We have nearly 5,000 members posting on a daily basis. Their distressing stories repeatedly illustrate the lack of appropriate understanding and support for attendance difficulties.”Colette Reid, 48, a social worker from near Manchester whose 14-year-old son James developed anxiety about going to school, said she has been though a nightmare over the issue. The teenager has an autism and ADHD diagnosis but started mainstream secondary school with no education, health and care (EHC) plan, a document that outlines the provision that must be in place to help a pupil, meaning he had no extra support in class or at break times.As James’s school phobia developed, his absences were recorded as truancy and, according to his mother, teachers blamed her for his failure to attend. Despite trying to get support in place and explaining her son’s anxiety to teachers and council staff, his mother was fined £60 and then prosecuted . But after representing herself in court, she was given an absolute discharge by magistrates who said they “appreciated how difficult it must be raising a child like James”.“When I came out of court, I burst in to tears because it was the first time anyone official seemed to understand. James is high functioning and didn’t cause any trouble in class so the school couldn’t see a problem,” said Reid. “But he said he felt like he was ‘in a bubble’ in class and his distress manifested itself at home in extreme episodes where he was out of control. He just could not cope with the big classes, noise and confusion of mainstream school.”James is now being home schooled but attends a part-time college foundation learning course. He is in a class of 10, with a teacher and two assistants.“He’ll go because it is totally different to school,” said Reid. “I was constantly told I wasn’t doing my job as a parent but unless those people live with a child with school refusal, they’ll never understand how tough it is.”Fran Morgan, founder of Square Peg, one of the organisations involved in bringing the legal action, said: “The term ‘school refuser’ is controversial as these are children who want to attend school but are unable to do so for reasons outside their control.“School special needs budgets have been slashed and cuts mean support staff are no longer there, waiting lists for access to the child and adolescent mental health service are unacceptably long, and the thresholds to qualify for any kind of help are unacceptably high. At the same time, academic pressure is being piled on pupils. It is a perfect storm and a lot of children can’t cope.”Polly Sweeney, a partner at Irwin Mitchell solicitors which is acting for the parents, said the issue affected thousands of children and their families across the country. “We are disappointed that the Department for Education has not responded to the organisations’ request to meet and discuss their concerns,” she said: “As a result of the lack of progress, we have now been instructed by a number of families of vulnerable children with school attendance difficulties, to advise them on a judicial review of the current system as they now consider that legal action is the only solution to addressing the issues they are facing.”A Department for Education spokesperson said: “No child should be taken out of school without good reason.“The advice to schools is clear they should authorise absences due to illness related to both physical and mental health.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/324f7877d53c29eb15e54da122cb68778c90f1c5/0_0_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cfa1f7fea71cdb3bf4498692fab9cc06","title":"fracking shale gas scientists tories earthquake","story":"Ministers have been condemned for wasting millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money in a failed attempt to introduce fracking to the UK. The bid also cost the nation a decade of effort that should have been expended on other, more environmentally friendly energy projects, scientists and activists claimed yesterday.The criticisms were made in the wake of the government’s decision on Friday to impose a moratorium on fracking in the UK. A review published by the Oil and Gas Authority concluded it was impossible to predict the likelihood or scale of earthquakes triggered by fracking.Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, is a way of extracting natural gas from shale rock formations that are often deep underground. It involves pumping water, chemicals and usually sand underground at high pressure to fracture shale – hence the name – and release the gas trapped within to be collected back at the surface.The technology has transformed the US energy landscape in the last decade, owing to the combination of high-volume fracking – 1.5m gallons of water per well, on average – and the relatively modern ability to drill horizontally into shale after a vertical well has been drilled.In England, the government placed a moratorium on fracking in November 2019 after protests,\u0026nbsplegal challenges\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspplanning rejections. A year earlier, the energy company Cuadrilla was\u0026nbspforced to stop work\u0026nbspat its Preston New Road site in Lancashire twice in four days due to minor earthquakes occurring while it was fracking. The tremors breached a seismic threshold imposed after\u0026nbspfracking caused minor earthquakes at a nearby Cuadrilla site in 2011. In March 2019 the high court ruled that the government\u0027s fracking guidelines were unlawful because they had failed to sufficiently consider scientific evidence against fracking.The moratorium leaves the government with an option to restart fracking in future years. However, many critics believe the technology is not suitable for the UK.“Fracking is utterly incompatible with our aims of ending the burning of fossil fuels in this country in a couple of decades,” said geologist Professor Stuart Haszeldine, of Edinburgh University. “Pursuing the technology of fracking while embracing the concept of having a carbon-free society is an example of national schizophrenia. It has wasted millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money. It has also wasted a decade when we should have been pursuing other goals.”One such aim should have been the development of the technology of carbon capture and storage which would involve carbon dioxide being captured, liquefied and stored underground in old mines or depleted oil reservoirs, added Haszeldine. “We have lost significant leads in developing this technology over the past decade when we should have been pursuing them energetically. Instead we have wasted our time on fracking projects.”This point was backed by Professor Jon Gluyas, director of the Durham Energy Institute at Durham University. “The government ban on fracking is a neat way of ignoring the now inescapable truth that the projected shale gas potential for the UK is tiny at best. We have, though, as a nation wasted a decade hoping for more gas to heat our homes rather than installing ultra-low carbon geothermal heating like that used in much of Europe.”Fracking, also known as hydraulic fracturing, involves pumping water, chemicals and sand underground at high pressure to fracture shale rock and release trapped oil and gas. However, the process can also trigger earthquakes, and although fracking was enthusiastically endorsed by Tory politicians when plans for erecting drills were first made 10 years ago their introduction has been hindered by intense local opposition. To date only three wells have attempted to frack for oil and gas in the UK.Earlier this year one of these wells triggered a tremor that measured 250 times the level permitted by regulations. A subsequent review concluded that it was impossible to predict the probability or scale of earthquakes triggered by fracking. Business secretary Andrea Leadsom yesterday announced she was imposing a moratorium. The decision brings England into line with the rest of the UK. Fracking in Scotland was suspended in 2013. The Welsh government imposed a moratorium in 2015, while there is a planning presumption against fracking in Northern Ireland."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c360b6db88dd12f0f8eafa47bba9c28f98bf0c38/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=393fa324178e44eddef16bb0d0466dbf","title":"the guardians climate pledge 2019","story":"We want the  to play a leading role in reporting on the environmental catastrophe.

Even in flat-soled shoes, this 36-year-old can go around plucking stranded cats out of trees. “Without a doubt,” she says, “I’ve always felt bigger and taller than I am.”In the past few years especially, the actor has made good use of this inside-outside differential. Whether it was playing the pioneering American judge, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in 2018’s On the Basis of Sex, or earning an Oscar nomination as Jane Hawking, Stephen’s formidable first wife, in 2015’s The Theory of Everything, Jones has had an instinctive sense for the pathos and humour in characters whose physical slightness tends to trick others into overlooking them. In a Star Wars movie, 2016’s Rogue One, she played a watchful and almost childlike guerrilla who ultimately tough-nutted past dozens of baddies to bring down an army. In her coming movie, The Aeronauts, she plays a 19th-century balloonist – a figure of fun to the scientists and flight enthusiasts of Victorian London, until she has to rescue one of them from death at 37,000ft.Jones meets me for lunch in a pub in north London. She is early, and pumped for some roast chicken. When our meals arrive she sets about eating and talking at an equally brisk clip. Although this can lead to accidents (she points out a stain on her sweatshirt), Jones is a cool bean and has that performer’s knack, just about inexplicable to me, of chatting away fluently even after forking in a mouthful of drumstick meat.She’s interesting and eloquent about her job, stiffer when it comes to talking about herself and her personal life. First we talk about the wider world, which seems, most weeks, to be falling to pieces. “There was that old-fashioned idea, years and years ago,” she says, “of a movie star who was this godlike being who never deigned to talk about anything mortal. But that’s long gone.” All for the better, she thinks. “I’m a constant news-checker. You can’t not be, now. There’s such chaos in the world. It seems to be our duty to be informed, to be abreast of things. Particularly in my work, now, I’m not shy of things that have a strong ideology, that are political.”Her Ginsburg biopic had an obvious liberal bent. The politics are more subtle in the new film The Aeronauts, directed by Tom Harper, written by Jack Thorne and co-starring Eddie Redmayne. He plays James Glaisher, one of the world’s first meteorologists, a Victorian scientist who hoped to better understand our weather and our climate. In his studies of the upper atmosphere, he took the first steps towards understanding what damage we were doing up there, even then. A timely story to tell, Jones suggests.I ask her what she makes of the current political situation. “Uh. I’m pretty disappointed, to be honest. It’s been sort of devastating, the last few years. It’s a tragedy.” She recalls the time she spent in the company of Justice Ginsburg, becoming close to the 86-year-old while preparing to portray the older woman on screen. “That was life-changing for me,” she says. “Spending time with her. Getting to know her well. She has such integrity. And, particularly now, when we look around at public figures, when their integrity seems to have been left very, very far behind, and it seems as if everyone is acting out of this horrific personal interest…” She widens her arms, a gesture of vague despair that I take to mean: oh, for one or two more Ginsburgs.On the Basis of Sex, which partly focused on the relationship between Ginsburg and her husband Marty, played by Armie Hammer, got a lukewarm reception when it came out last year. Jones remembers the months spent promoting the movie around America, not always to the most receptive of audiences. “I felt there was an ingrained sexism, at certain points, in response to the film. Even now it’s hard to put out a film like that into the world, about female triumph, female success.”She remembers the amazed reaction people had to Marty especially, who took on a secondary role in the marriage, better to support Ruth’s ambitions. Up to that point, in a varied screen career, Jones had played opposite monsters, witches, a long-dead Peter Cushing who was digitally revived by animators for her Star Wars film, superheroes and aliens. But it was Marty Ginsburg who audiences refused to believe in.“I was asked: ‘Who is this man? Could he possibly exist? Is he a fantasy?’ I don’t know. Maybe change happens slowly. But it’s hard at times not to get disheartened.”Jones was born in a suburb of Birmingham, to parents who met while working on a local newspaper. They separated when she was young, and Jones has since said that the example of living with a working single mother helped instil in her a definite work ethic. Jones joined a drama group at 10 and got her first paid gig at 13, in an adventure movie, The Treasure Seekers, alongside a young Keira Knightley. They filmed during the school holidays. “I remember liking how we were taken seriously, despite being young.” At 15, she joined the cast of The Archers (playing Emma Carter in the radio soap until she was in her mid-20s) and put in the work while in secondary school as a magic-endowed school bully, Ethel, in a BBC adaptation of the Worst Witch books.Over lunch we talk about some of the complications associated with kids who take on adult jobs. Growing up too quickly. Missing out on parts of childhood. Jones cuts in on my examples. “You’re asking, did I have the Judy Garland experience? On the uppers and downers?”Sure, I say. How Judy were you?“I was quite low on the Judy scale. Partly because my parents were strong about having an education, and keeping school going alongside acting. And partly because it felt like a hobby then. It was fun. It wasn’t Judy. It wasn’t a grind.”Jones went to Oxford and studied English. Her freshers’ week was unluckily timed. She had just done an ad for zit medication, which was nationally broadcast. “I was one of two girls in a bedroom, talking about a guy named Rob. We bounced around, fell back on the bed, dreamed about this guy named Rob. And then we used some face wipes.” As an undergrad she appeared in some earnest, bad student plays and, after graduating, moved to the southeast to set about auditioning for real.“I look back on that time fondly. But I remember it being hectic. Chaotic. Everything up in the air. You got sent reams and reams of scenes to learn, for auditions that were always in Soho, and which you would never get. I remember always bumping into the same actors who were going through the system.” She reels off the names: Carey Mulligan, Andrea Riseborough, Eddie Redmayne, Andrew Garfield, Tom Hardy… “We’d see each other constantly.”One by one, like fireworks, these other careers began to spark and take off. “We were all going for it. So you were disappointed if you didn’t get something, when someone else did. It was funny. People would have these moments and suddenly go stratospheric. I guess I started to realise that everyone has their own unique selling points.”When I ask Jones what her own unique selling point is, she raises an eyebrow, ironic. Isn’t it obvious? “My height. My huge stature!” She apes the voice of an imaginary casting director: “She took our breath away, that tall one. We’ve got to get that tall girl back.”That gang of Soho auditionees, with careers that one by one took off – was there rivalry between them? Is there still? Jones tilts her head. “We’re all still friends. I’m always interested in what choices they make. ‘Ooh. That is interesting. They’re doing a play now are they?’ It’s healthy competition. And it’s nice to feel hungry.”In the late 2000s Jones was in a bunch of TV shows: Austen adaptation, David Morrissey drama, Doctor Who cameo. She appeared in two Michael Grandage plays in the West End, and Julie Taymor cast her as Miranda in a Helen Mirren-led film of The Tempest. Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant made her a co-lead in their curious, whimsical romcom from 2010, Cemetery Junction. The film that eventually cut through was an American indie, Like Crazy, a Sundance darling directed by Drake Doremus that came out in 2011. Jones played a British exchange student who fell in love with a Californian, played by Anton Yelchin.Years later, Jones’s co-star Yelchin was killed in a car accident outside his home, at 27. When I ask about him, Jones loses her fluency. “I mean, it takes time, to get to a point… to find some hope in some of this stuff. I think all decisions in life become more meaningful through grief. You think: ‘How lucky I am.’ Because it’s… Because we’re all just here in the balance.” She’s seems a little teary-eyed. Maybe I’m imagining it. In any case we leave the subject there.There is a certain line in Jones’s head, the stuff in life that’s up for discussion, and the stuff that’s not. She will squirm as this line is approached. She’ll prod at her food. Talking about intimacies with a voice recorder running is, plainly, agony to her. “I think it’s a bumpy ride, isn’t it? I’m an instinctively open person. I’m used to being quite expressive. But I think, ultimately, you’re just trying to think about people in your life who haven’t chosen the public eye.”Jones recently got married to her boyfriend, the British director Charles Guard. After the wedding, pictures of the ceremony were harvested from her guests’ social media accounts and published in a few tabloids. “To an extent you develop a level of detachment from yourself,” Jones says. “Seeing images of yourself all the time, you have to, in order not to get too neurotic. But I think in terms of family and friends and partners, you need to protect them.”One friendship she is eager to discuss is that with Redmayne. The pair were cast in The Theory of Everything in the summer of 2013. During the shoot the following autumn, Jones remembers, they developed an interesting method of motivating each other. When it was one of their turns for a close-up, the other would linger off-camera, hurling abuse. “I would stand there, or he would, shouting horrific things, ‘You’re hopeless, you’re never going to work again,’ anything to get a response. Shooting gets monotonous. You do scenes over and over and over again. To try for something a little… spicier, it helps if someone is pushing you, provoking you.” Jones says the pair repeated the same trick when they reteamed for The Aeronauts. Every day she and Redmayne would set out to ruin the other one’s day, “to get a fantastic close-up.”When The Theory of Everything came out, both Jones and Redmayne were nominated for the big-deal best-acting awards – Oscars, Globes, Baftas, all of which Redmayne won. Jones missed out, beaten in every case by Julianne Moore for Still Alice. She remembers it, now, as a blurry, happy period of brilliant good luck. “Which at the time I totally took for granted. I thought it would happen in every film. ‘See you on the next red carpet!’ It’s only afterwards you see how special it was. How unique, for a film to hit the zeitgeist.”I ask Jones, what does an experience like that do to the ego? “The ego… swells. It can feel as if this film is the most important thing of the moment, and you lose a bit of perspective.” They’d been pushing and pushing to get to Oscar night on 22 February, she recalls, and on 23 February, Jones says, only exaggerating slightly, everybody moved on. “The whole thing ends. It feels like you start again. But that’s the job. It’s a carnival, it’s a travelling show. The tent comes down. There’s the constant excitement and adrenaline and next minute no one cares. You can see why actors in the past have had such horrific lives. Drugs. You have to have some stability that’s already there in you. You have to be able to ground yourself – come home. Take time to let your ego un-swell.”A few years have passed since then. Jones went on to helm the billion-dollar-grossing Star Wars film, Rogue One. She married. She played Justice Ginsburg. Recently she signed on to make a George Clooney-directed space movie, out next year. Right now she’s back on the promotional circuit with Redmayne for The Aeronauts. A winter release date, for a film like this, would tend to suggest there are studio hopes for the big awards. Who knows? Jones says: “You start to realise you have peaks and troughs. It’s an undulating experience.” She’s inclined to go by the theory: “Have a care for what you put out in the world, and then let the world do what it will.”We’ve finished our lunch and reflexively we do that ugly, uncomfortable thing in times of Big News – we check our phones for updates. Jones says she’s been thinking about Stephen Hawking a lot, in these times of political upheaval, all the disagreements and double-talk. Jones befriended the physicist during the course of making The Theory of Everything and when Hawking died last year, she attended the funeral. She has found herself wondering what he would make of it all. “He was such an important voice,” she says, standing up. “I miss it. I don’t mean his voice-voice. His voice went, of course, he had a mechanical voice. I mean, I miss his articulacy.”His reason, I suggest.“Yeah. I miss his truthfulness.”She shrugs. Gathers her stuff. The world carries on doing what it will.Stylist by Hope Lawrie makeup by Mary Greenwell hair by Leigh Keates at Premier Hair and Makeup"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0d02b377e0d27b735b3af903a5538e91d7d9fc5/0_65_2384_1431/master/2384.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7eb0bf0c85b9a5bd16b0f0079e1a1011","title":"theyre the pants that i want buyer pays 405700 for olivia newton johns grease outfit","story":"Actor’s famous black trousers and leather jacket sold at auction along with other memorabilia, raising $2.4mOlivia Newton-John’s tight black trousers and leather jacket from the movie Grease have sold for $405,700 at a Beverly Hills auction, more than double the expected price.The outfit that marked the transition of Newton-John’s character in the 1978 musical from demure high schooler to sexy Sandy was among 500 items for sale at Julien’s Auctions to help raise money for the performer’s cancer treatment centre in Australia.The famous pants worn by Newton-John for the You’re the One That I Want duet with John Travolta were so tight that she had to be sewn into them to film the scene, and were sold with a broken zipper.

I have taken her lead here using them on a golden cabbage pancake that I know she’d enjoy. Although I am sure that she would add some spicy sausage that would be also lurking around the bottom of her case.In the cold, I need comforting and these dishes will do this with warming ginger and a touch of acidity. When I asked my chef colleagues what they were looking forward to this autumn, the answer came back: “Eating all sorts of orange food while wearing a jumper.” The vongole surrounded by pumpkin pillars with fregola soaking everything up fits the bill. And if by the end of this you’re not feeling suitably cosy there is apple pie.All of the joy I associate with bubble and squeak, but with a dustily Italian accent. Serves 4potatoes 150g, peeled savoy cabbage 200g plain flour 90g polenta flour 60g bicarbonate of soda a pinch eggs 2 buttermilk 300g salt and pepperolive oileggs 4 cheese strong and harddried chilli 1, crushedBoil and roughly mash the potatoes. Shred the cabbage and then boil it for 5 minutes. Drain it thoroughly.Mix the flours and baking soda together. Beat the buttermilk and eggs together with 1 tbsp of olive oil. Into this, mix the flour, 2 good pinches of salt, a grind of pepper and finally the vegetables. Set aside to rest a moment.When you are ready to eat, fry a ladle of batter in a heavy-bottomed pan in 1 tbsp of olive oil over a medium heat. Do this one ladleful at a time. Then, fry eggs in more olive oil over a medium heat, seasoned and topped with two shards of strong cheese and a pinch of chilli.Serve the pancakes, warmed in the oven if necessary, with the eggs on the top.Baking everything together gives this dish unity. One to serve on the table directly from the pan. Serves 4Heat the oven to 180Cgas mark 4. Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil Clean the clams. Peel the pumpkin and cut it into pieces, roughly 3cm cubed. Heat a large pan or skillet that can go in the oven. Coat the pumpkin cubes with a little olive oil and salt and roast in the oven for 10 minutes.During this time boil the fregola. Chop the garlic. Chop the parsley. Peel and grate the ginger. Then drain the fregola.Remove the pumpkin from the oven, turn the cubes over. Add the garlic, parsley, ginger, chilli, clams and fregola, and stir thoroughly. Place the butter in the middle, pour over the wine and scatter the cheese.Return to the oven for 15 minutes, or until all the clams open. Serve at once.Steaming aubergines until they are almost translucent changes their texture. Dress when warm, but eat once they have cooled to be most delicious.

Cut the aubergine in half then into 2cm slices. Sit them in the steamer above the water for 15 minutes, while you make the marinade.Grate the peeled ginger and the garlic into a bowl. Season with salt, chilli, oregano, vinegar. Add the tomato. Set the aubergines into this while still warm, dressing with chopped mint and some olive oil, and allow to cool together. Eat within a few days.This indulgent pastry is super light and prefers a light touch to an electric mixer. Eat it with the ice cream recipe that follows. Serves 400 flour 200g baking powder 1 tsp golden caster sugar 85g salt pinch butter 200g, softened mascarpone 200g apples 4 lemon juice of ½ demerara sugar 2 tbspTo make the pastry, first mix the flour, baking powder, caster sugar and salt together. In a large bowl with a fork or wooden spoon, mix the mascarpone and butter together until absolutely amalgamated, but not whipped. Mix in the flour and continue to combine with a spoon and eventually your hands. Do not overwork the dough, but wrap it in baking paper as soon as it is a homogenous thing. Allow it to rest for at least half an hour in the fridge.Peel the apples and roughly cut them into small pieces. Squeeze over the lemon juice and sprinkle with 1 tbsp of demerara sugar. Heat the oven to 160Cgas mark 3.Squeeze the dough between your fingertips, then press two thirds of it directly into a 15cm tart case. Take care to join the pieces together so there are no gaps. Fill with the apple and top with the rest of the dough, pressed slightly thinner. Gaps are more than acceptable. Sprinkle with the last spoon of sugar and bake for 45 minutes.Inspired by a trip to a Dorset ice cream parlour, neither the coconut nor the lime dominate, but act as brothers-in-arms. Serves 6Toast the coconut chips in a pot for a few minutes over a medium heat until fragrant and browned around the edges. Add this to the cream, coconut milk and the zest from the limes. Bring gently to a simmer.Whisk the yolks with the sugar. Pour two ladles of the hot milk mix over the eggs, whisking to loosen, and then whisk this into the rest of the milk. Continue to cook, stirring all the time, until the custard is thickened. About 4 minutes.Transfer to a bowl, still stirring, and once cool, into the fridge, preferably overnight. Sieve and add the juice of one of the limes before churning according to the instructions of your ice cream machine if you have one.

So should doctors start issuing nature-based prescriptions?After her mother’s sudden death, Catherine Kelly felt the call of the sea. She was in her 20s and had been working as a geographer in London away from her native Ireland. She spent a year in Dublin with her family, then accepted an academic position on the west coast, near Westport in County Mayo. “I thought: ‘I need to go and get my head cleared in this place, to be blown away by the wind and nature.’”Kelly bought a little house in a remote area and surfed, swam and walked a three-mile-long beach twice a day. “I guess the five or six years that I spent there on the wild Atlantic coast just healed me, really.”She didn’t understand why that might be until some years later, when she started to see scientific literature that proved what she had long felt intuitively to be true: that she felt much better by the sea. For the past eight years, Kelly has been based in Brighton, researching “outdoor wellbeing” and the therapeutic effects of nature – particularly of water.In recent years, stressed-out urbanites have been seeking refuge in green spaces, for which the proven positive impacts on physical and mental health are often cited in arguments for more inner-city parks and accessible woodlands. The benefits of “blue space” – the sea and coastline, but also rivers, lakes, canals, waterfalls, even fountains – are less well publicised, yet the science has been consistent for at least a decade: being by water is good for body and mind.Proximity to water – especially the sea – is associated with many positive measures of physical and mental wellbeing, from higher levels of vitamin D to better social relations. “Many of the processes are exactly the same as with green space – with some added benefits,” says Dr Mathew White, a senior lecturer at the University of Exeter and an environmental psychologist with BlueHealth, a programme researching the health and wellbeing benefits of blue space across 18 (mostly European) countries.An extensive 2013 study on happiness in natural environments – to White’s mind, “one of the best ever” – prompted 20,000 smartphone users to record their sense of wellbeing and their immediate environment at random intervals. Marine and coastal margins were found by some distance to be the happiest locations, with responses approximately six points higher than in a continuous urban environment. The researchers equated it to “the difference between attending an exhibition and doing housework”.Although living within 1km (0.6 miles) of the coast – and to a lesser extent, within 5km (3.1 miles) – has been associated with better general and mental health, it seems to be the propensity to visit that is key. “We find people who visit the coast, for example, at least twice weekly tend to experience better general and mental health,” says Dr Lewis Elliott, also of the University of Exeter and BlueHealth. “Some of our research suggests around two hours a week is probably beneficial, across many sectors of society.” Even sea views have been associated with better mental health.White says there are three established pathways by which the presence of water is positively related to health, wellbeing and happiness. First, there are the beneficial environmental factors typical of aquatic environments, such as less polluted air and more sunlight. Second, people who live by water tend to be more physically active – not just with water sports, but walking and cycling.Third – and this is where blue space seems to have an edge over other natural environments – water has a psychologically restorative effect. White says spending time in and around aquatic environments has consistently been shown to lead to significantly higher benefits, in inducing positive mood and reducing negative mood and stress, than green space does.People of all socioeconomic groups go to the coast to spend quality time with friends and family. Dr Sian Rees, a marine scientist at the University of Plymouth, says the coastline is Britain’s “most socially levelling environment”, whereas forests tend to be accessed by high-income earners. “It’s not seen as being elite or a special place, it’s where we just go and have fun.“By spending time in these environments, you’re getting what we call ‘health by stealth’ – enjoying the outdoors, interacting with the physical environment – and that also has some different health benefits.”Even a fountain may do. A 2010 study (of which White was lead author) found that images of built environments containing water were generally rated just as positively as those of only green space researchers suggested that the associated soundscape and the quality of light on water might be enough to have a restorative effect.Although participants rated large bodies of water higher than other aquatic environments (and “swampy areas” were rated significantly less positively), the study suggested that any water is better than none – presenting opportunities for beneficial blue space to be designed or retrofitted. “You can’t change where the coast is, but when we’re talking about translating the benefits to other types of environments, there is nothing to stop a well-designed urban fountain,” says Elliott.“People work with what they have,” says Kelly. When she lived in London, she would head for the Thames when she had a spare 10 minutes “and recalibrate”. Then, four times a year, she would go to Brighton “and the benefits would keep me going for the next few months – so I didn’t get into a place of being overwhelmed or stressed, just keeping myself topped up”.The coast does seem to be especially effective, however. White suggests this is due to the ebb and flow of the tides. He points out that rumination – focusing on negative thoughts about one’s distress – is an established factor in depression. “What we find is that spending time walking on the beach, there’s a transition towards thinking outwards towards the environment, thinking about those patterns – putting your life in perspective, if you like.”When you are sailing, surfing or swimming, says White, “you’re really in tune with natural forces there – you have to understand the motion of the wind, the movement of the water”. By being forced to concentrate on the qualities of the environment, we access a cognitive state honed over millennia. “We’re kind of getting back in touch with our historical heritage, cognitively.” Water is, quite literally, immersive.As well as an academic, Kelly is a wellness practitioner who teaches classes in “mindfulness by the sea”. She says the sea has a meditative quality – whether it is crashing or still, or you are in the water or observing from the shore. “You can immerse yourself in it, which you can’t really do with a green space. You’re present in that moment, you’re looking at something with intention, and whether that’s for two minutes or half an hour, it gives you the benefits in that moment.”In the future, she believes time in blue space will be a mainstream, formalised response. “The mental health crisis isn’t going anywhere,” she says.Rees says support for the idea of “blue” or “green” prescriptions for iniduals is growing. A “surfing for mental health” group in north Devon is one example she gives of how “nature-based interventions” can work.By working to characterise and quantify benefits, BlueHealth’s cross-disciplinary team hopes to establish how “blue infrastructure” – the coast, rivers, inland lakes – can help tackle major public health challenges such as obesity, physical inactivity and mental health disorders. A 2016 paper – which White co-authored – put the monetary value of the health benefit of engaging with the marine environment at £176m.Access provisions under the revised Marine and Coastal Access Act, which is due to be completed next year, will help, says White. But seaside communities are particularly vulnerable, imminently from seasonal fluctuations in income and environmental degradation, and, in the longer term, sea level rise and extreme weather due to climate change.Rees says that the benefits of marine environments for our wellbeing are tied to the health of those environments, and that conservation efforts need to factor in the “natural capital” of blue space in supporting our wellbeing. Kelly’s work has found a link between a sense of personal connection to the sea and environmentally friendly behaviours researchers hope that we may be more inclined to protect blue space if the health benefits are proven.“To go to the sea is synonymous with letting go,” says Kelly. “It could be lying on a beach or somebody handing you a cocktail. For somebody else, it could be a wild, empty coast. But there is this really human sense of: ‘Oh, look, there’s the sea’ – and the shoulders drop.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42c7e2c218ae02bf40a493684bd2e31438ec23a0/0_261_5603_3362/master/5603.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b109f881f5d0d217e08552f89f59c35b","title":"i was given a second chance six amazing people describe their life changes","story":"The nun who fell in love with a priest, the victim of gang crime who went to the North Pole, the wounded Iraqi teen who made a new life in America… When I think about my childhood I think of colours. The orangey-brown mud of the family home the deep, rich greens of the mountains on either side of our valley. Home was Abujna, a small village on the edge of Mosul, Iraq. Life changed when the war started in 2003. We were a little away from the fighting, but I saw planes shooting a car on the street next to our village. Two men and a woman were killed. Then famine hit and the farm could no longer provide for us. We moved to Hatra when I was 15 in order to find the money to survive.The evening of 3 August 2006 was like any other. My friends and I were playing volleyball and a crowd had gathered to cheer us on. Towards the end of the match, I noticed a small truck coming towards us. I didn’t think much of it people often drove up to watch us, and there was a place to grind wheat for flour close by. As the truck grew closer it got stuck in the sand. The driver, a man in his 50s or 60s, revved the engine heavily, and suddenly he was coming up close behind me. I jumped out of the way, as it looked as if he might crash into me. I caught his eye, he looked left and then right, and then directly at me with a smile. He pushed his hand down on the horn, and instead of honking, a whirring began.Everything went dark at that point: just the red of the fire as people and cars flew through the air like birds. I was thrown upwards with the explosion, falling back to earth through the smoke headfirst. All I could see was smoke, and the blood flowing from my nose. All I could think to do was run, but as I stood up I was hit by shrapnel in the head. I lost control of my body and collapsed. There and then I lost my sight.A few minutes later I heard my father’s voice. He was crying. I told him not to leave me else I would die. At the clinic the doctor told him I would be dead within 30 minutes. Thankfully I didn’t die, and soon my father was driving me to a hospital in downtown Mosul, a journey of 70 or 80 miles. En route we were stopped by American soldiers. I had no idea what was going on when they put a medical shot in my back, nor when I heard the sound of a helicopter approaching. I went into a coma for 12 days.When I woke up an interpreter asked my name. I told her: Qusay. She thanked God I knew it, which I didn’t understand. I had no recollection of what had happened. As soon as she mentioned the explosion everything came back to me. If the shrapnel had hit my head just one hair’s width differently I’d have lost my entire memory. That, she told me, is why she thanked God.My family assumed I’d died and were already in mourning. When my father received the call from the Americans 14 days later he didn’t believe I’d survived. He thought someone was trying to lure him towards danger. It was only when they mentioned the tattoo on my arm – my name – that he could let himself accept it.Neither Iraqi doctors nor the US soldiers had the resources to help me heal, so for the following months I struggled, to breathe, to eat, to live. I had no nose, no cheek, half my skull was missing. Then one day I was half-listening to the TV – an advert was calling for people injured by war to get in touch with Médecins Sans Frontières. I was taken to Amman, Jordan, where I spent three years rehabilitating.I live in Austin now. I’ve been here almost seven years, and soon I’ll have completed my degree at the University of Texas. I’m a refugee, a product of war, but in many ways I feel lucky. Not only am I still here, but I’ve started a new life doing things I could never have imagined. I’m hopeful about the future. If what I’ve been through has taught me anything, it is that you should take every opportunity that comes.A lot of people were surprised when I entered the convent. I can see why. While I embraced every aspect of being a nun when I joined the Sisters of Mercy, a Catholic convent in Providence, Rhode Island in 1965, aged 18, my life before might not have suggested it. I had boyfriends in high school and I liked to talk. There’s a lot of silence involved in being a nun and, of course, there are the vows: poverty, obedience and celibacy.To my mind, it was the best way to be of service to the world. My sixth-grade teacher, Sister Maura, was my inspiration. She was fair and smart. We stayed in touch as I grew older and she mentored me as I started my training.It was all very exciting at the beginning. Silence was expected for much of the day, and there were prayers, classes and chores. This was the 1960s in the United States and the Me generation was leading a revolution. I like to think becoming a nun was in its own way quite counter- cultural. After three years of living in isolation with my fellow trainees, years four and five were spent at an all-women’s college. We would stay up late on campus listening to music and talking. Asking what does it mean to be a religious woman? To be of service? To be celibate? Many of the women I started with decided life as a nun just wasn’t for them – they moved away, got married.After taking up my teaching post, I delayed taking my vows for a year or so. I wanted to make sure my decision was right. But in the end I decided to stay and commit my life to God. It was 1974, and I decided I wouldn’t marry or have children. I made my vows and that was that.And then in the fall of 1977, a new priest arrived at my local parish. By then I lived in an apartment with other sisters, and would regularly go to his church, St Mary’s. On 4 October I went to evening Mass as I often did. Frank was leading it he seemed a nice guy, certainly good- looking. Afterwards I introduced myself and we talked for a while. I became a regular at the service, half to pray and half because of him: he gave a good sermon. He valued my thoughts and opinions. We became good friends.Things carried on this way for two-and-a-half years, until 26 September 1980. I got home from work to hear Sister Maura was unwell and in hospital. I was inconsolable, not just because of her condition, but bereft that I’d never told her how much she meant to me how much I valued her that she was loved. I went to see her that night.The next day I was with Frank. We were alone together, which was unusual for us, picking apples in an orchard. I told him about Sister Maura and how heartbroken I was. Frank turned to look at me: “Kathy, that’s how I feel about you.” Less than a year later we would be married.Before then, I questioned my vows and my relationship to God. It took time, but I came to the conclusion I stick by today: being a Sister of Mercy was a gift from God, and so, too, was Frank appearing. I could take or leave either, to God it didn’t matter, because God is in the people all around us. I opted for Frank and I have not one regret. It’s 38 years since our wedding, and he’s a gift that just keeps on giving.I’ve never carried a knife or a gun. But as I know too well, that doesn’t guarantee freedom from their violence. I’ve got two stab wounds on my body I’ve been held at gunpoint on at least three occasions. That was just my life growing up on an estate in Stoke Newington, London. It was typical. One time I was walking with a friend through an estate in Tottenham and woke up waiting for an ambulance to collect me with one stab wound in my stomach and another in my chest. After that, people around me were saying we should catch up with my attackers and get them. There was pressure to get revenge. The more I heard those voices, the more I wondered if they were right. By the age of 21 I’d tried to move on from that incident. I built a moped myself from scratch. I let my brother take it out on a test drive around our area. He was pushed off it on a neighbouring estate and it was stolen. I’ve never been as angry as I was when he returned. I marched over to where I knew I’d find these guys to demand it back. I found a group of eight or nine boys busy taking it apart. I went to grab it – we got into a fight. When I looked up, a gun was pointing right at me. I pushed my brother aside and looked directly into the eyes of the holder of the weapon. “You don’t have to do this,” I said, trying to stay calm.And then he pulled the trigger. I heard the sound. Oh shit, I thought, I’ve been shot. I couldn’t feel any pain. I assumed I was just numb. He pulled the trigger again. Before the shooter could go in for a third, his friends pulled him away. As I walked the 10-minute journey home I stopped to look again for a bullet hole. Could the gun really have misfired twice? My phone was filling up with texts and calls: we’ve heard what happened, what are you going to do about it?That night I re-evaluated everything. I thought back to the kid I was in Jamaica before I moved to London when I was seven the time spent outdoors exploring in nature. I wanted to find that person again. Making decisions to fit in with the crowd just wasn’t working. I ran 10k, and completed the Three Peaks Challenge. I applied to join James Cracknell and Ben Fogle on a trip to the South Pole. I was too late I was offered the North Pole instead. I wasn’t bothered. I’m from Jamaica, man, to me they were just cold and icy. Since then I’ve circumnavigated Jamaica by kayak, run ultra-marathons and trekked across the Sinai desert.The adventures and expeditions are great – I can see the world and tell stories – but doing them also helps me show others how to live their best lives, too. I’ve been given a second, third, fourth chance. You need to seize them. As I tell everyone, you never know if you’ll get one again.It didn’t feel a big deal when Erin, my daughter, came out as bisexual. There was no moment of revelation. It wasn’t long before she set about exploring her identity, and I wanted to be there with her. We went to Cardiff Pride together in 2011 – that’s the city where she was studying. I felt so comfortable, although I didn’t think much of it at the time.There was a lot going on that year. I was about to turn 50 and my silver wedding anniversary was fast approaching. Chris, my husband, and I were already making plans, but I was sliding further and further into the abyss. I’d always been unsure in myself, ever since childhood. I’d lacked confidence. But I’d assumed as I grew older I’d feel better in myself. I was married, a mother, I worked as a teacher – a job I adored. So why was I miserable?I’d been seeing a counsellor on and off for years, and after coming home from a weekend away with my girlfriends I went to see her. I was talking about feeling down, about loving Chris – my husband – but not feeling like I was in love with him. And then I heard these words coming from my mouth, as if another person inside me was speaking: “I think I’m gay.”Where those words came from I still don’t know. The minute I said them, though, it just felt right. I felt so much lighter, so much happier. I started to tell my closest friends and each time I did a weight was lifted. Something was changing, I was emerging.And then one morning Chris stopped me in the kitchen before work. I’d been waiting for the right moment, but he could tell something was going on. I couldn’t lie to him. I went off to stay with my parents for a few days. He found it difficult, I’m pretty sure he still does. We shared a house for months after that, although I’d spend a few nights a week at a friend’s for space.I felt amazing, but also very alone. None of my friends were gay – I needed to find a community. There was a local lesbian support group so I went along. The first time I went, I stood outside the door, terrified. I don’t like social situations at the best of times, but quickly found my place.A friend told me about a woman called Sarah who she’d known forever. Sarah came out when she was 12, so we were introduced – she could show me the ropes. We’d go for coffee as friends. I’m just finding who I am, I’d tell myself. I’m not looking for a relationship. We were still officially “friends” the first time we kissed. We were hugging goodbye on the porch at her parents’ place. It just sort of happened. It felt amazing, as if I was floating. We finally admitted to each other that we were dating a few months later. Then, after a week of “staying over”, she just never went home.My second wedding day was very different to the first. When my car pulled up to the venue, Sarah was there in her wheelchair. We just looked at each other and in that moment we knew this was how it was supposed to be. We kissed and she asked if I was sure about the marriage. “I’ve never been more sure of anything in my life,” I replied.The feeling of being loved and being in love is still so special to me. I feel like the luckiest woman in the world.We only applied to be in the audience as a joke, really. My partner – now husband – and I were watching Question Time on TV. At the end, the future dates and locations popped up on the screen. They were coming to Dover, just down the road from us. It was supposed to be a laugh. The thing is, I knew people like me don’t get heard: we’re not listened to, and we’re made to feel like we don’t know enough.The previous few years hadn’t been easy. I’d left school at 16 and worked in call centres until I hit 30, and by then I had four kids and a orce. Things started to crumble when I was pregnant with number four. My employer made it impossible for me to stay in my job. At 31, I walked into a job centre for the very first time. I had no savings left I had spent everything to try to stay afloat. I couldn’t make the rent payment, I had no security. I lost all sense of self-worth. Having to tell my kids that I couldn’t afford to buy them Christmas presents will forever be painfully etched into my memory.I had never voted before the 2015 general election rolled around, but on the day I thought, “Sod it!” I voted Conservative. I believed David Cameron when he said “We’re all in it together.” I believed him when, on national television, he promised not to cut the tax credits that I relied on to survive. And then he did it anyway. I was scared and I felt so let down.Still, I had no intention of speaking when I took my seat in the studio audience. I didn’t want to embarrass myself. As the recording went on, however, the more wound up I was getting. Something just happened when Amber Rudd started speaking about bringing the country economic security. A ball of anxiety and frustration and anger came flying out of my mouth. I said I voted for her, that I believed their promises and they betrayed me.I nearly broke down. It was the first time my voice had been heard. It all just came out, live on BBC TV.The next few days were a blur: every newspaper, TV station and radio show was ringing, reporters showed up at my door. I didn’t know whether to run and hide or to embrace it, but deep inside I knew I deserved to be listened to, just like all other working-class women people who are struggling single mums. When things died down I started reading, I met with politicians from different parties. I got involved in my local Labour party. I stayed on the fringes at first while I learned to believe in myself.That’s how I ended up in a room above my local count after this year’s local elections, shaking and pacing as the ballots were totted up. I had agreed to run as a candidate to be a councillor if I was going to bemoan the lack of working-class politicians I decided I should practise what I preach. When I realised that I’d been elected I burst into tears – although I made sure the Tories didn’t see me crying.It feels so wonderful to finally feel that things I say are worth hearing. For a long time I felt worthless. Now I’m making sure I, and my local community, have a voice. I wouldn’t have believed a word of it if you’d told me all this when we applied to be in the Question Time audience. It’s bizarre how something so little ended up changing so much.There was always a joke in the family that one day I’d end up at the Royal Hospital Chelsea. We would get leaflets sent to the house once in a while, selling it: “Retire in style,” they said. One evening I threw one on the table at dinner and told Joan, my wife, and the kids that if their mum went first, that’s where I’d go. It never crossed my mind it would actually happen. When she died in 2016 it felt like my life was going into reverse. After 66 years of marriage, I wasn’t sure what would happen. We had met at a barn dance at my army camp in County Durham while we were still kids, and we’d lived all over together, before settling back with our two children in Britain. It wasn’t the first time the future looked uncertain. When I retired from the army at 40, having joined at just 15, I’d felt much the same. But with Joan by my side, I knew we would find a way through. This time I was less certain.Music had always been my passion. I’d joined the Royal Artillery Band as a drummer as a teenager. I’d sung in the choirs on troop ships to get out of other duties. When we moved to Norfolk, Joan and I had been part of our local operatic society. We did that together for 25 years. And so, while I worked out the move to Chelsea, I carried on singing. If I hadn’t I think I’d have gone barmy.Moving to the Royal Hospital Chelsea seemed to be the start of the end for me. I felt like I was living in an old folks’ home and I was morose. But after a while a new friend and I started to entertain everyone in our social club once a month after Curry Fridays. Bill would do country and western numbers, I’d take the ballads. I noticed that singing raised my spirits once again.Stepping off the stage one evening, a bloke came up to me. He’d seen that Britain’s Got Talent had opened auditions, and suggested I apply. I told him not to be silly, why would they want an old man like me?“If you don’t use it, you lose it,” he retorted. And then he dared me to, so I printed the form and sent it off.There were a few rounds of auditions before I found myself at the filmed audition in front of a packed house at the London Palladium. A harem of female family members whooped as I came on. I’m sure the scarlet coat helped people get behind me. We went for a Chinese after.My whole life has been turned upside down, again, although I’m not complaining. The Royal Variety Show is coming up this month – my aim is to sing in front of the Queen. And there’s an album coming, too, apparently. I’m the oldest person in the world ever to sign a record deal. If I was a teenager I’m sure I’d be hungry for a huge career, but I’m just enjoying it. It’s never too late, I’ve learned, to do what you love. Just a few years ago I thought everything was over, and now I’m a pop sensation!

Notices in the car park of his housing association block in Cardiff required residents to display a permit and Holden was issued with a temporary permit by the concierge while he waited for his application to be processed. The temporary permit did not pass muster with Premier Park, the company that managed the car park, and he was issued with three parking charge notices (PCNs).Over the next three years he was harassed by letters and phone calls demanding escalating sums, culminating in a court summons in October 2018. On the night before the hearing he was called by Premier Park’s legal representatives and urged to pay the £691 “debt” there and then or face an additional £1,000 in legal fees. The case was dismissed by the judge, who ruled that the terms of his lease granting him the right to park on the land overrode any rules imposed by Premier Park.That, it seemed, was it. But only briefly. Last April a letter arrived from BW Legal, a debt recovery firm acting for Premier Park. It threatened Holden with court action unless he paid the PCNs that had been dismissed in court seven months previously. In July he was informed that he was being taken to court.Holden, who survives on benefits, claims he was driven from his home by Premier Park’s conduct. He had to spend £200 to move and is issuing a counterclaim for damages from Premier Park and BW Legal.Alarmingly, his experience is not unique. In Southampton, Charlene Thompson had been pursued by Premier Park and its representatives over the same period. She had been issued with four PCNs for parking outside her flat without a permit in 2015. Since she paid a service charge for parking and her tenancy agreement did not require a permit to be displayed, she ignored them.She says part of the reason she moved home was to escape Premier Park’s operative, which is why she didn’t receive the court claim issued by the company in 2017 and missed the chance to file a defence. A default judgment was issued, which she only discovered when she noticed her credit score had plummeted. She settled the £812 within the deadline, but two years later, in July, received notice from BW Legal, acting on behalf of Premier Park, that she was once again being taken to court over two of the paid PCNs as well as three more incurred at her old address.“Premier Park is taking over my life,” she says. “I was a single mum with a baby when all this started and it was either move home or get rid of the car. The stress of having to find a new home and the money to move was the worst and now I’m faced with a mountain of paperwork for charges I paid two years ago.”The court claims against Holden and Thompson were withdrawn in July when the pair pointed out that they had already been heard. Premier Park insists it had no idea the claims had previously been to court, blaming its former lawyers for the error.Ian Lamoureux’s experience is even more outrageous. In July the Yorkshire charity manager received three letters from BW Legal, acting on behalf of the parking management firm Excel, threatening enforcement action because of unpaid county court judgments (CCJs) worth more than £800. The judgments did not exist, however. Excel had issued two court claims against him in 2016 but both had been thrown out by a judge. “Since then ExcelBW Legal have never left me alone,” he claims. “They have continued to call and send me threatening letters, culminating in these … CCJs. Shortly before the second hearing Excel issued four more court claims against me before eventually admitting an error. Shortly after the second hearing ExcelBW Legal issued yet another court claim, then discontinued the case just before it was due. I’ve had to spend hours upon hours over the last three years researching my rights and filling out court papers.”BW Legal later admitted to Lamoureux that the CCJs had been cited in error. When approached by the Observer, neither Excel nor BW Legal appeared to take responsibility.“As the matter was placed in the hands of our representatives to pursue the outstanding parking charge notices, it is not appropriate for us to comment,” a spokesperson for Excel said. “However, we are aware that our representatives, BW Legal, have dealt with issues raised by Mr Lamoureux under their complaints procedure that subsequently led to his complaint being upheld due to their error. We have nothing further to add.”In a statement to the Observer about its contact with all three drivers, BW Legal said: “BW Legal is a dual-regulated law firm who rely on the good faith of instructions received by our clients and we follow those instructions. We do not comment on inidual cases or privileged discussions with our client. All cases in which we are instructed upon go through a pre-legal process whereby a customer is contacted to discuss the matter and the options available.“We always advocate the need to discuss cases in full so that legal proceedings are not required. If customers, however, choose to ignore such correspondence and our client instructs us to issue legal proceedings, then we carry out their instructions as one would expect a solicitor to do. If customers have a cause for complaint then our full complaints process can be located on our website and we shall respond in line with the same.”Holden, Thompson and Lamoureux are victims of a business sector that is more or less self-regulating. In order to obtain registered keeper details from the DVLA, parking management firms are obliged to sign up to one of two trade bodies which operate their own codes of practice and appeals service. Premier Park is a member of the British Parking Association, which promised to investigate its handling of Holden and Thompson’s cases. Its conclusion was to replicate Premier Park’s quote to the Observer, absolving the company of all blame.It failed to comment on the fact that Premier Park refers drivers querying an PCN to a premium-rate number. Premium-rate numbers cannot legally be used for customer services, but Premier Park insisted to the Observer that its 13p-a-minute line would stand, since the cost is advertised and was “lower than many other numbers in use across the country”.The government is belatedly planning a partial crackdown on unscrupulous methods used by parking companies. The Parking (Code of Practice) Act 2019 will create a single code of practice and an independent appeals service which all operators must abide by in order to access DVLA databases. It will also cap the charges imposed on drivers who are deemed in breach of an operator’s terms and conditions. In the meantime, motorists are left at the mercy of companies who appear to ruthlessly exploit the system to boost profits and get away with it.The cost goes well beyond money. “Excel and BW Legal have admitted that the claims about the CCJs were completely false yet they are unrepentant about the effect this has had on me,” Lamoureux said. “At the time I was applying for a loan to buy a new car and feared that if it was refused because of outstanding CCJs my credit score would be further damaged. I had to wait weeks until I was sure Excel’s claim was a lie and by then the car had sold.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d831a60f2e2dca7705a7bd524b97844e467aea6/65_0_1163_698/master/1163.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca13ab2b1a49015f8fb0dcc2d61dcb86","title":"ada lovelace imagining the analytical engine review barbican london","story":"Milton Court Concert Hall, Barbican, London A tribute to the 19th-century computing pioneer revealed some fascinating processes, but the music was less rewarding‘I shall in due time be a poet,” wrote Ada Lovelace. And now she is, if having your words set to an evening’s worth of music counts, thanks to this instalment in the Barbican’s Life Rewired series, curated by composer Emily Howard.It was Charles Babbage, who, in 1837, designed the analytical engine, an unbuilt machine anticipating the first computer but it was Lovelace, a mathematician with an artist’s imagination, who could see and articulate where her colleague’s invention might lead. Lovelace is the patron saint of any composer using artificial intelligence in their work, and we heard five pieces by four such disciples here. They framed a panel discussion led by Radio 3’s Andrew McGregor, which both burnished Lovelace’s aura and debunked a few romantic myths. It was a chewy evening, offering much to think about but less in the way of musical reward – though it is to the credit of the excellent Britten Sinfonia that it was attempted at all.McGregor interviewed each composer before their piece was performed, inevitably throwing up more questions than were answered. Howard’s Ada Sketches, from 2011, imagined Lovelace slipping into trancelike song as she fed an equation through the machine. The other works, all premieres, used words from Lovelace’s letters, chopped up and crunched by algorithms, including Howard’s But Then, What Are These Numbers?, in which a succinct little song finally assembled itself out of the component parts of preceding variations.Shiva Feshareki’s Perpetual Motion disappointed, in that the electronic second movement exhaustively explored the composer’s own voice rather than the rich violin and cello overtones of the acoustic first movement. Alter, created by Robert Laidlow and colleagues at the Royal Northern College of Music’s interdisciplinary PRiSM lab, had a gratifying sense of theatrics, using an analytical engine replica as a percussion instrument, and with the soloist, the unfailingly poised mezzo-soprano Marta Fontanals-Simmons, duetting with a version of herself what was lacking was a sense of resolution. Patricia Alessandrini’s gauzy Ada’s Song used AI to manipulate the piano strings and to generate new material for Fontanals-Simmons in real time, apparently.

Hopes and fears are running high among the different tribes and, for them, any suggestion that another party might hold the key, anywhere, to a better outcome is sacrilege.As a consequence, my team and I were unsurprised that parts of the Labour twitterati went into paranoid overdrive last week, when Best for Britain dared to suggest voting Liberal Democrat in a number of seats where Labour were first or second in 2017. This was despite the site overall recommending 375 Labour candidates to just 180 Lib Dems. We were equally unsurprised to find Lib Dems suggesting that some of our analysis was wrong, and that they were able to win more than the 180 seats where we identified them as the strongest Remain force.Some of the toughest seats to call are the Labour-Liberal Democrat marginals such as Leeds North West and Bermondsey. But these areas are the exception, not the rule: voters can choose Labour or the Liberal Democrats and know they won’t help a Brexiter Conservative win. We have tried, wherever possible, to back the sitting MP with a strong voting record on Remain. One place we haven’t done this, Kensington, is because Labour is so far behind the Lib Dems that backing them could give the seat back to the Tories. In most constituencies our objective is to identify the strongest opponent to the Conservatives.While Labour has been quick to criticise, the model is more than fair to it. It has assumed Labour to be a Remain force on the same basis as the Liberal Democrats. Given that the latter is a full-throated pro-European party, and the leadership of the former has taken three years to get around to giving the public the final say, there are plenty of Remainers who accuse us of being too generous. Yet our mission is not to help any party. It is to stop Boris Johnson, stop the Brexit party, and – in turn – stop Brexit.We are not relying on ancient data from 2017. Since then, politics has been turned upside down. Both the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have new leaders Labour has changed its Brexit policy the two main parties sank to third place and fifth place at the last national election in May the Brexit party has emerged. The political landscape has been repainted with Brexit in the foreground and previous party loyalties distant dots on the horizon.To achieve accurate, up-to-the-minute recommendations, we have used a technique popular among pollsters called “multilevel regression and poststratification” – MRP for short. This method was deployed to accurately predict the election of Donald Trump, the 2017 hung parliament, and the “surprise” wins for Labour in Kensington and Canterbury that year. The MRP we have used was undertaken in the last couple of weeks, with a statistically enormous sample size of 46,000 voters. A normal national poll contacts less than 2,000 people.The party machines will inevitably rail against the parts of these conclusions they least like, while embracing parts convenient to them. Fortunately for the future of the country, the electorate is far more savvy than the political parties they vote for. This Christmas election is our last chance. Banish Johnson and Brexit from our politics for 2020 with tactical voting, or put up with both for another decade without it.Naomi Smith is chief executive of Best for Britain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a09c89d0d945abf720f9b063efce43452b32d626/0_130_726_436/master/726.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e949304e80b932627d7c0f4c56e8700","title":"alzheimers society 40 years old dementia needs more funding","story":"Forty years ago this week, Morella Kayman (then Morella Fisher) wrote to every British national newspaper to describe the eight-year nightmare she had just endured as her husband Lawrence succumbed to early onset dementia. She and her daughter, Mandy, had been left to cope with his increasing incapacitation with little help, support or advice from doctors or social services. It was a gruelling experience.After Lawrence, who had begun to develop symptoms at the age of 51, was taken into a nursing home, his wife decided that other carers of people living with dementia should not share the same experience as she had, and in her letter outlined plans to set up a society that would raise awareness, provide information for families and generate funds for research. Her plea was taken up by the Observer’s medical correspondent Christine Doyle, who wrote a feature, The Sad, Quiet Epidemic, which outlined Kayman’s plight – and her plans.It was the only press response to her letter but it produced an extraordinary reaction. Within days, Kayman – who was 45 at the time – was contacted by other people who had been considering similar projects. They connected and shared ideas from which, a few weeks later, the Alzheimer’s Society was born.The organisation has since helped transform our awareness and understanding of one of the most widespread, debilitating conditions in modern society.“Forty years ago, dementia was simply not talked about,” says Kayman. “People would ignore Lawrence or walk on by on the other side of the road rather than face him. Today, we are squaring up to the condition and are recognising its existence. And thanks to the lead the Alzheimer’s Society has given, people touched by dementia are at least provided with help and community support. I always think: thank God I picked up that pen and paper and wrote that letter.”This point was confirmed by Professor Gordon Wilcock, of the Oxford Institute of Population Ageing. He was also closely involved in the setting up of the Alzheimer’s Society (or to be precise, the Alzheimer’s Disease Society as it was known until 1999 when its name was simplified). “We have made enormous strides since 1979. At that time it took a vast effort just to get a grant of £20,000 from the NHS to run the society for its first two years,” Wilcock told the Observer.Today, the Alzheimer’s Society has a budget of more than £100m and is helping to alleviate a great deal of suffering caused by the condition. “We are also funding important biomedical research that will hopefully lead to the development of drugs and treatments that can halt or even reverse the condition,” added Wilcock. “For good measure, we put pressure on the NHS to ensure it provides proper care for patients and families, and we have played a major role in helping to remove the stigma that was once associated with dementia.”It is thought there are about 850,000 people with dementia in the UK. The vast majority have Alzheimer’s, while about 150,000 have vascular dementia. In addition, there are other less common forms, such as frontotemporal dementia. The Alzheimer’s Society exists to support people with all forms of the condition.A crucial, and cruel, feature of dementia is its impact on families and carers. As Doyle wrote, presciently, in her feature: “For close relatives and friends, the suffering is probably greater than for the victim, who is commonly unaware of his or her condition and often content in a childlike way.” There was no support for carers in 1979. Today, the impact of the disease on families and partners is well understood, and the society exists to press the NHS to provide full support. “We don’t have seamless provision of social care and medical treatment for the condition as yet but it is something that we are urgently pursuing,” said Wilcock.“We need a society in which people do not have to sell their houses to ensure they get care when they start to show symptoms of dementia but at least there is an awareness of dementia today that was lacking 40 years ago. We know what we have to do.”In addition, breakthroughs have been made in understanding the causes of Alzheimer’s, although new drugs to combat the condition remain elusive. Last week, US company Biogen revealed it was seeking regulatory approval to licence the drug aducanumab to treat early-onset Alzheimer’s. Wilcock remains cautious, pointing out that the drug had failed previous trials. “Really, we need more government commitment to the development of drugs to treat dementia. At present, it gives about £85m a year. We need three times that amount. That would bring dementia research to a level where it gets the same as cancer research. Many cancers are treatable today but people living with dementia have nothing.”This point is backed up by Kayman, who is 85 now and is still closely involved in the work of the Alzheimer’s Society. “Ultimately, we are not looking at something that will merely alleviate dementia,” she told the Observer. “We are looking for a cure.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a98370d9b0286b667335e0d81ed26324a5955b6c/0_89_5016_3010/master/5016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf3e4d8e1b8deafcb545fc7cebe29271","title":"is autism a superpower greta thunberg and others think it can be","story":"Greta Thunberg, Chris Packham, Jack Monroe and others credit their Asperger’s with giving them the focus to get things done. Here, poet, writer and ‘autist’ Joanne Limburg wonders if the condition has helped her, tooWhen I heard Greta Thunberg say that being different was a superpower, I had to replay her saying it. Several times. I was diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome at 42 and, seven years on, I’m still far from sure what that means. Are those of us with autistic spectrum conditions disabled or different? Are we, by definition, deficient human beings, or are there compensations that come with our condition? Are there any circumstances in which autism could be considered, not merely an acceptable difference, but a superpower?Thunberg’s comment some two months ago was her robust response to commentators who had sought to use her Asperger’s to discredit her, claiming she must be a nave puppet and calling her a “weirdo” with a “monotone voice”. She wrote: “I have Asperger’s and that means I’m sometimes a bit different from the norm. And – given the right circumstances – being different is a superpower. #aspiepower.”As a fellow autist, I find myself stuck in the middle of these two incompatible views: on the one hand, autistic people are disturbed, naïve iniduals who are incapable of knowing their own minds or speaking credibly on the other, autistic people are superhumans with a preternatural ability to see the truth of things and to articulate it without equivocation. The world would be better without us the world would be lost without us.Food writer and campaigner Jack Monroe, too, has written that learning to harness her own autistic traits has enabled her to see them “as a kind of superpower”. Novelist Katherine May is more ambiguous: “My autism brings some things I really value – the flood of words I experience, the ability to fixate on a subject and burrow deep into it, and an intense relationship with the natural world. But there are other bits I’d get rid of. I break things and hurt myself all the time and I hate the way that I don’t remember faces and so come across as rude.”Charlotte Moore, who has written about bringing up two autistic sons with high support needs, told me: “I don’t see my sons’ autism as a disability, exactly. In the right environment, they can (and mainly do) lead happy, healthy lives. So I prefer the word ‘difference’ to ‘disability’.” She continued: “Can autism be a superpower? Probably, yes, in a few cases – some autistic people do have extreme abilities – but the popular belief that all autistic people are really geniuses isn’t helpful to parents or carers struggling with autistic people with no speech and self-harming behaviours, meltdowns or sensory overload.”When I received my own diagnosis, I wanted to find out what it meant. I learned that Asperger’s syndrome is a controversial condition, sometimes set apart from other forms of autism. Since 2013 it has no longer been recognised as a stand-alone diagnosis in the United States, now falling under the umbrella term autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but it still is in the UK.The opposing views of autism – disability or difference – may owe their origins to two different models of autism outlined by two different psychiatrists. On the one hand, there is Leo Kanner’s autism, first described in the US in the late 1940s. It is characterised by repetitive movement, little or no speech and high support needs. On the other hand, there is Asperger’s syndrome, named after Hans Asperger, the child psychologist and eugenicist who published the first definition of the condition in 1944, describing the children he encountered in his clinic in wartime Vienna as “little professors”. He famously said: “It seems that for success in science and art, a dash of autism is essential.”Although Asperger’s syndrome is no longer recognised in the United States, there are people who have grown up with it as their identity and they are sticking with it. Others have abandoned it in favour of the broader ASD. Controversy over Hans Asperger’s possible involvement in the Nazis’ eugenics programme led some to drop the term. Many, like me, use autism and Asperger’s interchangeably. I usually define myself as “autistic”, because I don’t recognise any essential difference between myself and non-speaking autistic people.I tried to figure out what autism might explain in my own life, including some of its negative aspects. I’d had long experience of depression, anxiety and OCD. Had they arisen directly from a glitchy abnormal brain? Had they come about as a response to the adverse life experiences that accompany any difference, or might hypothetical non-autistic me have had them, too? And what about the more positive aspects? Would non-autistic me ever have had the focus or determination to persevere in the financially insecure, isolating, all-consuming business of writing?I have always loved words and books. At the age of three, I would take my whole library to bed with me. My mother described me as a “not very childish” child, who preferred to talk to adults rather than other children. When I was nine, a teacher read a poem I’d written to the class, and I decided then and there to be a writer. That was a rare happy moment at primary school. Like many parents of autistic children, my parents found themselves with a child that mainstream education refused to accommodate. Their solution (not one open to everybody) was to re-mortgage the house and send me to private school. For my parents, my autism, literally, came at a great cost.If I picture myself at Thunberg’s age, I see certain similarities. I was idealistic, passionate about what I believed, blunt in the expression of my ideas. I was uninterested in makeup or any other aspect of what my mother called “making the best of myself”. I was a vegetarian, because two years earlier Morrissey had said that meat was murder. I didn’t go in much for what people think of as normal teenage socialising. Instead, I pursued my own interests – and I pursued them single-mindedly.My passions were writing, the Beatles and feminism. I read my way through the Women’s Studies section of Edgware Library, and passed The Female Eunuch round the sixth form at my all-girls’ school, to raise the consciousness of the sisterhood. I announced to my mother that I was not going to go to university, because to do so would only mean following a patriarchal curriculum. Mum told me to stop being so silly. I went to university, but I took Greer and De Beauvoir with me.So that was how I was 33 years ago: intellectually curious, idealistic and articulate. I could even be funny sometimes, but I was also intense and sullen, with few social graces. Asperger’s wasn’t available to me as a diagnosis in the 1980s, but people found other words for me. They said “moody” and “difficult’ or “thinks too much”. I still find it painfully difficult to maintain a conversation with more than one or two people at once. I have to overcome a wagon-load of inertia in order to clean my teeth, wash and dress. On a bad day, it seems to me that everything I have managed to do as an adult – earn money, find a partner, raise a child – has only been possible because I have learned to suppress my autism.But that’s not to say I see no advantages. Like Greta Thunberg and the comedian Hannah Gadsby, I find public speaking easier than casual conversation. In her brilliant Ted talk, Gadsby asks how she can be so good at something – talking – she knows she is so bad at. The answer is that standup has none of the pitfalls conversation brings for autistic people. When she is on stage, Gadsby does not have to listen as well as speak, she does not have to figure out how to respond to what she hears, she does not have to do all the exhausting parallel processing that an autistic person has to consciously engage in during everyday conversation. She has figured out what she wants to say and she can just say it, without distraction or interruption. Perfect.And I can add from personal experience, that when you have to perform almost every time you interact, performing in front of 1,000 people isn’t very different to performing in front of three. To a non-autistic person, who finds conversation easy but public speaking unnerving, this may well look like a superpower.Another trait that we have on our side is the intensity of focus with which we pursue our passions. Chris Packham, naturalist and environmentalist and ambassador for the National Autistic Society, explained how the strength of his sensory response to the world around him enables him to “engage with the natural world with greater clarity and ease”. Packham said that from an early age, he could “see things which others couldn’t in nature”. There is a third trait associated with Asperger’s syndrome that Packham shares with Thunberg and which makes them both such effective activists. It is a certain moral single-mindedness, sometimes pathologised as “rigidity of thought”, but at other times framed more positively as “a strong sense of justice”. Thunberg has spoken of her ability to see things “in black and white” – for her, this is not rigidity, but clarity. Autistic people, in general, feel the pull of the truth more powerfully than we do the pull of fitting in. We are not inclined to accept reassurance that has no facts behind it.Sometimes I do pretend to accept it. I’ve changed since I was a teenager: softened, become more pragmatic. It makes me easier to get on with, but when I watch Thunberg, I wonder what I might have done if I hadn’t spent so much energy learning how to smile when I talked.I asked Steve Silberman, author of NeuroTribes: the Legacy of Autism and the Future of Neuroersity, whether he agreed with Thunberg. “Autism,” he said, “is a disability that can have advantages in the right situation, and with the right support. Greta’s intense focus and disregard for others’ opinions of her are ‘superpowers’ in that they help her ignore the fossil-fuel industry’s lies, take on the facts of climate change, and organise her peers to change the world.”Perhaps we can change the world, if we don’t let it change us too much. Packham has suggested that: “Humanity has prospered because of people with autistic traits. Without them, we wouldn’t have put a man on the Moon or be running software programmes. If we wiped out all the autistic people on the planet, I don’t know how much longer the human race would last.”At the same time, there are some autistic people who see no advantage in it, and would gladly take a cure. There are some parents so desperate to believe in a cure that they put their faith in bogus treatments, sometimes with terrible consequences.So, what do I have – a disability or a difference? I asked developmental psychologist Professor Uta Frith the question: “Both points of view are valid and should be respected,” she told me. “We might avoid confusion by iding the spectrum into subgroups, but where the boundaries would be is far from clear. We need more research to tell us what autism really is.” There’s no telling where the boundaries are between a person’s autism and the autistic person. As far as I can tell, everything I am, I am autistically. If you took the autism away you would take me with it. And, regardless of whether autistic people have superpowers or not, when the world gives us the support we need, we thrive, and give the best of ourselves in return. You’ve not seen the best of us yet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24c97919430a94e5aafefa9ae660e6b471afa1d3/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af2a627dba62780a579362cd37a0fe49","title":"tories announce end benefit freeze move criticised cynical","story":"Government confirms policy will end in April, but Labour says ‘nobody will be fooled’The benefits freeze will end in April, the government has confirmed in what Labour said was a “cynically timed announcement”.It said the end to the freeze, which was introduced by the Tory former chancellor George Osborne, would cost £5bn a year.The shadow work and pensions secretary, Margaret Greenwood, said: “Nobody will be fooled by this cynically timed announcement, which even now will leave the benefits freeze in place until next April. Harsh, punitive Conservative policies like the benefits freeze, the two-child limit and the five-week wait have created a society where people are being forced to turn to food banks in ever-increasing numbers just to survive.“Labour will abolish the benefits freeze, scrap universal credit and put an end to the two-child limit. We will ensure that our social security system genuinely protects people from poverty as it should.”The work and pensions secretary, Thérèse Coffey, said: “We’re clear the best way for people to improve their lives is through work, but we know some people require additional support.“Our balanced fiscal approach has built a strong economy, with 3.6 million more people in work since 2010. And it’s that strong economy which allows us to bolster the welfare safety net by increasing benefit payments for working-age claimants now.”The Resolution Foundation thinktank said the announcement was a missed opportunity. Its senior economic analyst Adam Corlett said: “The benefit freeze was always due to end next year. The government’s confirmation that working-age benefits will only keep pace with rising prices means there will be no increase in living standards, and those in need of extra support will continue to be left behind.“With child poverty at risk of hitting record highs, this is a missed opportunity to provide a much-needed boost for low- to middle-income families.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba7f5254bddf39ed836c205d9a437aa7e9606c52/239_203_3181_1910/master/3181.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb8f2a669b435a2c6c87c7b26f91d928","title":"england south africa fans preview world cup final","story":"The two sets of supporters are ready for the Rugby World Cup final on Saturday – when they will both be on the bacon butties“I’ve been supporting England since I was 11 and remember cheering the World Cup win in 2003. I’m optimistic it will happen again on Saturday, when I’ll be up at the crack of dawn to drive to Surrey to watch the game with my dad as per our tradition. I couldn’t think of anyone better to watch it with – he’s so invested in England rugby matches that he’ll yell, curse and roar. His enthusiasm is infectious sometimes I’m louder than he is! My mum isn’t a rugby fan, but she’s always brilliant – supplying us with sausage sandwiches and putting up with our swearing.England need to maintain the brilliant form they showed against Australia and New Zealand. Both teams are going to go for broke and we need to be careful not to lapse into some of the sloppiness we’ve been prone to in the past. But Eddie Jones and his team are surely on the case, so I’m not too worried. Lucy Eldridge, 27, Oxford“I went to Japan for one of the England games and was blown away by the hospitality of the people. The Japanese were hi-fiving me in the streets because I was wearing an England jersey. The only low was the typhoon. I was in Tokyo as it approached and could feel the dread in the air. On Saturday, I’ll be watching at home with my rugby teammates and some close friends, wearing an England jersey with a Japanese beer in hand. Elliot Daly and Billy Vunipola are due a stormer. I hope this is the game in which they cement their names in English rugby history. Aravin Kumar, 26, Singapore“I’ve been getting up early on Saturdays to watch the rugby with my dad at our rugby club with bacon sandwiches and hot chocolate. Last Saturday we had a whole day of rugby. We watched the finals then went to Harlequins because my team Haywards Heath Under 10s were doing a guard of honour thing at the Stoop. I’ve enjoyed watching all of it and on Saturday, my teammates and I will be watching the game at our club on the big screen. My advice to the England team is to tackle hard, run fast and score lots of tries. Rosa McDonald, nine, Haywards HeathIt was been a thrilling experience. My family and I found a South African-run pub, the Percy Arms in Chilworth, which draws a large crowd of South Africans. I find watching the game at a pub with lots of fans makes it all the more enjoyable and exciting. You feed off the energy of other supporters. South Africa’s first game was a disappointing loss and left me feeling surprisingly low (still hopeful, however) but I love how rugby elicits such strong emotions. No matter what the score, it brings everyone together – even opposing sides!We’ll be watching the final with a number of fellow South Africans at the pub, bacon butty and beer in hand. South Africa really needs this win. With our first black captain and the most culturally erse team we’ve ever had, South Africans everywhere could use this to unite as a nation. This would go far in blurring racial lines that still form a ide in our country. England have done so well this World Cup. If they win, they will truly deserve it, but we won’t go down without a serious fight.If South Africa are to win, we need to focus on keeping our strong defence lines intact. England are a strong team and are going to make this a tough game. We need to keep as much possession as possible and ensure we don’t drop the ball – in all senses of the word. Shannon O’Farrell, a South Africa fan in GuildfordIt’s been a very exciting World Cup. I’m so glad for Japan. It’s going to be one cracker of a game on Saturday. Both teams are so strong physically. I can’t wait for the final. I’m having a braai (barbecue) at my brother’s house next to the swimming pool and a big TV outside. All four of my brothers will be there and we will be going big with outfits and flags, all the necessary stuff. We will open the first can of beer at 9am, two hours before kick-off. The Springboks need to play wisely with their physicality and dominate England up front. The rest will fall in place. Enjoy the game. May the best team win. Anton Wessels, Johannesburg“I’m very excited about how South Africa have progressed. The low was losing to New Zealand after camping in their half for 20 minutes and only getting three points for their efforts. On a high happy, they made the final and were made to work hard for it by Wales which has prepared them for the final.The difference between teams is basically nothing but England may have peaked a week too early. We have not seen the best of this South Africa team. If they click on Saturday, England are in for a torrid time.I shall be watching with my brother as I can scream at his house as his wife is a Springbok supporter. South Africa will have to play it in the forwards with their power and domination of being very physical and in England’s faces. Their backs can also be devastating, especially Makazole Mapimpi and Cheslin Kolbe. If given the chance, Damian De Alande and Pollard can be dangerous. They must just stay calm and focused.” David Lichtenstein, South Africa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58a9144a9ded4bd66b2704d48d1c9920ef91b1c1/0_235_4092_2455/master/4092.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dbd423ba90ca6df9d02f5b2f1fa0d422","title":"lewis hamilton max verstappen valtteri bottas us grand prix qualifying","story":"• Verstappen forced on to grass while attempting to pass Briton• Valtteri Bottas takes pole for Sunday’s US Grand PrixHe is almost certain to be celebrating after the race, but Lewis Hamilton had an underwhelming qualifying session for the United States Grand Prix, finishing in fifth position after a near-miss with Max Verstappen.There was a close encounter at turn 19 in Q2 between Verstappen and Hamilton, who had engaged in a war of words via the media after their collision at the start of the Mexico Grand Prix last week, with Hamilton complaining of the threat of being “torpedoed” by the aggressive style of the Red Bull driver and Verstappen accusing him of being “disrespectful”.Verstappen was forced on to the grass as he tried to pass Hamilton, who was himself seeking to overtake the Toro Rosso of Daniil Kvyat. Stewards decided the incident was not worthy of investigation, though there was a hint of disdain when Verstappen was asked about it.“We were all lining up to do our lap, to get to the last corner,” he said. “We were slowing down to make space and Lewis just drove by like nobody was there and didn’t care and I said, ‘well, if you don’t care I don’t care, I’ll get my position back’,” he added, admitting that it was “a close call”.Hamilton downplayed the moment. “Just nothing, nothing,” he said. “There’s no rules and regulations that say you have to stay in single file. I kept going and then he started to try and race me.”Hamilton’s Mercedes teammate, Valtteri Bottas, secured pole on Saturday with a lap time of 1.32.029, just ahead of Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel and Verstappen. This season’s poles leader, Charles Leclerc, was fourth. He had to change to a used engine after an oil leak in his Ferrari in the third practice session.Hamilton was 0.292 seconds slower than Bottas. The Finn is the only driver who can still deny Hamilton his sixth drivers’ championship, though the gap is so vast with only three races left that it would take a miracle to catch him. Bottas would have to win Sunday’s race, with Hamilton finishing outside the top eight, to keep the championship mathematically alive.“From what I know of him, he’s going to be there fighting hard. He always wants to win like all of us. He’s leading the championship with a big margin, he doesn’t need many points. I’m sure he’d like to win the championship in a nice way,” Bottas said. “I’ll try to delay that.”Hamilton complained about the track on Friday, saying it made him feel ill during the first practice session and he had to have a lie down to recover. “It was the bumpiest track by far that I have ever been on – I had such a headache,” he said.The 34-year-old had secured pole in the past three races in Austin, where he routinely dominates. But his most recent pole this season came at the German Grand Prix in July.“Nothing to do with the car, just me,” Hamilton told Sky F1. “I just didn’t pull the laps out together today and clearly the car had the capability to be on the front row and I just didn’t do it today. It’s my fault.”Another Briton, though, had cause to feel satisfied with his day’s work. Lando Norris, 19, who is 12th in the standings in his rookie Formula One season, was fastest in Q1 in his McLaren and ultimately qualified in eighth, one place behind his teammate, Carlos Sainz Jr.Zak Brown, McLaren’s chief executive, is optimistic that the rule changes announced last Thursday that will come into effect in the 2021 season will make his team more competitive as they seek to close the gap on the big three of Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull. Technical alterations should slow cars by around three seconds per lap, race weekends will be condensed from four days to three and there will be a budget cap of $175m (about £135m per team per year (assuming a 21-race calendar).“I think it’s great we’ve got clarity now on ’21, I think it’s exciting, we’re going to run at the budget cap,” Brown said. “We are, and the shareholders are, committed to getting back to winning world championships.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35219eaefc5c8733f792a727db55b0aeb703c16d/0_128_4162_2497/master/4162.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8bb0a4f1d4737c0bdd29714b236449f4","title":"canelo alvarez flattens sergey kovalev in 11th to become four weight champion","story":"Canelo Álvarez used a big punch to beat a big fighter.Álvarez landed a left-right late in the 11th round Saturday night, dropping Sergey Kovalev to the canvas and ending their light heavyweight title fight. Kovalev was left on his knees, his arms draped over the middle ring rope as the fight was stopped at 2:15 of the round.It was a dramatic finish for a fight that had little drama up to the knockdown. Kovalev was more than holding his own late in the fight and hadn’t been hurt when Álvarez landed the left followed by a right.The Mexican great, who moved up two weight classes, won his fourth title in as many weights. He celebrated by kissing the glove on his right hand as Kovalev’s handlers jumped into the ring to see if their fighter was OK.The punch was one Álvarez had been looking for the entire fight, stalking Kovalev while taking a lot of jabs and right hands to the face.Both fighters fought cautiously for the most part, with Kovalev content to use his jab from long distance and Álvarez looking to land hooks to the body. The crowd at the MGM Grand booed on several occasions, unhappy with the lack of action.Álvarez was a 4-1 favorite despite moving up two weight classes to fight for a piece of Kovalev’s 175lbs title. He took the fight against Kovalev rather than a third fight with Gennadiy Golovkin as part of a $365m deal he signed with the streaming service DAZN.Both fighters took naps in their dressing rooms as they waited some 90 minutes from the last undercard bout before entering the ring. The delay was for DAZN, which wanted to wait until the UFC card in New York was finished before the fight began.Fans at the MGM Grand Garden Arena watched the UFC main event on big screens in the arena while the fighters waited.Kovalev controlled the distance early with his jab, sticking it in Álvarez’s face as he plodded ahead with gloves held high looking for an opening on the inside. Álvarez threw punches sparingly, winging a few big punches that missed as Álvarez came back with jabs and an occasional right hand.But Álvarez began finding the range with his left hook in the middle rounds, working Kovalev’s body and trying to wear him down. He kept advancing with gloves held close to his face, putting pressure on his bigger opponent."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22dd579815622fa3db3778e070fed18506609a80/0_108_4337_2602/master/4337.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9eb25c107cefa6aa17f421e0ffa39dc8","title":"tennis wta finals ashleigh barty v elina svitolina final live","story":"Second set: Ashleigh Barty 6-4 *4-2 Elina Svitolina: That was pretty dire from Elina Svitolina. She seemed to be heading for another hold at 30-15, but then she threw in a couple of tentative errors followed by her first double fault of the match on break point. She is feeling the pressure and the world number one won’t hesitate to punish her.Svitolina’s British coach Andrew Bettles was on-court at the last changeover and he offered her plenty of encouragement:Second set: Ashleigh Barty 6-4 3-2* Elina Svitolina: Barty consolidates the break back with a slick, quick love hold. After some great serving from the Aussie, she’s back in the lead.Second set: Ashleigh Barty 6-4 *2-2 Elina Svitolina: Barty breaks straight back. With Svitolina cruising up 30-0, the Aussie played three stunning points in succession to break straight back. Her slice is working wonders and her forehand is backing it up incredibly. That concentration lapse could have dragged on for a while but Barty’s resilience has been so impressive this year.Second set: Ashleigh Barty 6-4 1-2* Elina Svitolina: And here’s the biggest challenge of facing Svitolina. Barty has played great so far, but she just suffered a short lapse in concentration here, throwing in a couple of loose, bad errors followed by a double fault on break point. Suddenly, Svitolina is up a break and flying.Second set: Ashleigh Barty 6-4 *1-1 Elina Svitolina: Very good work from Svitolina to break Barty’s run of 3 successive games. The Aussie put a lot of pressure on her throughout, but Svitolina found a big forehands at 30-30, then a service winner at deuce. Finally, a missed return from Barty brought them level.It’s difficult to overstate how impressive that set was from Barty. She served well, was patient with her aggression throughout and was creative whenever she could be, throwing in the odd dropshot and net foray to keep Svitolina guessing. Svitolina served great until that final game. She has to find her first serve on the important points.Barty: 19 winners and 18 unforced errors.Svitolina: 6 winners and 6 unforced errors fromSecond set: Ashleigh Barty 6-4 1-0* Elina Svitolina: Barty opens the second set as she finished the first, serving well and finding her forehand whenever she can.First set: Ashleigh Barty 6-4 Elina Svitolina: Ashleigh Barty takes the first set! That was some impressive resilience. Barty moved up 0-30 with two solid returns, but then threw in a couple of routine errors. It seemed like she had missed her chance at 40-30, but she kept on attacking and slotted two forehand winners to bring up set point.Barty missed a forehand on her first set point, then Svitolina slotted a passing shot past her on the second. Finally, Barty stepped in on Svitolina’s second serve and snapped a forehand return winner to take the first set. That was a brilliant set of tennis.First set: Ashleigh Barty 5-4* Elina Svitolina: The service games are getting tighter now and Barty saves break point to secure a great hold. Barty led 40-30, but then Svitolina, who is just flying around the court now, played two incredible defensive points to eventually force a couple of errors and bring up break point.A costly netted forehand from Svitolina on the break point, but Barty earnt that hold with some great serving when needed. On her fourth game point, Barty came to the net after a brilliant low slice and sealed the hold with an easy volley.First set: Ashleigh Barty *4-4 Elina Svitolina: Svitolina holds, but goodness, that was tight. Barty constructed a lovely point to force 30-30, stroking a crosscourt forehand followed by an angled dropshot. But at 30-30, Barty missed an easy forehand return. On game point, Barty moved forward behind a great slice and had a smash to finish the point, but Svitolina chased down every last ball until Barty relented with an error. As you can see, so much of this match will be on Barty’s racquet.First set: Ashleigh Barty 4-3* Elina Svitolina: Barty looked to be speeding through another service game at 40-0, only for Svitolina to peg her back to 40-30 after a sizzling backhand down the line winner and a great return. No matter. Barty crushed a crosscourt forehand, moved to the net and played an absolutely glorious angled backhand volley to hold. She has come to play.First set: Ashleigh Barty *3-3 Elina Svitolina: Svitolina levels with another confident hold. More good serving and some proactivity as well: She absolutely crunched a backhand down the line at 30-0 and attempted a decent dropshot at 40-0, only for Barty to come up with a peach of an angled slice backhand. After a loose forehand from Barty, we’re level again.First set: Ashleigh Barty 3-2* Elina Svitolina: Another solid hold for Barty, who continues to serve well and is finding her serve and forehand 1-2 punch very early on. A shanked forehand error from Svitolina moves the number one ahead again.First set: Ashleigh Barty *2-2 Elina Svitolina: A very good hold for Svitolina. It was sealed with another great unreturned serve, but it contained some of our first proper extended rallies. On the opening point, Barty patiently waited for a forehand and then slipped a forehand winner down the line. But Svitolina won the following two, her defence and hustle eventually forcing errors from Barty. That’s the challenge. How consistently can Barty put the ball past her?First set: Ashleigh Barty 2-1* Elina Svitolina: Both players are serving extremely well early on. Barty slams down three unreturned serves to slam the door shut on her second game with little fanfare.First set: Ashleigh Barty *1-1 Elina Svitolina: Elina Svitolina served a mindblowing 16 aces against Bencic in the first round and she opens her account with two aces and an easy love hold. Game on.First set: Ashleigh Barty 1-0* Elina Svitolina: Barty begins with a very solid first game and ample first serves. Barty made her intentions clear on the very first point by moving forward to the net. She missed the simple backhand volley but it was a message: she will be the aggressorSo, who will win?This is a tough, tough match-up for Barty because of Svitolina’s steadiness and her refusal to offer Barty any pace. Even when she is on the run and dragged far off the court, Svitolina constantly produces quality, deep shots to reset the point. Svitolina’s backhand is extremely solid, which means that she has no problem returning Barty’s kick serve and patiently dealing with her barrage of low slices.Barty will have to attack with patience and look to open up the court with angles and width. She will probably hit fewer deep backhand slices than she did against Pliskova and she should really move forward to finish points at the net when she can. These slow courts do not play into Barty’s hands at all, but she has made it this far, so we’ll see what the world number one is made of today.Hello! Welcome to our coverage of the final showdown at the WTA Finals, where Ashleigh Barty and Elina Svitolina are the last women standing, both literally and figuratively, on the final day of another long season.We have an excellent final in store and one that also serves as a reminder of just how long this year has been. Svitolina won their only meeting in 2019 7-6(8) 5-7 6-4 at Indian Wells in March, a battle that lasted 3 hours 12 minutes. It feels so long ago and Barty’s life has transformed since they last played. Svitolina leads Barty 5-0 but clearly the gap in this match-up is narrowing. Now that Barty is number one and Roland Garros champion, we’ll see if she can close the rest.Svitolina arrives into the final having used these slow courts to her advantage throughout the week, grinding down her opponents and forcing them to hit through her immense defence. The first person to consistently do so was Belinda Bencic in their semi-finals yesterday, and that was the first time Svitolina looked truly vulnerable, but eventually those long rallies ground Bencic down and she was forced to withdraw.Barty has mostly been great this week. It’s difficult to forget the absolutely bizarre sight of her failing to find the court for an hour against Bertens in her second match and collapsing from a set and break lead. But it seems to have been nothing more than a blip. Otherwise, she has shown her impressive (and improving) competitive skills, recovering from a set down against Bencic and then Pliskova yesterday. She faces one of the best match players on the WTA today and she will probably need those skills again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/791367d1f965680b32dec327b89de8cd12a16632/0_226_3592_2154/master/3592.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5669e067668225930cf66b36379576ba","title":"facebook politics republicans right","story":"Company has been accused of pro-Republican bias, in both policy and personnel, amid fears it could be broken up if a Democrat wins in 2020Facebook has been accused of pro-Republican bias, in both policy and personnel, amid fears at the company that it could be broken up if a Democrat wins the White House next year.Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg faced fierce criticism this week, first for including Breitbart – once described by former chairman Steve Bannon as a “platform for the ‘alt-right’” – in its list of trusted sources for Facebook News, then for refusing to ban or factcheck political advertising.Zuckerberg is also locked in a high-profile battle with the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, a leading contender for the Democratic nomination in 2020 who has vowed to regulate big tech companies because they stifle competition and wield too much influence.Although the social media giants are based in liberal California and often accused of anti-conservative bias, observers note that Facebook has recruited former Republican operatives in senior positions and is bound to put self-interest above anything else.David Brock, founder and chairman of Media Matters for America, a progressive media watchdog, said: “Mark Zuckerberg continues to kowtow to the right and rightwing criticism. It began when he met with a bunch of rightwingers in May 2016 and then Facebook changed its algorithm policies and we saw a lot of fake news as a result.“I think there’s a consistent pattern of Zuckerberg and the Breitbart issue is the most recent one where the right is able to make false claims of conservative bias on Facebook and then he bends over backwards to accommodate that criticism.”Brock, a former conservative journalist turned Democratic operative, added: “I think there’s also the issue of a cluster of conservative Republican operatives who are running the policy shops at Facebook, which just compounds the problem. That you’ve got the major senior players all coming out of Republican politics is not great for the perception of fairness that Facebook should be trying to project.”The Republican strain in Facebook was highlighted in a recent edition of the Popular Information newsletter, which stated that the top three leaders in the company’s Washington office are veteran party operatives. “Facebook’s DC office ensures that the company’s content policies meet the approval of Republicans in Congress,” Popular Information said.Joel Kaplan, vice-president of global public policy at Facebook, manages the company’s relationships with policymakers around the world. A former law clerk to archconservative justice Antonin Scalia on the supreme court, he served as deputy chief of staff for policy under former president George W Bush from 2006 to 2009, joining Facebook two years later.Warren noted on Twitter this week: “Since he was hired, Facebook spent over $71 million on lobbying—nearly 100 times what it had spent before Kaplan joined.”In one telling incident last year, Kaplan sat behind Brett Kavanaugh, who had been accused of sexual assault, during his bitterly isive supreme court nomination hearing, prompting an angry backlash from Facebook staff. According to the New York Times, Kaplan wrote to them: “I want to apologize. I recognize this moment is a deeply painful one – internally and externally.”Yet he still threw a celebratory party for Kavanaugh once he was confirmed.Kaplan has reportedly advocated for rightwing sites such as Breitbart and the Daily Caller, which earlier this year became a partner in Facebook’s factchecking program. Founded by Fox News’s Tucker Carlson, the Daily Caller is pro-Trump, anti-immigrant and widely criticised for the way it reported on a fake nude photo of the Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.Facebook’s Washington headquarters also includes Kevin Martin, vice-president of US public policy and former chairman, under Bush, of the Federal Communications Commission – where a congressional report said his “heavy-handed, opaque and non-collegial management style … created distrust, suspicion and turmoil”. He has forcefully spoken out against proposals to break up Facebook.Katie Harbath, the company’s public policy director for global elections, led digital strategy for Rudy Giuliani’s 2008 presidential campaign and the Republican National Committee. She has been the principal defender of the company’s decision to allow political adverts, even those including blatantly misleading claims, a move that earned a sharp rebuke from the screenwriter Aaron Sorkin among others and put it at odds with Twitter, which announced this week that it will refuse such ads.Brock said: “I think Twitter did the right thing here and the only solution, really, is to do what Twitter did, but Facebook is in the opposing camp there.”Facebook’s failure to filter out far-right hate speech and misinformation is a running controversy. Its decision to include Breitbart in its news tab’s algorithmic selections was widely condemned. In another report, Popular Information said it uncovered a network of 14 big Facebook pages that, violating the company’s rules, pretend to be independent but exclusively promote content from the conservative site the Daily Wire, which it described as “a cesspool of misogyny, bigotry, and misinformation”.Several Democrats have raised the prospect of regulating Facebook, with Warren the most outspoken. The senator has said she would nominate regulators to unwind anti-competitive mergers such as its deals for WhatsApp and Instagram. Last month she mocked the Facebook’s failure to factcheck politicians by running ads containing the false claim that Zuckerberg is endorsing Trump’s re-election.Warren’s ascent in the polls has set off alarm bells at Facebook. In a leaked audio recording last month, Zuckerberg could be heard telling employees: “But look, at the end of the day, if someone’s going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.”Critics suggest that he therefore sees currying favor with Republicans who, for all their suspicion of big tech companies, are generally against regulation, as an act of self-preservation. There are fears that, four years after Trump exploited Facebook to get elected, the platform might again tilt in his favor.Zuckerberg “has to be worried about what happens to Facebook if there’s a Democratic president”, Brock added. “I don’t think the answer to that is the way he’s behaving because all he’s doing is riling up Democratic opposition to Facebook policies, so I’m not sure what the logic is catering to the conservatives if he’s scared of Democratic regulation.”But for the Facebook founder, who has reportedly held a series of meetings with Republican politicians and conservative commentators, it might be a case of be careful what you wish for. The president’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, wrote an opinion column for the Hill website in September entitled Free speech suppression online builds case to break up Big Tech. Josh Hawley, a Republican senator, is an outspoken critic of Silicon Valley.Conversely, Facebook is hardly a political monolith. Hundreds of staff signed a letter to Zuckerberg and other leaders denouncing the decision to allow political ads containing falsehoods. Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer, told Vanity Fair’s New Establishment summit last month: “I imagine I will support a Democratic nominee. I have spoken for many years about my desire for my daughter and yours to see a woman as president.”Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute, argued that Zuckerberg and Sandberg are reckless “authoritarians” who helped get Jair Bolsonaro elected in Brazil and will do whatever it takes to preserve their power. “I don’t see why Facebook book wouldn’t give Trump a massive, unlimited donation to get him re-elected. Who would even be able to find out whether they did that?”But Stoller, author of Goliath: The Hundred Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy, added: “I’m not saying that they are just for Republicans. I think that they are as likely to try to destroy Josh Hawley or to try to promote Kamala Harris or Pete Buttigieg or other candidates they like as they are to help Trump.“They’re authoritarians. They don’t care particularly about which party is in charge.”Facebook’s Washington office did not respond to a request for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b49d99d32384f17c76b25781b7de5b90072b9b26/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1612350bca954e35f7ebed6623ae4f64","title":"a week in uk politics outlandish claims and dizzying spins","story":"Securing an election was a confusing business, so let’s just remind ourselves how we got here. A week ago the Conservatives wanted an election, but Labour, who had been demanding an election, opposed an election. The Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National party had agreed they didn’t want an election, but then said they did want an election three days before the Tories wanted an election. But the Tories wouldn’t have an election then, and anyway, some Lib Dems and SNP MPs started to worry about having an election. But none of that mattered because Labour, having not wanted an election, decided it did want one after all. Got it?This election is a huge strategic error by the Tories. Or Labour. Maybe both? What we can say for sure is, at least one of them has definitely made a terrible mistake – we just don’t know who or why. But don’t worry. After the results come in, various panels of experts will tell us why this was the obvious and – yes – inevitable outcome.Departures. Lots of them. There are some political heavyweights leaving the Commons such as Ken Clarke, Oliver Letwin and Amber Rudd. Yet there are some lesser lights also calling it a day. In unrelated news, David Tredinnick, the Tory MP for Bosworth, is stepping down. Tredinnick is best known for advocating the use of astrology to take the pressure off the NHS (he’s a Capricorn they have a wacky sense of humour). His interest in homeopathy also saw colleagues dub him the “honourable member for Holland \u0026amp Barrett”. Will we see his like again? The sun in Scorpio suggests ... hopefully not.Plaid Cymru is off to a flyer in the mad pledges stakes. With the Welsh rugby team dumped out of the World Cup by South Africa, the party said Wales “would be more likely to win” the competition under a Plaid government. The plan appears to have something to do with grassroots investment, but holding a breakaway competition and only involving countries that start with “W” may be more effective.With blue collar voters seen as key to the Tories’ chances of success, Johnson did his best “man of the people” impression by launching his election campaign from the back of a chauffeur-driven car. Next up, Jacob Rees Mogg is due to demonstrate the government’s plan for the arts by making his nanny and butler act out the final scene of Shakespeare’s Henry IV Part I. Who says this lot aren’t the vox populi?In a case of entirely convenient mass amnesia, we will all forget how pollsters misread the last election, the referendum before that and the election before that. Polls will be pored over, tweeted, gasped at and declared key moments. Then there will be a surprise result. Can’t wait for the inquiry.With the Cumbrian town identified by a thinktank as a key battleground, pity the voters of Workington as they’re stopped during a Christmas shopping trip by gaggles of journalists, desperately asking them if Labour’s latest announcement on regional development banks has tipped the seat back in Jeremy Corbyn’s favour. They just want to get the last walking Buzz Lightyear in stock, people. Have some pity!Johnson is up, completing the opening week with a double-digit lead. But the NHS was a hot topic, giving Labour hope. Having precipitated the election, the Lib Dems are battling to ensure it doesn’t become a two-horse race.

Really?), I have yearned for more of an adrenaline rush. And so it came to pass, thanks to The Young Offenders, the hit Irish comedy whose second series is airing on BBC Three. Two bonehead bicycle thieves cheated death as they outpedalled gardaí through a Cork shopping centre. Have you cycled in a mask down an up escalator while coppers shout futile curses from outside Dorothy Perkins? Me neither, but it’s going on the bucket list.You have probably heard of the Derry Girls, but what about the Cork boys? Conor and Jock are just as creatively foul-mouthed, and boast the most stupefyingly stupid pudding basin haircuts since Henry V disputed the field of Agincourt. If criminal teens’ haircuts are indicators of IQ, and in my unresearched opinion they are, these two make Ardal O’Hanlon’s Father Dougal brainier than Leo Varadkar.The episode opens with the bike chase – a Young Offenders hallmark – before we flash back and find out exactly why Conor and Jock are on the run. Cut to the pair casing a bike rack outside the police station before the chase. The boys had spotted a gap in the thievery market. “Gardaí never lock their bikes because they don’t think there’s anyone stupid enough to steal their bikes,” said Jock. “Except us,” replied Conor, proudly. “Exactly,” said Jock. Plus, they had a theory that if they wore male and female masks and walked very slowly towards the bikes in gaudy and probably flammable athleisure wear, their archenemy, Sgt Healy, wouldn’t spot them. Which proved to be obvious nonsense.The crime rate is clearly negligible in Cork since the whole force seemed to turn out to thwart the two herberts. Or maybe the garda – raised to venerate the bicycle through reading Samuel Beckett and Flann O’Brien – have zero tolerance for cycle-related shenanigans.In the opening episode of series two, Jock is tasked by his other archenemy, Principal Walsh, with looking after an egg for 30 days without breaking it. Principal Walsh is not just Jock and Conor’s headteacher but the angry father of Siobhan, who is pregnant. What makes Principal Walsh angry is that Jock is the child’s father – understandably angry, given that Jock is a teenage rampage of a ne’er-do-well, and not prepared for the responsibility of fatherhood. But then again, who is? “If I could go back and cock-block my own cock,” Jock observes philosophically when asked to hold someone else’s baby, “I would, because being a dad is for dickheads.” Jock, mate, you’d only been asked to change a nappy.If you can’t return the egg unscathed after 30 days, Walsh tells Jock, then you will surrender the child to me and Mrs Walsh. I don’t know how things work in Cork, but you would have thought social services aren’t keen on determining adoption claims by means of egg-based wagers. And you’d have thought Siobhan would have something to say about the matter, too.Happily, Jock comes round. He names the egg Jock Jr, and takes a keen interest in it. Later, he turns up at hospital for Siobhan’s scan. “It’s a girl!” discloses the radiographer. “You got a problem with that!” snarls Siobhan at her bedside beau, as his face shows disappointment he wasn’t fathering a little approximation of himself. “A smaller version of you? Loving this baby is going to be easy,” he replies sweetly.That said, Jock isn’t quite as sensible as that sounds. In another scene, he gives advice to Conor on how to proceed with Linda, who had arranged a tryst in Principal Walsh’s office and plans to deploy air freshener to dispel postcoital fragrance. What you need is foreplay, Jock explained while Conor looked on in awe at his mate’s superior wisdom. But what is foreplay? Let’s just put it this way: the second part involves taking your clothes off slowly like a stripper, and the third dictates you talk about your penis so as not to scare your sex partner. What rubbish. I’ve tried both and neither works.Peter Foott’s RTÉ sitcom is a delightful, if coarse, rites-of-passage thing, and a lovely corrective for someone like me who hitherto knew of Cork chiefly through Elizabeth Bowen novels.But questions remain. In the scene in which Conor’s mum, Mairéad, is looking after a friend’s baby, how does it happen that the little fella, from a recumbent position mind you, spurts a jet of urine straight into Conor’s face? Is this because Cork babies have superhuman muscle control and mastery of flow direction denied to adults? What’s more, if you do have sex in a headteacher’s office, especially if the event is broadcast to the whole school because one of you sat on the PA button, doesn’t that usually mean some form of punishment is in order? But St Finan’s community school, like so much of the world depicted in The Young Offenders, is clearly operating according to its own charmingly barmy rules – and is all the better for it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a62bc630fd0f7c9d0f704be2ac135be8321636c7/0_293_5315_3189/master/5315.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f66bb3e2a9cce4a3ab1b8b8b93b78bd6","title":"berlin wall 30 years on five german writers assess bernhard schlink franck geissler ohler","story":"Thirty years ago, the people of Berlin brought down the wall that had cut through their city since 1961. Here five writers, from both sides of the ide, recall those heady days and assess their legacyHeike Geissler was born in 1977 in Riesa in the former German Democratic Republic. She is the author of four novels, most recently Seasonal Associate, a highly acclaimed fictionalised account of a period she spent working in an Amazon warehouse in Leipzig.Oh, it’s all so long ago, isn’t it? When the wall came down I was 12 years old and crazy about belongings and about the world. I was embarrassed about coming from the GDR. I was embarrassed about going into shops in West Germany and being a grey and dark-blue complex of drab timidity amidst all the colours. With my first western money I bought myself a neon-coloured rucksack and a cassette recorder. I was already more colourful when I travelled with my mother in a packed train to Oberhausen in West Germany to see the acquaintances who had for years been sending us parcels for feast days and birthdays. I ate yoghurt for the first time, and liked it, and I draped myself in colours. Autumn colours were chic at the time: purple, ochre, etc.Maybe I’d just lost interest in politics. If only I knew. At any rate Ernst Thälmann (the leader of the Communist Party who was later shot in Buchenwald) had recently been my hero, I’d wanted to be like him, and I’d thought about how he had managed to fashion a little inkwell with the bread that a prison warder had given him, fill it with milk and thus have a source of invisible ink that he could eat straight away if he had to. I wondered about that, and a moment later I wondered what it would be like to live with Martin Lee Gore (of synth-pop band Depeche Mode). I papered my room with posters of him, I dreamt about him, I was, even though I wasn’t quite a grown-up, Martin Lee Gore’s wife.You probably didn’t know that before, but now you do. What I didn’t know for a long time: I was a torment to my parents, because capitalism now gripped me as firmly by the hand as the Pioneer Organisation had done before. As soon as it was there I was its willing talking doll, its passionate advocate, and I was right at the front of the queue of people buying and coveting consumer goods. I appropriated externals as if nothing else existed, and spent all my time observing who had what, and who had more, and established without much difficulty that we had less. To be precise, that was how things had seemed to me even before the wall came down, but now the differences were getting bigger. I couldn’t see what was being lost. I’ve only come to see it recently. I could see only what I didn’t have, and I was busy making demands and seeing those demands become reality. I never made any political demands, so for example I never complained in a public place about the new and much more visible distribution of money and opportunities instead all my demands were made on my parents.So I think I spent the years of growth after the fall of the GDR shopping. I barely knew how to do anything else but seek out those swiftly erected tent constructions full of cardboard boxes that contained all kinds of wonderful and desirable-looking cheap clothes, and later the new branches of large chains, afternoon after afternoon, and looking, wanting, buying. In retrospect I hold my hand up in front of my nose, because it smells of smoke. I remember that the nearby block where the Vietnamese guest-workers lived was said to be on fire. It’s clear in my memory that the fire had been started deliberately. I see people running, I see the excitement, I sense it, but perhaps it wasn’t even on fire, I’m not sure. But I remember very clearly that something was on fire somewhere for a while.Forgive me, I wanted to talk about my behaviour as a consumer and how it changed, but I got distracted.Forgive me again. I worked out that I didn’t want to say anything more about my behaviour as a consumer, because what is there to say about it that you yourself haven’t known for ages? So for the first few years after the fall of the wall I became a master at falling into every single consumer trap put in my way, over and over again. I am, and perhaps you need to know this, the child of determined players of the lottery. What we lived on, what fed us, was the hope of a big win, never the hope of political change. I am the daughter of a mother who rationalised herself out of her own job in 1992 whether out of negligence or honesty or both, I’m not sure. I am the daughter of a father who dreamt of reaching the age of retirement years before he actually retired. I see my father sitting in the living-room in the morning. The living room in this low-rise on the edge of the forest looks like a diorama with a set that could have been made for a post-wall museum: Father (38) on short time sitting silently in his armchair. The armchair is turned towards the television. The television is off. There is no sound in the living-room. The father is the silent type anyway. The daughter stands on the edge of the diorama, between the dining area and the corridor, looking at the father her mouth is half-open and she is dreaming about the world, and secretly of being a global star, although nothing came of it.I’m a writer, I was born in the former GDR, I live in the state of Saxony, notorious for its strong rightwing scene. You could describe me as an east German, but I place no value on that, I’m not comfortable with the term, and I’m not trying to become comfortable with it either. When I think east German and at the same time think west German, I immediately think about how my country was sold off piecemeal, about how lives were devalued, about how conversations were curtailed, and I think about solutions other than the unification of the two German states. Solutions which were discussed, which could have happened and which, from the perspective of the present day – when for example all needs can be satisfied with a small amount of money and when pretty much all properties are sold and all districts gentrified – seem more exciting and worthwhile than the status quo, which everybody I know finds extremely tiring. The term east German triggers unpleasant memories about my own greed, about GDR citizens’ desire for the Deutschmark, and their urging towards the unification of the two German states. It’s a phrase that also conjures up injustices. I’m thinking about west Germans who were eloquently and jovially able to impress, who occupied lucrative positions and transferred to us structures from their own country which I was unable to examine and question at the time. (As I said, I only ever thought about consumption.) I think about articles that still forget to mention the existence of the GDR or just mention it in self-justificatory sub-clauses to do their duty. I think of imperfection, repression and miscommunication. But I don’t want to describe myself as an east German because I think that would mean getting involved in a competition for media attention and helping to set one past against another. Emotional though it might sound, what’s needed is exchange rather than boundaries, so while I may have been a citizen of the GDR I’m not prepared to become an east German. I’m a German, because my passport tells me so. That’s label and challenge enough. Translated by Shaun WhitesideMaxim Leo, 49, is a screenwriter, author and journalist.

His memoir, Red Love: The Story of an East German Family, won the European Book prize.Germans like anniversaries they give such a clear shape to history. At these times you can simplify complicated things a bit, smooth out the contradictions. The GDR, which repeatedly comes back to life on these dates, long ago became a kind of museum country. These days hardly anybody wants to know what the East German state was really like instead the same stories are told over and over again, about very brave civil rights activists or very nasty Stasi people. Normal people seldom appear in these stories, and the German Democratic Republic has long since rigidified into a historical caricature.For their part, east Germans stopped explaining themselves ages go. Sometimes they still point out hesitantly that it didn’t rain all the time even in the GDR, that even under a dictatorship people were able to fall in love. That a genuinely normal life was possible even in a non-normal country. But then people in the west start wailing that the dictatorship is being played down, the GDR is being nostalgically transformed. So east Germans fall silent again, because what’s the point?I myself always feel bad on these big anniversaries, because I can’t help remembering the student from Düsseldorf that I met at my first party in west Berlin shortly after the fall of the wall. I had just bought a Billy bookcase at Ikea with my DM100 welcome money. When I was assembling the shelves I’d accidently hit my thumb with the hammer. My thumbnail was brown and swollen. At the party the student from Düsseldorf asked me what had happened to my thumb. I told him that in school in the GDR they hit you on the thumb with a hammer if you didn’t do your homework. And because I forgot my homework a lot, after 10 years of torture my thumb was pretty much beyond saving.The student gave me a look full of surprise and pity. He would probably have believed me if I’d told him that pupils with bad marks were shot at the end of the school year. For those young west Germans the GDR was so completely wicked anything was imaginable. I wanted to confess that evening, tell the student I’d been talking nonsense, but we lost sight of each other and I never saw him again. Since then, every anniversary, I imagine the student from Düsseldorf, years later, telling his children about that strange east Berliner with the battered thumb, that torture victim of the rogue East German state. So I’m not entirely innocent when it comes to the fact that the GDR only exists nowadays as a horror version of itself.Also regular as clockwork on the anniversary come the reports about the state of German unity. And each time there’s a huge sense of disappointment because east Germans are still so different. So strange, so ungrateful, so hard to train. East Germans vote for the right, they don’t like foreigners, they don’t believe in God, they eat a lot of meat and hardly have any children, but they do have a higher than average amount of sex. Worst are east German men, who are seen as left behind, frustrated, aggressive, uneducated, racist, homeless, wifeless. Has there, since Gollum from Lord of the Rings, been an uglier creature than the east German man?I write these lines as an aggrieved party. I’ve been an east German man since I was born. And I’m often asked to appear as crown witness particularly on anniversaries I’m supposed to explain myself and my odd compatriots. Last week a woman called me up from the radio. She said she’d like to do an interview. With me as an east German. “Perhaps you could give us a bit of an introduction to some of the peculiarities of east Germans,” she said. It sounded as if I was a native of Papua New Guinea.A few days earlier, Deutsche Welle radio had given me a call, as had a paper from Munich and a French radio station. They all urgently need east Germans for the big anniversary. “As witty as possible”, “as original as possible”, “with a wink, you know, Mr Leo”. That’s the new trend in the GDR history business. A few years ago people in the west only wanted to hear sad stories now the tales have to be funny. No problem. Over the years I’ve become a professional east German. If people want Stasi, I give them Stasi. And if people want to laugh, I’ll keep chucking those funny stories at them until the earth shakes.I hadn’t planned to be a professional east German. You might say I just slipped into it. There was a great need for east German stories and, to be honest, I needed the money. Ten years ago, at the last big anniversary, I had written a book about my East German family. I did a reading tour and, after many evenings in the west German provinces, I was lying in bed in the Intercity Hotel in Celle one night, thinking about how damned ironic history is: who would have expected the GDR, of all places, to involve so much world travel?Recently, incidentally, I’ve felt very close to the British, because so many people are disappointed by the British right now, and no one really understands the British any more. I have an idea: how about the British split from Northern Ireland and unify with east Germany instead? I see a lot of parallels and advantages there. But let’s talk about that some other time, when we’ve got a bit of peace and quiet. Translated by Shaun WhitesideBernhard Schlink is a writer, lawyer and academic.

A few days later I was in Berlin – history was being made here, and I wanted to be part of it.East Berliners were out and about in West Berlin, easy to spot thanks to their cars, their clothes, the way they inspected shop displays, the bananas and oranges in their shopping bags. At the border, the East German Volkspolizei were friendly, in contrast to their earlier attitude, and in East Berlin I could walk into Humboldt University without going through the security check that had previously been obligatory. Otherwise people did what they always do they went to work, did their shopping, sat in cafés. History is everyday life.But that November everyday life was light-hearted and cheerful. Rather than the low grey clouds that usually hang above the city in November, the sun was shining. Grumpy Berliners smiled. East and West Berliners exchanged greetings. The Volkspolizei were not just friendly, they were glad that they finally could be friendly. The first days, the first weeks after the fall of the wall, were a German-German love-fest. East and West Germans were curious about each other, intrigued by each other, talked to each other, delighted in each other. Anything seemed possible – journeying to new worlds, embarking on new careers, beginning new relationships. Would we reinvent Germany?I had always known that the ision of Germany would pass. I was the son of a Protestant pastor, and Protestant eastern Germany, the land of Luther and Bach and Zinzendorf, was my Germany just as much as the Catholic Rhineland was. In the 1960s I studied in West Berlin, had friends in East Berlin and went there regularly until I helped my girlfriend escape from East to West and risked arrest and imprisonment if I set foot in East Berlin again. When the relationship between the Federal Republic and the GDR normalised and I could once again travel there safely, I drove with my son through the East German cities and landscapes, poorer and greyer than their West German counterparts, sometimes in a lamentable state, but sometimes with a touching simplicity too – and, unlike West Germany, not ravaged by brutalist architecture and colourful advertising. We encountered the older Germany that could still be found there in those days and now no longer exists.When I came back from Berlin to Bonn, where I was professor of public law at the university, I received an enquiry about teaching in East Berlin. One of my colleagues knew a colleague at Humboldt University and had the impression they were looking for a visiting professor from the West now that the wall had fallen. He couldn’t take it on himself, for he couldn’t stand the winter air in East Berlin, where lignite was used for heating. I didn’t hesitate for a moment, travelled back to Berlin to introduce myself at Humboldt University, realised that they didn’t really want anyone from the West, but thought that they were supposed to, and I settled for that.That was how I ended up teaching a class on fundamental rights and another on constitutional theory in January 1990 as the first visiting professor from the Federal Republic of Germany to teach at Humboldt University. After the second session, a colleague invited me to participate as an expert in deliberations to draft a new constitution for the GDR. Over the next two months, I shared the hopes involved in drafting the new constitution. It was intended to be a free, constitutional, democratic underpinning for the GDR that would preserve the legacy of the peaceful revolution, allowing the GDR to enter into reunification negotiations with self-assurance and confidence. It was meant to be a contribution to reinventing Germany. In March, however, after the first and last free elections in the GDR, it was clear that reunification would come so quickly that plans to develop a new GDR constitution were already obsolete.In March, the love-fest between the two Germanies also drew to a close. The economic problems involved in reunification became apparent. Switching from life under socialism to life in a capitalist system was not easy for many East Germans, and it became clear that their experiences and knowledge were unappreciated, while the penalties imposed on those who had spied for the State Security Service affected both those who deserved them and those who did not. Advisers and visitors from the West were nicknamed “Besserwessis” (a pun on “Besserwisser”, the German term for “know-it-alls”) many of them were convinced that they did indeed know better and treated the East Germans as annoying, impoverished, helpless relatives. The wounds inflicted in that period have still not fully healed.We did not reinvent Germany. We did not even reinvent Humboldt University, as we had hoped we would in 1990 and 1991 it has become a German university like any other. Many things have become more difficult in Germany. Often Germans from the new federal states in the east and the old federal states in the west act as if there were an awkward distance between them, reacting to their differences as if they were annoying rather than a blessing. But I have confidence in the future. Great gifts change your life and cannot just blithely be chalked up as a turn for the better you need to get to grips with them. It remains a great gift that Germany is reunited, a gift I delight in over and over again – when I cycle through the Brandenburg Gate to Humboldt University, when I travel through Brandenburg, go hiking in the Elbe Sandstone Mountains or see the sun rise over the Baltic Sea in Rügen. Bernhard SchlinkNorman Ohler was born in 1970 in the west German town of Zweibrücken. He is the author of three novels and two novellas and co-wrote Wim Wenders’s film Palermo Shooting. His bestselling non-fiction book, Blitzed, about the surprising reliance on drugs of the Nazi hierarchy, was translated into 18 languages. Ohler lives in Berlin.It was the moment everything changed, and I became a writer.Before then it had still been the 80s, the cold war, and it was clearly always going to be like that: the wall, which was after all a wall in people’s heads too, would never fall, and I, a politicised teenager at the time, was going to be a journalist – I would furiously attack the state of things in the progressive media: the propaganda, the cold war…The result of Schabowski’s confusion was that immediately after the end of the conference – when he did finally call it a day – hundreds of thousands of people in Berlin went out and knocked down the wall that same night. A Kafkaesque momentum had been set in motion, and this time it wasn’t lack of freedom that revealed itself, as usually happens in bureaucratic processes, but a fairytale breach that opened up.At that moment I was 800km away in the small West German town where I was born, but I did have access to a car, and the next morning I called in at my grammar school to announce that I was taking the day off, sped up the autobahn and, seven hours later, reached Berlin just in time.It was already getting dark as I climbed up on to one of those platforms that still stood around from before, from which West Germans would look over the wall into the east. Over there, everywhere I looked, a GDR soldier was kneeling on the wall and iding the sections with a jackhammer – total rock’n’roll as well as an anticipation of techno – before a bulldozer came, with a kind of claw, to tear the segments inidually out of the earth with military precision and then drive off with them somewhere at the back to dump them on the scrapheap of history. As each passageway was opened up it immediately filled with people who flowed in from east to west, and suddenly a young woman of 18 or so (the same age as me) was standing next to me, asking excitedly what was over there. “Well, East Berlin,” I replied, surprised, but she said she knew that already, she was from there, in fact, she had asked the question in a much bigger context. That was my first encounter with an East Berliner, and with her words she tore away something inside me that continues to define my life today.It’s this idea of possibility. This transformation of hollow phrase and hackneyed term into a magically charged space – the change, for me personally, from journalist to writer and poet. The 90s began on that day, 9 November 1989, thanks to the inattentiveness of one police officer. The whole of world history was changed by a poetic moment at a press conference that was actually designed to exclude such moments. Since then anything has seemed possible to me, and my first three novels, about global revolution, the metropolises of New York, Johannesburg and indeed Berlin, emerged from the big bang that atomised the Berlin Wall. The fall of the wall gave Germany an incredible, positive boost, because for so many people who experienced it, myself included, it was a source of kinetic energy that they lived off for many years.Of course that energy dissipated in the end, and we are now back in a situation in Europe in which we no longer have a warm welcome for refugees who manage to get over its walls, we no longer want to learn from them. Instead Europe has slipped into a xenophobic rigidity that wants separation rather than unification. So we need new collective experiences that will give us back the strength that the politicians – as privileged people who can travel freely – have systematically tried to steal from us. We need people in the streets who will physically work for change. It wasn’t capitalism that won in the fall of the Berlin Wall, but a human need for freedom. Our future is much too precious to be left to politicians and their empty words. Translated by Shaun WhitesideJulia Franck is the author of five novels including The Blind Side of the Heart, a family drama set in postwar Germany, which won the German book prize and sold over a million copies in Germany alone. She was born in East Berlin in 1970 and still lives and writes in the city.All I know of Germany is a small fragment: Berlin. Thanks to the curiosity of a lot of people from far away, and the hopes and dreams they brought with them, over the past 30 years this city has rapidly changed and internationalised like no other in Germany. Of all major European cities, Berlin is perhaps not only the youngest, but the one with a thousand broken bones the craziest one, the one with the most tangible and visible scars left by wars and culture. It is like a poor, beautiful woman, dressed up and wearing makeup, but squalid and scruffy – she needs visitors, tourists and lovers to keep her going with their fantasies and money. Whether you seek a retreat into ascetic silence or anonymity, or the passionate thrill of nightlife – anything is possible here. Though Berlin’s economy lies idle, tourism and foreign investors have cranked up the property market to unreachable heights. Berliners scarcely have jobs, pensions or savings that would make life in the city viable in the long term. But Berlin belongs to visionaries, dreamers and inidualists from all over the place who either bring money with them or struggle, modestly and ambitiously, to survive in their particular niches. Students and artists get by, enriching the city with their inexhaustible creativity and self-exploitation, living hand to mouth while working on their concert or video or 1,000-page novel.Our family lived barely four kilometres from the west, with only the Spree and the wall, with its threat of deadly punishment in between. When the wall was built in 1961 and sealed with orders to shoot on sight, my uncle, 18 at the time, killed himself. In 1972, my 21-year-old aunt fled to the west in an empty fuel tanker. My single mother made her first application for an exit visa in 1974. After a ban on employment and various other kinds of chicanery, her application – for herself and her daughters, four of them at the time – was finally authorised in 1978. The five of us lived for almost nine months in a single room in Marienfelde refugee camp in west Berlin, the destination for all eastern European cold war refugees. It was a long time, even after we were granted asylum, before we felt properly integrated. The camp still exists, and has been used often in the 30 years since the fall of the wall: in the early 1990s, for emigrants from the former Soviet Union and Poland, later for war refugees from the Balkans and other parts of eastern Europe, and today for refugees from Syria and south-east Europe. In 2014 there was a surge of violence in the camp, when about 100 Muslim Chechens beat up 30 Syrian Christians. The situation in camps, with people of different origin, religion and perspective, is never easy. Yet the countless people who have come to Germany from all corners of the planet over the past 30 years have enriched it hugely.In the east, many people’s careers and lives were badly affected by the fall of the wall. Whole regions of the former GDR lie abandoned, because so many went to the west in search of work. While most west Germans were able to look forward to the legacy of their economic-miracle parents, hardly anyone in east inherits anything – they didn’t have private property or an economic miracle there. Instead they had ship of the state – familiar from all dictatorships – whose watchful eye encouraged an attitude of entitlement and immaturity. Anyone who supported the system, anyone who worked for the Party or the Stasi, could make a career inside the system without making any great sacrifice in terms of time or intellect, and be sure of being provided for through their entire lives. With that security gone, there is no cushion for the economic downturn in the east. Such social and economic fissures, and the different forms they assume in east and west, make many people, particularly in the east, feel like the losers and victims of reunification. In the last elections people, having lost faith in both democracy and government, turned their backs on the big political parties and vented their defiance as Wutbürger – furious citizens. That should be taken as an alarm signal. These people who feel left behind radicalise themselves inidually or flee to politically extreme parties. Their fear of the future finds expression in rage and hatred at “fake news”, the government and immigration. Today some Germans in both east and west see reunification as a mistake.Berlin, though, as a formerly ided city, occupies a special place in all this. Here we see a growth in the Prekariat – those with little purchasing power, who live a precarious existence on the poverty line. The sort of people who come to Berlin are looking more to pursue their independent social, creative or political vision than for promises of security and financial gain. “You can’t want to incur losses?” said my first and last financial adviser, to which I replied: “Yes, that’s exactly what I want and have to do.” My €5,000 shares were now worth only half that, but I had to pay my rent, I’d missed out on a job and I needed to finish a book."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Taoiseach criticised for singling out migrants from Albania and Georgia in interview\u0026lsquoInitial estimate to refurbish the GPO is prohibitively expensive,\u0026rsquo An Post saysEx-president also criticises Pope John Paul teaching and bishop\u0026rsquos yoga commentsStatus yellow rainfall alert issued amid expected downpours this weekendGarda\u0026iacute are investigating incident in Cork city that left woman with life-changing injuriesUUP under pressure to agree reciprocal arrangement in North BelfastDr Richard Clarke, who has been outspoken on a range of issues, announces retirement\u0026lsquoWe are one family, the disappeared now, we have all toiled to find these other bodies\u0026rsquoOne man (24) arrested at the scene following west Dublin drugs seizureYoung Fine Gael says party should contest British election and take Westminster seats if successfulDefendant previously given suspended sentence for possessing drugs for sale or supply, court hears\u0026lsquoThe bus lanes are currently at capacity,\u0026rsquo local authority saysLocal people say they are living in \u0026lsquoconstant fear\u0026rsquo due to volume of traffic next to hospital siteSheila O\u0026rsquoLeary shared the unique distinction with the former Taoiseach Garret FitzGeraldIncident occured at Newtown Cross near AshbourneLorry drivers on Scotland-Northern Ireland ferry flummoxed about customs checks planDoctor staffing has \u0026lsquoconsequences\u0026rsquo for patient care, says director generalWomen in Dublin emergency accommodation as move postponed over protestD\u0026uacuten Laoghaire-Rathdown council argued land not being put to most productive useBritish police issue appeal to Hughes brothers to hand themselves in"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4070811.1572707439!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"future use of gpo in doubt as staff face possible permanent relocation","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLast refurbished in 1985, the GPO on O’Connell Street, Dublin  is no longer a ‘healthy or appropriate’ work environment, An Post says. Photograph: Crispin RodwellThe An Post staff have been told they will move from the GPO “temporarily or permanently” by the end of next year, raising questions over the future of the historic O’Connell Street premises.In an internal email, chief executive David McRedmond said the building is in need of major refurbishment, while its lease is due to run out “in a relatively short time”. “The initial estimate to refurbish the GPO is prohibitively expensive, even if spread over say 15 years, and requires cash up front which we simply don’t have for this purpose,” he said. A formal process will begin to examine alternative headquarters with a decision expected by the end of the year. Last refurbished in 1985, the building is no longer a “healthy or appropriate” work environment, Mr McRedmond said. Nor is it conducive to modern work practices “essential for An Post to compete in a new digitally driven and environmentally conscious world”. While last month’s communication, seen by The , does not hint at any final decision, it makes a strong case for the unsuitability of the 200-year-old structure.“The expert advice about remaining in the GPO while it is being refurbished ranges from extremely difficult to impossible,” Mr McRedmond said. “A refurbishment is not just about partitioning and decoration but requires extensive mechanical and engineering works and replacement of the building’s core infrastructure including heating, wiring and plumbing.”Such an overhaul is estimated to require years of work, he explained, adding that he would “not countenance” asking staff to remain in situ.“We will have to move out of the GPO either temporarily or permanently to develop a new HQ,” with relocation targeted for the end of 2020. Staff were consulted during the summer as to their views. The majority expressed a desire to remain at the north inner-city premises and a preference to do so during refurbishment works. Whatever happens, it is likely any alternative HQ would remain in the city centre with most staff living on the north side of Dublin and using public transport. Members of the Communications Workers Union (CWU) have expressed concerns about the issue with the majority wishing to remain in the GPO. A circular to members said its position is that no agreement is in place to accommodate a move and that discussions with management are ongoing. Aside from union difficulties, any suggestions of major change at the GPO is bound to raise concerns - the central staging post for the 1916 Rising, it is one of the most revered monuments to contemporary Irish history. However, when the issue of a possible relocation was first mooted in August, 2018, Mr McRedmond said wherever its headquarters may end up, the retail post office, parcel hall and visitor centre “would likely remain” in place.

Eighty years later, and the effect is still breathtaking. MGM’s legendary musical adaptation of L Frank Baum’s children’s book, nominated for six Academy Awards, not only cemented Garland’s early stardom, but continues to transport those both young and old to a world where imagination is the only limit.Most memorable track: “Somewhere Over the Rainbow”Madonna, The Beatles, Nirvana, and The Police found themselves transported to the streets of 1900s Montmartre for Baz Luhrmann’s jukebox musical. Yet, as giddy and eclectic as Luhrmann’s directorial approach may be – making him one of Hollywood’s most unique creative forces – Moulin Rouge!’s doomed love story of a penniless writer (Ewan McGregor) and a courtesan (Nicole Kidman) is still grounded in the same sweeping romanticism that fuels the classic operas from which Luhrmann took his inspiration, including La traviata and La bohème.320 Singin\u0027 in the Rain (1952)Hollywood has (and will forever remain) in love with itself, but no other single film has ever quite shared that joy with audiences in the way Singin’ in the Rain does. A light-hearted parody of the industry’s transition from silent film to sound, MGM struck gold with its stars Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds, and Donald O’Connor. All three play off each other with both spirit and wit, while demonstrating unmatched technical ability: from the delightful tap routine of “Good Morning”, O’Connor’s pratfalls in “Make ‘Em Laugh”, to Kelly’s now iconic umbrella dance.Most memorable track: “Singin’ in the Rain”It’s a tough decision to determine which of the 10 musicals Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers co-starred in represents the very best of their work. The dance team are responsible for some of the most graceful, accomplished routines ever captured on film – and there’s no denying they made a perfect pair. As Katharine Hepburn is said to have noted: “He gives her class and she gives him sex appeal.” Yet, it’s Top Hat that remains their most fondly remembered collaboration, as a screwball romance of mistaken identities plays out across a series of glamorous locales in London and Venice.Most memorable track:  “Cheek to Cheek”520 Cabin in the Sky (1943)Cabin in the Sky has a complex legacy, and it’s difficult to judge how exactly it should be remembered. On the one hand, it’s a radical work, as a rare example of a musical with an all-black cast produced during Hollywood’s Golden Age. Although it was released by MGM and even nominated for an Oscar, the film was banned in several US cities on its release. However, as the product of a major Hollywood studio in the 1940s, the film is guilty of troubling racial stereotyping in its depiction of folksy, childlike black characters. Although this must be taken into account, the film remains a major part of film history, especially as it provides an opportunity to see some of the greatest black performers of the era – including Ethel Waters, Lena Horne and Louis Armstrong – in one place. It was also the debut film of Vincente Minnelli, who went on to direct the likes of Gigi (1958) and An American in Paris (1951).620 An American in Paris (1951)The height of class and elegance, An American in Paris rises to the top of MGM’s crop of musicals thanks to its George Gershwin score and its unforgettable 17-minute ballet sequence, which cost almost half a million dollars to film. Imagined as a fevered daydream of the film’s main character, Jerry (Gene Kelly), the sequence is a riot of colour and twirling skirts, as Jerry and his love (Leslie Caron’s Lise) traverse across a series of theatrical sets, each stylised to evoke a famous French painter. La La Land’s epilogue sequence is a direct reference to the film.720 The Sound of Music (1965)The third highest-grossing film of all time (when adjusted for inflation), Robert Wise’s adaptation of the stage musical has remained a source of great comfort over the decades. Drawing from the true story of the von Trapp family, who escaped Nazi-invaded Europe to continue their musical career in the United States, the film allows us to believe, even momentarily, in a world where kindness, joy and optimism is all that’s needed to shield us from the evils of the world, as exemplified by Maria (Julie Andrews) herself.Most memorable track:  “The Sound of Music”This wasn’t simply William Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet reheated for a new generation. West Side Story injected new blood into one of our greatest tragedies, exposing how relevant the story remained in a decade as ided as the 1960s, when America faced conflicts both on a global scale, in the Cold War, and at home, with continuing racial tensions within the US. As the Jets, the white American gang, and the Sharks, the Puerto Rican gang, fight for control of their New York neighbourhood, two lovers cross the battle lines to offer the hopeful message that love will save us all.The inarguable peak of Bob Fosse’s career as a director and choreographer, Cabaret exemplifies exactly what’s possible within the musical genre. Utilising the Weimar Republic’s booming nightlife scene as a backdrop for the rise of the Nazi Party, Cabaret could be sexy, glamorous, dark, and sinister in equal measure, exploring topics that were largely taboo at the time (including abortion) while still delivering the musical’s traditional exuberance, anchored in Liza Minnelli\u0027s magnetic lead performance.The ultimate cult musical, once described by critic Roger Ebert as more of “long-running social phenomenon” than a film, The Rocky Horror Picture Show now comes with its own rules and traditions – you can either be enlisted to dress up and perform alongside the film, or join in with one of the many callbacks that fans all know by heart. It’s a testament to the film’s glorious, schlocky embrace of B-movie history and its message of feel-good sexual liberation and gender fluidity.Bugsy Malone is an idea that never should have worked on film: would we really sit and indulge in a cast of children playing pretend cops and gangsters? Yet, under Alan Parker’s direction, and thanks to Paul Williams’s riotous lineup of songs, the film is not only a delight, but feels oddly subversive in the way its cast so gamely fill the roles of wisecracking ne\u0027er-do-wells – a smart way to parody the cultural obsession with the machismo of the gangster genre.While the film may have earned its place in the history books thanks to Marilyn Monroe’s now iconic performance of “Diamonds Are a Girl’s Best Friend” – frequently revisited, whether by Madonna or Moulin Rouge!’s Satine – Gentlemen Prefer Blondes also deserves to be heralded for including one of cinema’s greatest double acts. Monroe and Jane Russell are formidable as two best friends on the hunt for the ideal husband, with Russell’s witty cynicist providing the perfect counterbalance to Monroe’s goofy bombshell.1320 Dancer in the Dark (2000)The film’s production history has been mired in controversy after its star, Björk, alleged that she had been sexually harassed by a Danish film director she worked with, with the Los Angeles Times later identifying the accused as Dancer in the Dark’s Lars von Trier. He has denied the allegations. However, it’s hard to deny the film’s cultural significance, as one of the most startling and groundbreaking musicals of the 21st century. Björk’s score adds incredible compassion to the story of an immigrant factory worker who finds herself betrayed by the world and its cruel machinations.Most memorable track:  “I’ve Seen it All”Rob Marshall, whose last film was Disney’s Mary Poppins Returns, has become the go-to director for the modern Hollywood musical. Having also directed Nine (2009) and Into the Woods (2014), his best work is easily Chicago, which became the first musical to win Best Picture since Oliver! in 1968. It’s a film that dutifully pays homage to its stage origins, including Bob Fosse’s original choreography, while still feeling slick and modern in its invocation of the 1920s and its lurid culture of celebrity criminals.Most memorable track:  “All that Jazz”Director George Cukor knew he had two key ingredients when it came to his take on the musical adaptation of George Bernard Shaw’s Pygmalion: Audrey Hepburn and the gorgeous stylings of Edwardian London. And so, My Fair Lady’s most delightful image remains Hepburn’s Eliza Doolittle, engulfed by an enormous black and white hat, hollering at a race horse to “move your bloomin’ arse!” Doolittle’s resilience and fierce sense of independence endures today, 50 years after the film was first released.1620 The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964)Arguably, the film could could be described more as an opera than a musical, since every line of dialogue is sung, accompanied by Michel Legrand’s score – but it’s also a work that feels purely cinematic, in love with how much life and colour can be conjured in every frame. The film remains one of the most purely romantic entries in cinematic history, as Geneviève (Catherine Deneuve), a teenage girl working in her mother’s umbrella’s shop, pines after her lover (Nino Castelnuovo) after he’s drafted to fight in Algeria.The Disney animated musical is almost a genre unto its own, considering how much it has to offer, but if one film must tower above the rest, it’s almost certainly The Lion King. Released at the height of the studio’s renaissance in the 1990s, the film recasts Shakespeare’s Hamlet in the African savannah, offering an epic story that deals with themes of destiny and responsibility, without skimping on the humour. If an entire generation is now scarred by the infamous stampede scene, it’s a price worth paying.Most memorable track: “Circle of Life”Much more than the screen debut of Julie Andrews, Mary Poppins has endured in the hearts of so many because of how it spoke to children: directly, but with a wit that never dared to patronise them. Knowing Mary was to be in on the great secrets lost to world-weary adulthood, and to be welcomed into the bountiful world of imagination and play – as beautifully represented in the Sherman brothers’ musical score and the film’s combination of live-action and traditional animation.Most memorable track: “A Spoonful of Sugar”Although Grease will largely be remembered for its karaoke-primed tunes, what’s often forgotten is how subversive the film actually proved to be at the time of its release. Grease helped break barriers when it came to the teen film, featuring characters (especially female characters) who speak frankly and openly about sex. As much as Sandy (Olivia Newton-John)’s “bad-girl” transformation can elicit eyerolls today, the scene isn’t as simple as a woman changing herself in order to impress a man – it’s also a kickback against the stifling sexual norms of American society.Most memorable track: You\u0027re the One That I WantLa La Land’s legacy is now forever tied to the great snafu of 2017’s Academy Awards, but there’s more to Damien Chazelle’s modern musical than a besuited Ryan Gosling trying to suppress an embarrassed giggle on the Oscars stage. A love letter to the genre’s history, it’s a film that both pushes forward while looking back, much like the ill-fated lovers at the centre of its story.Memorable track: “City of Stars” 120 The Wizard of Oz (1939)All the tricks and gimmicks of today’s filmmakers could never upstage The Wizard of Oz’s grand reveal, as Dorothy (Judy Garland) takes her first step into cinema’s bold, technicolour future. Eighty years later, and the effect is still breathtaking. MGM’s legendary musical adaptation of L Frank Baum’s children’s book, nominated for six Academy Awards, not only cemented Garland’s early stardom, but continues to transport those both young and old to a world where imagination is the only limit.Most memorable track: “Somewhere Over the Rainbow”Madonna, The Beatles, Nirvana, and The Police found themselves transported to the streets of 1900s Montmartre for Baz Luhrmann’s jukebox musical.

Drawing from the true story of the von Trapp family, who escaped Nazi-invaded Europe to continue their musical career in the United States, the film allows us to believe, even momentarily, in a world where kindness, joy and optimism is all that’s needed to shield us from the evils of the world, as exemplified by Maria (Julie Andrews) herself.Most memorable track:  “The Sound of Music”This wasn’t simply William Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet reheated for a new generation. West Side Story injected new blood into one of our greatest tragedies, exposing how relevant the story remained in a decade as ided as the 1960s, when America faced conflicts both on a global scale, in the Cold War, and at home, with continuing racial tensions within the US. As the Jets, the white American gang, and the Sharks, the Puerto Rican gang, fight for control of their New York neighbourhood, two lovers cross the battle lines to offer the hopeful message that love will save us all.The inarguable peak of Bob Fosse’s career as a director and choreographer, Cabaret exemplifies exactly what’s possible within the musical genre. Utilising the Weimar Republic’s booming nightlife scene as a backdrop for the rise of the Nazi Party, Cabaret could be sexy, glamorous, dark, and sinister in equal measure, exploring topics that were largely taboo at the time (including abortion) while still delivering the musical’s traditional exuberance, anchored in Liza Minnelli\u0027s magnetic lead performance.The ultimate cult musical, once described by critic Roger Ebert as more of “long-running social phenomenon” than a film, The Rocky Horror Picture Show now comes with its own rules and traditions – you can either be enlisted to dress up and perform alongside the film, or join in with one of the many callbacks that fans all know by heart. It’s a testament to the film’s glorious, schlocky embrace of B-movie history and its message of feel-good sexual liberation and gender fluidity.Bugsy Malone is an idea that never should have worked on film: would we really sit and indulge in a cast of children playing pretend cops and gangsters? Yet, under Alan Parker’s direction, and thanks to Paul Williams’s riotous lineup of songs, the film is not only a delight, but feels oddly subversive in the way its cast so gamely fill the roles of wisecracking ne\u0027er-do-wells – a smart way to parody the cultural obsession with the machismo of the gangster genre.While the film may have earned its place in the history books thanks to Marilyn Monroe’s now iconic performance of “Diamonds Are a Girl’s Best Friend” – frequently revisited, whether by Madonna or Moulin Rouge!’s Satine – Gentlemen Prefer Blondes also deserves to be heralded for including one of cinema’s greatest double acts. Monroe and Jane Russell are formidable as two best friends on the hunt for the ideal husband, with Russell’s witty cynicist providing the perfect counterbalance to Monroe’s goofy bombshell.1320 Dancer in the Dark (2000)The film’s production history has been mired in controversy after its star, Björk, alleged that she had been sexually harassed by a Danish film director she worked with, with the Los Angeles Times later identifying the accused as Dancer in the Dark’s Lars von Trier. He has denied the allegations. However, it’s hard to deny the film’s cultural significance, as one of the most startling and groundbreaking musicals of the 21st century. Björk’s score adds incredible compassion to the story of an immigrant factory worker who finds herself betrayed by the world and its cruel machinations.Most memorable track:  “I’ve Seen it All”Rob Marshall, whose last film was Disney’s Mary Poppins Returns, has become the go-to director for the modern Hollywood musical. Having also directed Nine (2009) and Into the Woods (2014), his best work is easily Chicago, which became the first musical to win Best Picture since Oliver! in 1968. It’s a film that dutifully pays homage to its stage origins, including Bob Fosse’s original choreography, while still feeling slick and modern in its invocation of the 1920s and its lurid culture of celebrity criminals.Most memorable track:  “All that Jazz”Director George Cukor knew he had two key ingredients when it came to his take on the musical adaptation of George Bernard Shaw’s Pygmalion: Audrey Hepburn and the gorgeous stylings of Edwardian London. And so, My Fair Lady’s most delightful image remains Hepburn’s Eliza Doolittle, engulfed by an enormous black and white hat, hollering at a race horse to “move your bloomin’ arse!” Doolittle’s resilience and fierce sense of independence endures today, 50 years after the film was first released.1620 The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964)Arguably, the film could could be described more as an opera than a musical, since every line of dialogue is sung, accompanied by Michel Legrand’s score – but it’s also a work that feels purely cinematic, in love with how much life and colour can be conjured in every frame. The film remains one of the most purely romantic entries in cinematic history, as Geneviève (Catherine Deneuve), a teenage girl working in her mother’s umbrella’s shop, pines after her lover (Nino Castelnuovo) after he’s drafted to fight in Algeria.The Disney animated musical is almost a genre unto its own, considering how much it has to offer, but if one film must tower above the rest, it’s almost certainly The Lion King. Released at the height of the studio’s renaissance in the 1990s, the film recasts Shakespeare’s Hamlet in the African savannah, offering an epic story that deals with themes of destiny and responsibility, without skimping on the humour. If an entire generation is now scarred by the infamous stampede scene, it’s a price worth paying.Most memorable track: “Circle of Life”Much more than the screen debut of Julie Andrews, Mary Poppins has endured in the hearts of so many because of how it spoke to children: directly, but with a wit that never dared to patronise them. Knowing Mary was to be in on the great secrets lost to world-weary adulthood, and to be welcomed into the bountiful world of imagination and play – as beautifully represented in the Sherman brothers’ musical score and the film’s combination of live-action and traditional animation.Most memorable track: “A Spoonful of Sugar”Although Grease will largely be remembered for its karaoke-primed tunes, what’s often forgotten is how subversive the film actually proved to be at the time of its release. Grease helped break barriers when it came to the teen film, featuring characters (especially female characters) who speak frankly and openly about sex. As much as Sandy (Olivia Newton-John)’s “bad-girl” transformation can elicit eyerolls today, the scene isn’t as simple as a woman changing herself in order to impress a man – it’s also a kickback against the stifling sexual norms of American society.Most memorable track: You\u0027re the One That I WantLa La Land’s legacy is now forever tied to the great snafu of 2017’s Academy Awards, but there’s more to Damien Chazelle’s modern musical than a besuited Ryan Gosling trying to suppress an embarrassed giggle on the Oscars stage. A love letter to the genre’s history, it’s a film that both pushes forward while looking back, much like the ill-fated lovers at the centre of its story.Memorable track: “City of Stars” In total, the auction raised $2.4 million (£1.8 million), with some of the proceeds going to Newton-John’s cancer treatment centre in Australia.The singer and actor, 70, is currently battling cancer for the third time, having been diagnosed with stage four breast cancer in 2017.She said in August that she has chosen not to know how long she has left to live, explaining: “If you believe the statistics, you’re going to make them happen. If somebody tells you, ‘you have six months to live’, very possibly you will – because you believe that.”Instead she is focused on fundraising for cancer research, specifically the effects of cannabis as a treatment for the disease.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But the machine depends on electricity –\u0026nbspsomething in critically short supply in Gaza.\u0026nbspSamar’s story is far from unique, with the enclave’s two\u0026nbspmillion residents forced to try to survive on roughly three hours of electricity since Israel imposed a blockade in 2016.Hospitals and other buildings rely on generators to keep the power on during the cuts, but they are expensive, and until recently, a luxury that Samar was unable to afford.\u0026nbspIn comes Majd Mashharawi, an award-winning entrepreneur and CEO of a company that is providing radical solutions to Gaza’s energy crisis.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Family home destroyed in strikes on Gaza: in pictures Show all 5Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Tamer al-Wakeel lived with his family in the building destroyed in an Israeli airstrike on 5 MayTamer al-Wakeel stands among the ruins of his family home which was destroyed in an Israeli airstirke on 5 MayA man clambers among the rubble of a building that was destroyed in an Israeli airstrike on 5 MayA man stands among the rubble of a building that was destroyed in an Israeli airstrike on 5 MayThe rubble of a building that was destroyed in an Israeli airstrike on 5 MayTamer al-Wakeel lived with his family in the building destroyed in an Israeli airstrike on 5 MayTamer al-Wakeel stands among the ruins of his family home which was destroyed in an Israeli airstirke on 5 MayA man clambers among the rubble of a building that was destroyed in an Israeli airstrike on 5 MayA man stands among the rubble of a building that was destroyed in an Israeli airstrike on 5 MayThe rubble of a building that was destroyed in an Israeli airstrike on 5 May“I wanted to address two serious issues in my community –\u0026nbspelectricity and building materials,’’ she tells The Independent.\u0026nbspShe designed SunBox, a generator that uses solar power to provide electricity in the face of the blockade. Linked up to panels that residents can install on their roof, the machine generates 1,000 kilowatts of electricity and needs only three hours to recharge back to full capacity. Gaza, she jokes,\u0026nbspwill never run out of sun.\u0026nbsp“SunBox is more than a solar device that provides lights for my kids to study and run the TV for them, it really changed my life by providing electricity to run the medical device for my sick child,” says Samar.\u0026nbsp“Now I do not have to worry every day whether I can go to the hospital or not, I do not have to run anymore to be on time so I can provide him with oxygen before something happens.”\u0026nbspResourced from China, SunBox subsidises the generators, but at $450 it was still too expensive for many in the enclave. According to the World Bank, unemployment in the strip is at 47 per cent, one of the highest in the world.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The company initially started with providing energy to 15 families, but soon sky-rocketed, and in the first quarter of 2019, she says over 1,000 people were using the clean-energy source.For another customer, Muna, the energy source has enabled her to continue her work from home as a tailor. She says her small business was severely affected by the electricity crisis and she’d often stay up all night waiting for the electricity to come back.\u0026nbsp“I don’t have to worry when I will wake up and when I can sleep. I never imagined I will control my source of energy, I feel independent,” she says.\u0026nbspSunBox is not Majd’s first project to have found a novel solution to one of Gaza’s crises.\u0026nbspAfter the 2014 war between Israel and Hamas, 17,000 homes were destroyed or damaged and some 100,000 people were left homeless, according to the UN.\u0026nbspThe war and the ensuing devastation had\u0026nbspa profound effect on Majd: “I thought, as an engineer, what can I do for my people?”\u0026nbspHouses needed to be rebuilt, but the block on many imports meant that Gazans were unable to get the cement and aggregate needed for bricks.It was among the destruction and debris that Majd founded her first project: “Green Cake.”\u0026nbspHers was a revolutionary solution: Combining ash and rubble to create an affordable, cheap and sturdy building block.The team went through dozens of trials until they found the prototype that passed the strength, water and fire resistance tests.\u0026nbspThe response was overwhelmingly positive, and her first client commissioned her team to build an external wall with 1,000 blocks.“This is not just a building block, it’s changing the stereotype of women in Gaza,’’ she says.\u0026nbspFor Majd, her inventions are a crucial way of challenging the stereotypes around women in Gaza and trailblazing the way for other female entrepreneurs.\u0026nbspClients are often surprised to find that the CEO of SunBox is female, and she recounts how her engineering class at the Islamic University of Gaza had a 6-1 male to female ratio.These preconceptions only spur her on further: “Education is the strongest weapon us women have to fight for our freedom, decent life and future”,Majd is now training new graduates to be involved in her company, with a big focus on recruiting women. Well-known in her community, she has an open-door policy in her office and gives advice to young entrepreneurs.\u0026nbsp“I want to show that we are not just victims in Gaza.

But something even more important is at stake.Do we want to continue to live with the free-market economy that has given us wealth unimaginable a century ago  Or do we want to be sucked backwards into the failed socialist experiment that impoverished Eastern Europe in the second half of the th century and has laid waste to Venezuela Labour has yet to produce the radical manesto Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell promised yesterday but we already know there is going to be a hike in income tax for those earning over £, a year — and probably a swingeing wealth tax, given McDonnell’s past enthusiasm for the idea.McDonnell, too, has said he would expropriate ten per cent of the shares of every British company and put them in a fund supposedly for the benefit of the workers — although when you read the small print, workers would receive a maximum of £ in idends per year, with the rest going straight into the Government’s coffers.That measly £ would do little to compensate for the collapse in value of pension funds as Labour nationalised water and electricity companies at below the market value of their shares.Many of those shares are owned by funds on which you and I rely for our retirement.The Shadow Chancellor promises that under Labour, we will only have to work a four-day, -hour week, apparently with no cut in pay. We might as well put Alice In Wonderland in charge of the economy. His sums simply don’t add up.McDonnell says he will increase the National Living Wage to £ an hour. Butlow-paid workers were stopped from working  hours a week rather than the current average of , it would mean a substantial cut in pay for millions of people.That Theresa May was unable to win an outright majority against Jeremy Corbyn and his extreme economic policies in  is as astonishing in retrospect as it was at the time. What was meant to be a coronation nearly turned into a wake. Many Conservatives fear the polls could turn sharply again.But there is scant sign Boris Johnson will repeat Mrs May’s abysmal campaign. His three months in office have brought a change in the weather. We have a Prime Minister who exudes optimism rather than a sense of defeat.While May seemed almost embarrassed to be a Conservative and tried to out-do Labour for proposing the most unappealing tax rise — the “dementia tax” — Johnson has made the case for capitalism and conservatism.The first of those, he rightly points out, pays for the public services we all value so much.He has promised to rebuild hospitals and reverse the cuts in police numbers that took place on Mrs May’s watch.He knows the way to improve the lot of people on low incomes is not to boost benefits but to increase earnings through a higher ­National Living Wage.But he also recognises middle-income groups have suffered disproportionately from the tax system in recent years and has proposed raising the threshold for the  per cent tax rate.While Corbyn and McDonnell would undermine livelihoods by cutting working hours, Johnson’s Tories will encourage us to work and to invest — in our homes, in pensions and savings. Rather than threaten businesses with confiscating shares, he promises better infrastructure, especially broadband.Boris doesn’t just want to get Brexit done, as Remainer Mrs May did.He wants to turn it to Britain’s advantage, opening our economy to the world beyond the EU, with new trade deals to bring in investment.While Mrs May created a hostile environment for migrants, Johnson has indicated a more welcoming attitude towards those who want to come to Britain to work.But more than that, it is a battle between enterprise and overbearing State control, between having the freedom to invest for your future and having your assets confiscated, between the opportunity to work and having your working hours laid down by the Government.It is a cliche to say we face the most important election in decades.

No debate.This extremism is feeding into real-le events, including the campaign for next month’s General Election. Just look at the Labour Party and its leader Jeremy Corbyn.Despite presenting himself as a kind and compassionate old bean, Corbyn and most MPs in the current Labour Party thrive on presenting society as a fight between “good” and “evil”, the “few” and “many”, with people like bankers and Tories in the latter group.At every chance they demonise anyone who strays from the progressive orthodoxy.Labour’s shouty MP David Lammy even took this philosophy so far as to compare Jacob Rees-Mogg’s hard Brexit European Research Group to “Nazis” and “apartheid”.In reality, they are simply politicians who have dferent views to him.But such extreme rhetoric has become normalised among Labour. You are either on their side of the argument, or you are a fascist.Labour’s polarised world view is encapsulated in its utterly bonkers set of policies.Any sensible government knows that economic reform takes time, and is often about compromise and improving existing structures.But Labour wants to tear everything down and start again, with private schools being top of the list — no doubt because MPs have a vendetta against Etonians.Corbyn also wants to abolish Universal Credit, despite having no tangible plan for its replacement.Universal Credit is the perfect example of where Labour goes wrong. The system has had teething issues but the answer is not to burn it down, it is to make slow improvements.There are other huge, sweeping pledges the party has made, such as nationalising the railways, water, energy and mail, seizing a ten per cent stake in every private company with more than  staff and having a target of net zero for carbon emissions by .Experts have suggested this could lead to meat being rationed, cars confiscated and the wholesale closure of industries .Who cares, though,it gets Labour in charge!Much of the reason Labour has set upon these radical policies is because shaking up the system is always incredibly exciting for the young, particularlyit looks like it might bring about a few freebies.And let’s face it, it is no surprise that millennials and their younger counterparts can be enticed.They have had a rough ride since the  financial crisis, absorbing the shock of the recession and being decades away from home ownership.It is no wonder they think socialism is the answer, especially as it plays into the woke mindset of there being simple, binary solutions to everything.This is why it is so important that young people actually take on what Obama was saying about the world.The Government has to make large numbers of deeply complex decisions, where there cannot always be winners.Almost always someone will lose out in the intricate interplay that is political decision-making.There needs to be more acceptance of a Margaret Thatcher-style realism: That le is not fair.That is something youngsters do not seem to grasp these days, believing equalities can be remedied with the magic wand of socialism.Strong, long-lasting policies do not make sexy soundbites like “For the many”, nor can they be advertised in protests outside Parliament Square. Like Obama said, the world is messy.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Are these two really the brightest and the best  Obviously not. But with politics becoming ever more isive and toxic, they are all we have left.Let’s be honest. What normal human being would want to be part of such a cesspit  As we are all well aware, the past three years have seen a constipated parliament unable, or unwilling, to sort out Brexit, forcing us all into a nightmarish version of Groundhog Day.I believe the idea of a European referendum was the height of stupidity by a spooked David Cameron who wanted to neuter Nigel Farage. When the nation voted Leave, Cameron was the first to abandon ship.Never mind “women and children first”. He was rowing away from a Titanic mess in a leboat stuffed with like-minded, snivelling clowns, leaving poor Theresa May behind playing an out-of-tune piano with the rest of the ship’s doomed orchestra. Mrs May foolishly called an election that was a personal disaster, then was worn down until she had to step aside.Boris Johnson thought he could bluster and blag his way to a solution and promised we would exit the EU a couple of days ago, on Halloween. For all his blather about “dying in a ditch”, he couldn’t deliver.So here we are, facing a pre-Christmas election at a time when distrust of politicians has never been higher and our expectations have been never lower. It is easy to dismiss the whole bloody lot of them as a waste of time.But there ARE some decent MPs who want to make a dference. Sadly, some are unwilling to put up with the scrutiny and vilication the job now entails and many are heading out the door.Female MPs, in particular, have been subjected to online abuse that chills the blood. As well as death threats, they have had to deal with vile monsters threatening rape and other violent attacks. It’s horric to have to cope with such hideous abuse on a daily basis. I can’t blame them for quitting in despair.Their fears are real. We saw that with the tragic murder of MP Jo Cox in . She was a we and mother who wanted to make the world a better place and do the best possible job for her constituents. It’s a real pity the MPs now calling it a day are mainly moderates who were calm ­voices of reason amid all the shrieking and howling from extremists on both sides of the political ide.Heidi Allen, a Tory who joined the Lib Dems, can no longer cope with the “nastiness and intimidation” which has become the norm in Parliament. Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan is leaving because the abuse towards her has had a “clear impact” on her ­family.The Tory and the Labour leaderships should hang their heads in shame at allowing such an appalling situation to develop. They should have called off their attack dogs and clamped down on cowardly online trolls.There have always been robust arguments and passionate debates in politics — but nothing like the sheer hatred and aggression Brexit has unleashed. MPs were used to attacks from opposing parties. But now some of the worst abuse comes from inside.Left-wing extremists threaten deselection for Labour MPs who even whisper about their discontent with Corbyn. Tories find themselves booted out for failing to toe the line. Sadly, the next six weeks will see even more of this aggression as we have to listen to hate-filled rants and ­ludicrous, undeliverable ­promises to secure our votes.It is strange to think that Westminster was respected and admired not so very long ago. I honestly don’t think those days will ever .

But viewers were so excited, “R and J” have an open invitation to .The stumbling block has always been because Judy was reluctant toto live national TV. But Richard told me this week she really enjoyed herself and loved reconnecting with This Morning’s loyal audience.Richard was quick to stress that they are not after anyone’s jobs or in the market for a permanent– but it would be lovely to pop in now and again. I’m delighted. They are both total pros who make it all look delightfully easy and relaxed.They also have the sort of public affection only enjoyed by the Queen and Dame Judi Dench.IT is heartbreaking to think Ben Needham would have turned  this week. He has been for ever frozen in time as that little blond toddler playing in the Greek sunshine before going missing on Kos back in .Brave mum Kerry has never once stopped fighting to discover the truth. Three years ago, British police finally conducted a thorough investigation.They believe Ben was killed in an accident involving a digger on a building site on the island, where his grandad worked and close to where the family lived at the time. Despite handing over their evidence to authorities on the island, there have been no further attempts to find Ben’s body.Poor Kerry should have been celebrating her grown-up son’s milestone birthday, perhaps with her daughter-in-law and grandchildren. Instead, her agony ­continues.She has no closure, no grave to visit and is no nearer to finding out exactly what happened to her son almost three decades ago.I CAN’T wait to see what Michelle Visage and Giovanni Pernice have in store for us on Strictly Come Dancing. Last week their Halloween routine was perfection and Michelle foxtrotted around the floor like a gothic goddess.She was my tip to make the final even before the first steps were taken in this year’s competition. I knew Michelle had the sass, talent and work ethic to go all the way. I love that she’s flying the flag for the over-s while exuding buckets of sex appeal.Don’t forget that for years Michelle suffered with a serious autoimmune disease she believes was caused by her breast implants. She has only just recovered from surgery to have them removed.Michelle is a steel magnolia and the best is yet to come. So make sure you give her and Giovanni your vote.A HUGE thank you to everyone who has been so positive about Shine, my book out this week.With my th birthday coming up at the end of this month, it felt like a good time to reflect and take stock. I also wanted to share all of the knowledge and advice I’ve acquired from so many of the guests and experts I’ve met over the  years I’ve been on TV.So I decided to put it all into a book that will hopefully give useful tips and information to make your le better. I want it to be a book you can have by your bedside, to dip into when you need a bit of a confidence boost or advice on looking good and feeling great.I’m doing some signings on Saturday, so do pop in and say hello at WH Smith in Glasgow’s St Enoch Centre at noon and at Waterstones on Princes Street in Edinburgh at pm.I WAS in the US last week, going through astronaut training at Nasa. I will tell you about that very soon. But I also managed a couple of days to recover in Florida’s Key West. My husband and I had no idea that at this time of year there is a little event called Fantasy Fest. Well. What an eye-opener that was.Some brave souls were out and about in nothing more than expertly applied body paint. I was a bit bemused at first and obviously I refrained from joining in.But it is amazing how quickly you get used to someone wearing nothing but a leather posing pouch standing at the bar talking to you about the latest Trump baloney.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But the answer is simple.Corbyn knew the longer he could stall Brexit, the more damage would be done to the one thing he hates more than everything : Britain. He’s always sided with anyone who wants to do us harm. The IRA. Hamas. Russia. You name it.He wants everyone in those camps in Calais to come here because he knows it will destabilise our way of le.

Nor is he remotely likely to hold the balance of power.There is no longer a route to the No Deal Brexit he wants. Nor any prospect of Boris Johnson caving to his demands for a pact, destroying the Tories’ unity. And it is patently untrue to say Boris’s deal is not Brexit. The Tory ERG simply wouldn’t back itso.It will end our membership, payments and free movement and extract us from the customs union and single market, with no “backstop” keeping us half-in. We would trade freely as an independent nation. And Boris alone can get us out. The sole alternative as PM is Corbyn, and he will keep us in the EU for ever.In a few constituencies Farage’s party could hurt Labour more than the Tories. Overall it is FAR more likely to prevent Boris winning the majority which is vital to delivering Brexit and without which it is lost. That is why Farage’s ultimatum to the PM delighted Labour.Two by-elections — in Peterborough and Brecon, both of which the Tories should have won — were gted to Labour and the Lib Dems by Brexit Party votes. On December , those could put Corbyn in Downing Street in a Remain coalition.At which point Farage’s legacy won’t just be that his vanity wrecked his le’s work.That a party he founded with only one aim, a real Brexit, became the very instrument of the project’s destruction.He will be remembered as the right-wing maverick who handed anti-Semitic, anti-Western Marxists an unprecedented chance to plunder the world’s fth-largest economy. The Sun admires Farage.His pressure brought about the referendum AND a better deal. But he could now be the author of a double national catastrophe.He and his voters should think again.WE’VE heard it all now.Labour’s Tom ­Watson, of all people, insists broadcasters must combat the Tories’ “fake news”.That’s the same Tom Watson who destroyed lives spreading a paedophile’s lies.Whose party’s campaign centres on a blatant fiction about Boris “selling the NHS to Trump”.Whose leader lies endlessly about his terrorist sympathies and anti-Semitism — then sinisterly orders reporters: “Just report what we say.”These charlatans lecture journalists about the truth.But they themselves are strangers to it.Andthey took power, Press freedom would be a nostalgic memory.The Sun joins everyone rooting for Owen and England’s rugby heroes.Best of ruck, lads!Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But oddly,  is one of the things that mean the Tories might win that majority this time round. They are determined not to make the same mistakes again. As one senior party figure puts it: “We screwed it up once. We’re not going to do that again.”When Chancellor Sajid Javid spoke to Tory MPs on Wednesday night, he reassured them that “this campaign will not be like last time”. He described Theresa May’s  effort as “the most incompetent election campaign in modern times”.In , the Tories assumed that their chunky poll lead would easily translate into a big majority. There was a complacency and cockiness about their campaign. There was no ­rationale for why Mrs May was going back on her pledge not to have an election and a belief that the Tories could use that lead to win a mandate for almost anything.This time round, the Tories are being much more cautious. The groundwork has been laid for this campaign. Conservative Campaign HQ has been getting election-ready for months. The Tories have heavy-hitters ready to join their ­campaign team, including Paul Stephenson, one of the key ­figures from Vote Leave’s  victory. In , Mrs May took her own party machine by ­surprise with her decision to go to the country.In another dference with the ex-PM, Boris Johnson has a clear argument for why an ­election is needed — the only thing this Parliament is capable of on Brexit is delay. It is hard to see how anyone who wants Brexit and has seen what has happened since the  election could disagree with that.This Tory desire not to screw up will also lead to more ­discipline. This time, the ­manesto will be a cautious document, not an attempt to gain a mandate for a series of deeply unpopular reforms. The fact that everyone knows this election will be close helps the Tories too. There’ll be much more scrutiny of what a Corbyn premiership would mean than there was in .Cabinet Ministers believe that the prospect of a Labour SNP deal which would see Nicola Sturgeon’s Scottish Nationalists help Corbyn into Downing Street in exchange for another independence referendum is already cutting through, and particularly in Scotland, where the Tories are increasingly ­confident they can limit their losses to five seats or fewer.But perhaps the biggest dference from  is between Johnson and May. May had never done a ­national campaign before, she disliked big events and preferred going door to door. Boris, by contrast, is a showman who has already ­successfully fronted one nationwide effort, the  referendum. Boris knows how to make himself the centre of attention in a way Mrs May never did.As one Cabinet minister puts it: “Boris is ­capable of stealing the oxygen from all the other candidates.”The most signicant threat to the Tories is pro-Remain tactical voting. The big question, frets one Cabinet minister, is whether Labour and the Lib Dems end up splitting the ­centre-left vote and letting the Tories win — as happened with Labour and the SDP in  — or whether there is anti-Tory voting that condemns scores of previously safe Tory MPs to defeat — as happened in .Butthe Tories avoid the pitfalls of , then even from a much less promising starting position they should be able to win a majority.THIS election will see the first ever head-to-head televised leaders’ debate between the two big parties. On November , Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson will clash in primetime on ITV. Both Labour and the Tories think they will benefit from this one-on-one format.On the Labour side, they hope that it helps them unite the anti-Tory vote behind Corbyn. The Tories think the question of who you want to be Prime Minister – Johnson or Corbyn – favours them.During the  campaign, Theresa May lost her lead on this question. But right now, Boris Johnson has a -point advantage over Corbyn. If he can maintain anything like this margin, he’ll still be in No  come Christmas.Downing Street also thinks that making this election a forced choice between a Tory government and a Labour government works to their benefit. Polling for Conservative Campaign HQ shows that half of voters want the Tories in government in some way, compared to just over a quarter for Labour.They calculate that making the election a choice between Johnson and Corbyn helps them squeeze the Brexit Party vote down – something which is particularly important given Nigel Farage’s determination to put up candidates right across the country.Influential Tories are also worried thatthe Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson turns in a barnstorming performance, her party could threaten the Tories in their shire seats.Johnson himself will not do the seven-way debate between the party leaders. The Tories are keen to downplay the importance of this event. I’m told they are considering sending Sajid Javid, Michael Gove, Priti Patel or Rishi Sunak.THE “moratorium” announced on fracking today is a sign of the Tories’ safety-first approach going into this election. They want to close down issues that could cost them seats.One minister defends the decision to abandon the effort to improve the UK’s energy security by saying: “The reality is, it wasn’t happening.”But a bigger factor was their desire not to go into the election with this as a potential vulnerability.I understand that, in stark contrast to , the manesto will be a cautious document designed to prevent handing ammunition to Labour.AT CABINET on Tuesday, Boris Johnson called the Scottish Secretary Alister Jack to speak.An embarrassed Jack explained that he wasn’t actually trying to get in, to which Johnson replied he thought his hand was up.Jack, a multi-millionaire who owns a large farm, then quipped to laughter: “That’s why my farm manager doesn’t let me go to auctions.”THE Tories are planning to accuse Labour of staging a massive raid on the pension pots of million voters.This would hurt the .million who contribute to a private ­pension. Afterwards, one Tory told me Javid’s message was clear: “Labour are coming after your money.”I understand the Tories are also preparing a “tax bombshell” attack on Corbyn.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But they never got one vote from our house. And I have been thinking of my parents over the past few days and wondering: Would they have broken the habit of a letime and voted for Boris Johnson Because that is the key to who wins this General Election. We hear a lot about how Boris has to woo “Workington Man” — “an older, white, non-graduate male from the north of England with an interest in rugby league and a tendency to vote Labour”. But it is not just Workington Man who holds the keys to  Downing Street now.From one end of the country to the other, it is all those voters such as my mum and dad, who never voted Tory before. That is who Boris has to woo and win. Those millions of Tory virgins.The polls all suggest there is a massive majority for parties which favour leaving the European Union. Butthat vote is split between the Tories and Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party, then we don’t get Brexit.We get Jeremy Corbyn gurning on the steps of No. We get an economy in ruins. We get Venezuela without the nice weather.  But splitting the Leave vote is not a strategy for delivering Brexit. It is a cast-iron guarantee that Brexit is cancelled. If you want to see the result of the Referendum, you have to vote Tory.My mum and dad would not have recognised the rotten Labour Party of today. They would have been baffled, then angered, by the total absence of anything resembling patriotism among Corbyn and his Marxist mob.My parents would have scratched their heads at Labour’s immigration policy — to allow “as much free movement as possible” — not because they disliked foreigners but because they thought the identity of their country was worth preserving.My folks would never have trusted a grizzled old Marxist like John McDonnell with their hard-earned wages. They would have been wary of seeing the police force supervised by Diane Abbott.They would have noted Emily Thornberry sneering at the flag of St George while happily adorning herself in the EU flag. They would not understand how Corbyn could happily lick the sandals of Hamas, Hezbollah and the IRA.My parents — the kind of people who fought our wars, paid their taxes for a letime and built this country up from the rubble — would not have spat on this Labour Party. And after years of seeing Parliament place itself above the people, they would have crawled across broken glass to get to the polling booth on December .My parents believed in democracy. They had no doubts about the importance of voting. They would never have voted for Jeremy Corbyn. But would they have seen that the Conservative Party is now their natural home That’s your historic task now, Boris — convince the millions of working-class patriots like my mum and dad that you truly understand their lives. Andyou can do that, you will win a landslide.We have heard a lot about the failure of fire chiefs and their policy of “stay put” which added to the death toll of .But there has not been nearly enough focus on the heroism of the firefighters who were there on that hellish night.Firefighters put their lives on the line for strangers.Yes, that is their job.

And exactly how does a dog die, Mr President In my experience, a dog dies surrounded by humans who feel as though they have just had their heart torn out. A dog dies surrounded by love. A dog dies bitterly mourned by the family it leaves behind.According to Trump, the IS leader, “whimpered, cried and screamed like a coward . . . in utter fear, panic and dread”. My dog is not going out of this world like that. When our Stan finally goes, many years from now, he will be in my arms and looking in my eyes.Death will be painless and peaceful. It will be a moment of love and grief. Who writes your lousy material, Donald  All this “dying like a dog” rubbish felt stupidly off-the-cuff.While the world is mightily glad to see the back of a mass murderer, the florid violence of Donald Trump’s language sounded exactly like the kind of crass rhetoric we hear from terrorists.The President’s sneering “died like a dog” line was particularly misjudged because American special forces were helped in their ultra-dangerous mission by military search dogs.They pursued al-Baghdadi right up to the moment he detonated his suicide vest, injuring one of the brave dogs – a Belgian Malinois named Conan – who will be honoured at the White House next week.Kill all the terrorists you like, Mr President.

Happily, though, most of us know that, these days, coercion and force in the bedroom are not only ­unromantic but unacceptable.The offending lyrics in the song, which is a duet, are uttered by the female voice, which sings: “I simply must go, the answer is no” . . . only for the man she is singing to to hand her a drink — and for her to question what is in it. Obviously not good on any level. But this song was written in  .It was a hit during a time when sex was for marriage, and women weren’t actually allowed to express any active interest in men so had to feign modesty at all times. In the s and s, before the Pill was introduced, that dance of reluctance and “persuasion” was part of the courting process and the whole process of seduction was based on women pretending they weren’t interested only to be ­persuaded that they were.But look how dferent things are now.Also, let’s face it, when you get the magnying glass out, there are plenty of storylines from the past that don’t quite measure up to the standards of . Look at James Bond, who basically sexually assaults Honor Blackman’s ­character Pussy Galorein the movie Goldfinger.Or the song Every Breath You Take and the film Love Actually, both of which feature a stalker as the romantic lead. And when you think about it, Daniel Cleaver’s courting of Bridget Jones really just boils down to ­sexual harassment.There are countless other examples of “romantic” plots which are very dodgy indeed by current standards but, at the time, we all lapped them up. And don’t even get me started on the lyrics of rap songs that are being played today which routinely talk about killing and raping women. Now that is grim.But instead of allowing this song to exist as the relic from the past, soul singer John Legend and Kelly Clarkson have rewritten it. Their version now includes the lines, “What will my friends think If I have one more drink  ”.That is instead of “The neighbours might think,   Say what’s in this drink  .  Legend describes his version as having “a new-found sensitivity in the #MeToo era”. I’d put it a dferent way and say he is ­trying to re-write history.Last year a radio station in Ohio announced it would stop playing the original because of ­complaints from listeners saying the song, “didn’t have a place in modern music”. That’s fine. No one needs to play itpeople are offended by it. But the idea that we can airbrush the fact that it existed in the first place is ridiculous and I worry we are all in danger of trying too hard to be PC.The risk is we become so vanilla, so afraid of upsetting everyone with our view, that we stop speaking our mind, which is a form of societal repression. Yes, it’s good to stand up for what you believe in, but taking offence at the lyrics of a song more than  years old might not be the best cause to bat for.Everything has a context, andwe aren’t careful we will all be so worried about how “woke” we are that we will forget our own views and how to express them.PARENTS everywhere will be reassured to learn that even when you are a sporting hero your kids still think you are a bit of an embarrassment.Peter Crouch said in an interview yesterday that his daughter, Sophia, who is eight, initially asked him to stay outside when he dropped her off at summer camp – because the other kids were laughing about how tall he is .The thing is, as any parent will confirm,it wasn’t his height she would have found another reason that he had to stay outside, whether it be his shoes, coat or haircut.In fact, don’t worry Peter, as they get older they get embarrassed about you just for breathing.MILLIONS of motorists use their mobile phones while they drive. Thirty-five per cent of drivers under the age of , and  per cent of all drivers, admitted to taking their eyes off the road to check texts, email or social media, an RAC survey reports.But the current law means reckless drivers can only be prosecutedthey are caught using hand-held phones to call or text. Meanwhile, those who take photos or scroll through music playlists are exempt from punishment.So police have struggled to enforce the law because they are often unable to prove exactly what drivers are using their phones for. Bear in mind thata driver looks at their phone for just two seconds while travelling at mph, they will cover ft blind, drastically increasing their chance of an accident.So I’m fully behind plans for a ban on even touching a mobile phone while driving, which were announced – drivers take note – on Friday. It is thought the ban could be in place by spring next year.Drivers caught holding phones to browse social media, or even input a sat-nav location, now face six points and a fine of up to £. But how anyone can be complacent enough to check Insta while in charge of a moving metal box that can kill people is beyond me.I have not driven for ten years – I walk or get the Tube – but my kids do and it really bothers methey even so much as glance at their phones. There is no doubt that it is distracting – and dangerous for the driver, but also to others. So this proposed new law is nothing but a good thing as far as I’m concerned.I’VE never been one to embrace dressing up for Halloween or any other kind of forced fun.Sorryyou think that makes me sound like a killjoy, but one thing I have noticed with each passing year is the sexualising of Halloween going off the scales.Forget wizards, goblins and ghouls – every celebrity event seems to be populated only with sexy vampires, sexy ghosts and sexy witches. Witness Heidi Klum’s Frankenstein costume at her annual Halloween party in New York this week.The dress code seems to be wear what you like as long as it’s thigh-high, PVC or a bikini – with some fake blood.

As a boy, my mother used to tell me tales about the Caribbean and I loved listening to her.“She instilled a love of rhyme into me, from a very young age.”You can learn all about his le in Benjamin Zephaniah: My Story, which is in The Sun’s Books For Schools box.Learn what it was like growing up in a house of seven children, how he met Nelson Mandela and how Benjamin started writing poetry.Benjamin left school at  unable to read or write and without any qualications. It wasn’t until years later at an adult education class that he learned he was dyslexic.He says: “Learning to read and write was hard work. Back then, there wasn’t the understanding of learning dficulties so it passed me by.“I realise now that being dyslexic isn’t a sign of poor intelligence. When I first heard the word, I thought I was being called names.”After teaching himself to read, Benjamin started performing poems in public as a teenager before moving to London when he was .He was discovered by a publishing co-operative and had his first book published in .Today, he is a professor of poetry at Brunel University in London, has  honorary degrees and was offered an OBE in  which he rejected.Born and bred in Birmingham, Benjamin had a tough upbringing where he witnessed domestic violence.Although he got into trouble with the police as a youngster and served time in Borstal and prison, the writer was determined to turn his le around.He says: “If we want to educate the nation, we need to educate women. Then they will know stuff and can’t be bullied or intimidated by men. If a woman reads well, she’ll read to her kids.”Benjamin doesn’t believe that books are going out of fashion any time soon.He explains: “If you look back in time, there have always been people saying that it’s the end of the book whenever something new is invented.“It happened when the radio was invented and the same with television and now games. But fads have come and gone and people will always read.“For too long books were an upper-class pursuit but the working classes need to take back their power. Reading well will stay with you for le.”Andfinding time to read or the act of reading itself is an issue, Benjamin believes that poetry could be the answer.He says: If you’ve got a child or someone in your le who struggles to read or isn’t interested in reading, buy them an anthology of poems.“They might not like all of them, but there might be one or two that they do enjoy reading. And reading poems is great for people who might not have much time to read a whole book.“For some people seeing too many words can put them off.”READING well is a superpower and one that EVERY child can achieve according to writer Lauren Child.The former Children’s Laureate, and creator of Charlie And Lola, is thrilled to be backing The Sun’s Books For Schools campaign.The mum-of-one believes that as a society we don’t recognise the incredible ability that children’s books have to change lives for the better.Lauren, , says: “If you want children to do anything well then it needs to be enjoyable. If it’s a chore, then they will shut down and won’t want to do it.“Although schools teach children to read, you don’t become a reader until you find escaping with a book enjoyable. Books offer nourishment, information and understanding.“A well-stocked library in every single school is vital. The idea should be that all children feel comfortable around books so that they don’t grow up feeling that books aren’t for them.”Lauren, from London, admits that she was lucky to grow up in a house where books were valued.She says: “My mother was a huge reader and my earliest memories are of her with a book.IT’S simple to start. All primary schools need to do is visit thesun booksforschools before Friday, November .For more information, pick up The Sun.Later this month we’ll start printing tokens in the paper for schools and parents to collect.Once they reach the target, we’ll send out a bumper pack of  Collins Big Cat books, suitable for kids in Reception and Year .Schools can register at thesun booksforschools“My sisters and I were taken to the library twice a week, once after school and on a Saturday morning.“Because my mum loved the library, we loved the library. I felt very secure there and liked the fact that as I got older I could order any book I wanted and they’d get it for me.“My parents read to us all the time and even in our teenage years they ­continued to share stories with us.“Whenever we went on holiday my dad would find somewhere with a view and read a story to my sisters and I. It was usually at the top of a hill and we’d sit there listening to him and enjoy the landscape.“I still love being read to — and audio books are a favourite. It’s something I’ve continued with my daughter Tuesday, who’s now nine.“Although she can read alone, I think sharing a story is important. When we’re reading together we read every other page aloud.“It’s such a great way to bond. There’s something very intimate about reading aloud with a child. It offers such a great opportunity to understand them and their world.”Lauren adopted Tuesday when she was two with her partner, criminal barrister Adrian Darbishire, in  after travelling to Mongolia and falling in love with the country and its people.Lauren continues: “When Tuesday was little we were always in the library. She responded so well to the calm environment and I did too.“When I adopted Tuesday, she was a toddler and I didn’t really know what I was doing! She didn’t like rowdy, busy groups so the library was a lesaver.”Lauren adds: “Books teach us so much about the power of connection, empathy and emotions.”And according to Lauren, the pictures in books are just as important. She explains: “Images are just as powerful as words.“Pictures teach you to learn to look and observe which are vital le skills.“Many of us don’t know how to be ourselves and we need external affirmation more frequently. It’s only getting worse with social media.“But a book allows a reader to feel contained and calm.”SHARING stories together increases family bonds and a child’s sense of identity and security, says Nick Butterworth.The author and illustrator believes being read to as a child is a big investment in their future — and he speaks from personal experience.Nick, the creator of Percy The Park Keeper and Q Pootle , says: “Reading well is a valuable le skill whether you’re a politician or a parent writing a shopping list.“Books help us to make sense of the world and we get an understanding of people who aren’t like us.”Nick Butterworth’s much- loved character Percy The Park Keeper is in The Sun’s Books For Schools box.In Percy And The Rabbit, Percy’s cap, scarf and gloves go missing and end up being used by some mischievous mice to decorate a snowman.Surprisingly, reading didn’t always come naturally to Nick. He says: “I didn’t start school until I was six and I was a slow learner.“I was in a class of  with one teacher and my parents were so busy running a newsagents, nobody noticed I was struggling. I didn’t get the hang of reading until I was eight.“But, though I found the mechanics dficult, I really loved stories. My parents read to me all the time and so did my gran. If I was ever bored my gran would say, ‘Come on, chuck, let’s have a story’.“My favourite childhood tales included The Tale Of Jeremy Fisher by Beatrix Potter.“As I got older, Aesop’s Fables, Moby Dick, Alice In Wonderland and Kipling’s Just So Stories made an impact.”Nick, , from Essex, adds: “A story is like going through a door into a dferent world. I was lucky to go on flights of fancy sitting on my gran’s lap.“Reading to my children and now my grandchildren is the most natural thing. Because of the demands on parents’ time, the bedtime story is easily dispensed with.But remember, there will be a time when your child might not want to snuggle up and listen to a story.” Nick, who is going on a book tour this December, believes reading and sharing stories is vital.He says: “I love visiting schools, particularly when I meet parents and they tell me what a dference it’s made to their child’s le.“It’s a shame, because it’s a fantastic thing to do. Reading to a child gives them wonderful memories to treasure for a letime.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

My son Giacomo, , had been staying at his friend’s in Llanwenarth and we were driving home to Abergavenny on the A when I suddenly saw a small plane coming down. It all happened so quickly. Out of nowhere, it crashed literally  yards away from where we were driving. The plane had hit the power lines and crashed into the central reservation, overturning and bursting into flames. We were going  miles an hour and I slammed on the brakes and swore.    Luckily I managed to stop, otherwise we may have careered into it ourselves, which is a terrying thought. It’s all still a bit of a blur even now. I think I was acting on pure adrenaline – I didn’t really think, instinct took over. I jumped out, leaving Giacomo in the car. I remember shouting at him to stay where he was, because we really didn’t have time to mess around. CLIMBING INTO DANGER The plane was upside down and flames were coming out of the cockpit and I could hear screaming, so I climbed under the wing where I could feel the heat and smoke. I started trying to kick the windows in but I couldn’t get through, and it was at that point, with the heat of the fire coming over the top of the plane, that I started thinking I might have to bail out of there or I’d be dead myself. Luckily the small windows at the back of the plane had cracked, so my best bet was to kick those through as it would be easier than breaking the others, which felt impossible to get past in the heat. It worked and, looking back, we were incredibly lucky. It’s horrible to thinkthat window hadn’t been cracked, it would have been a completely dferent story. I think there must have been roughly half a minute between getting the first and last person out. I pulled a teenage girl and boy out.    Then another guy – who turned out to be Joel Snarr – arrived on the scene to help at just the right time. I don’t think I’d have been able to get the pilot out – he was a big guy. But Joel managed to grab him by the arms and yanked him out just in time. There is no way he would have survivedJoel hadn’t been there. I could tell straight away Joel had a military background by how he conducted himself. He had this sense of composure that helped us in the moment. BURSTING INTO FLAMES We’d just got all three of them to a safe distance when the aircraft was completely engulfed by the flames. From the moment I dashed out of my car to the moment the plane exploded can’t have been more than two minutes. The emergency services arrived pretty quickly, and we were at the scene for a couple of hours while they dealt with the fire and cleared the roads. Perhaps it was the shock of the event, but Joel and I didn’t even really speak to each other afterwards – he went one way and I went the other. The family were treated at the scene for non-le threatening injuries, which was a relief for all of us. Thankfully, Stuart Moore, the pilot, and his nephew and niece Jack Moore, , and Billie Manley, , have all since made a full recovery. When I got back to the car, I turned around and looked at the ball of flames.  Giacomo and I stared at each other, almost laughing in relief. It was a surreal moment – things like this only happen in films. We drove the rest of the journey in silence, stunned. After I got home, I told my we Joanne, and I don’t think she – or the rest of the family – understood the magnitude of the day. It was obviously a shock to hear what had happened, but it was only when I started getting calls from the media that they started to realise it was something a bit bigger.  The following day Joel and I were put on a call together by a radio station. It was a strange reunion, but a chance for us to speak over the phone in a calmer environment without the drama of the day before. A few days after, we were asked to go on This Morning on ITV. Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby read out a message for us from the survivors as we sat on the sofa and the gravity of the situation started to set in.  It had been a roller coaster up to that point, so my mind was all over the place. Afterwards I spoke to the family, and that was the first time the emotion of the whole thing hit me. I kept randomly bursting into tears. Jack and Billie were suffering a lot more than I was. Although they were safe, the memory of being inside that burning plane would have been more of an emotional scar. THE GREATEST HONOUR  Six months on, it’s made me look at things completely dferently. It’s changed me as a person and I don’t tend to take things as seriously any more. It was an amazing feeling to be acknowledged for the Pride Of Britain award. I didn’t expect it. I thought it was one of my mates having a laugh with me, so when they finally convinced me, I was speechless. I spoke to Joel and he was made up as well.

The web giants – which carried disturbing pictures – said certain photos did NOT breach their rules. Amelia’s brother Harry begged for an image of her sand-covered tattooed arm to be removed. But Instagram refused to step in. It was only last night, after pressure from the Sunday Mirror, that Facebook removed the most intrusive post. Others were still online. One Instagram image was uploaded by a US ghoul famed for gory posts of bodies, foetuses and severed limbs.  Harry – who helped search in vain for -year-old Amelia – urged followers: “Get this shared and get this f*****g insensitive women to stop posting pictures of my dead sister.” His sister Georgie, , shared the post and pleaded: “Please report.” A friend claimed Amelia’s -year-old nephew had seen the image. The scandal comes just weeks after the social media site vowed to tighten its rules on self-harm and mutilation images. Deputy Labour leader Tom Watson MP said: “This is completely disgraceful from Instagram. “Amelia’s family should have their privacy and wishes respected. Instagram’s standards are clearly morally redundantthey don’t rule these posts in breach of guidelines. “This proves how urgently we need a tech regulator to hold companies account for decisions like this.”  Disturbing photos of Amelia’s body began to emerge on Facebook, and then Instagram, hours after her body was found in the sea off the Cambodian isle of Koh Rong. On Facebook, locals posted pictures appearing to show her body. One showed her floating after fishermen found her. But it was a close-up of one of the images which sparked fury when it was reposted on Instagram by the US ghoul, who has .million followers. It showed a distinctive Highland cow tattoo on Amelia’s arm. Other users also reported it to Instagram.  One wrote: “I’ve spoken to Amelia’s brother and he’s shocked and angry. “For everyone’s information, Amelia was only found yesterday and the family had been searching for five days. For this to be posted almost exactly at the same time is not okay!” But a spokesman for Facebook, which also owns Instagram, defended their position, telling the Sunday Mirror: “We’re saddened by the news about Amelia Bambridge and our thoughts go out to her family and friends. “We have clear rules against posting graphic content, when we are made aware of this content we remove it. People often use Facebook and Instagram to share stories in the news and this can result in content appearing that some may find upsetting.”  The social network giant initially said that while the images could cause distress, they were not in breach of their community guidelines. Amelia went missing in Cambodia  days ago and was found on Thursday. She is believed to have accidentally drowned after leaving a beach party. The picture reported by brother Harry, from Worthing, West Sussex, was posted on an account with a caption that said: “Forensic Friday! Tattoo identication was super helpful this week in an investigation involving a young woman. “Her family provided multiple photos, including the top photo of her tattoo of a Highland cow.

Thomas Dunning said he had always been a victim of cyber-bullying at school where he got aposbeaten up on a daily basisapos.He told Lincolnshire Live : I went to sixth form and later applied to do an apprenticeship. In that same year my brother died. I think because I had a reason, an excuse to distract myself, I did and sunk into my studies.Over the next five years, I finished my apprenticeship and got my degree in mechanical engineering. I hadnapost allowed myself to deal with my brotheraposs death and I believe that was the trigger for my psychosis. Thomas, , heard voices in the head and also experienced hallucinations.    My partner Amber, who is now my we, at the time was basically on the verge of walking out and she told me thatshe was going to stay then I would need to change my le. Thomas started to reach out and seek help, even confiding in several of his close friends about the dficulty he was facing. I explained to them why I had scars on my hands and why they couldnapost come over because the house was always trashed, said Thomas. Several of my friends set up fake social media accounts and sent abusive messages to people I knew, pretending to be me. I had become a victim of cyber abuse at the hands of people I thought were my close friends. One evening I received a message from people I worked with at the time telling me to not bother coming into work because they know what Iaposm like.    Feeling depressed, Thomas decided to give up on his le and kissed Amber before going into the garage to hang himslef. He continued: By some fluke, the joint on the pipe I had used gave way, I think there had been a leak there and it had rusted. Amber came in as I had been in the garage for a long time. I couldnapost see properly, but I just remember seeing this bright light as the garage door opened. It was as though I could see my heart beating in my eyes. Thomas was taken to hospital where mental health doctors diagnosed him with PTSD, social anxiety and borderline personality disorder. Amber took on the role as his carer and attended group sessions. He said: Amber convinced me one day to go along to one of the sessions. At this point with my diagnosis, I couldnapost understand how I was going to get any better.  But I went along. It was a group session and in that group was another man, who ran his own business, who had also been diagnosed with PTSD. He was very open and spoke about his experience. This was a turning point for me, because before this I had never thought that anybody who suffered with similar issues could move on and achieve what he had. It changed my outlook completely, meeting people like me and being able to open up conversation. Thomas set up a podcast with a friend where they discussed mental health, sport, culture and Ru Paulaposs Drag Race. I started to do things that I enjoyed and that made me feel good. I enjoyed running the podcast with my friend and started looking around for more I could do, said Thomas. I remembered when my partner and I first got together, we took part in a running event together and I loved it. At the time I was  stone, so the sight of me running wasnapost pretty. But gradually I got more and more into it and loved it and the impact it made on my mental health.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBeware student loan statements. They’re dangerous and misleading. I wish I could tell you to rip ’em up without looking at them, but occasionally there’s ­practical info you need. Over million uni leavers still have outstanding loans, and many panic on seeing £s in interest added each month – a ­financial canker that’s led some into making catastrophic decisions. No surprise that one of the most common questions I’m asked by those with a little spare cash is: “Should I be trying to clear my student loan ”For detailed help see mse.me studentoverpay , but in brief…Which student loan plan do you have  There are three main types.Plan : All from England or Wales who started university in or after , including current students. Plan : All who started university between  and , and Scottish and Northern Irish students since. Mortgage-style loans: All those who started between  and . Plan  loans: These are the ­scariest as the debt can be up to £,.The interest is high, too. It changes ­annually with inflation, but for this academic year .% is added while at university then .%-.%, depending on income, when you leave. Yet while this is what statements show, for most these numbers are irrelevant as what you oweISN’T what you pay back. What you repay each year depends solely on what you earn.    You repay % of earnings over £, . Earn less and you pay nowt. In effect it’s like a % additional tax, because your annual repayments stay the same whether you owe £, or £ million. The prime dference the amount owed makes is whether you’ll clear the loan or not within the  years before it wipes.  It’s estimated by the Institute for Fiscal Studies that % WON’T. Of course those who never earn over the threshold won’t repay owt at all. Those who earn just above it will repay some of their original loan but no interest. Mid- earners may pay the loan and some interest, but less than inflation, so there’s no “real cost”. Mid-to-high-earners may pay real interest, but still not everything on the statement. So for all those groups, the interest you see added to your statement is NOT the interest you pay. The only people for whom statements tell the truth is that top % of earners who’ll clear within the  years.  Tragically, the pressure of seeing that oft-irrelevant interest build-up pushes people to make mistakes. One woman told me she’d used an inheritance of a few thousand to overpay her student loan to “reduce the interest”. Yet she was a low earner, so that overpayment’s unlikely to reduce what she’ll pay in future by even a penny. It’s money flushed down the loo, as you can’t get back what you voluntarily overpay. Therefore those with spare cash should use it first to clear other expensive debt. After that, save it to reduce the need for future borrowing.I’d suggest building up a mortgage deposit – a far better use of the cash mse.me LetimeISAs .After all, with other debts they still chase youyou lose your job, but with student loans lower income means you don’t repay. Only those who’ll be consistently high earners over the  years, and won’t need to borrow anywhere , can truly say, “The interest is higher than I can earn saving, so I’ll pay it off”.

The nursery - named Explorosity Education - has its own separate baby lounge, toddler room, Kindergarten and forest school. Pictures show how the rooms are a match for any Grand Designs-style award-winning property or a five-star hotel accommodation.Eleanor has indulged her passion for interior design which is matched by her professionalism in Early Years Teaching, reports Grimsby Live .The baby room is booked until  and one mother has even booked in her baby who hasnapost been born yet.  It has been crazy. We have a waiting list for children who are not yet born and donapost yet have a name, she said.

Eleanor, , has worked in early years education for  years and was formerly a relief manager at a nursery. She managed a nursery in Scunthorpe from  up until March this year.  I have always wanted to own my own nursery, she told Grimsby Live.

That is soa child wants just to sit down and have a cuddle and story read to them there is plenty of opportunity, said Eleanor.  There are lots of activities for collaboration and communication and children can always look around and see that provides stimulation for their next stage of learning. Sustainability is also an important  part of their learning and we want all our children to value the resources around them. We grow our own fruit and vegetables, told Eleanor. She said: Our setting promotes aposHyggeapos and aposZenapos whereby we create spaces our children can feel safe and relaxed. They can become absorbed within their surroundings fueling their fire for learning.  Even having opened a fortnight ago, the staff have already built up links with the wider Waltham community. They want the children to have fresh experiences thanks to the activities at Waltham Windmill Museum and the miniature train attraction. The children will also learn about the local churches and inter-generational links with visits to old folks homes.

Kids of the s may well remember the polite but stern aposNot the child- The sparklerapos ads, maybe even the cute aposKing of the Roadapos Safety Hedgehogsapos. But for the generation before that, the video arm of the now defunct aposCentral Office of Informationapos clearly had an aposanything goes policyapos when it came to public safety videos. From the grim reaper delighting in a child drowning, to a cat intervening in a child abduction case, these are the nightmarish cautionary tales that a generation were raised on. . Donapost Start November th Like This For a generation that wore that much nylon anything flammable was a risk, but to say the ads where on the terrying side was an understatement. The ad showed a little girl who had decided to handle a sparkler, not knowing they could remain hot long after theyaposd burnt out. As you might imagine the caption aposDonapost start November th like thisapos followed by a bandaged child,  was enough to scare most children away from sparklers for le.  The stepped up versions of these adverts, aimed at older children, included a firework exploding in a childaposs face after being thrown at her. But one ad in particular that scared us witless was shot entirely from behind the child, later revealing he had been blinded by a firework that also exploded in his face.  But despite their seemingly over the top message, fireworks when handled improperly are a real danger. Stay safe out there.  The film aimed at seven to ten-year-olds was commissioned by the COI in response to the high number of child drowning cases in the UK during the s. The sombre film involved a creepy voice over from none other than aposThe spirit of lonely waterapos who looked an awful lot like, well, the grim reaper. The commentary opens with I am the spirit of dark and lonely water: ready to trap the unwary, the showoff, the fool... and to a shot of the grim reaper in the reeds . The film shows bunch of children playing on a construction sitebefore a child is sucked into a watery vortex trying to retrieve his football. The voice then says the show offs are easy, but the unwary ones are easier still as another child is dragged to a watery grave.  Cut to a shot of the danger no swimming sign, with the voice saying Only a fool would ignore this. But thereaposs one born every minute. Lastly the camera pans through a rusty, dysentery ridden embankment, where a bunch of children pull a boy out of the water. The spirit of lonely water says sensible children, I have no power over them before dissolving and maniacally cackling Iaposll be back as the children throw his shawl into the water. But as most of the children who watched it at the time will tell you what the film actually did was deter most children from swimming ever again.  Charlie Says was a series of six short animated films about a boy called Tony and his cat Charlie aimed at children. Charlie, a cat with a voice that grated worse than your tape getting stuck recording Top , used to warn Tonyagainst everything from matches to scalding hot kettles. But one episode that continues to haunt the memories of  British children everywhere was about never going off with strangers. The film starts with Tony saying Charlie and I were in the park. Then this man came up and said would I like to see some puppies  And I said Yes. And I was going to go but Charlie stopped me. It finishes with Tony saying Charlieaposs reminded me I shouldnapost go off with people I donapost know. Then the man went away. We went and told mummy and she said weaposd been very good. The film provides a haunting window to the past, to a decade living in the wake of the Moorsapos murders, a time where many people mistakenly believed only strangers hurt children.  It must be quite comforting to know you survived a generation where even fridges could kill you. This was a genuine public information film, illustrating the dangers of discarded aposlockapos friges. And in fairness they were very dangerous,a child got locked inside they could suffocate, because as the advert points out, fridges were impossible to open from the inside. The advert opened with the line, to her itaposs a caravan, a ship, a castle, even a bed. The wonder of magnetic locks has somewhat diminished this threat but the creepy film still remains.  Play Safe consisted of three films, highlighting the dangers of playing near electrical equipment such as overhead lines, electrical substations and pylons. Each film was part of a longer film to be shown in schools, and as you might expect some dramatic license was used to scare children straight. It was commissioned by the Electricity Council, and featured an animated robin and owl. But the final film Frisbee, was not narrated, and struck rather a more sombre tone. The film showed two children sneaking into a substation to retrieve a frisbee, the children had seen older children sneak in the week before, and Jimmy decides to go first.  He climbs onto a transducer, and the last thing we see is his legs on fire and his friend screaming Jimmy. The radio plays telling viewers that a sixty six thousand volt shock killed a boy when he broke into a substation. The last scene showed a cap and school blazer lying vacant near the porch. Bleak. The film was later replaced with a film called aposPowerful Stuffapos which placed a greater emphasis on older children.    On the surface Tufty is no more scary than any of the clangers, the Magic Roundabout characters, or Rainbow puppets of the s. But thereaposs something about Tuftyaposs leless eyes that unnerve people. That and the fact most of Tuftyaposs woodland palls keep getting hit by trucks which is rather a downer for children.  Tuftyaposs information films definitely arenapost for the iPhone generation, but at the time he was a dynamite way of teaching young children about road safety. But one problem with the films lies in the fact the cartoons tone has aged really badly. Willy Weasel is hit by a car, and the Police Officer badger pretty much drags him out the road and says on your bike son, giving the pair a brief scolding of Oh you are silly boys to play in the road. Not one person rang an ambulance, then again in those days it probably would have come rather late anyway.

Endometriosis is a painful disorder in which tissue similar to the tissue that normally lines the inside of your uterus — the endometrium — grows outside your uterus.The -year-old told Cornwall Live that battling heavy periods and agonising pain led to the deterioration of her mental health.To top it off, she was then diagnosed with a similar condition, adenomyosis, in which the inner lining of the uterus breaks through the muscle wall of the uterus.    For many, the only cure is a hysterectomy. Jade said that medics told her that her symptoms were “just something that women have to put up with. She said: “Years went by and I thought this was just what being a woman was about. I figured it was a bit rubbish but I dealt with it. It settled down in my late teens and in my early s it all started again. “I started to get such painful and heavy periods that I would pass out and vomit.

It is a relatively common condition, primarily affecting girls and women of childbearing age. It is less common among women who have been through menopause. It can cause painful or heavy periods, and may also lead to infertility, fatigue and bowel and bladder problems.Approximately . million women in Britain live with endometriosis. While it is a long-term condition, for which there is no cure, treatments to ease symptoms are available. More information from the NHS is available here   She added: “She gave me another prescription for another type of hormone pill, even after I explained they donapost help me and make it worse. GPs kept telling me the pain was in my head. Even after ending up in AE in so much pain no one would take me seriously.” She finally achieved a breakthrough when, at , she visited a dferent GP, who officially diagnosed her with endometriosis. Jade said: “I had never even heart of it. She then referred me to the gynecology team at Royal Cornwall Hospital. She says that the surgeons also discovered that she had a bulky uterus, which was caused by adenomyosis. Unlike endometriosis, which can be treated with hormone therapy, the only treatment for adenomyosis is a hysterectomy. With her new diagnosis, doctors have finally given Jade the green light for a hysterectomy. First, they will medically induce menopause.

While the vessel was anchored off Barbados, Renate F, and her husband, Volker, told Reise they were having very loud consensual sex but forgot that their balcony door was open. Afterwards, Renate said the pair began arguing loudly, but claimed there was no violence and no damage to their accomodation.    Later, Volker was in the shower and Renate smoking a cigarette on their balcony when a manager, accompanied by a security guard, came to their room and told them the captain had ordered them to leave the cruise ship. After disembarking in Barbados, the couple say they were stranded, and were forced to pay thousands to catch a flight back to Paris, where they took a train home to Germany. The couple are now thought to be suing the holiday company for damages, including compensation for pain and reimbursement for travel expenses.

But with its population is dwindling and many buildings sitting empty, Mayor Vincenzo Giambrone has launched an ambitious scheme to save his home town and its historic centre. He is convincing owners of abandoned family homes to hand over the keys to the crumbling buildings to new residents who are willing to fix them up and put down roots. Couples who have a baby after moving in will be given a cash bonus.    Buyers must submit a refurbishment proposal, pay a , eurodeposit and agree to renovate the property within three years. The deposit will be ed once the renovations are complete and the building is turned into a family home or a business such as a BB, shop or restaurant. Priority is being given to young couples with children.    Couples who move in and later have a baby will be given a , eurobonus.Mr Giambrone told CNN Travel that he is determined to make the town, which sits at an elevation of about ,ft, a vibrant place to live again.He said: I canapost stand to see this gorgeous, old historical centre empty and turn into a ruin. It hurts me.  Mr Giambrone said some of the neglected buildings are at risk of collapsing. There are more than  abandoned houses in the town. About a dozen empty stone buildings are currently available and ready for new residents. UK-based businessman Jose Augusto Manetta Ramos was tempted by the prospect of living in a sleepy village with a warm climate. Calling it a perfect retreat, the Brazilian-Italian sales executive said: Cammarata is stunning, the green landscape, the sea and mountains are both nearby just like the Valley of the Templesand other great spots.

This dress was reused too! It was first made during the s from silk brocade. It was altered during the s as a fancy dress outfit that included fashionable elements of the late-Victorian era, such as a point at the bottom of the bodice.The machine-made lace was a Victorian add-on too. Silk was valuable, and clothes were often unpicked and reworked into something more fashionable.Or how about matching costumes  This boy’s cream satin fancy-dress costume was made in the late th Century. It is in the style of an th Century outfit with brocade jacket, waistcoat and knee breeches. Childrenswear in the th Century mirrored their parent’s clothes. Little boys often dressed in small replica outfits matching their father’s.Will you look at world cultures for your fancy-dress inspiration  National dress and folk costumes inspired fancy-dress during the late Victorian era.This Bolivian-inspired fancy dress costume dates to the early s. It shows how elaborate fancy dress costumes of this period could be. The lilac silk skirt has a matching fitted bodice decorated with cream lace. The net headdress has been stfened with wire.The cultures of the Middle East and Asia have long been a source of inspiration within fashion, design and the arts. The exotic and elaborate costumes of India were attractive to Victorians and inspired many fancy dress costumes. This cream silk Indian outfit has a robe-style jacket decorated with gold thread and beads, salwar trousers, shirt, cummerbund, hat, shoes and a peacock feather fan.For the Victorians there was no end to fancy-dress themes, with partygoers taking inspiration from animals, history, royalty, the military, the seasons, literature and fairy tales.

The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.

Two men were paid to accompany Patrick the Fool on his journey from England to provide entertainment for the King and his guests while residing at Tarbert.Also recorded is a figure for #making a suit for the King at Tarbert#.  Bruce visited Tarbert on many occasions. His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction. Whilst this work was underway, James summoned parliament to meet him here to discuss matters local to the area. This meeting took place on July  .Over the years, many travellers of note have passed this way and commented on Tarbert and its scenic surroundings.In  Thomas Pennant arrived by sea at East Loch Tarbert and described the scenery as #picturesque#.CGS Teighnmouthpassed through the Kyles of Bute in  and commented that #it offers no scenery worthy of notice#. He continued to note that #the romantic little harbour of East Loch Tarbert – with the overhanging keep of its ruined castle # form a scene singularly picturesque#. He became a frequent visitor to Tarbert.In  Lord Cockburndescribed the Kyles as #rugged and picturesque# but, arriving at his destination, exclaimed: #But Tarbert! East Tarbert! How is it that I had never even heard of that curious little bay. There it lay, calm and silvery, like a scene from a theatre. A striking and beautul spot.#In the modern era, many thousands of tourists visit Tarbert each year.

Around  resident berth holders and more than , visiting leisure craft during the sailing season add considerably to the numbers who arrive at Tarbert and appreciate the attractive surroundings.The present plans for the power line, however, as exhibited by SSEN, will present a view on entering the harbour despoiled by a line of monster pylons.The current proposal suggests that four or five of the -foot pylons will dominate the western skyline. The visual impact of this scheme as presently proposed will have a negative effect on the experience of everyone who lives in, or visits, Tarbert.Tarbert was designated as a conservation area in the s. Argyll and Bute Council imposes restrictions on works likely to have a visual impact on its appearance.But the council has apparently raised no objection to this visually damaging proposal. Similarly, Visit Scotland is reported as having raised no objection as well as closing all its tourist offices in Cowal, Mid Argyll and Kintyre in the past year.With the recent decline in the Loch Fyne fishing industry, Tarbert is increasingly dependent on tourism to provide employment.Other issues include the sterilisation of ground under the proposed line of overhead wiring. Opportunities to extend social housing will be restricted under the present plan.OFGEM administers a £ million fund set up to mitigate the impact of electricity infrastructure on national parks and #scenic areas#.Tarbert, along with its harbour and the isthmus linking it with West Loch Tarbert, without doubt, constitutes a #scenic area#.Reconsideration of this proposal is essential."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column october 4 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsTo an observer, it seems that Argyll and Bute Council is, at best, confused over its approach to autism.The people who know this best are those affected by the condition and their families and their view of senior council officials was made crystal clear when Autism Argyll gave up banging its head against a brick wall a year ago.Little seems to have changed since then.A council Autism Strategy Group is apparently being bypassed in the formulation of a strategy, yet the councillor in charge of health and social care says the strategy is the responsibility of the HSCP.Yet again, it is people affected by autism who are losing out.

Her partner Rebecca Taylor read music as an organ scholar at Lincoln College, Oxford before attending the Royal Academy of Music where she was a Junior Fellow and completed the MA in Piano Accompaniment.The audience were introduced to the pair with an intense piece by Mozart about burning letters and it certainly woke us up. We moved onto Schubert’s #Du Bist Die Ruh# which was beautully controlled by both singer and pianist.This was contrasted with Shubert’s angsty #Gretchen am Spinnrade# and I commend Rebecca Taylor for playing the right hand part with ease. The journey then moved through Schumann and into Brahms where the audience murmured in agreement at the rollercoaster of emotions before us.As we reached Wolf the themes took a darker turn in a short but intense piece about crying tears of blood. Swtly moving onto Strauss and Mahler the audience were given songs of simple love, a sing off between a cuckoo and a nightingale and a man in great pain which reigned the audience in with a spiritual lull.The second half opened with a stunning rendition of Faure’s #Apres Un Reve#. Through Debussy’s impressionist piece, Rinaldo Hahn’s Operatic journey and into Du Parc comforting his love with a dream like harp created by the piano.The duo then gave us a contemporary piece by Joseph Horowitz which comprised of snippets from the monologues of Shakespeare’s Lady Macbeth and the music tracks her descent into madness. It was aAs a light and fun ending we were given #I can be a sexy lady#, a piece about poor mezzos and how they always play boys and not much  in operas.

This was followed by Debussy#s Premiere Rhapsodie which was written as a test piece for a competition at the Paris Conservatoire this requires of the performer the full range of colour and technique which was deftly delivered. Finally we were given Poulenc#s last Sonata. In this, and many of his works, he was rebelling against the Impressionist style and was particularly reflected in the outer fast movements with often angular and zany writing.The second half of the programme started with the Saints-Saens#s Sonata # also his last work. Unlike Poulenc, here he was harping back to the th century#s more classical style style of composition.Their official programme ended with a highly-virtuosic rendition of Chausson#s Andante and Allegro, but we were also given a short and charming encore # one of Gerald Finzi#s three pieces for clarinet and piano.This was all chamber music of the highest quality Maximiliano#s musicality, technique, emotional expression and tonal range were exemplary as indeed were those of his accompanist, Scott. It was patently obvious from their opening bars that they had played many times together with the rapport between them a delight to witness.

It will include a new toilet, shower, laundry and kitchen building,  new camping pitches and  motor home pitches, most of which will have hook-ups.The total project will cost around £,. In addition to HIE’s contribution will be an award of £, from the Rural Tourism Infrastructure Fund, with the balance from IGHT.It is expected that the modern site will strengthen the local economy by an additional £, a year and that other businesses on Gigha will benefit from the increase in footfall and visitor spend.The Isle of Gigha camp and motorhome site is due to welcome its first visitors in autumn , after which it will be open throughout the year.Strategic planning to secure a strong, sustainable future for the Mount Stuart Trust and the Isle of Bute is at an advanced stage, with key decisions expected by spring .Speaking ahead of the next phase of community consultations, Colin Boag, managing director of Mount Stuart Trust, said: #We are working intensively with community groups, Argyll and Bute Council and the Scottish Land Commission to develop a range of initiatives to improve the rural and urban landscapes on the island of Bute and to unlock growth opportunities for the local economy.#There is a great sense of purpose and commitment from everyone involved. This is matched by a desire to make progress on a number of crucial projects. The trust will conclude a strategic review by the end of the year. In conducting this - year ‘look forward’, we have been well supported through discussions with iniduals and community bodies across the island.#As part of the overall review, we are creating a specic rural strategy focussed on building a sound, sustainable future for farming and forestry on the island. Following an initial consultation with key stakeholders in July, we are developing the rural strategy through a number of joint working groups. These are examining key priorities including dairy farming, rural training and skills, forestry development and the environment.#Our emerging rural strategy builds on work completed with Argyll and Bute Council to support their bid to the Scottish and UK governments for a multi-million-pound Rural Growth Deal. Working together with the council, Fyne Futures and the Bute Island Alliance, we drew up a proposal for investment of £million to pilot on Bute a new transformative rural development model for niche food and drink and primary island industries.The trust is also consulting with local communities about the proposals to release urban land for community projects. This important work is being conducted in line with the Scottish Land Commission’s protocol on community engagement.In August, Mount Stuart Trust, with Scottish Land Commission representatives, held an urban community workshop with key community organisations in Rothesay. Discussion centred on how potential community projects could utilise land in Rothesay, which is currently in either council or trust ownership.Colin Boag added: #Throughout the discussions with ious community representatives, a number of local groups have expressed interest to make use of some or all of the land on offer. We welcome their interest in creating opportunities for positive change on the Isle of Bute.#I am confident that the depth of collaboration between Argyll and Bute Council, the Land Commission, local communities and the trust is set bring a strong sense of renewal and confidence to the island.#It was a trip to the Co-op and trollies at the ready for Lochgilphead High School pupils, as they were set a mission in aid of the Argyll Foodbank.Staff from the school ided the group of S pupils into teams, giving each an inidual budget to stick to.

The money raised from this was then matched by school funds to give an overall budget of £.Over  items were purchased by the pupils on Thursday October , using their Young Scot cards to benefit from a  per cent discount and remembering to collect valuable points on their Co-op membership cards.The school has decided to make contributions to the food bank throughout the year, particularly focusing on Easter, Halloween and Christmas."},{"url":null,"title":"21-year-old-accused-injuring-ex","story":"A STOW man has been accused of struggling violently with his former partner to her injury.David Steel, , of Mitchelson Farm Cottages, denies the offence said to have happened at the Tesco Car Park in Galashiels on June .A trial date has been fixed for December  at Selkirk Sherf Court."},{"url":null,"title":"talisk-set-memorable-homecoming","story":"THEY are amongst the most successful folk musicians to have come out of the Borders.And next weekend they willhome and take to the stage in Melrose.In the five years they have been performing, Sottish firebrands, Talisk have stacked up several major awards for their explosively energetic yet artfully woven sound, including lsquoFolk Band of the Yearrsquo at the BBC Alba Scots Trad Music Awards in , and a BBC Radio  Folk Award.Musicians, Mohsen Amini, Hayley Keenan, and Graeme Armstrong seamlessly meld together the notes from their concertina, fiddle, and guitar to produce a multi-layered, enthralling signature sound that has effortlessly captivated audiences throughout the UK, USA, and Australia.They have amassed a die-hard following, and the folk music and world music media have heaped praise on the trio.The release of their hotly anticipated second album, Beyond, last October was met with a -star lsquoTop of the Worldrsquo review in Songlines, with praise for the band as incredibly infectious and endearinghellip fresh, invigorating, accomplished and playfully frisky,With appearances at festivals include the Cambridge Folk Festival, Denmarkrsquos Toslashnder, the Philadelphia Folk Festival, Celtic Colours, Milwaukee Irish Festival, and five successive outings at Glasgowrsquos Celtic Connections, Talisk are ready toto the Borders and show us what they can do.Promoter Becki Hodgson from hosts Live Borders told us: \"This musical event promises to delight and excite.\"We are extremely privileged to be hosting such prolic and local grown multi-award-winning musicians.\"Talisk will be on stage on Sunday, November  at Melrose Corn Exchange.Tickets are priced at pound in advance and pound on the door.

And a reminder that Im not getting any younger as I try to grow old gracefully.JCCs, now a septuagenarian, style has remained a constant.His image of the suit, shagpile black hair and sunglasses remain intact. His social realism poetic constructs seem relevant today as they did during his inception, extrapolated initially from the often nihilism and tales of social decay that earmarked punk mark one.Poetry is often a barometer of an epoch or epochs. Combining observation and the written word. JCC has become a master of mind imagery, social commentary, surrealism, and semantics and above all story telling. We get it because it resonates with us.It is us or we know someone who it references. Sometimes dystopian, often hilarious and never dull. Add the heavy Salfordian brogue the chemistry set is complete.The performance was slightly peculiar to what I was expecting.Maybe my expectations were misguided or unrealistic. There were some long periods of stand-up comedy that laboured at times.It was only when \"Johnny\" ed to his natural home of poetry recital that he got back on track. Though his joke about Billy Bragg being in crisis because he hadnt released an album in two weeks, I found amusing.But when he got back to the poetry it was a reminder why most people were here.Most poems were from the back catalogue and instantly recognisable. A greatest hit set list.JCC proceeded with Hire Car and the sharply expletive named Get Back on Drugs You Fat F***.Well it was an adult show after all.Common language for common poetry. And it never did Billy Connelly any harm. The poem insinuating it was easier to lose weight being on drugs.Beasley Street, arguably his most well-known poem received one of the best reactions of the night. Imbued with the description of a rock bottom street, a dreg of society and where everything that could go wrong did in this street. A caricature of a threadbare existentialism. Mainly bought on by social and economic deprivation.And then a natural supersession in the form of an epilogue Beasley Street Bouled recital, as the street had now changed into middle class suburbia.Next up Ive Fallen in Love with My We. A reference to marriage, the vows and marital bliss. Tongue in cheek of course.The \"bloody song\" Evidently Chickentown, was greeted with widespread applause. More nihilistic scorn and deprecation of a town, that is in a state of dys.Funny how we tend to laugh at the misfortune of others. But we do.Twat was another poem that represented consistency in tonights performance. A crowd pleaser for all times. Twat being the ultimate character assassination and castout. Bringing sporadic fits of laughter within the audience.The closing recital I Wanna Be Yours, famously adopted by The Arctic Monkeys for one of their songs, represented a slight U-turn in the writing of JCC. More linked to a character who wishes to show an undying love for someone . The positives of the human condition. Did I detect some optimism!The MacArts performance had poetry that mixes modernity with the historical. Comedic in value.When we laugh, we are laughing at ourselves. With him, not at him.

There are many people walking around freely drinking during these times.ldquoThis makes it dficult to identy those young people who are underage drinking when there are such crowds.Another wrote: ldquoIntoxication in these areas is unpleasant to witness. In all cases we are entitled not to be subject to the loudness and antisocial behaviour this leads to.On the other hand, some respondents voiced their concerns about bringing in alcohol bylaws: ldquoI think itrsquos a complex situation which deserves time and thought. Irsquom not entirely sure that reacting in a retrospective way is the best approach.ldquoI feel there are many behaviours and traditions entrenched in Scottish and Borders society around drinking habits.ldquoI feel personally that there are alternatives for many people socially that do not centre around drinking or going to the pub, such as the cinema, concerts, sports, dining out, etc., but not everyone has the imagination or willingness to explore these as valid ways to enjoy yourself.Another objector wrote: ldquoDrinking in public places doesnrsquot cause a problem in itself. Issues arise when certain iniduals drink alcohol to excess in any setting.ldquoThe problem, in my view, wonrsquot be solved by a blanket ban on alcohol in public spaces. There are already laws to prevent antisocial behaviour but they need enforced.Police Scotland also provided a detailed response to the consultation. It reads: ldquoAlcohol bylaws are used within the three other local council areas within Lothian and Borders, namely East Lothian, Midlothian and West Lothian.ldquoBy having such bylaws in force it assists Police Scotland in reducing anti-social behaviour and violence both of which are known to have an association with drinking in public.ldquoCurrently the Scottish Borders area is the only local authority area in Scotland that does not have bylaws restricting the consumption of alcohol in public places.NHS Borders, Borders Alcohol and Drug Partnership and Scottish Borders Children and Young Peoplersquos Leadership Group provided a joint response, which reads: ldquoAlcohol consumption can take place in our communitiesrsquo private space as well as within licensed premises.ldquoNot allowing people to drink in a public place will help to reduce the normalisation of alcohol being an ordinary commodity and builds communities and environments that supports a culture change and reduces exposure for our children and young people.ldquoPublic drinking can adversely affect the quality of le for residents and our communities.ldquoAlcohol Focus Scotland report that one in two Scots experience harm from anotherrsquos drinking and often this harm is experienced in public spaces .ldquoIn this study % had experienced harm to others in public places and this was mostlyexperienced by the younger age group .ldquoAlcohol bylaws can be used as an additional tool to reduce the nuisance and disorder normally associated with public drinking.ldquoLicensed premises are well regulated within the Scottish Borders and provide the opportunity to consume alcohol in a safe environment.ldquoThe Scottish Borders is the only local authority area in Scotland that does not have bylaws restricting the consumption of alcohol in public places.Councillors will now be asked whether to conduct further consultation on two options: a blanket ban on public drinking to cover the whole of the Borders, or the introduction of an alcohol ban in certain areas of the Borders.

Sheeran.\"Tommys new EP, Golden Arrow, was released in April via Wow and Flutter Records.Therersquos a lot of contrast and colour throughout the tracks but the music lives in the same world as his first EP, Restless Love, thanks to Grammy award-winning producer, Sam Okell.Sam knew instinctively when to leave a track stripped back simply using Tommyrsquos pure vocal, acoustic guitar rhythms and a few atmospheric touches, and when to bring in much bolder production.The new EP has won support and plaudits galore from the tastemaker press such as Record Of The Day, When The Horn Blows and Celebmix, as well as Fearne Cotton, BBC Radio , BBC Scotland and ious Spoty editorial playlists.Clash Magazine hit the nail on the head when it praised Tommyrsquos wonderfully fresh songwriting which

That race took place over the course of last weekend.The series featured five rounds at dferent venues, and each race was set up like a car rally, with untimed uphill transition stages leading to ious timed downhill sections, the results of which were amalgamated into an overall race time. The stages ied massively in , from as little as  seconds to an absolute behemoth we endured at Laggan in April which took us  minutes to ride! The topography and trail surface dfered wildly from venue to venue but also from stage to stage, and the taped trails we raced down last weekend at Fort William epitomised this eclectic set-up.Stage  was the easiest and least technical track we have raced on all year, an entirely man-made sprint through flowing banked corners coated in compacted quarry dust. Of course you had to be careful you didn`t push too hard, it is all too easy to wreck a race run by hitting the deck on an easy stage. We assumed that the organisers were trying to lull us into a  sense of security with stage #and we were so right!Stage  started halfway down the legendary World Cup track , channelling riders through some savage rock gardens before cutting off to the right along a lung-busting fireroad before descending into another sculpted hardpack track which then erted down a horrendously muddy, freshly cut chute that was littered with roots big enough to swallow a bike wheel whole. Even walking down it was impossible.A big transition ride towards Torlundy took us to the top of stage , which was the famous Blue Crane trail running into Ridgeline. Both of these tracks are black-graded on a good day, but there is a huge dference between trying to ride these ‘for fun’ and then trying to race on them once  people have spent a whole Saturday skidding them to bits in the tipping rain! A lot of people fell foul of this stage, but we survived and we absolutely loved it.Stage  was a dferent animal altogether. We had tackled it fairly early on practice day and hadn`t had any issues with it, but the swarm of maniacs who had ridden it in the rain since our earlier visit had turned it into an absolute swamp and the ruts were so deep that I found it almost impossible to negotiate with my limited skills. Dave telling me afterwards that he had romped it didn`t help my mood one bit!The last  stages were so high up the mountain that we needed a trip on the gondola to get to them. The black graded Top Chief track is a fearsome animal that follows the best twisty bedrock line around the hill before plummeting several hundred feet straight down off it into the tree line below, where it once again becomes sanitised into a flowing, twisty and utterly hilarious serpent of a trail that had riders drting and whooping all the way to the carpark. The organisers had cleverly split the Top Chief track into two stages, as there is a long section of perched wooden boardwalk high up on the mountain that is great fun to ride but would be far too dangerous to race on. Stage  was therefore very short -taking most riders about  seconds to ride- while stage  was a  minute monster. What a way to finish a season!So how did we do David was fastest of the three of us, as he has been all season. He finished in a time of  minutes,  seconds. He races in the Senior category , so it is a tough school littered with sponsored riders and crazy kids. He finished th in seniors on the day, and th overall out of an entry of  riders. Having failed to finish the race at Laggan earlier in the year due to a mechanical breakdown, David has been constantly playing catch-up but he still managed to finish in a brilliant nd place overall in the seniors category for the season.Alex has ridden consistently all year and has managed to tread the fine line between wrecking and ruling perfectly at every round. He had one of his very few crashes on the last stage at Fort William which cost him a few seconds, but he still ed a very respectable time of : to finish nd in the Masters category. The Masters section almost always attracts the largest entry and it is full of well-heeled chargers on very expensive steeds, so for Alex to finish in th place in that championshipin his first full season is a highly respectable result.I have continually been either on par or just slower than Alex on nearly every stage of the year, and nothing changed here. I knowI`ve kept within a few seconds of him I have done just fine, and I managed my ride to achieve this perfectly right up until the last stage where a cruel puncture right on top of the hill put paid to any chances of a good result to finish the year. With  top s already in the bag for the season though , I managed to hold onto th place in the Grand Veteran`s championship which was some consolation for a day that finished with me feeling, well, a bit deflated.Competing in this series has been a brilliant experience for us. We have had some hilarious times racing our bikes through some of Scotland`s very best scenery, and we have loved camping out of the back of vans. The organisers at No Fuss Events have done an outstanding job of setting up a professionally run race series in some dficult locations and have always managed to tread the right side of a precarious line, providing us with stages that have been just barely on the rideable side of ridiculous!David Muirhead leads Alex Dickson down the rocky Top Chief track during Saturday#s practice.

A high-energy showing in Paisley saw the McFadyens-sponsored side run out convincing winners.With the match going ahead at the Kibble’s grass park despite the heavy rain overnight and during the week leading up to the game, the surface was in surprisingly good condition, allowing the Pupils to get into their attacking flow early on.Up against a home side not lacking in height and physical stature, the Pupils had to be ready to contend with some lofted early balls from back to front by the hosts, whose game plan seemed to be to get the ball to their forwards as quickly as possible, but the Pupils# defence of Fraser Wylie, Ross Souden, Ryan McConnachie and Stuart Crossan, stood up to the task well.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils quick passing and inidual pace and skill in the final third caused the hosts problems early on, and Ryan Gilchrist and Gregor McFadyen, and both had almost identical attempts to score, but snatched at their shots at the vital moment.However, the Kintyre Park side would not be denied for long, and scored after  minutes through a sharp passing move that released Gregor McFayden, who buried an arrowed shot from the edge of the box to continue his excellent goalscoring form.Then, the visitors made it - after  minutes, when an enterprising move out of defence found right-back Crossan, whose ball through to Johnny McCormick allowed the right winger to cut inside onto his left foot and release a thunderous first-time drive into roof of the net for a great goal, his second of the season.After seeing their deficit doubled, Carlton for their part put their Kintyre visitors under a bit of pressure from several corners and free kicks, but the Pupils’ defensive discipline continued to win over.Into the second half, the Pupils made it - when Donald McCallum scored another great goal, in a move started by Liam Renton, whose in-swinging corner was cleared to the edge of the penalty box where the ex-Dumbarton man McCallum made space to drive a deflected shot into the top corner of the net.At this point in the match, all three subs were used, with Ellis Robertson and Michael McKinlay replacing the excellent deep-lying midfield pairing of Ryan Gilchrist and Liam Renton, and Ross Brown entering in the fray in a direct swap with winger McCormick.The youngster Brown quickly got involved to create the Pupils# fourth goal, outpacing the Carlton full-back to draw out the last defender and square the ball across for Scott Souden to cheekily chip the ball over the home keeper into the net.The rampant Pupils completed the scoring in the th minute after hesitation between a Carlton defender and his keeper allowed McFadyen to nip in, touch the ball round the keeper to score a simple but well-earned second goal, for his brace on the day, and his fourth of the season.At the other end, the Pupils were determined to get their second consecutive clean sheet in league action, and while young keeper Alistair Ferguson spilled a deflected free kick in the latter stages, he bravely ed at the feet of the striker to smother his effort. The Pupils management noted how Ferguson’s kicking and distribution was first-class throughout the match.A Pupils spokesman said: ‘It was a great team effort, with our attacking players working together to cause problems all game. At the back, we defended high balls and direct play really well.’The Pupils are in league action again tomorrowwhen they welcome Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star. Kick off is pm, with Kintyre Park the expected venue.The Pupils’ Liam Renton on the ball with Ryan Gilchrist looking on at Saturday#s match in Paisley.

George reminisced: ‘It was announced at a Town Council meeting that the Royal couple was scheduled to visit. It was all to be top secret, but that didn’t happen. The next morning the #secret# was ulged in a queue in one of the town’s shops and the news was out.’With a smile that showed how fond these memories are to him, George continued: ‘The Royal Yacht Britannia was anchored out in the loch and a small boat brought the Queen and Prince Philip to the quay where my father was delegated to catch and secure the rope. They were then driven to the Town Hall and there was a huge crowd present.‘Campbeltown Gaelic Choir, conducted by Mr M G McCallum who was also a councillor, had a lovely surprise for the Royal visitors. Prince Charles had just been made Prince of Wales, so the choir sang ‘God Bless the Prince of Wales’. This was very well received, and the Queen said that she had not heard it before.’George and Mrs McMillan were present at a reception given by the Town Council in the Town Hall. George remembers that he shook hands with the Queen and spoke with the Duke of Edinburgh. He said: ‘Only those invited could speak to the Queen, but the Duke moved among the gathering and spoke to some of the councillors. I was a coal miner at Machrihanish at that time and he asked me and some other miners about our work.’He continued: ‘The food and drinks were served on silver trays by waiters in tails and bow-ties. Afterwards, when the couple was taken on a tour of the town, the heavens opened and oh how it rained and rained.’A town councillor from May  to its disbanding in , and then a councillor on the District Council and the Strathclyde Regional Council, George was to meet the Queen and other members of the Royal Family on other occasions.

What is it I always do riddles when I tell stories. I think of riddles and stories as close cousins which support each other.A good brain-teasing riddle is usually fun, and children in particular love the challenge of solving a riddle, as well as making their own ones up.Irsquom often greeted with pleas for ldquoTim, tell us one more riddle when I enter a school, and Irsquom often challenged to solve a riddle made up by one of the children.They are an ancient form of learning and entertainment.The first discovered written riddles are close to , years old. They were written in Cuneorm, the writing of the ancient Sumerians.A shortened and simplied version of one of these earliest riddles is: ldquoA house you enter blind, but come out with sight. What kind of house is it  The answer is a school, although some may raise an eyebrow at this answer.Perhaps the most famous riddle from antiquity is the Riddle of the Sphinx to Oedipus, recorded in ancient Greek around the fth century BC: ldquoWhat is the creature that walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening The answer is a human being. When a baby we crawl on four legs, as an adult we walk on two legs, in old age we need a third leg .With my now continuous painful knee, this riddle has particular relevance for me, although Irsquom stubbornly resisting the stick!I use riddles as ice breakers in storytelling sessions and as an engagement technique because they quickly hook an audiencersquos attention since they are, by their nature, interactive.But they are also great fun to use with the children in your family.I use them to help distract and calm my younger ones when they are fractious. I use them in the morning when the kids are getting ready for school so they concentrate on them while they are getting ready.We make the riddles about the things we can see and the things we are doing, for example: ldquoTherersquos a big one and a wee one and three in between, we are two families of five, we are all going to nursery, but we are usually not seen. Who are we  The answer, of course, is my sonrsquos toes!For younger kids, itrsquos important to repeat riddles they already know the answer to. It helps them learn the riddle and how wordplay works. It also teaches them the rhythm of how they are told.My four-year-old is getting pretty good at this, although the answers to his own made-up riddles donrsquot always make sense.That doesnrsquot matter at this stage, whatrsquos important is hersquos developing an understanding of how they work and it encourages him to look for things to make riddles about.His nearly six-year-old sister likes to challenge him too.Her riddle ldquoI am short when I sit, I am long when I jump, what am I  had me thinking for some time before I got the answer: a frog.To make a riddle, think of the answer first. Then work the riddle up to the answer. It involves thinking about all the dferent qualities, uses of and parts of the answer and how they can be twisted or described dferently.For example, a shoe has a tongue but canrsquot talk, a clock has a face and hands but no body, a river has a bed but doesnrsquot sleep.Once introduced to riddle-making, children can get really engaged with it. A group of seven-eight-year-olds in a P class challenged me last week with a riddle they had made up themselves: ldquoI have a brain full of teacherrsquos knowledge, I crash without moving, I freeze while staying warm, what am I  The answer is a computer.Some riddles rhyme and it can be an extra challenge to think of a rhyming riddle, but they donrsquot have to rhyme.It really is a fun and rewarding activity to make a regular habit in the car, dinner table, on a walk or even a bedtime riddle.To help you out, there are literally thousands of examples of riddles in books, on the internet, in history, films and ones you hear. But the best ones will be those made up yourself, and the more you do it, the better at it you will become.And the benefits of riddling regularly with your family can be signicant, especially for children. It can promote critical thinking, encourage the observation of the world around us, help language development and can be a powerful bonding process with your child. And itrsquos fun!And so when next time you are with your kids, grandchildren, nieces or nephews and find yourself waiting for food to be delivered in a restaurant or have no time for a proper bedtime story, or you just want to spend some quality time together without a screen, try make riddling part of it. Trust me, it will be fun.Oh, and the answer to the well-known riddle at the beginning  Itrsquos a coffin."},{"url":null,"title":"wallyford-bluebell-players-fantastic-experience-soccer","story":"The county sextet were in the studio throughout the show, which went out live on Sky Sports at .am.The players for the amateur team ndash captain Daniel Howie, Jordan McCallion and brothers Jack and Shaun Moffat ndash along with friends Darren Hall and Lewis Brown, took part in the volley challenge and pro am questions to win cash.They travelled by train to London last Friday evening, with Sky covering all travel and hotel costs, as well as taxi fares to and from the studio.The trip came about after Soccer AM posted on Twitter that it was looking for Scotland fans to appear on the show.After an email from Daniel and a couple of phone calls later, the trains were booked from Edinburgh Waverley to London Kingrsquos Cross as the members of the Musselburgh Tartan Army headed south.

replaced by a joint community pupil library which opened in the new Wallyford Primary School campus in April.A report to the councilrsquos policy and performance review committee said that the move had seen the number of visits to that library service almost halved.And it added: ldquoAlthough we have improved facilities within the school, there is no public transport to the school and limited car parking so some of our elderly customers are not now using the library.However, the report said there were hopes that when the new housing had been completed at Wallyford, where large development is ongoing, public transport would improve.The council put the increase on physical visits to library branches down to a combination of factors, including ldquoincreasing opening hours, merging library and customer services, increasing digital use and dferent types of events taking place within libraries.It said that the number of e-magazines and e-newspapers issued through the library

libraries in recent years and we have seen the numbers of visits increase by nearly  per cent since .ldquoDespite all the challenges which we face, we have continued to improve the library service which we offer through the opening of the new community library in Wallyford Primary School.ldquoThis has given more support for reading and literacy to primary age children in the Wallyford area and we have also been able to maintain a high level of library opening hours in recent years.The report on the service said: ldquoThe library service has changed signicantly over the years and many more services are provided within our libraries than have been previously.ldquo[The library service] continues to adapt to society changes and demands and going forward the service will be developed to promote reading for pleasure in particular and be available for those who need a bit more support, whether this be through giving assistance with digital developments or guidance in literacy or being a place for people to meet and socialise.The most popular library in the county is in Haddington, where the number of visitors to the John Gray Centre facility was , last year.Haddington and Lammermuir ward councillor Craig Hoy said: ldquoHaddington Library is the busiest in the county and that underscores its importance to the town and the wider community.ldquoItrsquos fantastic to see it being so well used and we should continue to explore what additional facilities and services can be located at the library and the John Gray Centre to ensure they continue to attract residents of

The River Esk snakes around the edge of the course.Prof Crofts expressed concern that dogs could easily swallow them, resulting in ldquolarge vet bills for owners.After ing the balls to the club, he has issued a call for the flood protection scheme, currently being drawn up for Musselburgh, to include measures to slow down water coming off the Pentland and Moorfoot Hills where the North and South Esk rise.Prof Crofts, of Musselburghrsquos Eskside West, a geography expert who has worked as a research scientist in Scotland, said: ldquoAlong the golf course there are very soft banks and you can see where they have been cut back, and probably there was some rough at the end of the fairway where lots of people have lost balls.ldquoWe cannot stop leaves and tree trunks being brought down the river but the speed of rise of the water level and its velocity shows that any flood prevention scheme for Musselburgh needs to look hard at measures to slow down water coming off the hills and into the river. Without this, the erection of walls being proposed in Musselburgh will not be public money well spent.ldquoMany of us feel the importance of the amenity of this stretch of the river ndash it is very fine.He said a tree planting scheme using native species should be discussed with landowners in the headwaters of the Esk catchment area, as government grants were available for such work.He said: ldquoI am talking about hundreds of thousands of trees maybe. Careful hand planting of trees is best rather than using tractors to dig ditches to prepare the land for planting as this would aggravate the problem by increasing the rate of water running off the hills. The trees would take up water from the soil.ldquoThe use of the reservoirs on the North and South Esk and the temporary flooding of the flat land along the river should be seriously investigated to store water during heavy rainfall and therefore slow the release of water into the river.ldquoIf you look at the flood issue, itrsquos caused by the river rising very fast but itrsquos made worsethere are high spring tides and a storm surge in the North Sea, and also a northerly wind across the estuary which piles the water up high and stops the river water escaping for a couple of hours either side of high tide.Professor Crofts has raised his concerns with consultants who are drawing up the Musselburgh Flood Protection Scheme and he has also made local councillors aware of his views.As for the coast, he highlighted small sand dunes which formed a natural barrier with grasses, which, below the ground level, had yards of roots acting as a natural catcher of the sand.Jackie Lambert, captain of Musselburgh Golf Club, said: ldquoThe club was unaware of the issue regarding golf balls being found on the beach near the mouth of the River Esk.ldquoWhilst, the figure of  golf balls is signicant, it is unknown over what timescale these balls have accumulated andthey are all, indeed, from the course.ldquoNotwithstanding this, the golf club will happily participate in any working group looking at the wider issues of flood protection and the environment in and around Musselburgh.

This was inevitable as she had been travelling one hour each way to get to Dunbar and, even though subsidised by us to make the journey, a two-hour commute is simply not sustainable.Mr Bruneau warned of the impact of demands on private nurseries in April this year when his nursery in Haddington saw its grades fall in an inspection. He said: ldquoThis is a systematic problem which is causing a death spiral in the quality of nursery provision throughout the industry.The inspection report on Dunbarrsquos Pumpkin Patch rated its quality of care and support, staffing and management and leadership at twowith the environment rated a three .The report said that parents had contacted the inspectorate following its unannounced visit in August to discuss concerns.A high turnover in staff was raised by a number of parents, with one telling inspectors: ldquoOften when I drop my child off I have to introduce myself and my child to the agency staff.The report said: ldquoParents told us that they often did not know the staff when they dropped off their children in the morning, often resulting in their children being reluctant to attend.Mr Bruneau said that the introduction of mandatory SSSCregistration was creating recruitment problems throughout the industry.He said: ldquoBefore the advent of SSSC registration, our group of nurseries never used any agency staff as recruitment was simple. It included people of ying ages, experience and circumstance.ldquoIt was a healthy labour market now new staff are iniably under , inexperienced in le, work and certainly the care of children.ldquoNursery closures are inevitable as sites struggle to find staff, maintain standards and satisfy increased demand.He said his company had decided to rationalise itsservices, placing more experience in fewer sites, and called on the Scottish Government to reverse policies he said ruled out more mature staff from working in nurseries.He added that all five members of staff at Dunbar had been offered places at his other nurseries.A spokesperson for East Lothian Council, which used the Dunbar nursery as a partner provider, said: ldquoWe have worked with Pumpkin Patch as one of our partner providers, offering funded early learning and childcare for pre-school children for many years.ldquoOur officers have also provided extensive support to the Dunbar team to help them improve the quality of experiences following recent Care Inspectorate reports.

For example the fact that Scotland has added around a further pound billion to its debt since  and become a ldquojohnny-come-lately Europeanwill not be up for public scrutiny.Furthermore, it would appear that tactical voting will play a major part on the outcome of the General Election with a number of people holding their noses to vote for the party which can deliver or safeguard either Brexit, Remain, the Union or an independence referendum. Under these circumstances surely the best outcome would be for an orderly Brexit and also for a Scottish referendum to be put on the back burner for at least a ldquogeneration to allow UK businessescertainty to invest for the future to the advantage of us all and not self-serving narrow nationalism either by the SNP or the Brexit Party.Ian Lakin, Aberdeen AB.IT is timely to remind the First Minister in particular and the SNP in general that sovereignty in Scotland is vested in the people and not in parliament. It is possible to win a majority of seats in Parliament, whether Holyrood or Westminster, by obtaining the votes of a minority of the electorate or a minority of votes cast this being an insubstantial basis to demand Scottish independence.William Durward, Bearsden.SO the fates have decreed that we get an early Christmas present in the form of a General Election. While the date is clear, it is less obvious for whom one should vote where one is not already a paid-up member or ardent supporter of one party or another. It has to be said that the selection of party leaders is not overly impressive. It has to be one of the poorest list of leaders promoting election campaigns in our history.For the Conservatives we have the incorrigible Boris Johnson, who has been known to be economical with the truth on occasion. For Labour we have Jeremy Corbyn, who was once vocal in his support of Venezuela. The current tragic condition of that country illustrates how dangerous the implementation of his doctrinaire socialist policies would be for the UK.The Lib Dems have the opportunistic Jo Swinson, lacking in gravitas, who sees herself, somewhat delusionally, as the next Prime Minister. For the SNP we have the doughty Ian Blackford, the investment banker, living the le of a ldquosimple crofter. His party at Westminster basically and repetitively sings from one song sheet . Do not let us forget the ex-Ukip leader Nigel Farage, now calling the shots for the Brexit Party. In spite of all the predictions of the subsequent profound adverse effects, he would prefer to leave the European Union without a deal.While not being spoiled for choice with regard to the leadership qualities of those at the head of parties and their policies, more and more I have inclined to the view that there is a case for extending the choice available on the list of candidates on the ballot paper,by adding a box to be crossed with the wording ldquonone of the aboversquo.Ian W Thomson, Lenzie.PLEASE help our memories by answering the following questions:.

In Scotland, we have the additional but equally isive issue of independence. Current polling and conventional wisdom suggest that the Conservatives should obtain a majority across England and Wales, and the SNP will perform very strongly in Scotland. But as the last general election campaign and the current unreliability of polling have shown, those apparent positions could be quite dferent by December .There are the usual unforeseeable factors of any campaign: blunders by candidates, external events, issues other than those the parties anticipatecoming to the fore. Even without those, however, the arithmetic is fiendishly tricky to calculate. No one knows the degree to which, for example, support for the Conservatives ndash or, for that matter, many Labour MPs ndash may be undermined by the Brexit Party. Nor the extent to which tactical voting against Brexit may benefit the Liberal Democrats or the SNP.It is assumed that the strength of Remain sentiment bodes well for the Nationalists, but  per centis not a negligible proportion of the electorate ndash itrsquos more than the SNP secured at the last general election, when they took  per cent of the countryrsquos Westminster seats. Andthe focus turns from Brexit to a second independence referendum, it is as likely that Unionists will vote tactically as it is that Remain and Leave voters will. Given the number of marginal seats, how hotly they will be contested, and the first-past-the-post system, any of the parties could see gains being offset by losses.The picture is just as unclear where in the UK splits in either the Leave or Remain votes could allow unexpected gains for almost any party. Butpoliticians and their most vehement supporters can have no certainty about the results, nor should they claim a monopoly on the truth, or moral virtue, of their arguments.One expects candidates and activists to paint themselves in the best light, and their opponents in the worst, but ision should not be exploited to mislead and to coarsen public discourse. Even before the campaigns have begun, there have been unpleasant instances of abuse ndash and equally dangerous attempts to claim robust criticism, within the normal bounds of political speech, amounts to abuse. There may be little prospect of restraining the more extreme rhetoric which appears on social media, but the electorate deserve an effort from those who seek their vote to conduct themselves honestly, and to give consideration in their thinking, rhetoric and pledges to those who may vehemently disagree with their position.Division may be unavoidable we may also fail, in the end, to get a genuinely decisive result.

in Munlochy, the Black Isle, where legend has it a rag or cloot dipped in the healing waters and tied to a tree can cure sickness or ailment.Now officials from Forestry and Land Scotland have teamed up with community groups for one of Scotlandrsquos most unusual clean-up operations.In a bid to preserve the site and protect the environment, they removed  bags of unsuitable offerings last month, including underwired bras, polyester flags, umbrellas, sunglasses ndash and even a medical back brace.But locals were careful to maintain the unique atmosphere of a place steeped in mystery and long associated with pre-Christian traditions.John Stott, chair of the local Knockbain Community Council, said the woods surrounding the well had become a mess.He said: ldquoIt had got out of control, and the cloots werenrsquot actually biodegradable, by and large.ldquoA lot of the material, as most modern materials are now, wasnrsquot biodegradable, therefore itrsquos never going to go anywhere.Mr Stott said the site had expanded as it grew more popular with backpackers and tour companies.He said: ldquoIt had started to spread out to the point where it was taking over a huge section of woodland, as opposed to the actual Clootie Well site itself, which is, letrsquos say,  yards by  yards or something like that.ldquoThe cloots had actually extended out to  or  yards. It was just a huge expansion of the site.ldquoBut at the actual site round the Clootie Well itself, we didnrsquot remove anything other than possibly inappropriate stuff such as umbrellas, sunglasses, a pair of trainers.ldquoThere was a colossal amount of stuff around that was totally inappropriate.However, Mr Stott said those involved were careful to show respect to people who had placed genuine offerings around the well.He added: ldquoItrsquos peoplersquos wishes, peoplersquos hopes, obviously, that they are hanging on these trees.ldquoWe did it with as much respect and dignity as we possibly could.He continued: ldquoThe idea basically is you hang up a wee bit of cloth, and as that cloth biodegrades it draws away the illness of the person who you have hung it up for.ldquoSo thatrsquos the theory,you like, or the history of it. But things like sunglasses are clearly never, ever going to biodegrade.He said those who initially expressed concerns over the clean-up were reassured once the purpose of it was made clear.And he suggested an annual drive to keep the surrounding area tidy could be in order in future.He added: ldquoI wouldnrsquot quite say we havenrsquot scratched the surface, but Irsquom quite sure the same exercise could be done again and it still wouldnrsquot actually affectthe character.ldquoI would like to see some kind of annual event ndash done tastefully, done as a family thing, just to make sure that we keep on top of the non-biodegradables and we donrsquot end up back in the same situation.Clootie wells ndash or sites drawing on similar traditions ndash can be found where in Scotland and the UK, but few possess the unsettling atmosphere found in Munlochy.Its strange power even inspired elements of Ian Rankinrsquos novel The Naming of the Dead.While it is associated with a holy well, such healing traditions pre-date Christianityand the area has become an important site for those with a iety of beliefs and none.Maree Morrison, of Forestry and Land Scotland, said  volunteers took part in the clean-up from the local communities of Munlochy, Avoch and Knockbain, as well as from further across the Black Isle and Easter Ross.She said: ldquoThe site was expanding rapidly, with the surrounding woodland being badly affected by non-biodegradable items as they built up over the years.ldquoThere were cloots tied around trees and information posts in the car park.ldquoThe items had crept out from the well up to  metres out into the woodland, and the local community felt that it was getting too much and was detracting from the traditional nature of the healing well.Ms Morrison said volunteers removed a iety of unsuitable items including empty dog poo bags, entire pairs of jeans, a window blind and even an electrical sander.Forestry and Land Scotland is now requesting that any offerings left at the site are restricted to natural cotton or wool.

What starts the day on paper as a tidy soundbite can end it a disheveled mess. Positions that at first appear reasonable can turn to nonsense when chewed over at .Take Ms Sturgeonrsquos comments yesterday on having a democratic double-dip in . Out campaigning in Leith, the First Minister predicted a Labour government would grant a second independence referendum.Mr Corbyn has said he is open to it, subject to a few years delay to let Labour get underway in office, and provided it follows a democratic process, perhaps a fresh mandate in a Holyrood election. Ms Sturgeon seemed very confident.Talking to the media, she said: ldquoEveryone knows, you all know, therersquos going to be an independence referendum. The opposition parties might not yet have got round to conceding that point but they and know and everybody knows it.Ms Sturgeonrsquos dream scenario is a minority Labour government that needs SNP support to survive, giving her the leverage to secure Indyref.Labour counters that the SNPrsquos hand would not be as strong as it thinks. It has no nuclear option. Ms Sturgeon could hardly swing behind the ToriesLabour refused to oblige, or let the government fall and the Tories in. The SNP would be accused of another , when it helped oust Jim Callaghan and along came Margaret Thatcher.But a minority Labour government would not really be in a position to play hardball with the SNP. To legislate for the transformation Mr Corbyn promises, it would need the votes of SNP MPs. A deal between the SNP and Labour,not a formal coalition, seems a credible bet in such circumstances.But then Ms Sturgeon was asked a series of follow-up questions. The more her position was interrogated, the shakier it became. Would she compromise on her timetable of Indyref in the second half of   ldquoNo, Irsquove set out my timing. Is there a public appetite for two referendums in   ldquoYes. Is there a risk a Remain vote would diminish support for independence  ldquoNo, I donrsquot think so.Mr Corbyn claims he would get Brexit done in six months by having a Peoplersquos Vote. Which should come first - EU referendum or Indyref  Here Ms Sturgeon said something extraordinary. Apparently the order doesnrsquot matter.ldquoThe most important thing is not what comes first, itrsquos about why these things are important, ldquo she said.ldquoA second EU referendum is about giving the whole of the UK a chance to escape Brexit. A second referendum is about giving Scotland the chance that never, ever again, on Brexit or anything , do we find ourselves in a position where our future is being decided by the likes of Boris Johnson, not the people who live here.But the order is so obviously important itrsquos almost asthis stuff is being made up on the hoof. If Scots voted first for independence they wouldnrsquot get a vote on Brexit. The die would have been cast. Itrsquos also obvious Labour would prioritise its UK-wide promise on Brexit ahead of Indyref.So , in line with Ms Sturgeonrsquos plan, there were two votes in , it would be EU first then Indyref. But what would that look like  The SNP would have to campaign for Remain despite Brexit being the grounds for Indyref. Activists might be a bit queasy about unpicking their lsquotriple-lockrsquo mandate.Andthe result was Remain - and assuming Indyref wasnrsquot axed off as a consequence - the SNP would have to go back to the country immediately and argue it didnrsquot matter. Remain, Leave, whatever, we still need independence.That would echo early , when Ms Sturgeon first called for Indyref because of Brexit. She was ahead of public sentiment then. The two issues didnrsquot seem sufficiently linked to justy a new referendum, and the SNP was punished a few months later at the election for indecent haste.Since then, sentiment has moved in the SNPrsquos favour and independence and Brexit are seen as closely linked, the former offered as the way out of the latter. Ms Sturgeonrsquos efforts to fuse the two has paid off, with support for independence rising due almost entirely to No-Remainers becoming Yes-Remainers.

And itrsquos not just the political climate thatrsquos volatile.Derek Mackay, deputy ing officer for Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, said the highlands and islands ldquocould have signicant issues with a winter poll.He said: ldquoWeather is a major consideration. We often have challenges with a summer poll, never mind something in winter, because wersquove got to transport the ballot boxes and the ballot papers up from Barra to South Uist.ldquoSo yoursquore going across the Sound of Barra and the Sound of Harris ndash two stretches of water.ldquoWe always have a contingency arrangement for that, using boats, but that would obviously take pretty much till the next day before we get the papers there. So we usually use either a helicopter or a plane.If weather conditions are so severe that even boats canrsquot make it across, officials will simply have to wait.Mr Mackay added: ldquoWe have in the past looked at having the leboat in the Sound of Barra route,we can do that.ldquoIt is a shorter route, so it wonrsquot take the leboat far away from its normal base. But we just have to see what the weatherrsquos like on the day.ldquoIn the evening and in the morning, wersquoll obviously be watching the forecast well in advance so that we can make any logistical decisions.ldquoAndit is delayed, itrsquos delayed, but hopefully not for a signicant amount of time. But thatrsquos very much out of our hands. The risk is signicantly higher at this time of year.There is also the possibility of strike action by air traffic controllers employed by Highlands and Islands Airports Limited , amid an ongoing pay row.This could rule out using a plane, while helicopters can be weather-dependent.Mr Mackay continued: ldquoTherersquos also the issue of getting the ballot papers from the mainland to Stornoway and then on to Uist and Barra.ldquoWersquoll have contingency arrangements in place for that as well. That usually happens several days in advance of the poll.ldquoWe may have to bring that forward, depending on weather. So therersquos issues there.ldquoGetting postal packs to and from the islands,therersquos weather disruption with the Royal Mail ndash especiallyitrsquos on polling day, a lot of people could end up disenfranchised because their postal votes are stuck in Glasgow.Elsewhere, seasonal flu means more staff could be off sick, while officials are also looking at buying additional lighting to cope with the dark winter days.Mr Mackay said: ldquoWersquoll be meeting with the ious emergency services and our own technical services staff to look at options for their potentially having to have xs or all-terrain vehicles on the road.In , when the local government and Holyrood elections were held on the same day, last-minute fog grounded the helicopter on the Western Isles and delayed the count. And that was in May, not December.John Mundell, the interim chief executive of Orkney Islands Council and ing officer for Orkney and Shetland, said there is a ldquosignicant potential risk around the winter weather.Ferries could be cancelled, planes grounded and roads and footpaths covered with ice or snow.On Shetland, ballot boxes in the outer islands have be transported down to Sumburgh on the southern tip and then across the sea to Orkney, by plane or boat.Mr Mundell said: ldquoItrsquos unpredictable at the best of times, but during the winter you can get hit with all sorts that makes it even more unpredictable.ldquoItrsquos quite acute, and the risks are quite hefty. And obviously, from my perspective, Irsquoll be watching the weather forecasts very closely.Mr Mundell stressed ing officers up and down the country have been anticipating a winter election.He added: ldquoHowever, given the circumstances, there is a limit to what we can dowe are hit with the worst of the weather.ldquoObviously, the intention from the outset is to have the count completed in a professional and organised manner.ldquoBut under no circumstances will I be allowing my team to put lives or property at risk.Elsewhere, David Sutherland, Highland Councilrsquos elections manager, said a ldquomulti-agency coordinating group will be set up to assist with any events or incidents under severe conditions.He said: ldquoWe have been planning for a snap election for some time now and are very mindful of the possibilities of conducting an election in winter in the highlands of Scotland, which has the largest geographical election area in the UK with some of the most challenging distances to cover, including island communities.Scotlandrsquos cities also face a logistical juggling act to ensure everything runs smoothly.Both Glasgow and Edinburgh have been unable to secure their preferred venues for the election count due to the late notice.Andrew Kerr, chief executive of Edinburgh Council and the cityrsquos ing officer, oversees one of the largest operations in the UK, coordinating votes from five constituencies.He said: ldquoItrsquos not so much that itrsquos winter, itrsquos that now we donrsquot have very much notice before we go to the polls, with , polling cards going out.He said there are  polling stations to organise, with  staff manning them.A further  staff will be needed on the night of the count, which is likely to take place at the Royal Highland Centre in Ingliston.Mr Kerr said a small number of Christmas parties and other events had to be rescheduled to free up polling stations.He said: ldquoItrsquos just about getting yourself prepared. Itrsquos a big logistical exercise ndash a big complex logistical exercise.But he added: ldquoLocal governments all had some practice, I think, because of the European election, which were done at speed as well.ldquoSo wersquore just using the same protocols. Irsquove just stood up the full-time team again as of Monday. My election team ndash some of whom had gone back to their day jobs ndash are now back full-time.Peter Stanyon, chief executive of the Association of Electoral Administrators, said councils will need to use ldquoinnovative thinking.He said: ldquoWersquore stepping into the unknown, because we havenrsquot had a national poll in December since the s.He said there is a legal requirement to start counting the votes within four hours of polls closing.If this window is missed, he said, officials need to formally state the reasons for this.Mr Stanyon added: ldquoOne of the things that wersquove been talking to the Electoral Commission about is an understanding that, for exampletherersquos a heavy dump of snow, ortherersquos gales in the Northern Isles forecast for polling day, then clearly the count wonrsquot start within that four hour period. Itrsquos testing anyway, obviously, for the islands regardless.ldquoSo I think there will need to be a degree of understanding that every effort will be made to run this poll in exactly the same way asit were in the spring or summer months, but there will be that challenge.ldquoI know in the past, for example, when there have been weather issues, theyrsquove actually helicoptered the boxes in from the islands.He continued: ldquoThe good news, I suppose, is that ironically because of the European election, that we had been told wasnrsquot going to happen, the councils have been through this process recently.ldquoIf there had been any issues in the run up to the European elections, they will have been ironed out now in time for this particular poll.

Indeed, they still do in benighted foreign lands. But, here, we complain that it might be too dark or a bit nippy and, evenit isnrsquot, we canrsquot be bothered because wersquove got busy schedules of reality TV to watch.And all this in the run-up to Christmas tae. The Dailycartoonist Matt quipped: ldquoAt least a December election will put paid to all that lsquoSeason of Goodwillrsquo nonsense.The cry also went up: ldquoBut what about the nativity plays  The what now  I havenrsquot been to school for a while, and never paid much attention when I was there. But are they seriously still forcing the inmates to re-enact scenes from the Middle East , years ago  Come to think of it, I canrsquot remember having these at my primary school. Maybe that was just Leith, right enough. I think we only did May Day and Leninrsquos birthday.It would be finethe election was all about Leith Man but the doughty old port suffers from the disadvantage of being Scottish and so could never be representative of Britain. Instead, theyrsquove decided that itrsquos Workington Man who should be the successor to previous incarnations of electoral barometer such as Essex Man and Worcester Woman, not to mention ious vehicular representatives such as Mondeo Man and White Van Man.The Pebbledash People were also adduced at one point, but the least said about them the better. In Leith, theyrsquod have been put up against a wall.The Workington Man concept comes from centre-right think-tank Onward, and is predicated on targeting older working-class Leave voters without degrees in gender studies or vegan sociology, who are worried about crime and immigration, which liberals living in prosperous, all-white areas say they ought just to thole.Itrsquos currently a Labour seat with an unrepresentative Remainer MP, which has led many stout proletarians to say theyrsquore going to vote Conservative this time. Thatrsquos well weird. But itrsquos the same in other northern English towns like Warrington and Wigan where, as one psephologist said, most voters would normally never give the Tories the steam from their tinkles.But now, feeling alienated from and despised by the haut-liberal establishment, many are thinking of going further than offering not just the vaporous by-products of micturition but also their votes.Not all of them are saying this, of course. Some Workington citizens have taken offence at the stereotype pinned to them, and many proletarian Leavers simply could never vote Conservative, even with clothes pegs on their proboscises.Itrsquos the latter vote that the Brexit Party of Mr Nigel Farridgeis banking on picking up. Yesterday, at the launch of their election campaign, the spiv-style statesman said that,the Tories thought they were going to win northern English Labour seats, they needed to get out of the office more.He believes his party are better placed to take the Labour Leave vote because, unlike the Tories, they donrsquot yet have a history of being horrible. The Brexit Party might plausibly claim also to be a broader church, apparently including even some ex-Communists, and as far as I can make out, it hasnrsquot overtly extolled the virtues of the enslaving free market as Boris Johnsonrsquos Tories do at every turn.Of course, a few people in Workington and where will continue voting Labour on a tribal basis, believing it still to be the party of the working person . The partyrsquos launch this week showcased several attractive proposals for punishing the rich, with even some encouraging talk that there should be no billionaires in Britain, and itrsquos possible that decent people everywhere might support this.But maybe not in Workington, which has had enough of Labour promises. Irsquom guessing that old industrial Leith, meanwhile, will stick with the SNP, particularly with its attractive policy on trans-gender issues.As for how Irsquom going to vote, Irsquom afraid itrsquos not my place to say.++++IF you were genuinely open-minded, and not a liberal, you might concede that there are some things to admire about Boris Johnson. Well, two: the humour and erudition.And, of course, there are a few things to dislike, including the not inconsiderable fact that hersquos a Tory. However, a clinching factor against him for many decent ratepayers is the fact that hersquos a cyclist. And,the account of one former journalistic colleague is anything to go by, he typies the breed.Stephen Robinson recalled: ldquo[Following] Boris on a bike is a very dangerous undertaking indeed. When traffic is gridlocked, Boris shimmies along the inside lane, propelling himself with his left foot along the kerb. He crosses red lights, he cuts up the largest lorries.Textbook stuff. Voting is an important business and, when weighing up candidates, it is important to consider several factors: their hairstyle, football team, alcohol intake and mode of transport.Few people beyond the pedalling narcissi themselves would knowingly vote for a cyclist. My own view is that, as with bald people, cyclists should not be allowed to vote never mind stand for election. However, Irsquom aware that this policy is not popular among the closed-minded.++++A SURVEY of , adults found the majority wouldnrsquot dream of going to the cinema or dining out on their own. The study, commissioned by hotel brand Staybridge Suites, also found many wouldnrsquot attend the pub or the football or a museum on their own.How peculiar. The only one I concur with is dining out. I used to do it when younger, not knowing it was problematic. But I soon noticed I was getting stared at by other diners, most often those couples who never exchange a word.Chinese restaurants were the worst. In two establishments, I looked up to find the entire staff staring. And they donrsquot flinch when you stare back.Of course, I cannot discount the possibility that I look bizarre. Somebody once said I resembled a character from The Lord of the Ringsand itrsquos true also that I used to be a martyr to red-face disease rosacea .But none of that is an excuse for such bovine staring. So,dining alone is called for, Irsquoll do it in rather than oot, thanks.++++WE live in fast times. By the time I finish this sentence, many of you online will already have moved on, to find something bilious about Brexit or fitbarsquo or dancing cats. Losers.However, I cannot say Irsquove been bothered by the furore over a new Netflix feature allowing viewers to speed up or slow down films and TV shows.Itrsquos mainly film-makers and actors whose underwear has been formed into a bent, curling or distorted shape by the development. They say the move has a similar effect on the artwork and resent such interference.But itrsquos long been available on DVDs, and I canrsquot remember using it much. On TVs, too, you can apparently fast-forward through the adverts on recorded programmes.The new Netflixis currently only available to Android users, ie punters with portable telephones. Am I getting this right  They watch movies on their mobile phones Why would anyone do that  Do they eat from tiny wee tubs of popcorn as well  Theyrsquore the sort who probably would fast-forward through films, right enough.

The opinion polls, putting the Scottish Tories on just  per cent, down almost eight points since their impressive performance in , point to losses among their  seats where the SNP is the main challenger in all of them.But Mr Jack was having none of it, insisting that in fighting hard to retain all  Scottish seats, the Conservatives, by promoting themselves as the party of Brexit, could win more, possibly by getting supporters of Nigel Faragersquos party to switch to them.ldquoIf they back Brexit, the only party that is going to deliver Brexit out of this General Election is the Scottish Conservative Party. If you want Brexit, vote Conservative, declared the Secretary of State.He acknowledged: ldquoWe do start from  per cent but we also have the Brexit Party with six or seven per cent. We are the party that can deliver Brexit. We have a Brexit deal which we will be putting into our manesto and we will be the only party going to the electorate and saying give us a majority to get Brexit out of the way, get Brexit finished.But, of course, while Brexit might dominate the battle for No  south of the border, the perennial constitutional question is once again set to be at the forefront in the political fight north of it.With the SNP making clear that ldquoScotlandrsquos right to choose will be the central plank of its campaign, Mr Jack indicated that ldquostanding four-square against a second independence referendum would be at the heart of the Conservativesrsquo.A recent snapshot placed Scottish independence on  per cent support, causing the First Minister to claim that tide for Scotland breaking with the Union was on the rise.Askedshe was right to make the claim, the Scottish Secretary declared: ldquoI donrsquot accept that because the poll, which the Andrew Wilsonrsquos Commission suppressed, showed  per cent of those who voted to leave the UK in  have now changed their mind and the Survation poll that came out on the fth anniversary of the Scottish referendum on independence showed  per cent of the Scottish population wanted to remain in the United Kingdom.ldquoWe have a really strong case to put on that. Separation would be a terrible thing for Scotland. As we leave the EU we need to strengthen the Scottish economy and we will do that by taking away uncertainty, explained Mr Jack.Ms Sturgeon has insisted thatthe SNP got a majority of Scottish MPs at the election, then that would be an ldquoirresistible demand for indyref and the UK Govt would be dutybound to facilitate a second vote.ldquoNo, she absolutely would say that, wouldnrsquot she, declared the Cabinet minister.He argued that the Nationalist leader ldquopersistently finds reasons to promote independence and her call for a second vote to ldquodistract people from the real problem in Scotland, which is, after a decade in power, they have failed to improve our NHS, failed to improve our education service, failed to improve public services. So, they distract us by constantly harping on about independence.But askedhe was saying that evenMs Sturgeon and her party succeeded in getting a majority of Scots MPs at the election, they would not have a mandate for indyref, Mr Jack replied: ldquoIrsquom absolutely saying they would not have a mandate.ldquoTo me, itrsquos very simple. We had a once-in-a-generation, her words, once-in-a-letime, she and the First Minister at the time Alex Salmond used those expressions, referendum in , we had that, the people of Scotland decided to stay in the UK and they should respect that referendum and they should respect the referendum in , which was a UK one.He went on: ldquoWe do not need and we do not want to have another independence referendum. We should take separation right off the agenda, deliver Brexit, which got a majority of  votes in Parliament, the Second Reading of the Bill, come back, deliver Brexit and start focusing on the good things wersquore doing for Scotland the City and growth deals, bringing COP to Glasgow next year. Letrsquos start delivering on the good things we can do for the Scottish economy, growing that economy, growing peoplersquos prosperity as part of the UK.The Secretary of State stressed how Scotland had suffered the ldquodouble whammy of ision with the  and  votes and the task for a new Tory government would be to seek to heal the nation under Mr Johnsonrsquos premiership.ldquoBoth those referenda have been very isive but not just in terms of politics but in terms of families, relationships it has not been a good period in our history but we have to get Brexit sorted, push back the independence question, and start pulling together. We are all in the same rowing boat and letrsquos pull on the oars together. Thatrsquos my message.Last night, Ian Blackford for the SNP made clear thathis party did secure a majority of MPs in Scotland the UK Government could not stand in the way of indyref.ldquoAlister Jack has to recognise we already have a mandate for an independence referendum from the  elections. This time round we will be asking people to support Scotlandrsquos right to choose. The Conservatives cannot ignore democracy, he declared.In the interview, Mr Jack also said:*a new Tory Government would not seek to rush through a Withdrawal Bill in December as there would be ldquoenough time in January to do it*the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, that restricts Governments in how to call an election, had ldquonot served us well in the last month and I would suggest we revisit it when we *eventhere had to be a ldquoflextension to the December  Implementation Period, the UK would leave the Common Fisheries Policy in  monthsrsquo time and*getting Brexit done would open up the ldquosunny uplands of potential trade deals with other countries."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-independent-scotland-within-touching-distance","story":"She said \"another clear win\" for the SNP at theGeneral Electionnext month will \"bring it even closer still\".The SNP leader is the headline speaker at the event in George Square, her first speech at an independence rally since the  independence referendum campaign.Ahead of the event, she said: \"A vote for the SNP is a vote to escape Brexit, and to put Scotlands future in Scotlands hands - not Boris Johnsons.\"This election really is the most important one Scotland has faced in modern times.\"So much is on the line - people are completely fed up with the mess at Westminster.\"But George Square will be packed today as people from all backgrounds join together to demand a better future for Scotland.\"An independent Scotland is closer than it has ever been.

The subsequent typhoid epidemic left  people desperately sick, visitor numbers slumped and suddenly Aberdeenrsquos shining northern star was fading.Now, however, after decades of enjoying an oil and gas boom that more than made up for the loss of the Edinburgh and Glasgow Fair visitors, the Granite City and Aberdeenshire are preparing to become Scotlandrsquos next big tourist destinations.Stung by the downturn in the energy sector that saw demand slump for its once-packed hotel rooms, and perhaps slightly envious of Dundeersquos rising star as a ldquomust-see destination, Aberdeenshirersquos tourism sector is now seriously upping its game.Yesterday saw a major step towards the cityrsquos tourism rebirth with the reopening of Aberdeen Art Gallery following a pound. million revamp.Around , visitors were expected to pour inside the -year-old gallery to admire works by Tracey Emin, Henry Moore, Francis Bacon and Monet.Its  galleries offer three times the number of previous exhibits and include displays on nearby Balmoral and its links to Queen Victoria, the empowerment of women and the cityrsquos relationship with the sea.The galleryrsquos rejuvenation is accompanied by a host of other multi-million-pound new developments and revamps across the city, from the dramatic expansion of the cityrsquos harbour to welcome mega-size cruise ships, to a new look for Union Terrace Gardens.Along with the recent opening of the pound million Event Complex Aberdeen with its conference and venue space, restaurants and two new hotels with  new rooms, city leaders believe the city is set to shed a little of its ldquobusiness only image to lure a new generation of leisure visitors.That should be very welcome news for the arearsquos hotels. From enjoying the comfort of having rooms block-booked months in advance, many were left grasping for customers as oil and energy businesses slumped.Rooms lay empty, the cost of a nightrsquos stay in luxury hotels designed to meet high demands of big paying customers was slashed. Some, such as the -room Highland Hotel on Crown Street, closed.According to VisitScotland figures,  saw the volume of domestic visitors to Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire fall below , for the first time, driven by a % drop in business travellers.Meanwhile, BDOrsquos Hotels Britain report for the year showed the cityrsquos hotels had the worst occupancy rates in the country with more than one-third of rooms lying empty.It also recorded the biggest drop in rooms yield in the UK, with hotels earning pound. per room, down from pound. the previous year.The figures were particularly concerning at a time when rooms yield in Inverness grew by almost %, while Edinburgh soared by .%.Fast-forward to last month, and professional services specialist PwCrsquos latest Hotels Forecast report brought only some comfort. While a slight recovery in the oil and gas industry led to a .% increase in occupancy rates to .% in the past year, it is far short of the countless ldquono vacancies signs at the height of the oil boom when room occupancy rates were in the s and s.Despite the rise, revenue per available room was also said to have fallen by .%.Could Aberdeenrsquos multi-million-pound investments in visitor attractions and facilities bring the good times back ldquoUntil around , hotels had lsquono vacancyrsquo signs up, says Chris Foy, chief executive of VisitAberdeenshire.ldquoWe were doing very well from corporate business.

Therersquos plenty of capacity, the lsquono vacancyrsquo signs are down and there are fantastic deals.Foy believes Aberdeen and the surrounding areas can capitalise on a growing trend among travellers to embrace lesser-explored ldquosecondary cities which offer something dferent to well-trodden tourist centres.Evidence of that comes from Aberdeenrsquos recent surprise inclusion in the New York Times list of top  places in the world to visit alongside Doha, Los Angeles, Lyon in France, New York, Los Angeles and Tahiti.Meanwhile, accommodation giant Airbnb has also named Aberdeen as one of its top  trending global travel destinations for .

Enterprising local travel agents have already confirmed new routes for the harbour, with vessels offering trips around Britain, to the Baltic States, St Petersburg, Norway and Iceland on the cards, while across Aberdeenshire tour companies are gearing up to cater for an influx of visitors seeking golf, castles and outdoor adventures.To help the area on its way ndash and following some criticism that its marketing strategies in the past have dwelled too much on certain other areas ndash national tourism body VisitScotland has included Aberdeen in a new six-month worldwide ldquoScotland Is Now marketing campaign targeting potential visitors from Germany, France, the US, China and the UK.Meanwhile, hopes are high that the decision to stage the BBC Sports Personality of the Year ceremony at the new Event Complex Aberdeen in December will give the area a national  for a sport-loving audience.City leaders are also looking at plans to host the final stage of the Tour of Britain next year and the cycling eventrsquos Grand Depart in  as a potential opening to encouraging adventure and outdoor tourism.All of this has led to local tourism agency, VisitAberdeenshire, calling for volunteer ambassadors for the area ndash people who can share their love and knowledge of the northeast to visitors.ldquoTourism in the northeast has been dwarfed by oil and gas in terms of the economy, agrees Councillor Jenny Laing, co-leader of Aberdeen City Council. ldquoThose in the city were happy to service the business market, but the downturn in oil and gas meant companies and their supply chains looked at how to cut their costs, and part of that was around accommodation.ldquoTherersquos an increase in the number of rooms available while the market has shted, she adds. ldquoWe have a great opportunity for tourism, wersquore close to the beautul coast, we have Royal Deeside, golf, castles, but we donrsquot have any joined-up approach about what we are offering.One idea is to present Aberdeenshire as Scotlandrsquos outdoor adventure destination, she points out.ldquoItrsquos about us finding a niche for Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire, collaborating and showing we have a good offering for tourists.Five hidden gems in the northeast.

The Loch Ness Monster  Underwater gasses released from a seismic fault. Giants and elves  The result of our ancestors trying to make sense of Standing Stones and ancient burial mounds. Selkies and kelpies  Echoes of ancient rites such as human sacrice and animal worship.Scotland is rich in myth. Each tale, however, has a grain of historical truth lying at its heart. We may think of such legends simply as supernatural stories invented by ancestors with overactive imaginations way back in the mists of time, but in fact these fables all have some basis in fact ndash although itrsquos often hard to uncover.The same is true for any culture. Most myths across the world can be explained. Therersquos even an academic discipline for rationally interpreting legends ndash itrsquos called Euhemerism. This school of thought is so old that it goes as far back as the greatest myth-makers of all, the ancient Greeks.Such studies were inspired by Euhemerus, a gted thinker from the fourth century BC. He believed the Greek gods were merely ancient kings and queens who had become worshipped as deities over time. Euhemerus was certain that the real, mortal king who became known as Zeus was buried on Crete. He is seen as the first atheist in history.Archaeologists in the early-th century worked out that the Greek myth of the one-eyed giants called Cyclopes was inspired by the woolly mammoth. When ancient Greeks uncovered the remains of mammoths scattered across the Mediterranean, the skull would have been bewildering. It looked human, it was huge, and in the centre there seemed to be a single, giant eye socket. It was, of course, the cavity of the mammothrsquos trunk. But the myth of the Cyclopes was born.The dragon myth found across the world is down to our ancient ancestors uncovering fossilised dinosaurs and trying to make sense of their discoveries. Similarly, tales of the mythical Grfin originated along the route of the old Silk Road in Asia, where the remains of beaked dinosaurs and their eggs were found.In the book The Lore Of Scotland, folklorist Sophia Kingshill says the nationrsquos myths helped our ancestors ldquoexplain the world and take ldquocontrol over their surroundings and circumstances. In a world without science, the stories handed down to us as folklore were a very real attempt by our forebears to grapple with the mysteries of le.Folklorists have been trying to decode Scottish myths for decades, to unravel what might lie behind them. How do our myths reflect our own past culture, and the thinking of our ancestors Sawney BeanSometimes myths reflect not how a society thinks of itself, however, but how others see that society. One of our most monstrous legends, the story of Sawney Bean the Scottish cannibal, reveals how our closest neighbour, England, saw us centuries ago. Studying the Sawney Bean myth also reveals just how recently some legends have been created, and then quickly accepted as fact.The tale tells of a family led by Sawney Bean and his we who take to the caves around Girvan sometime in the s. The tribe turns to cannibalism, waylays local travellers, drags them into caves and eats them. Eventually, one traveller survives, and the king and his soldiers arrest the monsters in their lair, and execute the entire brood.Therersquos a spot near Bennane Head in South Ayrshire called Sawney Beanrsquos Cave to this day ndash however, therersquos no evidence whatsoever that the cannibal family ever existed. In fact, the first records of the tale appear in England in , when tensions were high between Scotland and England following the Acts of Union.Sawney Bean is first mentioned in a book called Lives And Actions Of The Most Famous Highwaymen, Murderers, Street-Robbers Etc written, we think, by Daniel Defoe of RobinsonTherersquos no mention of Sawney Bean in any Scottish sources, Hobbs points out, until  ndash by which time the legend was an established part of folklore.Loch Ness MonsterWhen it comes to Nessie it seems like science and religion may well have collided to produce one of the worldrsquos greatest monster myths.The first report of Nessie comes in the Le Of Saint Columba, written in the sixth century AD. It tells the story of the Irish monk who brought Christianity to Scotland. It canrsquot have been easy converting the Picts, but claims of supernatural powers always help. Columba was said to have defeated a Pictish wizard, and repelled a monstrous ldquowater beast at the northern end of Loch Ness.Columba battling a monster from a river or loch would have been highly signicant to the ancient Celtic mind. Rivers were among the most important deities in the Celtic religion. A prominent Celtic goddess in Britain and Ireland was Danu, the mother goddess. Danu is also the root of the name for the river Danube ndash showing the extent of Celtic faith across the continent.Stories of Columba overpowering wizards and river monsters would have acted as propaganda at the time and accelerated his mission to convert Scotland ndash but there might also be a grain of truth somewhere too. Italian scientist Luigi Piccardi investigated possible geological explanations behind myths. He was interested in the fact that the Columba legend says the monster appeared ldquocum ingenti fremitu or ldquowith loud roaring. Loch Ness sits on the Great Glen Fault and itrsquos thought what Columba claimed to have seen was a mini-underwater earthquake, or the release of gas.Giants and fairy folkThe landscape around Scotland is filled with Standing Stones, burial mounds and ancient hill forts. To a Scot in the Middle Ages, such sights would be almost impossible to explain. What were they  Who had built them  Perhaps, our ancestors theorised, they were the work of giants or the entrance to Fairyland. In the th century, the Normans thought Stonehenge was built by giants.Therersquos been speculation that the word ldquoPict might be the source of the word ldquoPixie. This could be the ultimate source for ldquoPuck ndash the fairy made famous by Shakespeare in A Midsummer Nightrsquos Dream. Strange Pictish carvings are found on stones across Scotland. Itrsquos thought our ancestors interpreted these carvings as the handiwork of fairies.If we had no understanding of Neolithic le or the Bronze or Iron Age, such ideas would give meaning to the unexplainable.One of the most famous examples of the Stone Age-inspiring myths comes in the shape of ldquoElf Shot. When farmers in the medieval period were ploughing their land they would often uncover Neolithic arrow heads. Of course, no-one knew of the Stone Age back then, so no-one could understand what these strange stone arrows were ndash unless, of course, they were weapons used by fairies.During one battle in  at Loch Gruinart, there were claims that little people ndash an eighth the size of humans ndash helped the winning side. The legend is thought to be down to elf shot found in the area.Fingalrsquos Cave on the island of Staffa in the Inner Hebrides is a perfect example of the landscape-affecting myth. Itrsquos an incredible and imposing geological feature ndash and to the minds of our ancestors it could easily be seen as the home of some huge giant. In Irish mythology, Fingal is the warrior giant Fionn MacCumhaill ndash or Finn MacCool. Like many ancient mythic figures, itrsquos thought he was based on a great king or warlord who became a god-like figure long after his death.Legend has it that Fingal erected the standing stones at Machrie Moor on the Isle of Arran. Some of these spectacular stones stand nearly five metres high. Without an understanding of the past and of science, how  could our ancestors have interpreted the stones  They had to be the work of giant hands.Fingal is supposed to have died in Scotland ndash maybe in Glen Dochart. The fact that an Irish myth has such strong Scottish connections points to the deep cultural links between Ireland and Scotland going back millennia. The ancient kingdom of Dal Riata, founded in the fth century, spread from the north of Ireland across the west coast of Scotland. The prevalence of Irish myths in Scotland is a cultural reminder of our shared history.The Cailleach was a female giant also inspired by the Scottish landscape. The island of Ailsa Craig is supposed to be a pebble which fell from her apron. Huge stones in the Forest of Mar in Aberdeenshire were said to be the remains of her home.Rocks at the Falls of Connel are stepping stones she used to cross Loch Etive. There were reports of sightings of the Cailleach well into the Victorian era and she was last seen around  near Lochaber.In Scotland, therersquos also a long tradition of ldquoBrownie stories ndash of elf-like creatures who come into homes at night and perform good deeds, such as mending clothes or sweeping floors. Similar stories exist throughout Europe ndash most famously in the tale The Elves And The Shoemaker where little people help a cobbler with his work at night. Itrsquos believed these stories may be a hangover from the time when most of the continent was ruled by the Roman Empire. Romans believed in ldquoLares ndash household spirits which looked after every family, and often helped out in times of need.In Shetland and Orkney, stories of the little people reflect the regionrsquos ancient Viking past. On the islands, little people are known as ldquotrows ndash a derivation of the Scandinavian ldquotroll. These creatures lived in hillocks or cairns. One such place is the Trowie Knowe, a chambered tomb in Shetland.Sometimes, tales of the little people were a way of explaining the most painful of events. If a perfectly healthy baby dies today, we realise it is cot death. A millennium ago, such a tragedy would be impossible to understand. However, parents could find some explanation in the malevolent actions of fairies who came into homes, stole human babies and left dead fairies in their place ndash so-called changelings.Kelpies and selkiesMany myths across the world began as stories told to children by their parents to scare them and keep them safe. Think of the bogeyman stories of the th century. Some of these tales have morphed over recent decades, and taken on the shape of myths, such as the online Slenderman legend. Slenderman was taken so seriously by some children in America in  that the story led to violence.The kelpie may well be the original Scottish bogeyman. Itrsquos also a myth that could only be created in a country dominated by water. Scotlandrsquos rugged and sprawling coastline and myriad lochs and rivers made this a dangerous place to live in ancient times. Unlike many other parts of Europe,you lived in Scotland in the Stone Age or Bronze Age you were going to have to travel by boat a lot.The kelpie was a terrying horse-like beast which lived in water and would drag you to your death. One of the most famous kelpie stories sees seven little girls and one boy playing in Glen Keltney. The little girls see a horse in the loch and climb on to its back. The boy refuses. The girls drown. The boy lives. The moral of the story, children, is do what your parents tell you and stay away from water.The kelpie myth is also an echo of the ancient Celtic practice of making sacrices to appease powerful water gods who lived in rivers. In some cases the sacricial victim would be a horse. To make more signicant offerings to the gods, humans would be sacriced, even children.Like kelpies, selkies also played a role in reminding people to be respectfully fearful of water, but these mermaid-like creatures, half-human half-seal, say more about ancient economics and religion. Along the Scottish coastline, and across the islands, the seal was a vital resource for our ancestors. It provided food and clothing. Humans have hunted them since the Stone Age. Neolithic people identied closely with the creatures they hunted, and even worshipped them. Their shamans, or priests, would ldquobecome the deer or seal during magical ceremonies to help in the hunt. Once killed the animal would be revered because of the importance of its sacrice to the tribe.In the s, a North Uist poet, John MacCodrum, claimed he was a selkie descendant. In the sea, selkies take the shape of seals, on land they take off their skins and assume human form. However,they lose their skin they have to remain human. The North Uist legend tells of a local man who fell in love with a selkie and stole her sealskin to keep her on land. The couple had children but one day the selkie found her skin and ed to the sea.Their descendants were known as ldquothe MacCodrums of the Seals. In the th century on North Uist there were still people who claimed a lineage back to selkies.On Orkney, there were stories of people descended from selkies being born with webbed hands. Perhaps that myth was inspired by the birth of a disabled child. After all, our ancient ancestors found source material for the legends they handed down to us wherever they looked."},{"url":null,"title":"general-election-2019-labour-win-itll-less-like-venezuela-britain-circa-1974","story":"Jeremy Corbyn was also talking tough this week.

There is a powerful mood for change in Britain. But what would a Labour government actually look like We have never had such an avowedly radical Prime Minister ndash not even in , when Labour was led by a small ldquoc conservative, Clement Attlee. However, Labour reality would be rather dferent from the rhetoric. Burrow into Labourrsquos policies, and what emerges looks more like reheated social democracy, circa, than a Bolshevik revolution.For a start, we can largely ignore the issue that ided the party so bitterly in recent times: nuclear weapons. Jeremy Corbyn may be a lelong member of CND, but Labour is no longer a unilateralist party. Its  manesto committed a Labour government to renewing Trident almost indefinitely.But Corbyn will still enter Number  with a raft of left-wing policies, from seizing corporate assets to abolishing private schools as well as taxing the rich until the pips squeak. However, many of the headline policies will never make it to first reading, let alone the statute book.Abolishing schools like Eton would involve y court action, not least from faith schools and the home school movement, who might also be affected. Labour is more likely to confine its assault on educational privilege to axeing tax reliefs worth about pound. billionSimilarly, seizing % of the shares of companies with more than  employees would be fiercely resisted in the courts by shareholders. They have deep pockets. I suspect Labour would confine itself to increasing corporate taxes, ending zero-hours contracts and restoring trades union rights ndash all of which are eminently doable.Indeed, looking behind the radical rhetoric, much of Labourrsquos policy agenda is surprisingly modest, viewed from Scotland. Measures like free personal care, abolishing university tuition fees, childcare for three and four-year-olds, scrapping the right to buy, lting the benefits cap and the bedroom tax ndash these are all achievable.Indeed, the Scottish Parliament has already achieved them, bar the welfare cap. Nicola Sturgeon will no doubt remind the Labour leader of this repeatedly in coming weeks.Nationalisation is a policy that used to be seen as ldquoloony left but is no longer. Taking rail into public ownership shouldnrsquot be too much of a problem, since Network Rail, which owns the track and signalling, is already in public hands. The service franchises could be replaced as they come up for renewal, without needing to hand billions in compensation to Virgin and the rest.Waterand energy would pose greater problems, not least because most of our energy companies are foreign-owned ndash often, ironically, by state-owned bodies. But with a good wind it should be possible for Labour to find a way. Public attitudes to public ownership of utilities have changed out of all recognition since the s.Similarly, there is broad public support for Labourrsquos Green New Deal. A majority of voters agrees there is a climate emergency. Though they may not agree with the measures needed to tackle it.Labour is not going the full Extinction Rebellion route of making Britain zero carbon by . But its own policy, passed at conference, is still pretty radical. It commits a Labour government to making Britain zero carbon by .

There is a powerful mood for change in Britain. But what would a Labour government actually look like We have never had such an avowedly radical Prime Minister ndash not even in , when Labour was led by a small ldquoc conservative, Clement Attlee. However, Labour reality would be rather dferent from the rhetoric. Burrow into Labourrsquos policies, and what emerges looks more like reheated social democracy, circa, than a Bolshevik revolution.For a start, we can largely ignore the issue that ided the party so bitterly in recent times: nuclear weapons. Jeremy Corbyn may be a lelong member of CND, but Labour is no longer a unilateralist party. Its  manesto committed a Labour government to renewing Trident almost indefinitely.But Corbyn will still enter Number  with a raft of left-wing policies, from seizing corporate assets to abolishing private schools as well as taxing the rich until the pips squeak. However, many of the headline policies will never make it to first reading, let alone the statute book.Abolishing schools like Eton would involve y court action, not least from faith schools and the home school movement, who might also be affected. Labour is more likely to confine its assault on educational privilege to axeing tax reliefs worth about pound. billionSimilarly, seizing % of the shares of companies with more than  employees would be fiercely resisted in the courts by shareholders. They have deep pockets. I suspect Labour would confine itself to increasing corporate taxes, ending zero-hours contracts and restoring trades union rights ndash all of which are eminently doable.Indeed, looking behind the radical rhetoric, much of Labourrsquos policy agenda is surprisingly modest, viewed from Scotland. Measures like free personal care, abolishing university tuition fees, childcare for three and four-year-olds, scrapping the right to buy, lting the benefits cap and the bedroom tax ndash these are all achievable.Indeed, the Scottish Parliament has already achieved them, bar the welfare cap. Nicola Sturgeon will no doubt remind the Labour leader of this repeatedly in coming weeks.Nationalisation is a policy that used to be seen as ldquoloony left but is no longer. Taking rail into public ownership shouldnrsquot be too much of a problem, since Network Rail, which owns the track and signalling, is already in public hands. The service franchises could be replaced as they come up for renewal, without needing to hand billions in compensation to Virgin and the rest.Waterand energy would pose greater problems, not least because most of our energy companies are foreign-owned ndash often, ironically, by state-owned bodies. But with a good wind it should be possible for Labour to find a way. Public attitudes to public ownership of utilities have changed out of all recognition since the s.Similarly, there is broad public support for Labourrsquos Green New Deal. A majority of voters agrees there is a climate emergency. Though they may not agree with the measures needed to tackle it.Labour is not going the full Extinction Rebellion route of making Britain zero carbon by . But its own policy, passed at conference, is still pretty radical. It commits a Labour government to making Britain zero carbon by . Thatrsquos only five years longer.We are talking about the most radical change to our lestyles since the industrial revolution.

A friendship with his landladyrsquos daughter Rita had blossomed into something more romantic and the pair were married in , despite the staunch disapproval of both their families.Rita Cowan, at , was living a le of faded prosperity with her mother and three siblings after the death of her father, Dr Samuel Campbell Cowan, the previous year, and seized the chance to break away from her tight-knit community even though it would mean uprooting herself to the other side of the world.Masataka had already marked himself out as an unusual man, but his mixed marriage was highly unorthodox in his home country, where arranged marriages were seen as the essential ingredient of a happy and successful le and Westerners were few and far between.According to family legend, the couple slipped away and married in a register office without the knowledge or permission of either of their sets of parents. Ritarsquos -year-old sister and her friend acted as witnesses and the diminutive party ate an illicit celebratory meal afterwards at the nearby Station Hotel.But despite its clandestine start, the marriage would prove to be a success, with Rita accepting the customs of Japan when she emigrated there with her husband later that year.The couple later adopted two children ndash a daughter, Rima, whose name combined Rita and Masataka ndash and a son, Takeshi, who was Taketsurursquos orphaned nephew. Takeshi, who would go on to inherit Masatakarsquos whisky business, witnessed the atomic blast at Hiroshima from his home nearby.Back in Japan, Masataka put his new-found distilling skills to use with a job at spirits maker Suntory.However, whisky was slow to catch on in the Japanese market and it wasnrsquot until  that the breakthrough was made.Establishing a distillery at Yoichi on the island of Hokkaido, which has a similar climate to Scotland, Mastaka began to produce a drink that found a ready market. Some of the recipes he introduced remain firm favourites today, such as Kakubin ldquosquare bottle, the most successful of all Japanese whiskies.In , with a gulf growing between Japan and the West which would soon erupt into war, homegrown whisky rose in popularity and Suntory became the official supplier to the Japanese navy.The distillery, with Masataka its guiding light, was then ideally placed to capitalise on the economic boom which gripped Japan as it rebuilt in the s, and a huge consumer class arose hungry for luxury goods.Rita died in , and Mastaka in , after a le which saw him awarded six honours from the Emperor and his hometown, and gain the unofficial title of ldquothe father of Japanese whisky. Kirkintilloch, where he met the love of his le, is now twinned with Yoichi, which has a ldquoRita Road among its street plan.Dr Niall Mackenzie of the University of Glasgow Adam Smith Business School said: ldquoMasataka Taketsuru is one of the universityrsquos many illustrious and world-changing alumni ndash the centenary of his enrolment at the University of Glasgow is an occasion for celebrating his role in the creation of Japanrsquos whisky industry and the longstanding connections between the university and Japan.The celebration of Masatakarsquos Taketsurursquos le will be held on November  at the University of Glasgowrsquos Kelvin Gallery."},{"url":null,"title":"thriving-surviving-dying-scottish-towns-health-check","story":"ldquoI have a soft spot for Berwick-upon-Tweed, he says, referring to the home of the only technically English club in the Scottish league. ldquoThere are a lot of great towns, Aberdeen, Dundee.But Leishman warms up as he gets closer to home. ldquoLook at Falkland, Culross, these places are fantastic. Look at the East Neuk of Fe. St Andrews is beautul.The Labour councillor represents Dunfermline ndash and a new academic report from the Bennett Institute for Public Policy at Cambridge University underlines just how well this Fe boom town is doing.Scotlandrsquos ancient capital, Dunfermline is also the fastest growing ndash and fastest improving in the country, according to a detailed crunching of government statistics.Leishman is not surprised. And he dials up his pride to reflect this. ldquoIt is a lovely place, Dunfermline.ldquoWe have the new bridge and the circle line in Fe. The expansion of Dunfermline has been amazing with people ndash first-time buyers or people from Edinburgh coming across and getting more value for their money.But Leishman recognises that there is a problem in Scotland: we no longer talk about our towns. We fret about islands and remote Highlands. We focus on the economic engine houses of our cities. And we neglect the dozens of communities where so many of us live and work.Some of these communities are not doing well. The new Cambridge University report reveals a very mixed bag of results for Scottish towns, especially some of the post-industrial ones. ldquoMost towns on the west coast of Scotland are declining faster than the average British town, its authors conclude. ldquoAyrshire and areas along the river Clyde appear to be a hotspot for town decline.They are talking about communities such as Dumbarton, Irvine, Greenock and even Troon, some of which at least match Dunfermline for their historical pedigree.But Leishman has advice for fellow civic leaders. ldquoJust keep the pride in your town, in where you are from, keep the heritage. I am a proud Fer, especially of Lochgelly, my hometown. We should not be afraid to speak about the positives.Towns are unfashionable, at least for policymakers. So much so that some of Scotlandrsquos most town-like towns ndash the kind geographers use as case studies ndash have been jostling to be redesignated as cities. Stirling, Perth and Inverness have all successfully secured city status. This seems to please some politicians. Geographers roll their eyes.The latest research sets aside such eccentricities, harmless as they may be.A town, for geographers, is an urban settlement with a population of between , and , or so. Council borders ndash such as between Glasgow and Rutherglen ndash or local name signs, such as the border between and Gourock and Greenock, are not important for this kind of analysis.And so Scotland has three real city conurbations, Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen, and  distinct towns, from relatively big Dundee to Whitburn in West Lothian.Michael Kenny, the professor who leads the Bennett Institute, admits there is wiggle room over definitions.He said: ldquoWhat some people will call a town, other people will call a city. The two things blur in to each other.ldquoFor the statistical stuff, we use a technical definition. A town is a place that exists separately from a large city, that has its own identity and its own sense that people feel they belong to them, and they are smaller than a city.ldquoOver the last two decades in Britain and in many other countries the dominant assumption is you can achieve growth through cities.ldquoAlmost inevitably that led to towns and other communities moving to the margins of the attention of policy makers. I donrsquot think that was always deliberate. But towns fell from view.ldquoA number of towns have quite rightly read the runes and seen that in the world of government funding and focus, being a city or a city region is a better route to getting resources.ldquoThere is something  here as well, which is that some of these places, and Dunfermline is a good example, are seeing rapid shts in population and feel more like cities.Kenny and his colleague Ben Goodair have been crunching numbers across Britain. They are looking at things like levels of deprivation and jobs density ndash how many posts there are per person in a town. And they have watched populations wax and wane. So Greenock shrinks and Dunfermline grows.Amid the bigger picture, there are hard truths. Scotlandrsquos towns are poor. ldquoThree-quarters have more household deprivation than the average British town, concludes the report. ldquoMeanwhile, towns in Scotland also appear to have lower numbers of some key public services. There are fewer nursery schools, mental health practitioners and health services compared to the British average.ldquoThe sparsity of these services is indicative of lacklustre town centres and struggling local economies.There is only one of the  towns with no police station . Only six lack a fire station. Yet centralisation under successive governments mean there are many with no hospital.The authors suggest things are getting better for public services in towns. ldquoIn terms of changes to public service numbers between  and , its towns outperform those in England and Wales ... and, of the top  British towns with the most increases in public service provision,  of them are Scottish.Sometimes services ndash such as transport ndash are based around historical population patterns. The report cites Greenock as an example. ldquoAs a key centre of manufacturing, shipbuilding and mining since the th century, Greenock has  train stations. This serves as a useful reminder that levels of service provision are sometimes the result of longer historical patterns, not just current policy choices.ldquoOverall Scotlandrsquos towns have experienced a reduction in the number of their services in key areas such as education, culture and emergency services, quite often because these have been consolidated in larger urban areas. In some cases, councils have merged schools, or lsquosupercampusrsquo, in the hopes of reducing costs. ldquoAberdeenshire Council reports nine recent consultations on reforming school provision through mergers, moving campuses and changing catchment areas.The reality is that towns y. A lot. Those that still have jobs are doing well. Only six of the  towns have more jobs than people of working age: oil town Westhill in Aberdeenshire, Inverurie, Inverness and Culloden, Elgin, Livingston and Perth. Dumfries, Fraserburgh, Stirling and Glenrothes are not far behind.But jobs do not necessarily mean wealth. Some dormitory or retirement towns, or those that are a mix ndash such as Helensburgh, Linlithgow, Stonehaven, Carnoustie and Ellon ndash can have low levels of deprivation despite low or medium levels of local employment.Kenny and Goodair suggest this iety means there is no one-size-fixes-all solution. Their reports says: ldquoThe wide geographic spread of towns in Scotland means that there is a iety of kinds of town. Understanding the dferent needs of these ndash for instance those that are struggling on the west coast, compared to its more prosperous lsquoworking townsrsquo in the northeast and the belt of residential, commuter towns around large cities ndash is a prerequisite for more effective policy responses.In England, the focus on towns comes after Brexit, after the chattering classes noticed that town dwellers and the left-behind of small urban centres voted Leave. Kenny added: ldquoWe are seeing a turn back to look at towns because certainly in England the jolt of Brexit has provoked some soul-searching.The Federation of Small Businesses is one of the few bodies demanding more attention for towns, Brexit or not. Its spokesman, Craig Borland, said: ldquoThis report shows our towns remain a mixed bag, with some offering unique and vibrant locations to live, work and do business. However, many towns still bear the scars of deindustrialisation and continue to struggle with that legacy, especially in the west.ldquoIf we want to improve the economic fortunes of our hard-pressed towns, we need to tackle the root causes of their challenges. And, at the core of that, is generating and maintaining a critical mass of economic activity ndash spreading their risk across several economic sectors making it easier to start up and run a business making it the first choice for consumers ending their abandonment by banks and the public sector. All of that, of course, requires long-term funding and support.Politicians will be spending a lot of time in towns this month as they hit the campaign trail. They can expect to hear a lot about bus stops, banks and post offices, job centres, supermarkets, train, fire and police stations and all the other amenities that make a town a town. most deprived townsbull Cowdenbeath, Lochgelly and Lumphinnansbull Methil, Leven and Buckhavenbull Stranraerbull Whitburnbull Greenockbull Larkhallbull Kilsythbull Irvinebull Hawickbull PrestonpansTown health check: three success storiesBy the reports authorsFalkirkFalkirk scores best of any town in Britain on our index of changes to public service numbers between  and .By our measures, Falkirk can be categorised as an improving town, an isolated town and a working town.

In Orkney, Police have joined up with Orkney Road Safety forum, to encourage cyclists to remain safe and visible, with not only education, but the handing out of bike lights.Police are reminding cyclists that along with obeying all traffic signs, traffic light signals and not cycling on pavements, they must equip their bikes with the appropriate lights and make sure they are lit when it starts to get dark.Officers in Orkney will be proactively looking to address cyclists who ignore the legislative requirement to illuminate their bikes in darkness, and will be providing bike lights to those who need them. Just over  pairs of bike lights have been purchased using funding from Police Scotland Safer Communities for this purpose.#Visibility is key to keeping cyclists safe on the roads and I would encourage cyclists to ensure they wear bright reflective clothing and illuminate lights on their bikes, both front and rear, in order to make themselves more visible to other road users,# said chief inspector, Matthew Webb.#This is equally applicable during the day, but more important at dusk and when it#s dark, to avoid collisions and warn other road users to their presence.#Some cyclists wear dark clothing and particularly on faster roads they can be almost invisible to drivers until they are close to them.#He added: #I recognise in this rural community that a lot of the measures are equally applicable to the equine community and they are more than welcome to make use of the same free offer.#This initiative has been supported by the Orkney Road Safety Forum who will assist with the distribution of these lights, which in addition to the police office, are available from the OIC hubs and Scottish Fire and Rescue Service Community Safety Advocacy.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We might be calling the vote on  December a general election and politicians might be muttering about health and education and what have you, but when the UK goes to the polls, the key issue upon which we will be making our feelings known is Brexit.Will we send a majority of Tories back, enabling Boris Johnson to take the UK out of Europe under the deal he struck last month or,he wishes, to use his parliamentary might to overturn legislation preventing a no-deal exit  Or will we – unlikely as it may now seem –a majority Labour government, allowing Prime Minister Jeremy Corbyn to hold a second referendum, offering the choice of leaving with a deal or remaining Perhaps – and I accept this is the most unlikely of all possible outcomes – Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson will become our next prime minister and Brexit will simply be cancelled.The stakes are high for all leaders, but for Johnson, the implications of failure are especially great. If he wins that majority, he’s home and dry, but polls told us the Tories would win a majority in  and this did not come to pass. If this outcome is repeated and Johnson ends up, yet again, leader of the largest party in a hung parliament, the parliamentary impasse over Brexit that has persuaded MPs of the need for another general election – the fourth in less than a decade – will be re-established. If Johnson remains PM in those circumstances, he can expect his opponents to continue to hamstring him over the UK’s departure from the EU, making his premiership a miserable grind. This, I think, would be the most entertaining outcome, but I daresay it wouldn’t do much by way of providing much-needed certainty over Brexit.But while Brexit may be the central issue under consideration for voters, here in Scotland there’s another big constitutional question at the heart of this general election.For SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, the result in December will be all about Scotland’s place in the UK. The First Minister has, since succeeding Alex Salmond after defeat for the Yes campaign in ’s independence referendum, expended a great deal of energy explaining to Scots that we are becoming increasingly persuaded of the merits of breaking up the UK. Inconveniently for her, poll after poll has failed to show that this is true.Recently, however, support for independence appears to have crept up. The nationalists might not yet have the majority of Scots onside – let alone the  per cent the First Minister’s people once briefed would be necessary for her to call a second referendum – but the tide is moving slowly in their direction.And so the result of the coming general election is of huge importance to Sturgeon’s project.We can, of course, assume that the SNP will win the majority of seats in Scotland. So dominant are the nationalists that they took  of Scotland’s  Westminster seats in . And even after losing  of those constituencies in , the SNP remained by far the largest Scottish party at Westminster.But simply winning most seats in Scotland in December is not the goal. If Sturgeon’s SNP is to make real progress towards another referendum, the party will have to win a clear majority of votes. This will not be easy.Even when the nationalists swept aside all but three of their opponents in , they did so without winning a majority of the popular vote. This fact undermined any SNP claim that another independence referendum was necessary. The result in  hardly helped that SNP argument. Even senior party figures such as Deputy First Minister John Swinney conceded that the push for another referendum had cost the nationalists seats.After a dozen years in power at Holyrood, the SNP remains seemingly untouchable by its opponents but the membership is becoming increasingly impatient about a lack of progress towards another referendum.Sturgeon tells members that she wishes to hold another independence referendum next year, but the Scottish Government has no right to initiate such an event. When andanother referendum takes place is a matter for Westminster. Sturgeon may insist that there will be another vote on Scotland’s place in the UK next year but she cannot possibly guarantee such a thing.If Johnson wins a majority in December, he will not waver from the current position of the UK government that a second independence referendum is a non-starter. If Corbyn wins a majority, then he will have no reason to play along with SNP demands for another kick of the constitutional football. If Labour ends up the largest party in a hung parliament, however, then Sturgeon will find she has cards to play.What the SNP really needs is for a majority of Scots to vote for pro-independence parties in December. The general election may, for the most part, be a rerun of the European question, but in Scotland it is a chance to revisit the matter of independence.If the SNP, the Greens, and whichever fringe pro-independence parties that put up candidates come through the process without winning more than half the popular vote, it’s dficult to see how Sturgeon gets another referendum up and running.Even a majority of votes for nationalist parties wouldn’t guarantee indyref but it would certainly bolster the First Minister’s case that one should be held.After a prolonged period of unshakeable discipline in the SNP, cracks are beginning to appear. Some now wish Sturgeon to take a more aggressive approach, perhaps even declaring an election win as grounds to begin independence negotiations.Such a course would be a recipe for disaster. It would create huge conflict in the SNP and the law would declare any claim of independence meaningless.Right now, the most that Sturgeon can do is try to maintain momentum for the nationalist project. If nationalist parties win an overall majority in Scotland next month, she will have kept the train on the tracks."},{"url":null,"title":"rugby world cup why i ll be cheering on england john mclellan","story":"I feel as much a part of the English rugby scene as I do of Scotland#s, writes ex-Preston Grasshopper John McLellan.Down at Twickenham earlier this year, I swear there were tears in my eyes as what had seemed just before half time to be turning into a sickening humiliation was instead becoming one of the most staggering recoveries in sport.For Scottish rugby fans, Liverpool coming back from - down to beat AC Milan on penalties in the  Champions’ League final would have nothing on this gameScotland could win from - behind.

But it was striking how the rest of the country seemed to want Scotland to do well in Argentina, in contrast to those blokes who head to the pub wearing the football shirts of countries they can’t locate on a map when England play.In  I was playing for Preston Grasshoppers when the Grand Slam was won, where Wade Dooley was still learning his trade and couldn’t know he’d experience what it was like to lose to Scotland in a title decider six years later. That day I turned out for Furness RUFC from Barrow, the only Scot in a packed clubhouse where afterwards everyone patted my back and shook my hand asI’d actually been playing at Murrayfield. This morning I’ll be texting a couple of my team-mates from that day.A gun to Zeffirelli’s headYears living in England, playing rugby union and covering professional rugby league has made me feel as much part of their game as ours. The rest of the house is solidly behind England too, but at least my we can justy her support on account of actually being English. So the rest of the gang can claim red and white blood, but even so my hockey-playing daughterstill gets asked by some team-mates how she can support “them” when “we’ll never hear the end of it”. Well we never tire of Archie Gemmill’s goal or  and I’ll never forget Twickenham .There will of course be those who will say that it’s only to be expected from a Conservative, and a lot worse, although there are plenty of our persuasion who are in the Anyone-but-England camp. But I’ve never seen the need to wallow in every set-back suffered by English teams to demonstrate pride in my heritage and culture or the dferences between us, and I’m as quick as the next Scot when abroad to correct anyone who thinks I’m from where. Like the woman in Arizona who saw me in a kilt and askedI was Irish.I am reminded of the story told by Italian film director Franco Zeffirelli when he was a partisan fighter during the War. Trapped between Allied and German forces he gave himself up to what he hoped were friendly troops. “English ” he called, and thought his le was over when a soldier shouted back “No” in a guttural tone he didn’t recognise and put a gun near his head. The soldier hissed, “We’re f***ing Scottish.”Seven ministers in seven yearsTalking of culture, seven ministers in seven years is not a musical based on government departments, but it should be at the Department of Culture, Media and Sport, where this week Nicky Morgan announced she will be the latest Secretary of State to depart since Jeremy Hunt’s elevation to health in .For us in the news business, it’s a key appointment, but no sooner had the industry got to know what Maria Miller, Sajid Javid, John Whittingdale, Karen Bradley, Matt Hancock and Jeremy Wright were all about, than it was usually time to move on.Ms Morgan has only been in the job three months, not even enough time to pop into the News Media Association offices for a spot of lunch.

How they expected folk could go for weeks without any money at all, just with the the promise it would be sorted out, I think is disgraceful.#He said the much-maligned #bedroom tax# had also been a contributing factor, and added it was important for people both in public and private sectors to have a fair living wage.Ms Valente said she had been shocked by the numbers of people who needed to use the food bank but were too ashamed of their poverty.#The cost of housing is one of the things I find quite shocking,# she said, adding that people needed to #earn a huge amount of money# to put a roof over their heads.She was also #appalled# by universal credit, and added it was wrong for society to #really target# or make people feel bad about being poor.Mr Wenger said people were encouraged to go to Citizens Advice Bureau, which could advise people on how to manage their finances.But Debra Nicolson, who stood as the Green candidate in the recent Holyrood campaign, pressed for more information on what candidates would doelected.Other questions were asked about the stigma attached to free school meals, and how it can be tackled.Ms Valente said responsibility lay with the government, but stressed the council needed to ensure social work staff and support services were fully prepared to help.Mr Robinson pointed to the -plus housing waiting list, and stressed affordable housing was key to solving the problem.Ms Henderson added there was an #antiquated rule# in the council that a percentage of the housing stock had to be kept free in case there was an emergency, and added she had argued that should be scrapped because #people need houses now#.Mr Flaws added there would always be a stigma until people are prepared to talk more openly about it.Mr Wenger said beating stigma, and preventing discrimination, needed to start at an early age. He added SSE had raised energy prices three times in one year, and stressed the issue should be picked up in the council.A former councillor, Iris Hawkins, wondered how well the candidates would adjust to #le in the goldfish bowl.#Mr Wenger said many people knew him already as a postman and as a tourist guide. He said he was a member of Transition Shetland.As a German, he said people had noticed his lack of Shetland dialect, although he admitted having problems with English accents, too.#The most problems I have with the English isI look down to the #sooth-moothers# at  Downing Street#.Ms Valente said being a councillor meant #you can#t win#, because pleasing one person would mean upsetting another.#You just have to do the best job that you can so you can sleep at night with a clean conscience.#You just have to do the best job that you can so you can sleep well at night with a clean conscience# FRANCIS VALENTEMr Robinson has #been there before#.

We need to bring it down and work on other solutions.#But I think the council does need to declare a climate emergency.#Questions were also raised on ferry links to the mainland, with concerns voiced about the number of cabins and the freight constraints.Ms Valente said the boats were #not fit for purpose,# and added capacity for freight was #dreadful#.Mr Robinson said Shetland should be able to design a ferry to suit its own needs. He said the real problems with NorthLink vessels lay at constraints at Aberdeen Harbour, as well as regulations which limited where on a vessel cabins could be placed.#To my mind we really should have the power locally to resolve our own ferry service, so we can design something that works for us.#Mr Flaws said the ferries were commissioned roughly  years ago. He said it was dficult for his family of five to get away on the ferry.#They#re just not fit for purpose. We need to say what we need rather than be told what we should be using.#Discussion also focused on the bus service, with support for cheaper – or even,possible, free – buses being offered.Mr Flaws said it would be good to see more people using buses.#If it was cheaper or free then maybe more folk would be using it. If that was an incentive to get more folk on it, then that should be looked at,# although he acknowledged some bus times did not suit everybody.Ms Valente cited an occasion when she lived in Sandveien when the bus could get her to work just before am.#They they changed the service, so that actually you either had to get to work by half eight or half nine. It#s just ridiculous. I do not know how that happened.#Mr Wenger said e-buses – smaller units which can be called upon using an app – should be adopted. He added he had enjoyed a positive experience with an electric bike.Mr Robinson – a convert to the bike himself – said there was no easy answer on buses.#The last thing you want to do is run a bus with three folk on it when in actual fact that#s causing a bigger carbon footprint than a car with three folk in it.#He berated the absence of any buses in Shetland that ran on anything other than diesel. He cited Dundee, which had a number of electric taxis.Questions were raised about how a councillor might get things discussed with other members.Mr Robinson said climate change was something he would consider attempting to raise a notice of motion over – a measure which would ensure the topic is debated in the chamber.#That is one thing the council has failed to move on so far. I suspectyou were to canvas the councillors and ask them to sign it, you#d probably get half the councillors for a start. I fail to understand why they#ve not moved on it. It#s ridiculous.#Mr Flaws said an issue that kept coming back was that people had no idea what the council#s strategy was with sustainable energy.#It#s Viking Energy, or it#s nothing,# he said.Ms Valente said she wanted to ensure everyone#s house was insulated.#There are people living in houses that are cold. There are people who can not afford to do it and are choosing between putting the heating on and having something to eat.#Mr Wenger said council office buildings should be insulated, but Ms Henderson said it was important to deal with the issues constituents bring forward. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"prince charles receives a right royal welcome to the borders","story":"Photos of his visit to St Boswells are online here: https:www.thesouthernreporter news in-pictures-duke-of-rothesay-s-visit-to-mainstreet-trading-company--"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/001WH1810NCA-crop.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio files friday 18th","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week, Skye  Lochalsh Council for Voluntary Organisations http:www.slcvo.org.uk  produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

If Edinburgh and Skye do suffer from overtourism, what can we do about it  In a free country, we cannot stop people from coming here, evenwe wanted to.It should also be recognised that folk visit those two places for dferent reasons. Edinburgh is an architectural jewel which is at its most crowded during the annual festival. People come to Skye for the scenery — most notably in recent years to the Trotternish Ridge and the Fairy Pools, two undeniably beautul spots in an island which is full of other undeniably beautul spots.Edinburgh cannot be expected to cancel its festival, any more than we want to drain the Fairy Pools or blow up the Old Man of Storr.And we do not want to stop them coming. They bring money, which provides jobs and kickstarts enterprises and improves the island#s economic wellbeing even outside the realm of the local tourist industry.Professor John Lennonof Glasgow Caledonian University#s Moffat Centre is presently commissioned by another independent body, SkyeConnect, to carry out a major survey of the impact of tourism on Skye.Professor Lennon and his colleagues are not due to deliver their report until next spring. But he will offer a taste of its findings so far to the autumn conference of SkyeConnect next month.We look forward to both the sample and the full report. We can hazard a guess at some of its content.Skye has been #discovered# by the rest of the world, like a Caledonian Machu Picchu.Unlike the Peruvian Inca site, however, Skye is a very big island. Unlike Machu Picchu, it is not yet collapsing under the weight of its visitors# feet.Skye can — and Mark Crothall congratulated the Skyetime campaign for pointing this out — accommodate half a million visitors, and continue to benefit hugely from their spending, particularlycertain adjustments are made to the tourist itinerary.More people should be encouraged to spend a quiet and infinitely rewarding week in Elgol or Waternish, in all four seasons, than take a whistle-stop, bucket list summer tour of the Storr, the Fairy Pools and back to the bridge.And of course, local and national government should do much more to improve the basic infrastructure of the island, from roads and parking areas to public transport and public toilets.Skye has bucked the trend of the rest of the north-western Highlands and Islands by growing its population and its economy in recent years.That has chiefly been because of the tourist industry. After  years of steady and apparently irreversible decline, the growth quite naturally took everybody by surprise. We should now learn to adapt to it, rather than call it #overtourism# and hope that it goes away."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/001WH2510NCA-web.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio files friday 25th","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week, Skye  Lochalsh Council for Voluntary Organisations http:www.slcvo.org.uk  produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

Instead, it leads to the booze aisle in thelocal supermarket and to a drinking den out on the moor.In this, the maincharacter in Kevin MacNeil’s novel ‘The Stornoway Way’ is depicted as havingmuch in common with his fellow islanders, whether or not they absorb their localminister’s thunderous moralising. Theplay of the same name, which MacNeil also wrote, pulls no punches so far asdevastating social critique is concerned.There’s a lot in a name. RomanStornoway can be read as romance torn away. He is also R Stornoway. He is a religiouscuckoo in the nest and the key in a roman a clef. The character himselfacknowledges all this. As an everyman outsider, Mister S is meant tocommunicate a great deal about Lewis.Calvinism, alcohol and climatecombine in a pernicious cocktail that permeates people and place. Depression, repression and addiction are endemic.So are dreams of escape.If this is the desolate reality in which MacNeil’s characters are immersed, the play of the novel # staged by Dogstar Theatre at Sabhal Mor Ostaig last week # sugars the pill with scabrous wit, hilarious minor characters, and some truly moving songs, among them a traditional Gaelic lament rendered with crystalline clarity by Lewis-born actor Rachel Kennedy. It is a sublime moment where Roman reconnects with the culture he scorns. But the moment passes, and the song of loss and love is soon replaced with cynicism and tomorrow’s hangover.All good writing, whetherfor page or stage, interweaves the personal, the local and the universal. Roman’s war is with himself and with Lewishis dreams are of finding love and self-fulfilment. The universal arrives inthe shape of Eva, a Hungarian student who initially succumbs to Roman’s scatterguncharm, but who later comes to see him as self-obsessed and manipulative. Roman is certainly that. Heis also vulnerable, funny, and capable of great profundity.Self-fulfilment comesthrough music, and when Roman’s long-suffering best friend Eilidh organises asession for him in a recording studio in Edinburgh, the road to salvationopens. But Roman is a master at self-sabotage. Matters don’t quite go to plan.Naomi Stirrat as Roman,Rachel Kennedy as Eilidh and Chloe-Ann Tylor as Eva are all fine actors, and adeptat lively theatricality. As an ensemble,they tick like a Swiss watch, darting here and there without missing a beat. Andthey can’t half belt out a tune. As with all adaptations,there are issues concerning the episodic aspect of narrative fiction and how thisworks on stage, in real-time. In ‘The Stornoway Way’ scene transitions areheralded by brief drum patterns that wouldn’t sound out of place in an Americansitcom. But that is to cavil. MacNeil’s play is at least as good as his novel, and the novel was very good indeed."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MOD-GLW-19-BACK-CHOIR-4.jpg","title":"competition underway to create a flag for","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoinen.This weeksees the launch of a competition to design a flag, which will be recognised by the Court of Lord Lyon — the body responsible for recording and protecting all heraldry, flags and national symbols in Scotland — and will be flown and displayed as an emblem of the island at home and abroad., Highland Council ward members and tourism body SkyeConnect petitioned the court with the idea for a flag following the example of several other island areas and regions which have, in recent years, adopted a flag.Philip Tibbetts, honorary vexillologist with the Court of the Lord Lyon, is to visit schools on the island next week to deliver a series of workshops and presentations detailing his interest in flags, and discussing the themes which could potentially inspire a flag for Skye.It is hoped youngsters and adults will be keen to have a go at designing the flag, and enter the competition which will run from st November until st December, after which a  — made up of representatives from throughout the community — will compile a short list of final entries which will then become subject of a public vote in February of next year.or by post to Skye Flag Competition, c o West Highland Free Press, Unit B, Pairc nan Craobh, Broadford, Isle of Skye IV AP, the potential for both the design and subsequent usage of a flag for the island is incredible.”In addition to the information provided on this page, these links will be helpful:"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/LOVAT-STUART-MACDONALD-2-adj.jpg","title":"shinty hurling to take centre stage as scotland visit face ireland this","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineTwo Kinlochshiel players, Finlay MacRae and Donald Nixon, are in the Scotland squad for the senior shinty-hurling match.At under- level Alan MacRae has named a -man squad seeking to seal a second win in succession against the Irish.Skye#s William MacKinnon is in line for his debut, while there is also a place in the squad for Johnnie MacAskill, the ex-Kinlochshiel player, now playing for Glasgow Mid Argyll.

Anyone that met her - she took a piece of their heart straight away and they never forgot her.Ruby had to battle a lot day to day, but she did it with huge strength, she was fully depended on us   for all of her care. This was huge for us as a family.Ruby did not sleep at night. She had a lot of cerebral irritation and suffered from frequent seizures daily We, as her parents, were the only ones able to provide this care.This is where the Hospice played a huge part in our lives, Ruby attended the hospice for respite from the age of six months. The hospice is a home away from home that provides the most amazing care and love to the children and their families with full : medical care  .We, as a family, felt completely comfortable that Ruby was being cared for to the highest standard, in a place filled with love and joy. This gave us time to refuel to keep going that bit longer.The Hospice were also there for us in Ruby’s end of le care, we spent our final two days with her there, in the comfort of a home setting with the support of the nursing staff around us.This gave us precious time that we would never have got anywhere .We made memories that we will cherish forever and we are truly indebted to the Hospice for having such a signicant impact in our final days with Ruby.We decided to host Rubys Birthday Fundraiser last year and it was a huge success, raising an amazing pound,. The whole community and local business were fully behind us and couldn’t have done it without them.

I continue to tell my story of grief and Ruby’s le on my blog Chasingladybirds it has been a good way help journey through grief and to also reach out to others in the same situation.Everyone that knew Ruby knew that ladybirds was her wee thing.When she was only a few months old a ladybird landed on her toes one summer day and thats where it all started.In my journey of grief I decided that blogging might be a good outlet and a good way to share my story and journey of grief.Chasing ladybirds came from our connection of ladybirds with Ruby, and Chasing was down to we will always chase Ruby’s memory.We will never forget our memories and love for her - we will always chase every moment we had with her.Lisa and her family would love ityou can make it to Rubys Birthday Fundraiser.Admission costs pound for adults and children go free.

completion has the potential to transform lives, commenting: “This new amenity will be a game changer for the local community, and will hopefully motivate more iniduals who lead sedentary lestyles to increase their physical activity level and enjoy the health benefits that regular exercise brings.“It’s long been our ambition to see this section of riverside trail extended and enhanced so that the recreational value of this wonderful environmental asset can be fully appreciated.“Creating a riverside trail was first identied as a viable project in the Gilford Village Plan . Today we come together - community, council, funders and key contributors - to celebrate its successful completion. Well done to all involved!”The completion of this second phase of works on council-owned land has created a scenic riverside trail that stretches  metres and connects Bridge Street and Gilford Community Centre to the attractive Woodlands Park, passing the iconic Gilford Mill building along the way.In addition to creating a short section of walkway over the remains of the old millrace and constructing a new footbridge across the millrace, the council undertook associated works to enhance the trail including landscaping, installing street furniture, lighting and interpretative .The second phase has been completed thanks to £, in funds allocated by SOAR’s Local Action Group. This project was part funded under Priority of the Northern Ireland Rural Development Programme - from the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs and the European Union.Chair of SOAR ABC Roisin McAliskey added: “This project has been completed to an exceptionally high standard, and is exemplary ofhow funds from SOAR’s Rural Village Renewal scheme can be used to support the implementation of local village plans.”Open to the public since July, the new trail is already proving to be a popular destination for walkers, runners and cyclists.Welcoming completion of the trail, Jerome Burns, Contracts Manager, Southern Rural Affairs Division at the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs  said: “This trail has been completed as part of a suite of village enhancement measures financed through the Village Renewal strand of the Leader Rural Development Programme. It provides a great opportunity for everyone to enjoy the many benefits of outdoor activity, and it is an excellent example of how DAERA is delivering on its vision of a ‘living, working, active landscape valued by everyone.”Given its proximity to Gilford Community Centre, this marvellous amenity set in an attractive riverside setting greatly complements the centre with its excellent indoor and outdoor facilities including a climbing wall, trim trail, picnic tables, pump track, canoe landings and beginners’ canoe slalom course.Alternative Heat are set to expand the firm Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"The council acknowledges with thanks the co-operation of the owners of Gilford Mill, Karl Asset Management, which enabled this project to proceed along with The MWA Partnership Ltd, Landscape Architects and A.G.

The event will also see launch of a groundbreaking new report that outlines a framework for community development.The paper, entitled ‘We Must Dissent’, is the result of a community survey that assessed the human rights of local residents against the major issues facing the area. Amongst the issues identied were concerns around road safety, housing, health, education, and unemployment.Another key issue was the pressures of commercial land speculation in the area, which has presented an obstacle to the community development of the Lanyon Tunnels.Despite planning permission and £.million being granted for the development, plans have been stalled by owners of an adjacent piece of land – which was subject to plans to build a £million office block.In , residents won a legal victory when the High Court ruled that planning approval for office block was unlawful. However, the potential for future plans to develop the land could impede access to the tunnelsgiven the go-ahead.Speaking ahead of next Wednesday’s event, Fionntán Hargey from the Market Development Association said the tunnels development would provide a “massive boost to people’s self esteem”.“It would physically reconnect them to city centre and it would also reconnect them into the economic, social and cultural le of Belfast. “The tunnels got planning permission in , and there is £. million in funding sitting there ready to go, and there are three groups of residents trained up and they’ve got business places developed. We also have updated drawings that have recently been commissioned. “The issue is that there is a private developer who is refusing to grant access to allow the project to go ahead.”He continued: “Next Wednesday will refresh people on the latest concept drawings and give people wider overview of the Redeveloping the Local Economy programme. Our aspiration is that by January we will be launching a report, and we will have several groups of residents with business ideas that are on course for development.” Next Wednesday’s event will take place at pm in the Market Community Centre where guest speaker, Dr Sean Byers, will discuss the economics of community empowerment. There will also be a full project update on the Lanyon Tunnels."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ballotbox_pr8qo2.png","title":"north set for december","story":"POLITICAL parties in the north have put their general election machines in gear after MPs voted for a December  poll.The legislation is expected to be approved by the end of the week when it goes through the House of Lords. MPs votedfor the election by a mammoth margin of  votes to .Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is ready to fight a “tough” election while Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the snap poll is a “once-in-a-generation” opportunity to transform the country.DUP Leader Arlene Foster said it is right the people of Northern Ireland have their say through the ballot box.“The DUP will use this opportunity to campaign strongly to send a message that Northern Ireland is better in the Union of the United Kingdom and we cannot be separated economically from Great Britain,” she said.“We have a record of speaking up for Northern Ireland in Westminster and delivering for everyone in Northern Ireland.“At a time of great uncertainty as to who will form the next government how Northern Ireland votes will matter as never before.“Unionists need their strongest team ed to so that Northern Ireland’s interests are protected in the next Parliament.That team is the DUP.“This election will matter and we will be campaigning for every vote as we take our message to the people.”Reacting to news of a pre-Christmas election, Sinn Féin Leader in the North Michelle O’Neill said it is an opportunity to reject the DUP, reject the Tories and reject the destructive role of Westminster on the north. “It is a welcome opportunity for the people of the north to have their say on the looming disaster of Brexit,” she said.#It is a chance to reject the DUP and the Tories, to reject Brexit and the Westminster chaos and its destructive influence on the north of Ireland.#Sinn Féin has strong candidates who work tirelessly on behalf of their constituents, and we stand ready to fight this election. “Sinn Féin has successfully made the case to the Irish government and Europe that the north’s special circumstances needed to be recognised to protect our economy against the Brexit catastrophe, to avoid any hardening of the border and to protect the Good Friday Agreement. “The DUP have ignored the democratic wishes of the people of the north, of business, of farmers, of retailers. The people of the north did not consent to Brexit. “There is no good Brexit for Ireland. “Westminster is in chaos. It has no answers and no solutions.“The Brexit debacle has shown that Westminster cannot, has not and will never act in the interests of the people of the north. “Your interests in this election are best served by voting Sinn Féin for a dferent future by sending a clear message to the British government that we want control of our own future through a referendum on Irish unity.#Alliance Leader Naomi Long said her party is best-placed to unite Remain voices.“This election will be mainly focused around Brexit and Alliance has always been clear there is no such thing as a good or sensible Brexit,” she said.“Therefore it will be an opportunity for people to have their say and elect MPs who want to avoid a hard border, protect the Good Friday Agreement and attend Westminster to represent their interests. “We are uniquely placed to do that, as the Alliance surge seen in May’s local government and European Elections showed the party could reach across all sections of our community and gain support from everywhere.“We have been preparing for an election for some time, as it is clear this Parliament is hopelessly ided and the Government has no legitimacy. Northern Ireland voted to Remain. “If people vote for Alliance candidates, we can increase the representation of progressive, pro-Remain MPs and articulate that voice loudly at Westminster.”"},{"url":null,"title":"church of ireland archbishop dr richard clarke to retire","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Theres not a chance he will split the vote.\"He would be committing political suicide,\" he said.\"He will eventually say that he has considered all the soundings that have been taken from his membership and he will give way, with the proviso that there should be a reciprocal move from the DUP in other areas.\"Mr Dodds is defending a majority of just over , and Sinn Fein voters in the constituency were hoping yesterday that the UUP would put up a candidate and enhance the chances of victory for their man, Belfasts Lord Mayor John Finucane.At Yorkgate shopping centre Jean Johnston from the New Lodge area said she thought a split vote could help Sinn Fein but she added that she wanted all politicians to do more to help ordinary people.Two other local women agreed. Kathy White said: \"The real priorities should be social issues like better housing. I am fed up hearing about Brexit.\"Geraldine Moore said: \"I will be voting for John Finucane.\"But I think the DUP and Sinn Fein will get their backsides warmed in this election.

In Dublin city in the mid-s, there were more than , Orangemen - comparative to north Armagh, the home of the Orange Institution. data-dfpadtargetingThe bookletsMr Dougan, who lives in Markethill, said: \"Orangeism had been in decline prior to the Great War, but the turbulent times of the Anglo-Irish War and the Civil War, when there were ious attacks in the early s, made it very dficult for Orange lodges to meet.\"It was a chance event that inspired Mr Dougan to begin researching the \"lost and forgotten\" unionist and loyalist history.\"There was a medal that came up for sale at Whites auction house in Dublin for Achill Island Orange Lodge and I was asked about it. So, that prompted me to start some research and suddenly I began to uncover lots of undocumented facts,\" he said.Mr Dougan regularly travels south of the border to give talks.Just last week he addressed members of Achill Island Historical Society about Co Mayo Orangeism which \"went down really well\", and other trips this year have taken him to Mayo, Cork, Meath, Dublin, Donegal and Dun Laoghaire.He said: \"Almost universally I get a reception of immense interest and a positive line of questioning. \"The history aspect is very eclectic, % of people have no idea what Orangeism is about.\"The booklets have been translated by Irish language scholar and university professor Dr Ciaran OCoigligh.Mr Dougan explained: \"They should be and are of interest to anyone who has a true, agenda-free interest in discovering Irish history. \"The Irish language is a part of le for many people and this is an attempt to bring this subject matter to a new audience.\"However, Mr Dougan, who has worked as a columnist for the Orange Standard, the newspaper of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland, said that while he respects the Irish language, he is not in favour of an Irish Language Act, because of his concerns over how it would be \"imposed\" by Sinn Fein.\"One of the most sensitive issues at the minute in unionist and loyalist communities is that of an Irish Language Act,\" he added. \"It isnt really about the language directly, it is that our experience of Sinn Fein just does not trust them not to exploit itthey were given legal cover to do so. \"I fully intend to address the audience at the launch. I will tell them that I respect the language ... I will also tell them why I personally oppose an Irish Language Act, and why unionism in almost its totality opposes it.\" "},{"url":null,"title":"boy with leukaemia fulfils wish to find loch ness monster","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They called on their peers to jointhe programme.Bloc Blinds in Magherafelt is one of those companies. Mark Wilson, IT Director with the town centre business, said: “Since our establishment only eight years ago, Bloc Blinds has become a leading employer in Mid Ulster. Our technology underpins our success. We are pleased to be a founding member of this Career Encode initiative to develop and nurture the talent we need to continue to grow.”Alan Davis from Magherafelt, who secured a Career Encode apprenticeship with Bloc Blinds, praised the scheme.Hed said “I found Career Encode to be a better alternative to university as it gives the ability to learn and work in a real workplace.”FP McCann was another high profile company involved with the apprenticeship scheme.The Knockcloughrim-based companys IT Manager Brian Law said: “FP McCann is one of the largest employers in the mid Ulster region. Our bespoke IT infrastructure and software is critical to the sustainability of our enterprise.“We were so impressed with the high calibre of the applicants that we offered two apprenticeships as opposed to one. We are looking forward to continuing our investment in a skilled IT team with the Career Encode initiative and would strongly recommend it to any business that is experiencing dficulties in recruiting staff with technology skills.”Ronan Rafferty from Dungiven secured a Career Encode apprenticeship with FP McCann.Ronana said: “I was very interested in the ability to earn money whilst getting experience within the working environment.”Working in collaboration with Northern Regional College, the schemehas already appointed  newIT apprentices who will build careers within a rapidly growing sector, which, according to the Skills Barometer Report , compiled by Ulster University Economic Policy Centre, will grow by % over the next decade.With this in mind Career Encode is seeking more Northern Ireland businesses to sign up to the scheme to ensure the IT talent resource here is not outpaced by demand.Camilla Long, Director of Bespoke Communications, which specialises in training and leadership development, is acting as an independent facilitator for theexisting  employers on the scheme.She said: “One of the biggest hurdles for businesses today is sourcing staff, particularly IT staff. This scheme allows participating companies to take the IT skills gap into their own hands by developing a future workforce for their business.“We had a phenomenal response to the first initiative with  young people of exceptionally high standards vying for  apprenticeships. We anticipate that the demand for next year’s intake will be so much higher.“The benefits for participating companies are about much more than alleviating technology staffing needs. Being part of Career Encode sends out a message to the next generation that you provide a workplace with a positive working culture that nurtures long-term career goals all while allowing you to develop employees with the skillset that you need for your future.”For further information log ontowww.careerencode googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He was jailed for three years in December  for causing death by dangerous driving and spent another three years on license.Marty’s parents, Martin and Elizabeth, have had to live with the consequences of the driver’s actions for the rest of their lives. It has also impacted on the lives of his brothers Richard and Ryan, and sisters Michelle and Anne.This week the Department of Justice launched a public consultation into a Sentencing Review. One of the offences up for debate are those “which may result in death, including causing death by dangerous driving”.It seeks the public’s views on whether the current maximum sentence of  years should be increased to le imprisonment or increased to a higher fixed number of years.The Department confirmed to the Derry News that a decision can be taken on these legislative changes in the absence of a minister.The Gallagher family are supportive of le imprisonment being introduced for such offences.Speaking to the Derry News yesterday, Marty’s father described him as a “great son” who got on with everybody and raised a lot of money for charities through his running.Martin said his son would’ve been a good footballer and got involved in competitive running when he was  or -years-old.On the day Marty was killed, his father was working and didn’t see him before he went into town but said he was joking about with his mother before he left.Martin and his we slept on the third floor of the house with Marty and Ryan on the bottom floor. About am Ryan burst through the door saying, “he’s dead, he’s dead”, and when they asked who they were left in a state of shock. “The man killed Martin at am and then went on to a party,” Mr Gallagher said. googletag.cmd.push  Photo: Marty Gallagher with friend Barry Smith after London marathon No closure Martin and Elizabeth were initially asked to call to the Racecourse Road to identy him but a PSNI sergeant then said it wouldn’t be possible because it was a crime scene. The police sergeant, who still keeps in touch with the family and whom Mr Gallagher described as a “good man”, wanted to spare them the trauma of seeing Marty’s injuries.The following day they were also advised against seeing their son at the morgue but when the coffin was brought home Mr Gallagher said they were in disbelief and it brought “no closure”. “You’re wondering was that Martin and waiting for him to walk through the door,” he added.The man responsible for his death appeared in court for the first time on Martin’s birthday, February . He was sentenced in December  with police saying it was one of the quicker cases of its kind to pass through the courts.“First of all we tried for murder and they wouldn’t give it to us,” Martin recalled. “Then we tried for manslaughter and they wouldn’t give us that either, why, I don’t know.“I think the reason it went through so quick was because the girl testied who was in the back and actually shouted to the driver, ‘Jesus, there’s a fella crossing the road’. Martin was about a foot away from reaching the footpath.“That person who killed Martin was full of drugs and drink but the police couldn’t say when he took the drugs.“We were hoping that he would get at least fourteen years. What they’re trying to do now in England, Scotland and Wales is bring in le for le, but they’re not bringing it in in Northern Ireland.When told the news of proposals that are now on the table in NI to Increase the maximum sentence to le imprisonment for the three serious driving offences resulting in death or grievous bodily injury, Martin was fully supportive, believing it may be the deterrent needed to make drivers take more care.This would mirror the current maximum sentence available for offences such as manslaughter, rape, shooting or wounding with intent to commit grievous bodily harm. Public support Two months ago the same man responsible for their son’s death was convicted of a number of driving offences but was given a suspended sentence.“Ten years later he has never said he was sorry,” Martin stated, “I will never forgive him.” An emotional Martin said, “it’s like part of our le is gone,” as he implored anyone ever considering drink-driving to think about the suffering of families affected by such tragedies.“You live from day-to-day for your other children. You might’ve seen the ad on TV about the man living with depression who pulls the mask off at night, you just put a front on for people.“It gets no easier over ten years, people say it gets easier, it doesn’t, you learn to live with it just that’s it. If you didn’t have a good family and marriage, it would wreck your family.”And every time he crosses paths with his son’s killer it makes it worse, he added.Support from the local community has helped to lt the family’s spirits over the years. Last weekend  members of Foyle Valley Athletics Club ran the Dublin marathon in memory of Marty.One of the founding members of the club, Harry McNulty, ran his st and final marathon on the day – Marty was a prodigy of Harry’s when he joined Foyle Valley.“With Marty’s run every year we’ve raised about pound, for Derry charities. Over , people turned out at the start of the month.“It’s great to see what they thought of Martin and the money going to charity.“Last year we gave Altnagelvin a bed and it has Martin’s name on it but we try to spread it out. “The support gives us a lt and it just shows you what people thought of Martin,” Mr Gallagher concluded. .

So, all of our energy went on trying to win and get over the line on that first game and everything has just snowballed after that.”If there was ever a worry of the Rossa men freezing on the big stage, any such thought was obliterated by a performance that both players and management alike have deemed as one of their best.“For a lot of the build-up we were just worried that the players might freeze bit, they didn’t and they actually produced what we have thought to be their best performance of the year.“That is something that is very satisfying for not only us as the management but, for the players too.“We’ve a good celebration but, we got back out to training on Thursday evening and we were back out yesterday morning .“There is just your usual knocks and niggles but we are hoping to have everyone back for next week but, aside from that we’ve a full bill of health.” googletag.cmd.push AmbushBut attentions have definitely turned back to football and their eyes are firmly set on ambushing the Magpies in the Marshes.“Attention has definitely turned back to football, lads were still going into primary schools and things there on Thursday and Friday and they’d a few similar events on Saturday but, that is something they are embracing and they’re enjoying it.“But, now they’re in an Ulster Championship, you never know when you’ll get the chance to represent your club in Ulster again,ever.“Derry clubs have a really proud tradition in this competition and that is something that we are hoping to carry that on.”Like almost the every round of the Derry championship, Magherafelt will go into this one as heavy underdogs with little or no expectation.For many, they will claim that Kilcoo’s season only begins at the provincial stage.“I was actually chatting to a lad about this the other day and he told me that home advantage is massive in the first round of Ulster.“We are away from home they’ve played in seven of the last eight Ulster’s, they’ve two Derry managers that will know us inside and out, the preparation for us we’ll be the same as the final, as will the build-up.“Neutrals will look at all the iables and they’ll will write us off but, we are not afraid going up here. Looking at it and the match-up we think that it will be a close game.“Like I said we are the Derry champions and we want to go on and represent Derry well.“We’ve gone into almost every game as underdogs and the only game with expectation on us was the Banagher semi-final and looking back at it, we didn’t get enough credit when you see how fiercely competitive it is in the championship.”“That point was hammered home to me when I was sitting watching Thomas Davis’ knock Kilmacud Crokes out of the Dublin championship on Saturday night.”Quinn himself has some familiarities with Kilcoo lads through his time managing Fulham Irish in London, a club now managed by none other than Tyrone’s Owen Mulligan.“If I needed to know what this meant Gaelic Football was all about in Kilcoo these four emphasised it.“They were fiercely strong and put in a serious sht, real serious natural talent and damn good footballers.“Through that friendship I have been going and watching Kilcoo in the Ulster Championship and they are a serious outfit and I’m sure they haven’t appointed men of the calibre of Mickey and Conleith to just win the Down title.“It’s a game that we are really looking forward to, it’s like a new competition for us and we will be looking to represent Derry well.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A gun battle was raging between the military and paramilitary. He was an unwilling, innocent spectator. This personal experience, in Belfast’s Ballymurphy, was a snapshot of a society bereft of civil rights and constantly consumed with relentless violence. His interview with former Deputy First Minister, the SDLP’s Seamus Mallon, perfectly encapsulates both the tragedies of ‘The Troubles’ and the hopes for a better future. In ‘Born to Lead’ Seamus narrates a comprehensive overview of the historical triumphs of two ‘half parish’ GAA clubs – Slaughtneil, one of the greatest all-round clubs the Association has ever seen and the mighty men of Mullinalaghta, the outstanding  Leinster Senior football club champions. googletag.cmd.push This book is essentially a cameo of seventy years of Irish social, political and cultural le. It ranges from the showband era of the ’s to the splendid contribution of two present day Country music stars. Their current status emphasises the inherent value of “singing the songs of the people for the people”. Likewise, the y careers of two recently retired GAA players illustrate the importance of total dedication towards achieving personal goals. The author examines the mind set of some of his fellow alumni of St. Patrick’s College, Armagh. Insightful profiles of the legendary scoring exploits of Hogan Cup winner, Iggy Jones, and the versatility of Horslips’ Barry Devlin, are a microcosm of twelve, other gted SPCA luminaries who are also featured. All of them help immensely to make this superb book a wonderful and enjoyable read. Seamus will be launching Born to Lead in Slaughtneil Hall on Saturday, November ,  at .pm. The event is open to all and everyone is welcome.

There was controversy in the final seconds when Feargal Higgins looked to have grabbed victory for Dungiven. His kick, which appeared to curl inside the post, was ruled out. After the final whistle there were unsavoury scenes, lasting a minute, involving players and subs from both teams. Once order was restored, management and officials from both clubs entered discussions with referee Gavin Hegarty and a decision not to play extra-time was agreed. The game was played in incessant rain and both teams deserve credit for their endeavour over the hour. googletag.cmd.push Ballinascreen played with Reece McSorley as a sweeper. Dungiven counteracted by putting Odhraacuten McKeever on Noel Rafferty, leaving Sean McKeever free at the other end. Early points from Pauric McNicholl, Feargal and Cahir Higgins had Dungiven - to - ahead after seven minutes. A run from midfield by Marty Bradley split the Dungiven defence, before Jon Paul Devlin slotted ‘Screen’s first score of the game. When Conal Logan turned over possession in the face of Dungiven’s defensive wall, Sean McKeever broke at pace, leading to a second point for Cahir Higgins. An outside of the boot Niall Doyle point gave ‘Screen some brief respite but Fergal and Cahir Higgins, the latter from a free, opened a four point lead. Odhraacuten and Daire McKeever combined for Sean to come surge forward and open a - to - lead after  minutes. Just when they were threatening to fade out of the game, Ballinascreen found the net. Caoilte McAlinden had the bravery to flick over the final Dungiven defender and when he rushed on the loose ball, he had the composure to slot an inch-perfect shot across ‘keeper Hasson to the far corner of the net. Marty Bradley added a fisted point after a Ronan McKenna run from deep but it was Dungiven who finished stronger. Hasson’s short kick-out found Eoin McKeever, who built a move up the right wing before Daire slotted between the posts. Feargal Higgins passed to and took apass from Conor Kelly to kick between the posts, putting them - to - ahead at the break. The third quarter became a non-event, with a series of failed attacks as both teams carried possession into the tackle. In the rd minute Aaron McBride began a move up-field that led to Emmet Duggan being dragged to the ground by Sean McKeever. No card was brandished but when Devlin’s penalty hit the bar, he pounced on the rebound to level to force over the line and level the game. Darragh McGilligan began to come into the game and he began a move that led to a Conor Kelly score from the wing, after Cahir and Feargal Higgins both kept their composure. McGilligan doubled Dungiven’s lead but Michael O’Kane’s men played second fiddle for the rest of the game. With seven minutes to go, Cathal Donnelly turned over a move from the Dungiven defence before being dragged to the ground by Thomas McClarey but astonishingly no black card was shown, with Donnelly correctly later seeing black for a cynical foul. Devlin tapped over the free and with Ballinascreen in control, a draw looked a likely outcome. Goalkeeper Ryan Scullion scuffed a th shot to the left of the posts but made up for it with pressure kick in injury time to draw the game. Dungiven will have to plan without Conor Kelly for the replay, after he was dismissed on a straight red card, for an off the ball incident late in the game.

Quigg to the rescue for Kilrea Glen -Kilrea - There was also a stalemate in the other semi-final, when Paddy Quigg rescued Kilrea with a late free to draw with Glen in Loup. Three seasons ago, Kilrea went all the way to an Ulster Final at St Paul’s only to be beaten by Burren at St Paul’s. There was torrential rain from start to finish but Quigg opened the scoring with a goal after linking up with Daithi McLaughlin to beat ‘keeper Caolan Convery at the near post. It was point for point for the rest of the half. Quigg, Gearoid and Daithi McLaughlin were on target for the Pearses. Alex Doherty , Conleth McGuckin and Eunan Mulholland were the Glen scorers but they trailed - to - at the break. In horrendous conditions, the second-half, it took  minutes for first score of the half from Paddy Quigg.

The companies travelling from Derry and Strabane are O’Neill’s International Sportswear, Humanity Cosmetics, Learning Pool and Visual Edge while EKO Chute, MMG Welding and Wild Fuschia Bakery from Donegal will also be taking part. The trade and iInvestment mission will be led by Derry City and Strabane District Council and Donegal County Councils and will include third level and further education providers and development organisations including the Ulster University, Letterkenny Institute of Technology, the North West Regional College, Donegal ETB and Catalyst. The mission will run from  to  November. It will build on the strong political, economic and cultural linkages already established in Boston and Philadelphia with the North West City region and will be an opportunity to further reach out to the Irish diaspora.  Speaking ahead of the visit and welcoming the confirmation of the seven local companies, Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Cllr Michaela Boyle, said the visit was particularly timely for the companies and partners to promote the North West city region’s unique strategic cross border location. She said: “This trade mission is a real opportunity for us to focus on our strengths in terms of location, talent and skills and support. It is our chance to really sell our location to the business community in the US, by educating them to the fact that post Brexit they can locate in our region and access both the North of Ireland and the EU. We will be very positive in our approach to emphasise to potential investors the strong selling points we have in terms of our location, our talented skills base, our cultural compatibility and quality of le, During the visit the participating businesses will meet with key contacts, explore and understand opportunities in the US market, develop in-market networks and develop relationships with potential customers. The civic delegation will engage with industry influencers and leaders, meet with Philadelphia Council and attend a Philadelphia Diaspora event. While in Boston they will visit the Irish Immigration Centre, meet State representatives at the State House and attend the official launch of the Hard GSD Visit Atlas for a City Region project as well as engaging with senior business executives. In addition to attending bespoke business to business meetings and engaging with potential investors and business connections, the delegation will attend a reception hosted by the Irish Consulate in Boston and be guests at the Golden Bridges Conference. Last year, Joule, a locally based fire engineering consultancy business, was one of a number of companies that took part in the trade mission. The company’s founding director John McColgan said he trade visit was a fantastic opportunity to look at new markets in the United States and his company’s participation was a very positive experience. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

About halfway between Naples and Rome, the Allied armies ran into strongly entrenched German forces determined to check their advance on Rome. The place the Germans had chosen for this stand was Monte Cassino, surmounted by the famous and ancient Benedictine Abbey, and it was here that four fierce and gruelling battles were fought out between the Allies and one of the best forces at fighting defensive actions in the history of warfare – the German Army in the Second World War.Ballinascreen Historical Society’s next monthly meeting will be addressed by one of the leading military historians in the UK and Ireland, writer and broadcaster Richard Doherty. Richard has around  books to his credit and over the years he has researched, written and presented several historical series for BBC Radio Ulster and presented two major historical programmes for BBC TV. He has featured twice in the popular “Who Do You Think You Are ” television series, providing historical background for the guests.Richard has addressed a wide iety of audiences in the UK, Republic of Ireland, France, Italy and USA. Since  he has been a guest speaker on cruise ships and he also leads battlefield tours in Ireland, Italy, Normandy and Greece. It will certainly be a major coup for the Society to attract such an eminent speaker and while, strictly speaking, it is not “local” history we can confidently predict that many local connections will be emphasised.The talk, which is open to everyone, will be held in  High Street – the room beside Draperstown Library - at pm on Tuesday, November .

About halfway between Naples and Rome, the Allied armies ran into strongly entrenched German forces determined to check their advance on Rome. The place the Germans had chosen for this stand was Monte Cassino, surmounted by the famous and ancient Benedictine Abbey, and it was here that four fierce and gruelling battles were fought out between the Allies and one of the best forces at fighting defensive actions in the history of warfare – the German Army in the Second World War.Ballinascreen Historical Society’s next monthly meeting will be addressed by one of the leading military historians in the UK and Ireland, writer and broadcaster Richard Doherty. Richard has around  books to his credit and over the years he has researched, written and presented several historical series for BBC Radio Ulster and presented two major historical programmes for BBC TV. He has featured twice in the popular “Who Do You Think You Are ” television series, providing historical background for the guests.Richard has addressed a wide iety of audiences in the UK, Republic of Ireland, France, Italy and USA. Since  he has been a guest speaker on cruise ships and he also leads battlefield tours in Ireland, Italy, Normandy and Greece. It will certainly be a major coup for the Society to attract such an eminent speaker and while, strictly speaking, it is not “local” history we can confidently predict that many local connections will be emphasised.The talk, which is open to everyone, will be held in  High Street – the room beside Draperstown Library - at pm on Tuesday, November . Light refreshments will be provided. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The event aimed to look at the issues affecting Atlantic Salmon in the freshwater and marine environment, with particular focus on the salmon of the Foyle system. The conference was well attended by members of the angling community interest- ed to hear the latest updates and research developments.  Opening the conference, Loughs Agency chief executive officer, Sharon McMahon, explained that “globally salmon numbers are in decline and we must work collectively to ensure the survival of this iconic fish in the cross border catchments of Foyle and Carlingford areas’. Speakers, who included Professor Ken Whelan, Dr Cathal Gallagher and Dr Robert Rosell, took the audience through the scientic journey of the salmon and echoed the stark warning that scientists, anglers and government agencies need to work together to protect the Atlantic salmon. Dr Diego Del Villar also presented to the large crowd on the SeaMonitor project.  SeaMonitor is a unique marine research project, the first of its kind in Europe, studying the seas around Ireland, Western Scotland and Northern Ireland. It will deliver Europe’s largest telemetric marine array and spatial models, supporting the conservation of several species including Atlantic salmon and will ultimately produce a Salmon Manage ment Plan for the River Foyle.The Loughs Agency will shortly be launching a public consultation to capture the views of the public in managing the salmon fishery. John McCartney, director of conservation andprotection, said: “We value the input and opinion of the public when reviewing our salmon management programme. I would encourage everyone take time to consider and respond to the questions’.Speaking after the conference, Francis Curran, chairperson of FASTA, said: ‘I’d like to thank the Loughs Agency and the professional speakers for providing an interesting forum on the challenges that the angling community face in terms of conservation of our Foyle system. We recognise that there are many drivers that are feeding into the problem but that anglers are up for working in partnership with the relevant government agencies, fishing clubs, private fisheries and the angling community North and South.”Mr Curran concluded: “We endorse the consultation process that will be rolled out by the Loughs Agency which will help inform decision makers as we move forward into this dficult period.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

New projects this year included social prescribing mdash helping people who present to their local GP to get out and about in their local area.New investment in multi-disciplinary teams in GP practices in Down was now being rolled out to the rest of Newry and Mourne. He said the Network was central to that roll-out and CDRCNrsquos experience of social prescribing made the organisation a great source of referrals to local community activities.Cllr Casey said CDRCN along with Community Advice and other umbrella support organisations were key to the delivery of Council services. He was grateful to the Network and especially to the hundreds of groups and thousands of volunteers who work away, day and night with no financial reward to make sure this area is a safe, pleasant and prosperous place to live, work and play.Alan Dumigan, CDRCN chairman, thanked the outgoing management committee for their time and expertise in bringing the Network forward.He acknowledged Board member Doris Noe, of Lecale Conservation, who, he said, had contributed her time, energy and expertise over the last number of years to the organisation and he wished her well in her retirement from the board.He thanked the community groups for their ongoing support and the management and staff for their continued commitment.The guest speaker, Dr Chris Leggett, recalled his long association with the community network and the exciting new developments. He acknowledged the importance of projects tackling social isolation and poverty and the need to address mental health and suicide in our local area.Nicholas McCrickard, CDRCN manager, presented the work of the organisation and reported that an increasing range of activities and projects were delivered to a high standard.He thanked the board and staff for a ldquofabulous year and acknowledged that the community and voluntary sector from Bangor to Crossmaglen was a thriving and creative place which was tackling issues relating to health, the economy, the environment and more.ldquoWorking together with the local Councils and Government departments is key to our success, he said. ldquoOur communities have a powerful voice coupled with large numbers of willing volunteers and we have risen to the challenge of tackling mental and physical health problems.The evening concluded with a talk from local photographer Raphael Mason on how photography can impact on peoplersquos physical and mental wellbeing.

We are being terrorised in our homes and our property is being damaged.Mrs Smyth said it was almost impossible to report incidents to the police.ldquoIf we can get through the police often donrsquot respond, she continued. ldquoThese temporary gates have been being put up for almost two years now. Torn down and put up again. Itrsquos the residents who suffer, not the council people for delays in signing off on the workthat needs to be done.The residents are being supported by local Independent councillor Cadogan Enright, who accused the council of being ldquonot exactly on top of their game.He said: ldquoThe need for fences and gates to make the area into a cul-de-sacs was triggered by an emergency situation where pensioners were and still are under siege by a small number of nersquoer-do-wells, culminating with the actual burning down of a pensionerrsquos cottage.ldquoThe council have not been treating this as an emergency. Were it not for the Housing Executive repeatedly replacing the eight temporary steel and wood barriers week after week when they are torn down, the area would be unviable as an area where pensioners can live.He added: ldquoI have proposed a workshop between the social partners led by the PSNI, Housing Executive, council and other partners to agree in detail a step-by-step process for gating orders in writing so that we never again have such a series of dreadful delays.A spokesman for the council said last night: Newry, Mourne and Down District Council can advise that the Northern Ireland Housing Executive has applied to the council for gating orders in the Model Farm area and that the Council is currently following gating order guidance produced by the Department of the Environment.ldquoThis process requires consultation with the Department for Infrastructure and members of the public in the area. A public advertisement of the proposals is then required.

We will eventually cover all old estates, subject to continuing funds and satisfactory contracts.Movements have already been made with the awarding of a number of pre-paint repair contracts and work on all contracts should begin by March or April next year.More programmes of maintenance work are being prepared and will be starting in the - financial year, subject to the approval of the Executiversquos Board.CASTLEWELLAN mdash Uncertainty has surrounded the recent proposals to establish units for educationally sub-normal pupils at Castlewellan.The South Eastern Education and Library Board give approval in January for two new units to be set up at the local controlled primary school.However, plans were revised when the neighbouring school, St Malachyrsquos Primary, decided it wanted to have special ESN units.Board officers decided thatan ESN unit is established at St Malachyrsquos the demand for ESN facilities at Castlewellan Primary mightand therefore only one unit might be necessary at each school.But confusion arose when the Board placed advertisements in a local newspaper about the plans to establish the units.Castlewellan councillor, Mrs Ethel Smyth, a Board member, was unsure about whether or not the Board had changed its policy and was intended to establish the units at St Malachyrsquos instead of at the controlled school.Mrs Smyth, who has raised the matter on several occasions, told Board members, this week that she was aggrieved about the whole affair and thought that Board officers had acted in a ldquovery surreptitious manner.ldquoThis sort of thing raises suspicions in the community and itrsquos just not good enough,: said Mrs Smyth.However, she was assured by Board chairman, Mr Cecil Kirkwood, that Board officers had not acted in an underhand manner and that there had only been a misunderstanding.KILLYLEAGH mdash A Killyleagh priest had called this week for people to follow the example of friendship shown by more than  Protestants and Roman Catholics who joined together in a special Halloween dinner and concert organised by his church.He is Fr Hugh OrsquoHagan and he was speaking hours after  senior citizens had enjoyed a dinner and concert in St Maryrsquos Hall, organised by the hall management committee.Speaking afterwards Fr OrsquoHagan said that Killyleagh and Shrigley had a unique community, ldquo everywhere has like here, Northern Ireland would be a more peaceful place.Invitations to Thursdayrsquos dinner and concert went out to both sides of the community and Fr OrsquoHagan stressed that he hoped no senior citizen had been forgotten, either Protestant or Roman Catholic.The idea of the dinner mdash which was such a success last year, when he was held for the first time mdash has been widely praised in the town, especially by the senior citizens and Thursday nightrsquos was no exception, with many voting it a big hit.Before the dinner began, Fr OrsquoHagan mdash who has been priest in Killyleagh for over  years and who is the longest serving priest ever in the town mdash welcomed everyone and thanked them for coming.He welcomed especially, the three ministers in the town, the Rev J C Boggs, Rev J D Mark and Rev R E Conn.

preparing to import the generic drug from South America as part of a CF Buyers Club of families.In a desperate attempt to start their son on the drug as quickly as possible, the couple and their family fundraised around pound, to buy Lorcaacuten three months treatment.ldquoWe were so close to getting the generic drug ourselves and that would have been great as Lorcaacuten would have started on it, but we would have still been campaigning and pushing for it, said Jen.ldquoWe have been told that the Department of Health want to copy what NHS England did and get the drug into peoplersquos

The choral society gave me a taste for musical theatre and my mum really pushed me to do it. It turned out that I just loved it, added the former pupil of St Colmcillersquos High School in Crossgar and Down High School, Downpatrick.Mark performed in every musical staged by the society until his final appearance in Sunset Bouled, with music from Andrew Lloyd Webber, at the Grand Opera House in .ldquoThat role was the hardest one I had ever done, as while I have had plenty of leading roles, it was one that had me on stage in a major theatre and for nearly every scene, just as I will have to do the same in Joseph, said Mark.While Declanrsquos illness undoubtedly shook the McMullan family to its core, Mark said that he believes some good has come out of it.ldquoBefore Declan took sick in , my dream was always to go and live and work in London and do musical theatre. Unfortunately when that happened I had to put that dream on hold.ldquoI never thought I would look at it again as I knew I had to help Declan and my family, but unwittingly, the bad thing that happened to Declan has actually helped me pursue that dream even more.ldquoHe is my biggest supporter, hersquos like my manager.

Leading a presentation on Agriculture and Agri-food, Craig Humes highlighted how dairy farmers will be one of the main farming groups to be ldquostruck by Brexit.ldquo. billion litres of milk are collected from across Northern Irish farms each year.  per cent of this milk produced is then exported south to be processed.ldquoThis could make le extremely dficult for farmersexport tarfs are to be introduced, Craig shared, adding that Dr. Mike Johnston, Chief Executive of the Dairy Council Northern Ireland believes that milk prices could drop by  pence per litre should a no-deal Brexit proceed with such excessive tarfs announced.ldquoIn my opinion, to put it quite simply, dairy farmers will not survive in Fermanagh unless there is a deal, commented Craig.In her presentation on Tourism and Hospitality Rebekah Starrett noted how Fermanagh had over , visitors last year who spent an average of pound. million.ldquoThis is a massive amount of money being spent in this local economy. The tourism and hospitality industry here supports , jobs ndash one of the biggest employment sectors in the county.ldquoIf Brexit happens it could mean some businesses may need to let some staff go and leave people without a job, said Rebekah.Stating that in her opinion Brexit offers the tourism and hospitality sector many innovative opportunities to potentially grow and expand, Rebekah shared some examples.ldquoThere has been a rise in lsquostaycationrsquo ndash the number of UK residents that have been staying and holidaying at homehas shown a three per cent rise in  and is continuing to grow something which would be good for Fermanagh Tourism, explained Rebekah, who also highlighted how Fermanagh is renowned for its celebrity chefs, award-winning restaurants and local produce which will continue to attract visitors to the County.Presenting facts on Business and Cross Border Trade, Nicole McFarlane and Oran OrsquoLoughlin shared how Enniskillen has the lsquotop performing ASDA store in the UKrsquo which was the th best store in Walmart Worldwide Group in  and that an average shopping trip spend by Republic of Ireland shoppers to Enniskillen is euro to euro.ldquoCross Border trade stands at pound. billion for  and Northern Ireland makes up between  to  per cent of total exports from Ireland to the UK and accounts for seven to eight per cent of imports, stated Nicole and Oran, adding that the flow of trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will depend on what kind of agreement replaces the current one which is free market trade within the EU. Sharing a positive outlook on how Brexit could impact business trade, the studentsrsquo stated: ldquoBrexit could actually result in more opportunities in more vibrant markets across the world becoming available. Some argue that Brexit could liberate the UK government to sign fresh trade deals with more dynamic markets outside the EU and therefore bolster trade.Whilst presenting his research on how Brexit could impact Student Le, Jordan McClure shared: ldquoStudent le is a vital part of growing up where we learn many things. Brexit has taught me the importance of ensuring that my opinion and voice is heard, especially, when I wasnrsquot the age to vote in the  referendum.ldquoWhilst much of what happens around Brexit is beyond our control one thing for sure is that the potential impact will affect all of our lives. Whatever that may be, it is important that we as students embrace it and make the most of it, he added.Will Greenaway closed the conference by reiterating the potential benefits that could come from Brexit and potential concerns that leaving the EU could have on us in Northern Ireland and especially in Fermanagh.ldquoOur generation of students represent the future of Northern Ireland we are potentially the next generation of business leaders, health care workers and entrepreneurs.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

With that close to being achieved we want to emphasise that we never sought an Irish Sea border and we want to see Stormont . ‘To that end, we now accept that in a system of mandatory coalition no one party should set red lines before theof devolution. ‘We realise that previous comments by the Tanaiste suggested that we think an Irish language act is needed for Stormont to .‘As a Brexit resolution nears, we can see things more calmly, and now concede that any Irish government would be outragedunionists collapsed power-sharing and issued terms for its . So we will now support the UK restoring Stormont without preconditions’OK, so the chance that Mr Varadkar will say that is almost zero.But is there anyone in Ireland’s Department of Foreign Affairs, which has sway over this province, or in Dublin’s political establishment, who can see how much anger would be alleviated by such a statement To grasp unionist frustration, go back to David Trimble’s  plea to Sinn Fein, the year after the Belfast Agreement: ‘Mr Adams, it’s over to you. We’ve jumped you follow.’The Ulster Unionist leader was endorsing setting up power-sharing with SF ahead of IRA decommissioning, hoping that the latter would follow .Ian Ellis: Ending welfare mitigation payments could mean , households in Northern Ireland will see their incomes fall suddenly Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Remember also how in  direct rule was imposed by London after IRA spying at Stormont and the Castlereagh break-in , because Tony Blair refused specic sanction against SF.Recall March  after the Northern Bank robbery and the murder of Robert McCartney, when all Northern Ireland politicians were dis-invited to the White House on St Patrick’s Day, instead of just republican ones.Go forward to autumn , after the murder of Kevin McGuigan, and security force assessments of an intact Provisional IRA structure.The DUP would have been justied in refusing to continue to share power with republicans then but would not have dared, knowing that global opprobrium would follow.A widespread sense within unionism that republicans are allowed to do things that unionists are never allowed to do is why even many moderate pro Union voters want Nigel Dodds to defeat Sinn Fein.When Martin McGuinness wrote a letter explaining SF’s decision to collapse Stormont in January , disrespect to Irish culture was mentioned in passing, but his big complaint was Arlene Foster refusing to stand aside over RHI.This newspaper long ago made an editorial decision that the cash for ash scandal was worthy of daily scrutiny, via Sam McBride’s excellent coverage. We saw off critics who said a unionist paper was making things hard for unionists.But RHI was never a reason to collapse power-sharing, particularly after a public inquiry was agreed.It soon emerged that Sinn Fein’s enduring red line towas an Irish language act . Sure enough, hospitals and schools have been rudderless for three years and will remain so until such legislation is in place. The DUP agreed an ILA in February , but was unable to sell it to unionists.Many people sombrely say that all MLAs need a pay cut but get confused as to the source of the stalemate. All parties, goes the criticism, must “drop their red lines”, asunionists saying no to ILA blackmail is equivalent to the demand itself.If anyone is still under this misapprehension, consider it like this: Think of an imaginary ided society in which the political aspirations of that society can be scaled from  to , with  the status quo.Side A would like society to move to point  in the scale, while Side B would like it to be at point .But they agree to disagree, and stay at the compromise of point .Side A then says, right, we’re unilaterally moving the status quo to , but Side B says, no you’re not.Side A has issued a non negotiable red line demand. Side B has resisted that non negotiable demand.It is not the same thing.For both sides to be equally culpable, Side B would have had to say: we are unilaterally insisting that the status quo moves to .But it has not done that.Some people will be outraged at a journalist writing an article such as this against an ILA. Yet I see no criticism, or even concern, at the way that the media class has accepted there has to be an ILA, despite the fact that Irish already enjoys positive discrimination such as Irish language schools with far lower pupil numbers than larger schools that have to close.A respected commentator wrote recently that an ILA was viewed as “pivotal” to Stormont’s . It is often said that an ILA is harmless, yet even last year’s watered down proposal included a language commissioner. AsNI needs another commissioner!Does anyone think that, evenIrish is visible everywhere, such a person will be issuing reports five years from now, or , saying all is well with language provision  Or that such reports won’t be seized on to justy legal actions for even more widespread use of Irish Isolated Protestants in the west of NI believe some councils are being triumphalist when they use Irish as the first language in signage, despite the fact it is spoken well by a tiny minority of NI’s population. It is often said that Protestants should appreciate Irish as part of their heritage, but the fact is that many unionists are uncomfortable with how they perceive it is used. Similarly there are aspects of unionist culture with which many Catholics are uncomfortable, and there would be unremitting uproarunionists demanded protection for such culture before Stormont could sit.Sinn Fein had ample time after  to reassure people as to its intentions. Instead it used an ILA in a way that fanned fears. If Stormont s on the basis of ILA, it is a precedent for a future collapse based on fresh demands. If it is restored without pre-conditions, MLAs can debate the merits and de-merits of such legislation without the lasting rancour there will bean ILA has been achieved by ransom.• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editor©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"electoral pact is torpedoed  ","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive any of the following newsletters from Belfast News Letter, via email Daily news, news features and service updates\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". ss+s+  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+]]]]]]]]]]]]]] initInArticleOnlySiteText, initArticleSiteText, isInArticleOnlyTemplateReady. s isArticleTemplateReady. s addCustomTextToSiteTemplate addSiteName.html  -- -- TriggerPrompt url  https:survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site_oqfshupypyivmsxzqude + url +  +:  + random + .getTime + afterel.setAttribute head  document[]  document[]headChildTriggerPrompt   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business Subscribe#jp #login-widget #login-flip.flip RegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Opinion Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Offbeat People Read This News Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health People Read This Sport Football Rugby Union Motorcycling More Sport Sport Opinion Whats On Arts  Entertainment Things To Do Nightle Lestyle Retro Cars Homes Must Read           Electoral pact is torpedoedLetter to the editorPublished::Saturday  November Share this article window.onload  .sharetool \"m.\" index  .indexOf \"ContentId\" pointIndex  .indexOf articleID  .substring.article-sharetool.article-sharetool--mobile Share this article window.onload  .sharetool \"m.\" index  .indexOf \"ContentId\" pointIndex  .indexOf articleID  .substring.article-sharetool.article-sharetool--mobile Sign Up To Our Daily Newsletter ipaddress.getJSON .keypress.focus.on email  .val.ajax\",source_url: location.href,source_website_category: \"Letters\", \"text\".done .removeAttr  .htmlThanks,  + email +  has been added to our newsletter..

Yesterday he stayed silent about the issue.Mr Aiken told The View: “This evening we’ve been receiving threats coming through to members of the Ulster Unionist Party and their staff...this undermines the entire principle of democracy”.ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Last night aUUP spokesperson said: “Our headquarters has received a number of phone calls of a threatening nature in relation to North Belfast and we have informed the PSNI of that.”The News Letter spoke to two UUP politicians, one a senior party figure, who said that separately there had been clear intimidation involving loyalist paramilitaries who were pressurising inidual UUP members not to stand as the candidate in North Belfast, where that could cost Mr Dodds his seat.Last night Mr Dodds condemned the “deplorable” threats, making clear that those doing so were acting without his support.One of the messages sent to a senior UUP figure and seen by this newspaper explicitly referred to a “big meeting of loyalists” which had included South East Antrim UDA.From page oneThe message said that it had been agreed that “all members of the UUP and its leadership are to be told they are not to be standing a candidate in North Belfast” and that “ the DUP lose it, they will be responsible”.The senior UUP source said that other party members had been receiving messages and phone calls “along the same lines”.Last night veteran UUP councillor Frazer Agnew told Radio Ulster’s Evening Extra programme: “It’s absolutely disgraceful that people have to resort to that sort of activity.”\u2028The Newtownabbey councillor said that as well as being wrong the threats were “counterproductive” becauseMr Aiken now backs down and decides not to stand a candidate it will seem that those behind the intimidation have won.Mr Agnew was one of the signatories to an open letter of North Belfast unionists this week which urged Mr Aiken to reconsider his position. Among those signing the letter were PUP leader Billy Hutchinson and DUP councillor Dean McCullough, although the fact he is a DUP politician was not mentioned and he was instead described as chairman of Rathcoole Neighbourhood Renewal, a publicly-funded cross-party group involving everyone from Sinn Féin to the UUP.Sam McBride: U-turning even before he has taken over could be devastating for Steve Aiken Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Mr Agnew said it was “naive” of Mr Aiken to pledge to stand in all  seats and said of the incoming leader: “He’s only been in the party a handful of years”.The veteran unionist said he feared that “the party is slowly leaving me at the moment”.It is understood that senior UUP figures are meeting this weekend to decide on whether to back Mr Aiken’s stance or agree a pact with the DUP.Mr Dodds’ seat is the most vulnerablethe UUP does not agree a pact. Although the DUP’s deputy leader is widely respected at Westminster and is one of the DUP’s most capable figures, his majority has been shrinking in North Belfast as demographic changes, a shrinking unionist vote and a consolidation of the nationalist vote behind Sinn Fein has left him with a majority of just over ,.He is facing a challenge from the Sinn Féin Lord Mayor of Belfast, John Finucane, who is being positioned as a more moderate and modern republican than past candidates such as former IRA bomber Gerry Kelly.In a statement last night, Mr Dodds said that it was “essential that there is respect on all sides for the democratic process”.The former Stormont Finance Minister said: “There have been some reports of intimidation and threats issued towards members and activists from the UUP.“Any such incidents are deplorable and must be totally condemned. The only appropriate way to express your views and the most effective way to send a message in our society is through the ballot box.“For our part the DUP has a positive plan for Northern Ireland to deliver more for everyone building on the extra billions of investment we have already delivered in the past two years for health and education, roads and broadband.“We will be putting forward that clear message over the coming weeks.”At the time of going to press, the PSNI had not responded to a request for comment.The PSNI’s Belfast District Commander, Chief Superintendent Jonathan Roberts, said: “Police received a report yesterday morningabout telephone calls received by staff in an office in the Belmont Road area of east Belfast.“Some of these calls have been described as abusive and threatening in nature. “Enquiries are ongoing.”Sam McBride: U-turning even before he has taken over could be devastating for Steve Aiken©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"traffic and travel","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive any of the following newsletters from Belfast News Letter, via email Daily news, news features and service updates\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". ss+s+  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+]]]]]]]]]]]]]] initInArticleOnlySiteText, initArticleSiteText, isInArticleOnlyTemplateReady. s isArticleTemplateReady. s addCustomTextToSiteTemplate addSiteName.html  -- -- Traffic and Travel   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business Subscribe#jp #login-widget #login-flip.flip RegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion People Read This News Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion People Read This Sport Football Rugby Union Motorcycling More Sport Sport Opinion Whats On Arts  Entertainment Things To Do Nightle Lestyle Retro Cars Homes Must Read           Traffic and Travel      Ballycarryrsquos Manse Road closed due to overturned lorryMotorists are advised the Manse Road in Ballycarry, Co Antrim, is currently closed from its junction with Bellahill Road to its junction with Main Street.

They must know that there are real-world consequences from dangerous language.I have many friends who took a respectful and dferent view from me on Brexit. Like the overwhelming majority of Welsh and British people, they are perfectly capable of expressing that view without resorting to threats, aggression or violence.We must all learn to disagree well, however robust our views and remember that we all share this country and this planet - and that we genuinely have more in common.Meanwhile, it has been another extraordinary week in these turbulent political times.After we had the shock news that I wrote about last week ndash that the Supreme Court had delivered a unanimous judgement that Parliament should not have been shut down by the PM ndash we were able to go back immediately.I was straight back to Westminster having meetings with colleagues, holding the government to account, and of course getting back to work not just on Brexit but on many other issues.I was able to raise concerns in the Commons on behalf of constituents relating to the Thomas Cook collapse, which has affected everybody from holiday-makers to pilots to holiday reps and retail workers in the constituency and to call for a debate on the incineration of waste.And on Monday, I joined Allied Steel and Wire Pensioners from the constituency, and others hit by pensions theft, to hand in a petition to the Prime Minister at  Downing Street. They deserve justice on their pensions and have my full support. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

Like the overwhelming majority of Welsh and British people, they are perfectly capable of expressing that view without resorting to threats, aggression or violence.We must all learn to disagree well, however robust our views and remember that we all share this country and this planet - and that we genuinely have more in common.Meanwhile, it has been another extraordinary week in these turbulent political times.After we had the shock news that I wrote about last week ndash that the Supreme Court had delivered a unanimous judgement that Parliament should not have been shut down by the PM ndash we were able to go back immediately.I was straight back to Westminster having meetings with colleagues, holding the government to account, and of course getting back to work not just on Brexit but on many other issues.I was able to raise concerns in the Commons on behalf of constituents relating to the Thomas Cook collapse, which has affected everybody from holiday-makers to pilots to holiday reps and retail workers in the constituency and to call for a debate on the incineration of waste.And on Monday, I joined Allied Steel and Wire Pensioners from the constituency, and others hit by pensions theft, to hand in a petition to the Prime Minister at  Downing Street.

A former head of two other schools in Gwent, he is clearly proud of his school and all they have accomplished.ldquoItrsquos a wonderful school and everyone here has worked so hard to make it that way, he said. ldquoBut it does face challenges.Like other head teachers in Penarth, Mr Rees had signed the open letter to the Welsh Government calling for fairer funding for Vale schools earlier this year. He had discussed coming in to the school on weekends to clean the toilets himself to help balance budgets. But he is firmly optimistic.ldquoBetween kind donations and fundraising efforts from our PTA, renting out the school hall, and younger members of staff taking on some extra burdens we are just about able to balance our budgets, he said. ldquoTo be honest, next year might start looking grim, but wersquore keeping our heads high.ldquoWith that said, wersquove been working hard on incorporating new initiatives and the new curriculum, we have a great crop of pupils and staff morale is high. We are very positive here.ldquoItrsquos also our th anniversary this year, so we have loads of ex-staff and pupils coming through the doors to say hello, a celebratory PTA barbecue and more planned.Taking a tour around the school, this positivity is reflected in students and staff alike. Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the past he chaired the all-party Parliamentary group on nuisance calls and secured changes to the law to restrict cold telephone calling.ldquoThere have been a number of complaints about the increase in nuisance callers and the rise of the doorstep economy in the Vale of Glamorgan. Ahead of the clocks going back, Alun wants to provide constituents with a proven means of reducing the number of doorstep callers.Welsh Labour parliamentary candidate for the Vale, Belinda Loveluck-Edwards said: ldquoIt appears that Alun Cairns is using public money to try and block his political opponents from speaking to voters. This must be investigated.ldquoThis is a deliberate attempt to present a  equivalence between genuine political canvassing and those who would wish to scam vulnerable people.ldquoMany people will be deeply unsettled by this behaviour from Cairns at the same time as the Tories are attempting to suppress votes by making it a requirement to show ID at polling stations- a move that will disproportionately affect working class, ethnic minority and young voters.ldquoThis is not how politics should be done. In contrast, Welsh Labour is opening up politics by extending votes to  and  year olds in future Assembly elections.

We need a UK Labour Government that will stand up for the many.The Tories have been cutting budgets for nearly  years now.Since  they have scrapped over , frontline police officers.In the last year alone more than , children were pushed into absolute poverty.Boris Johnson has sought to ide our country.Labour would immediately raise the minimum wage to pound an hour for all ages, increase funding to Welsh Government for the NHS, and kickstart a green revolution.On Saturday it is expected that MPs willto Westminster to sit for a highly unusual session in Parliament, as we reach the critical stage of the Brexit process.Weekend sittings are very rare, and the House has only sat on four Saturdays since  ndash on September ,  at the outbreak of World War II on July , as a final summer sitting on November ,  to debate the Suez Crises and on April ,  over the Falkland Islands invasion.A Saturday sitting, two days after the EU summit, is likely to be a decisive moment in determining the future of our country.Saturday will also see a lsquoTogether for the Final Sayrsquo march to Parliament Square.When a similar march took place earlier this year an estimated million people of all ages, from every corner of the UK and from all walks of le, took part ndash including many from Penarth and Cardf who travelled to London to make their voices heard.Their message was absolutely clear then ndash and mine remains the same now - that the people must be given a final say on this Brexit disaster. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

His father was West African and his mother was Irish.Billy was overlooked by rugby union. However he is recognised as one of the greatest ever British rugby league players.Elizabeth lsquoBettyrsquo Campbell, also born in  in Butetown, was the first black head teacher in Wales.Following a public vote on hidden heroines Cardf Council confirmed earlier this year that a statue of Betty will be built in Cardf - the first woman to feature in our capital city.On the weekend I will be on a question and answer  about institutionalised racism in Wales, across sport, the media, politics, and the world of work.I look forward to sitting on the  with Cllr Saeed Ebrahim, lawyer Hilary Brown, and Chisomo Phiri from EYST.As more and more Black History Month events take place across Wales, I cannot help but feel a sense of pride in how far we have come as a nation.I hope that these events continue to inspire the next generation of young black leaders as we still have so much more to change.To all my constituents, to everyone across Wales, I hope you all join in with the celebrations and festivities of this historic month, attend the events, learn about those that have trailblazed for us and make this a Black History Month to remember. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It would require the removal of seven of the  ancient trees in the Conservation Area.Many of the trees had been assessed in September  as deserving of a Tree Protection Order, which would prevent them from being cut down, though the Vale council has said they are in the process of securing the protection orders.Residents say one ndash Ash Tree , crucial to development ndash has already been removed. John Lean, a resident of Kymin Terrace, said: ldquoAround a week ago, the first ash tree was sawn down. It was painted as a routine tidying up of their grounds, that it was sick, and was carried out not by the architects who made the main application, but by the warden. We do not believe there was anything wrong with that tree.ldquoAn application was made under Section  of the Planning Acts for the removal of Ash Tree , another tree not in the wood but next to the house, and the removal of a fallen tree. No notice was given to local residents the Vale council did not inspect the site before permission was given, and the first we knew of it was when we heard the chainsaws.Ash Tree  would have to be removed for any development to take place, to allow construction traffic to pass.David Burnett, a resident, said: ldquoThis creates a dangerous precedent for further development here.ldquoWhen the construction of Homeside House was permitted on appeal in , the inspector at the time made it clear that it should not impinge on the woodland. The woodland was described as lsquoinviolatersquo ndash itrsquos at least  years old. What was true then is true now. Other residents had further complaints about the proposed development, and the methodology used to carry out inspections.The large footprint of the dwelling occupies over half the site. The access road would also have to be able to take construction traffic, which residents fear would further damage the site and could limit parking.One resident described a bat survey as lsquocompletely inadequatersquo, as the resident said the survey carried out on behalf of the applicant noted observation was made on two occasions only.William and Karen Stonehouse said: ldquoThe development would involve the destruction of a valuable natural habitat without any benefit to the community whatsoever.ldquoPenarth is not short of expensive properties. It is affordable housing that is desperately needed to prevent the continuing drain of its young people who can no longer afford to buy any property here.ldquoThis proposal does nothing to address that.Joanna Masters said: ldquoI am very concerned about the proposed plan to fell the wood.ldquoI thought the world was becoming more environmentally aware, particularly regarding the value of trees, but it seems the Vale council is, in its own way, as irresponsible as Brazilrsquos Bolsonaro.A spokesman for the Vale council said: ldquoThis planning application has yet to be determined and will be considered in exactly the same way as any other, with the views of all interested parties taken into account.ldquoThat will involve reviewing all letters of representation and consultation responses on the matter. IldquoIt has been resubmitted after a previous one for a similar development was withdrawn as it failed to provide full details of the impact on nearby trees.ldquoWe are in the process of arranging Tree Preservation Orders for trees there that meet the criteria for that protection.ldquoThe council did approve an application to fell an ash tree from Homeside House as, after inspection by an officer, it was deemed to have a fungal bracket, which can structurally weaken trees to the point of breakage. That being the case, it was decided a TPO was not appropriate.The freehold for the woodland was purchased by Proxima GR Properties in  from McCarthy  Stone, who had built an unsheltered accommodation around the site.The Penarth Times has attempted to reach Proxima GR Properties for a comment. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Their sole motive has been about blocking Brexit.I have long thought the only way out of this is a general election.The British people need to be given the opportunity to have a clear out of those politicians who said one thing to get elected and have done another in office.All Labour and Conservative MPs were elected on manestos explicitly promising to respect and honour the referendum result.The people of Penarth deserve better than this.Earlier this month, I was present on the steps of the Senedd as the petition to save the Sam Davies ward at Barry Hospital was presented to the Assembly.I joined other local representatives and campaigners from Unison to receive the petition, and send a clear message on the health boardrsquos proposals.Under the plans, the -bed older persons rehabilitation ward will close, with services transferring either to the community or Llandough Hospital.Local opinion in Barry is quite clear that the ward should stay, while in Llandough, further expansion of the hospital will cause further pressures on the village.You wonrsquot often catch me standing alongside Unison, but on this we completely agree.These plans need to be dropped.The Royal British Legion have officially launched the  Poppy Appeal, and as ever, I am delighted to pledge my support.It is crucial we commemorate those who made the ultimate sacrice to defend our freedoms, including those from Penarth.Wearing a poppy is an understated yet clear way of demonstrating that, and it also raises vital funds to support current and former servicemen and women and their families.It is often misunderstood as condoning or celebrating war, and that could not be further from the truth. It is respecting those who have fallen.Irsquod like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Royal British Legion for their work. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There is fierce competition to host the All Ireland Fleadh each year as it attracts thousands of visitors and musiciaans from across the world. Councillor Mark BaxterAt Monday night’s meeting Sinn Fein welcomed the success of their motion, tabled by the party’s group leader Darren McNally, which asked council to investigate the feasibility and economic benefits of hosting the Fleadh Cheoil Na hEireann in Armagh.Cllr McNally said it would be ‘a massive economic boost for the entire borough’ with a potential £m for the economy.“I believe Armagh would be a very fitting venue given the rich ancient heritage and culture the city possesses’”#However DUP Cllr Mark Baxter said: ““We are hugely disappointed that we were the only party to vote against this potential colossal spend by council in these very tough economic times. The other parties were quite happy to task officers to investigate bringing the Fleadh Cheoil to Armagh despite the huge cost involved.” “Ironically it was only three weeks ago that Sinn Fein refused to back another much smaller proposal for a community event citing a lack of council resources. I would question in the strongest possible terms the economic benefits and the motives for bringing such an event and why the UUP and Sinn Fein are so keen to bring the event to Armagh which has in the past had some very controversial artists. Indeed we all can point to similar festivals recently held in Belfast where its very clear that ‘unionists’ were not welcome with Pro-IRA chanting and bands imploring the British to “go back home. “I would call on councillors to reflect on this wanton disregard for the public purse and remind them of their responsibilities in delivering first class services for best value. The DUP make no apology for being the champions of low rates in council.”Sinn Fein Cllr Liam Mackle dismissed claims by the DUP‘s Mark Baxter that the motion committed council to a massive spend as untrue.He said: “The passing of this motion gives council officers the freedom to engage with numerous stakeholders holders including Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann who organise the Fleadh Cheoil to get a better understanding of what’s expected of any host venue, Council officers will bring back a report to committee following engagements with local businesses, hospitality sector, community groups and traditional musicians, where Councillors can have an informed debate on its feasibility.“We have seen the DUP on ABC council spend hundreds of thousands of pounds on a whim - on events with no economic benefit to our borough. Their behaviour is somewhat childish, compared to the mature approach of this motion.”Musician Willie calls for better rehabilitation for stroke survivors Coremetrics  Coremetrics

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/2_web.jpg","title":"top  voice of business never stronger or more important","story":"Posted on Friday  September  by Ulster Business John Mulgrew, Michael Neill, Sarah Little and Len OHagan The voice of Northern Ireland’s business community has never been stronger and more important as industry attempts to avoid a hard Brexit, a gathering of top business leaders has heard. The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.  Danske Bank’s Conor Lambe said there were still a number of possibilities for what might happen over the next  days, with the UK due to leave the EU on October . Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election. But predictions were \"incredibly dficult\", he said. \"Businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month,\" he said. The .% is down from the bank’s previous forecasts, delivered in June, that growth would hit % in  and .% in . In its latest Northern Ireland Quarterly Sectoral Forecasts report, Danske Bank said that the Northern Ireland economy likely expanded in the second quarter of the year, but the rate of growth over the first half of the year remained modest. “We have revised our forecast for economic growth in Northern Ireland downwards for both  and ,” he said. “This largely reflects the modest data for the first half of the year, increased Brexit-related uncertainty and the weaker global economic environment. “Assuming that a no-deal Brexit is avoided, we expect the Northern Ireland economy to grow by .% in  and .% in , below the .% we expect UK GDP to grow by in both years. “A combination of strong wage growth and more stable inflation is likely to lead to solid growth in consumer spending, but the lack of clarity around the UK’s future relationship with the EU is expected to continue holding back business investment.” It says the information and communication, and professional, scientic  technical services sectors are expected to be the fastest growing parts of the economy over the next two years. Meanwhile, output in the construction sector is forecast to rise by .% in  and .% in , while expected output growth in the wholesale and retail trade sector has been revised down to .% in  and .% in . Public administration and defence is continuing to have the weakest outlook of all the sectors of the Northern Ireland economy, with output expected to contract by .% in , and by a further .% in . “Over the coming weeks, a number of potential Brexit options are possible, including a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of the Article  period or a general election,” Mr Lambe said. “Predicting what will happen next in the Brexit process is incredibly dficult, but businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/BOI11_web.jpg","title":"bank of ireland uk empowering colleagues to support local communities","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by Ulster Business Paul Slevin, Alison Mitchell, Ian Sheppard, Sally Irvine, Christine Graham and Paul Magee With a purpose to enable customers, colleagues and communities to thrive, Bank of Ireland UK staff are building on a long history of supporting local charities and community organisations. Ulster Business speaks to Northern Ireland managing director Ian Sheppard, and learns more about how colleagues are being empowered to play an active role in the local communities where they live and work Bank of Ireland UK sees developing its colleagues and helping customers and communities to thrive as part of its DNA, according to Ian Sheppard, managing director in Northern Ireland.From key charity partnerships, to fundraising, volunteering, sponsorship and more, Ian says the desire for Bank of Ireland UK is to make a positive impact by empowering colleagues to make a dference.“When I speak to my colleagues, I hear how really active and involved they are in their own community,” Ian says. “There are so many examples and I never cease to be amazed by their passion and commitment.An important partnership for the bank is with Alzheimer’s Society, its flagship charity for the last two years. In that time around £, has been raised in Northern Ireland, but as Ian explains it’s about more than fundraising.“We realised that not only can we help them financially, but there are resources we can share and opportunities we can offer which can help to signicantly raise the charity’s profile and raise much needed funds.”One example in which the bank has supported Alzheimer’s Society in this way is through its own long-running partnership with Ulster Rugby.“We donated our advertising and promotion activity for a televised game at the Kingspan Stadium making the charity ‘Sponsor for a Day’. This included using their logo on the back of the Ulster Rugby jerseys, taking over the pitch side boards and inviting a group of people living with dementia, their family and carers to the game – helping to get their brand message out to not only a stadium with capacity of , people but to a much wider TV audience.”Alzheimer’s Society sees some fantastic people giving their time to help others. That’s no clearer than its Side by Side programme, which Bank of Ireland UK helps to fund.The photograph on the front of this edition of the magazine taken at the Grand Opera House in Belfast features Mary Dalzell a Side by Side volunteer, alongside Hazel Whiteside, who has been living with dementia for two years.They share a love of music, theatre and cinema and the Side by Side programme, which re-connects people with dementia to their communities by doing the things they love, has not only put a smile on both their faces but has had a positive impact on their lives.There are so many people impacted by dementia and Alzheimers in our local communities, and its touching so many people’s lives, taking this as our motivation, the bank now has almost , staff trained as Dementia Friends.The bank’s ‘Give Together’ programme means staff can take one day a year to spend the time working with a charity or community organisation of their choice. “This day can involve anything from gardening work to painting a youth centre,” Ian says“Beyond Alzheimer’s Society, colleagues are helping many other organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK through its Relay for Le Legenderry, the Wooden Spoon children’s rugby charity, and Space NI, which offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community.” You canabout some of the good work colleagues have done further on in this feature.“We are also committed to reflecting the community by developing a erse and modern workforce – which is part-and-parcel of a progressive company,” Ian says. “It’s something that current and future employees expect in their employer. For us its part of our DNA, something that’s always been there but we are now putting a clear and visible structure around it,” Ian says.This has included being a founding member of FuSIoN – the Financial Services Inclusion Network which drives to support and promote LGBT+ professionals across the sector, becoming JAM Card members – allowing staff to knowcustomers with a communication barrier need ‘just a minute’, as well as recently being awarded the Diversity Charter Mark.“Our community involvement is something we are very clear about - something I’m passionate about and it’s an easy ask to get staff engaged. It’s very natural, and it has always been developed from the ground up,” Ian says.He believes this contributes to the huge numbers of staff doing their bit – enabling their own local communities to thrive.  ALISON MITCHELLA customer service manager for Bank of Ireland UK in Londonderry, Alison has worked for the bank for  years, but her motivation for fundraising and support for Alzheimer’s Society began in , following her mother-in-law’s diagnosis with dementia. Alison trained at her local hospital to become a dementia volunteer and learned so much she asked Alzheimer’s Society to run similar sessions in her own branch to enable staff to better assist customers with dementia.Sadly, Alison’s mother-in-law passed away in May of this year but to mark her passing and to raise vital funds in her memory, Alison took part in Alzheimer’s Society Cupcake Day. Initial plans to simply sell cupcakes within her own branch changed rapidly as colleagues from nearby branches heard of the event and wanted to support both Alison and the charity.  Faced with orders for more than  cupcakes, Alison requested a Give Together day, which is time given by the bank to both iniduals and teams to give back to their communities. Alison says: “I was in the kitchen from am to pm baking and icing but it was worth it. The event raised £, which Bank of Ireland UK matched doubling the amount raised to £,. “I could not have achieved that without the support of family, colleagues and the wider business. I was proud to raise the funds in my mother-in-law’s memory and I am proud to work for an organisation that not only values our role in the wider community but supports it too.” CHRISTINE GRAHAMChristine Graham has helped to raise funds for Cancer Research UK through the Relay for Le “Legenderry” event held in St. Columb’s Park, Londonderry.The Derry-based senior business manager for Bank of Ireland UK has personally been touched by cancer as she lost two close family members to the disease. Her young great niece was also diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in  and is now doing well, but seeing the impact a cancer diagnosis has on a family inspired Christine to get involved with the Relay for Le event.“Our event truly is ‘legenderry’,” she says. It is a -hour relay race that brings the whole community together to celebrate the lives of cancer survivors, to remember those lost to the disease, to fight back by increasing our knowledge of cancer and by raising money to fund le-saving cancer research.”In just three years the event has raised over £, for Cancer Research UK with Christine helping to raise £, in  – not only the most successful Relay for Le event in the UK this year but all funds raised in Northern Ireland stays here.  Christine values the support she has had from the bank who promote the event to the wider community and from her colleagues who enter teams.“Relay for Le is for all ages and stages, all shapes and sizes,” she says. It’s cross community and intergenerational and the atmosphere every year is electric.”Plans are already underway for Relay for Le  which promises to be another massive event. PAUL MAGEEPaul Magee, associate director of the corporate banking team, became involved with the Ulster Region Committee for Wooden Spoon, the Children’s Charity of Rugby, five years ago after he successfully completed the charity’s Four Peaks Challenge, reaching the summits of the UK and Ireland’s highest peaks. He is now an active committee member for Wooden Spoon, helping to raise funds to provide le-enhancing experiences for disadvantaged and disabled children. “All funds raised in Ulster stay in the region and benefit the children here,” Paul says. “For instance, we provided £, to the Mae Murray Foundation to buy specialist equipment for the first fully accessible beach in Ulster at Benone Strand. When we created the access to the beach, one parent was very emotional as he watched his teenage daughter in the sea for the first time. It’s those occasions where we’re responding to a need within the community that makes the effort worthwhile.”Wooden Spoon has funded numerous charity projects, most recently £, for a new multi-sensory room at Parkview Special School in Lisburn and purchasing a horse for Riding for the Disabled Association in Coleraine, a charity that enhances children’s lives every day.  With his passion for and involvement in Wooden Spoon, Paul is grateful for the support Bank of Ireland has given him in his role with the organisation, specically the corporate banking team who value his dedication to making a dference. He says: “The bank has been fantastic – I appreciate the flexibility the team offers in the lead up to events and my colleagues often attend Wooden Spoon fundraisers. I’ve also benefited from the bank’s Give Together initiative, which offers days of paid leave that employees can use for volunteering. The bank’s support has helped facilitate my commitment to Wooden Spoon, where I can really see and be a part of the impact the charity has on the local community.” SALLY IRVINEOver the last  years Sally Irvine’s coffee mornings have become a highlight in the office calendar, in turn raising more than £, for MacMillan Cancer Support and funding  days of specialist nursing care for cancer patients across Northern Ireland.Sally, a business lending and credit governance manager at Bank of Ireland UK, arranged her first Macmillan Coffee Morning in  following a colleague’s cancer diagnosis. She found herself wanting to do something to help people living with cancer and so took the plunge and decided to be a host as part of Macmillan’s biggest coffee morning fundraising event. From the outset, Sally had tremendous support from her team members and the wider business, and this has contributed to the ongoing success of the event.The bank plays a huge part in ensuring Sally can deliver the event each year by giving her support through their Give Together scheme.Sally says: “The coffee morning has become a very special occasion and a great day of fun where people from across the bank come together to have a wee cuppa and a cake and take time to catch up while raising money for a really important cause. One in two of us will face cancer at some time in our lives and I am passionate about continuing to fundraise to provide the specialist nursing care that’s so vital for those living with cancer.”Plans are already underway for this year’s Macmillan Coffee Morning and Sally is hopeful the annual fundraiser will continue to hold a special place in the office calendar. PAUL SLEVINBranch manager at Bank of Ireland UK in Newry, Paul Slevin is someone who embodies the bank’s ethos of community involvement through his role with the charity Space NI.  Space NI offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community. Through its service Home to Hospital, the organisation has helped  elderly people travel to crucial hospital appointments, while its Family Support Hub offers vital assistance to families in distress. Paul joined the charity in  and has just completed five years as chairman of the Board of Directors. He is proud that his background in finance has enabled him to support the charity through its repositioning process to ensure that its activities best serve the community.  Since Paul’s involvement with the charity began, Space NI has won the ‘One to Watch’ award at NI Social Enterprise Awards and the ‘Community Wellbeing Initiative’ at the All Ireland Pride of Place Awards. The organisation has also grown and opened a third premises in Newry and launched a range of volunteer made soy wax candles to raise crucial funds. “Bank of Ireland UK encourage all staff to give back,” Paul says. “Every manager I’ve had was very active in their community, so they were both great role models and great motivators. I think it’s really important to give our time, our expertise, and to do whatever we can to help and support the communities we live and work in.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/12312323.jpg","title":"novosco sold to global services giant for m","story":"Posted on Monday  October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland IT services firm Novosco has been bought by a German-based global industry giant for around £m, it has emerged.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"We’ve got a great new deal that takes back control — now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.\" Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said: “This agreement is a fair compromise between the EU and the UK. It is testament to the commitment and willingness of both sides to do what is best for EU and UK citizens. We now have a newly agreed Protocol that protects peace and stability on the island of Ireland and fully protects our Single Market. I hope that we can now bring this over the line and provide the certainty our citizens and businesses so deserve.” Michel Barnier, the European Commissions chief negotiator, said: “We had dficult discussions over the past days. We have managed to find solutions that fully respect the integrity of the Single Market. We created a new and legally operative solution to avoid a hard border, and protect peace and stability on the island of Ireland. It is a solution that works for the EU, for the UK and for people and businesses in Northern Ireland.” The DUP has said it could not support the deal brokered by Mr Johnson. So, what deal was agreed  A statement from the European Commission says: “In terms of regulations, Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of rules related to the EUs Single Market in order to avoid a hard border: legislation on goods, sanitary rules for veterinary controls , rules on agricultural production marketing, VAT and excise in respect of goods, and state aid rules. “In terms of customs, the EU-UK Single Customs Territory, as agreed in November , has been removed from the Protocol on Ireland   Northern Ireland, at the request of the current UK government. EU and UK negotiators have now found a new way to achieve the goal of avoiding a customs border on the island of Ireland, while at the same time ensuring Northern Ireland remains part of the UKs customs territory. This agreement fully protects the integrity of the EUs Single Market and Customs Union, and avoids any regulatory and customs checks at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. “Finally, the EU and the UK have agreed to create a new mechanism on ‘consent, which will give the Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly a decisive voice on the long-term application of relevant EU law in Northern Ireland. The Commission has been in close contact with the Irish government on this point.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/redbus.jpg","title":"wrightbus deal struck to buy ballymena bus maker","story":"Posted on Tuesday  October  by John Mulgrew A deal has been struck to buy the business and assets of Ballymena bus maker Wrightbus after it entered administration with the loss of , jobs.

We hear about the firm’s plans for growth hereBelfast City is changing and its transportation network and parking strategy have a key role to play in supporting its growth. Innovative use of technology to make parking ‘smarter’ and promoting better use of city centre space will contribute to creating the right environment for business investment and the lestyle of residents, commuters and visitors. The need for effective parking planning reaches beyond Belfast city though as parking issues are common in towns across the country. Parking planning is not just about the provision and management of spaces – the majority of parking acts require some sort of enforcement system to ensure effectiveness. As an experienced parking operator, APCOA can work with the public and private sectors to contribute knowledge and expertise to the planning and implementation of effective parking strategies. An on-going investment in developing parking technology also offers new ways of improving services to clients and the public.In August, APCOA acquired the business of Nationwide Controlled Parking Systemsin Ireland, including subsidiaries Parking Enforcement Solutionsand Mobile Research Solutions.The combined operation resulting from the acquisition sees APCOA’s business in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland double in size to cover more than , site locations and it will enable them to service all counties in both countries.APCOA’s existing business in Northern Ireland operated a number of sites including two city centre multi storey car parks in Belfast city centre. The NCPS subsidiary PEA brings a further c. locations, primarily in the greater Belfast area with key sites such as the Titanic Quarter, numerous NHS hospitals and trusts and the Odyssey.

We’re really excited about the opportunities ahead.”Neil Cunningham, managing director of APCOA in Ireland, explains why he sees the acquisition as a positive move for the business in Northern Ireland.“This investment strengthens APCOA’s ability to offer countrywide services and gives us a stronger base for future growth. Colleagues in both companies have a keen focus on customer service and we’ve brought together two experienced management teams.“I’m also delighted that Jason Ballard, founder and chief executive of NCPS and PEA, will continue to work with us for the next six months to support the smooth integration of the business.
