She is specializing in plasmonics, the study of electromagnetic fields.And Campbell is also a mentor to a British project to launch a satellite which will seek to find out the weather patterns on planets outside the solar system using the ultra-violet light spectrum, part of her expertise.Last year she she told her Facebook friends she was traveling from London to South Korea in July last year for what\u0027s dubbed the world\u0027s leading conference in her field.A day later, friends told her how proud they were when she posted pictures from the event, with one commenting: \u0027Proud of how far you have traveled in your life. Well done.\u0027 Another called her a \u0027superstar\u0027, saying: \u0027Looks like an amazing event and we\u0027ll (sic) done on all your years of learning to get you there.\u0027Ansari, 35, did not appear intimidated by her academic achievements as the pair were pictured smiling and laughing, with the Master of None star whispering in her ear and waving at the crowd at the U.S Open last Monday – indicating he appears to be moving on from controversial sexual misconduct allegations earlier this year.    Scientist Serena Skov Campbell is a researcher pursuing a PhD in plasmonics, the study of electromagnetic fields          Campbell traveled from London to South Korea in July 2017 for what\u0027s dubbed the world\u0027s leading conference in her field, according to her Facebook           Campbell has an impressive academic resume, according to her research page, which details her work in plasmonicsThe physicist also seems to be unfazed by the allegations leveled against her new beau and was seen holding hands with him in New York City in early August.Campbell often shares pieces of her academic work on her Facebook page, and ironically, she once shared an article questioning the the MeToo movement, a few months before Ansari was  himself accused of sexual misconduct.In October 2017, she shared an article titled, \u0027Literally, Why Can\u0027t I Say #MeToo?\u0027 by Total Sorority Move, in which the female author says she struggles to identify as a victim because she feels her own experiences with sexual misconduct, are not \u0027bad enough.\u0027 In January, Ansari was accused of sexual misconduct when an anonymous 23-year-old woman from Brooklyn claimed he ignored her verbal and non-verbal cues and repeatedly tried to pressure her into having sex with him after they went on a date last September. The accusations were made in a story on Babe.net, where the woman, under the pseudonym \u0027Grace\u0027 alleged that she had felt \u0027violated\u0027 by the comic\u0027s overly-aggressive gestures.Meryl Streep leads a host of A-list celebrities including...The spectacular fall of Les Moonves: The chilling claims of...Share this article    The pair were spotted canoodling as they watch the tennis match.

Britannia would be a place for fun, for mischief and — in a world governed by ritual and tradition — for the spur-of-the-moment.Diplomat Sir Roger du Boulay and his wife joined the Yacht for a week in 1974 during his years as Resident Commissioner of the New Hebrides. They were astounded one night when dinner was followed by the ship’s entertainment — ‘an elaborate pantomime’ — in front of the Royal Family and the crew, with the Queen acting as wardrobe assistant.‘It involved the equerry taking the part of a Polynesian beauty,’ says du Boulay. ‘I remember him sitting on the floor and I remember seeing the Queen kneeling on the floor. He was stripped to the waist and she was fitting a brassiere on to him. It was an extraordinary sight!’ABOARD, informality would go a long way — but it had its limits. John Gorton, former Prime Minister of Australia, later recalled one beach barbecue with the family during a 1970 tour of Australia, when the royal party decided it was time for a swim.‘Princess Anne was thrown in and then Prince Philip,’ he said. ‘I was sitting next to Her Majesty and I was just about to throw her in but I looked at her and something about the way she looked at me told me that perhaps I shouldn’t. In the end, the Queen was the only one who stayed dry.’May briefs Queen on Brexit progress at Balmoral amid claims...From Windsor and Windermere to Loch Ness and \u0027Game of...Share this article    HM The Queen and HRH The Duke of Edinburgh on board HMY Britannia in March 1972But ultimately Britannia’s demise was down to bad timing and political incompetence.In the mid-Nineties a substantial refit was required. Shortly before the 1997 election, the Conservative government announced that it would build a new yacht with a budget of £60 million.But it had failed to follow a political golden rule, that major undertakings involving the Crown require cross-party agreement.Tony Blair’s New Labour was not consulted and duly opposed the idea, which thus became an election issue. Not surprisingly, on being elected a few months later, the Labour government declined to commission a new yacht.Blair would later admit to me that it had been a mistake to get rid of Britannia in the first place and that he would have retained it, if he had been elected sooner.The Royal Family determinedly avoided becoming involved in what was clearly a political matter and thus strictly off-limits. Hence the brevity of the mournful speech by the Prince of Wales to the ship’s company on the night of Britannia’s retirement, the shortest after-dinner address of his life.‘I just want to get blindly, madly drunk,’ he declared and sat down again, to thunderous applause. His audience knew exactly how he felt.Adapted from Queen Of The World by Robert Hardman, (Century, £25). © Robert Hardman 2018.To order a copy for £20 (offer valid to September 20, 2018 p\u0026ampp free), visit mailshop.co.ukbooks or call 0844 571 0640. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/09/18/4FED918700000578-0-image-m-32_1536513551893.jpg","title":"British workers work four day week longer weekends better pay unions argue","story":"    TUC General Secretary Frances O\u0027Grady speaking at the TUC conference at the Brighton Centre in BrightonUnions heap pressure on Corbyn to back second Brexit...Welby wealth tax storm: Archbishop of Canterbury declares...Share this articleShe will say: ‘In the 19th century, unions campaigned for an eight-hour day.

Henry McMaster issued the evacuation order on Monday for all eight counties along the coast, including: Jasper, Beaufort, Colleton, Charleston, Dorchester, Georgetown, Horry, and Berkeley.\u0027This is a very dangerous hurricane,\u0027 McMaster said, adding that the evacuation order for coastal counties was \u0027mandatory, not voluntary.\u0027 \u0027We do not want to risk one South Carolina life in this hurricane.\u0027          He said storm surge could reach as high as 10 feet and estimated that one million residents would be leaving the coast.

He said people living well inland should prepare to lose power and endure flooding and other hazards.    It\u0027s too early to know the exact path, but forecasters said Florence could blow ashore in the Carolinas by Thursday          Jim Craig, David Burke and Chris Rayner load generators as people stocked up on supplies in Wilmington, North Carolina on Monday          Chris Rayner helps customers load their cars as they bought supplies at a Home Depot in Wilmington, North Carolina in preparation for Hurricane Florence          People shop at the Harris Teeter, filling up on water and supplies, in Charleston, South Carolina as Hurricane Florence becomes a threat          Customers line up to buy propane at Socastee Hardware store in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina          This photo provided by NASA shows Hurricane Florence from the International Space Station on Monday as it strengthened into a potentially catastrophic Category 4 hurricaneHeavy rain in the Washington area over the weekend had already led to flooding in historic Alexandria, Virginia and the National Weather Service issued a flood watch for part of the Potomac River.           North Carolina officials on Monday ordered mandatory evacuations for the state\u0027s Outer Banks barrier islandsOne person drowned on Sunday and two others were injured in dangerous surf conditions off Daytona Beach in Florida churned by Hurricane Florence. Up and down the densely populated coast, residents have been told to prepare, and not just for a possible direct blow.

As well as being a masterpiece it provides historians insight into everday life in 1600s London          The 7ft image was engraved onto four tiles which then made a panorama. This 1625 picture looked out from the South Bank to show life in London at the time. The engraving only has two copies, one of which sold for more than £100,000 at an auction in London today. The other copy is stored in Washington          The Tower of London never had onion style domes and The Globe theatre did not look like what is depicted. The reason for these errors  is because Dutchman Claes Jansz Visscher never visited London in his life, yet still managed to engrave the masterpieceOn the River Thames, which has only one bridge ning it, there is a Royal procession of boats taking King Charles I westwards.The spire of the famous Bow church is depicted as is Somerset House on the banks if the river.On the hills beyond what is now the city of London, Horowe-on-the-Hill (Harrow) is marked as is the idyllic looking Stepney villa.And Hampsted Mills - today posh Hampstead Heath - is depicted as a row of windmills.Remarkably, the panorama\u0027s creator, the Dutch engraver and cartographer Claes Jansz Visscher, never visited London, so the work required some imagination.Some say he copied exisiting sketches, or perhaps he used maps, explaining why the locations are accurate but the buildings are wrong.           The Visscher panorama gives insight into Tower Bridge. The southern gatehouse (above) shows the heads of traitors on a pike, used as a warning to ordinary Londoners, which proved effective. The houses on the bridge burned down just 10 years later, in a small fire in 1633. They would be meekly re-built, leading to the spread of the fire in 1666          The Bear Garden, left, was used for bear-baiting and popular animal sports and was called the Paris garden by ordinary Londoners. The Visscher panorama (above) is one of the earliest pictures of what the arena looked like, with Londoners trying to sneak a peek inside (left bottom). Also showing to the right is the Globe Theatre, famous for the play performances of William Shakespeare. Again, Londoners look on outside the walls (centre bottom) As a result, the Tower of London boasts some imaginative onion-styled domes.This 1625 panorama is one of only two known copies to exist, with the other one residing in the Folger Library in Washington DC, US.It is likely to have been made for a Dutch merchant as there was a burgeoning trade between London and Amsterdam at the beginning of the 17th century.The panorama was consigned for sale with auctioneers Christie\u0027s by a European private collector and the creases indicate it had been folded over and tucked away throughout its existence.Do you have a plague pit under your street?

The River Thames was awash with boats and trade back and forth, mainly to the Dutch port of Amsterdam. This was a time of progress, but Londoners were also worried about the threat of piracy. Unbelievably, a group called the Barbary Pirates from North Africa invaded a small part of Cornwall. Shocked and unprepared, around 60 locals were enslaved in Mount\u0027s Bay, Cornwall          The above picture shows Bow Church aqnd below it the River Thames. Before the fire, London was thriving but when this picture was depicted, there was political strife. King Charles I would marry Henrietta Maria that year, the daughter of Henry IV of France in Canterbury, Kent. The royal wedding was not popular with Londoners, since Maria was a Catholic          Hampsted Mills - today posh Hampstead Heath - is depicted as a row of windmills. The panorama\u0027s artist, Dutchman Claes Jansz Visscher, never visited London. But how did he do it? Some claim he used maps of London, and this is how he got things in the right place but inaccurate depictions. Others claim he used earlier sketches and copied those. But that mystery adds value to the engraving, which sold for more than £100,000\u0027There are earlier views of London but not on this impressive scale and the quality of the engraving is fantastic.\u0027It is fascinating to get this view of London from before the great fire when St Paul\u0027s Cathedral and Tower Bridge were destroyed.\u0027Also, there is a wonderful humanity to the panorama with people peering through the theatre windows in the foreground and the large ships on the Thames, giving a great insight into the way of life at that time.\u0027          The engraving is likely to have been made for a Dutch merchant as there was a burgeoning trade between London and Amsterdam at the beginning of the 17th century          A wide distance shot shows modern day Harrow.

They have studiously avoided bragging about their nuclear weapons, but at the same time haven\u0027t referred to any plans for denuclearization."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/08/11/4FE022AF00000578-0-image-a-45_1536404372429.jpg","title":"Owner roadside cafe called Nice Baps turned Costa Coffee buy offers three times","story":"    Kevin Baker, 54, runs the venue in Wadebridge, Cornwall, with his wife, Laura, 34, from a decorated shipping container made to look like a log cabin in a laybyThe business has been granted a permanent trading licence.Kevin has now revealed they have been approached by the coffee giant on three separate occasions - but he keeps turning them away.From Windsor and Windermere to Loch Ness and \u0027Game of...Share this articleCosta was recently bought out by Coca-Cola - for £3.9billion.Kevin said: \u0027Costa Coffee wanted to buy us out.

He said people living well inland should prepare to lose power and endure flooding and other hazards.    It\u0027s too early to know the exact path, but forecasters said Florence could blow ashore in the Carolinas by Thursday          Jim Craig, David Burke and Chris Rayner load generators as people stocked up on supplies in Wilmington, North Carolina on Monday          Chris Rayner helps customers load their cars as they bought supplies at a Home Depot in Wilmington, North Carolina in preparation for Hurricane Florence          People shop at the Harris Teeter, filling up on water and supplies, in Charleston, South Carolina as Hurricane Florence becomes a threat          Customers line up to buy propane at Socastee Hardware store in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina          This photo provided by NASA shows Hurricane Florence from the International Space Station on Monday as it strengthened into a potentially catastrophic Category 4 hurricaneHeavy rain in the Washington area over the weekend had already led to flooding in historic Alexandria, Virginia and the National Weather Service issued a flood watch for part of the Potomac River.           North Carolina officials on Monday ordered mandatory evacuations for the state\u0027s Outer Banks barrier islandsOne person drowned on Sunday and two others were injured in dangerous surf conditions off Daytona Beach in Florida churned by Hurricane Florence. Up and down the densely populated coast, residents have been told to prepare, and not just for a possible direct blow. Florence could slow or stall on or near shore, scooping up massive amounts of seawater. Some forecasting models show it could unload a foot or two of rain in places, causing devastating inland flooding. Forecasters also warned of a rising threat of life-threatening storm surge, along with the damaging winds.  Navy ships off Virginia\u0027s coast were preparing to sail out of the path, a North Carolina university has already canceled classes and people have begun stocking up on plywood, bottled water and other supplies.Red flags have already been flying on beaches, warning swimmers to stay out of the water as seas began kicking up. People rushed to get emergency kits ready, map out escape routes, fill sandbags and secure their homes.In coastal Charleston, South Carolina, city officials offered sandbags to residents. Myrtle Beach Mayor Brenda Bethune urged people to secure their homes but said it was too early to know if evacuations will be ordered.Myrtle Beach hardware stores and supermarkets were busy ringing up sales of bottled water, plywood and generators.\u0027Literally, they are filling buggies full of water, shopping carts full of water,\u0027 Ryan Deeck, grocery department manager at a Walmart, told The Sun News. \u0027They\u0027re coming in and buying water and plates, and that\u0027s about all they\u0027re buying.\u0027North Carolina crews were getting bulldozers and chain saws ready.

Its maximum sustained winds are at 105mph. Drawing energy from the warm water, it could have top sustained winds of 130 mph or more by Tuesday. The center also said that Hurricane Isaac, much farther out to sea, has become the 5th named hurricane of the 2018 Atlantic season.Lining up behind Florence, Isaac was about 1,230 miles  east of the Windward Islands with top winds of 75 mph  early Monday, moving west at 13 mph.

I chose 10 of them and then set out to find their human counterpart.Fenella and Georgine, a saluki“The plan was to shoot the dogs, find the humans, style them, then have them behave or pose in a similar way. This process would be repeated until we had all the shots. At the same time I would always have one eye on people I passed in the street. Many of the subjects I stopped in the park or on the bus, and had to find a tactful way of saying you look exactly like a poodle, can I take your photograph?Henry and Hope, an Afghan hound“Without exception, people reacted positively. I always led my request with a compliment, particularly if it was to a total stranger … ‘I’m working on a photographic project and you have beautiful hair interesting teetha magnificent nose!’ I’ve been taking photographs for a long time so am well versed in administering dubious compliments.Amelia and Artemis, a standard poodle“Almost all the dogs were funny.

The city comes to life as shops open and late-night revellers straggle home. But at the San Ysidro border crossing, the primary link to California and the US, traffic is already backed up to the city centre a mile away.Taking advantage of the early gridlock, vendors “work the line” – moving from car to car, offering newspapers, coffee and pastries to the morning commuters. The stream of potential customers will continue all day and well into the night, fuelling a unique mobile marketplace that operates here year round, offering everything from religious sculptures and shoes to dogs and prescription drugs.The San Ysidro port of entry between Tijuana and San Diego is the busiest land border crossing in the world, with an average of 135,000 people passing through each day. The port is a vital connection between two growing cities that are separated by politics but inextricably linked by history, culture and economics.People cross for a variety of reasons – work, family, travel or even medical treatment. For daily commuters the international border is just another traffic jam, albeit one that has grown in recent decades as the US has tightened security.A side effect of increased inspection on the US side means wait times have extended dramatically over the years, and can be as long as five hours during peak periods. This means more potential customers, which has in turn seen more people working the line. This is apparent in the mix of vendors, who come from across Mexico, South America and beyond.The ersity of vendors, beggars and hustlers walking among the cars is striking: Tijuana natives who have worked the line for decades, indigenous children juggling for tips and Haitian refugees stuck in immigration limbo selling fruit juice. Alongside them are American addicts who have relocated for a cheaper fix and recently deported people from the US – the deportados – who range from displaced Salvadoran families to those recently uprooted from several decades of life there.Some people work the line out of desperation while others do it part-time for extra cash. However it is widely accepted that the line is a place where anyone can make money if they work hard.Wendy Hernandez, a 19-year-old student, explains that she likes the flexibility of working here. “I work in the line to pay for school. Every day, Monday to Sunday, usually after school from one-thirty to eight. A lot of guys in line can be disrespectful but I like working here, mainly because of the money.”By noon the line is in full swing, with people walking around despite the 30C (86F) heat. It is clear this is a closeknit community. Everyone seems to have family and friends working nearby, and vendors socialise as much as they sell.Sitting at one of the streetside shops selling artesanías – handmade arts and crafts that depict everything from Catholic saints to Marvel superheroes – 47-year-old Nacho Ruiz says he would not want to be anywhere else. “All of my life I’ve worked the line, more than 30 years, I was practically born here,” he says. “It’s a great job for me, I have lots of family nearby. I wouldn’t leave the line for anything.”This closeness becomes apparent when a commotion breaks out. A pair of eight-year-old girls run over yelling that a man has been trying to force them into his van. Two men immediately jump up and head over. After a brief exchange they start taking turns punching him in the face. Most bystanders pretend not to notice, accustomed to this sort of “street justice”. By the end of the ordeal the driver has moved ahead in line and the two men are back at the shop, wiping the blood off of their tattooed hands before going back to selling blankets and paintings.When asked later the men say this is how things are done, since the line community is essentially self-regulating. Carlos Bueno, one of the local shop workers explains: “We take care of our business, we take care of our people. When something wrong is happening we deal with it.“Some people that cross think they’re better than us, so if we don’t take care of each other no one else will.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b37362a71483672a0c6e7103d250d98083ef58f/0_21_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34b9ddf700be9a5b598190cd833b18f6","title":"alcohol free days middle aged drinking public health england","story":"Here’s a weird pickle to be in: I haven’t been drunk for over a month, but I can’t remember the last time I went a day without drinking. The drunk thing is easy to pinpoint it was my brother’s stag weekend, and we were in some Welsh town, and it was a Saturday night, and I was partly drinking to keep up with everyone and partly drinking in the vain hope that I’d black out and forget what an abjectly terrible time I was having.But the second part is much more problematic. Last night I had a G\u0026ampT because we had some gin that needed to be used up. On Saturday I had a drink because I had to live blog Strictly Come Dancing and wanted something to take the edge off what turned out to be a very specific type of horror. I drank on Friday, and on Thursday. On Wednesday I drank in a pub. On Tuesday I drank on my sofa. Just one drink, mind you. At no point during the week did I ever feel the effect of alcohol coursing through my system. Just a small drink as a token reward for getting through another day vaguely intact.Which is all very boringly polite of me, of course. But the fact is, I can’t remember the last time I had an alcohol-free day. And according to Public Health England, that’s exactly what we should all be having.High alcohol consumption leads to all sorts of problems, from obesity to cancer. But what can you do about it? Cut it out altogether? Probably, yes, but that’s no fun. Take a month off, like dry January or Go Sober for October? Maybe, but, despite the fact they’re charity-run events, it’s hard to escape the feeling that these schemes are designed for the worst kind of virtue-signalling, Justgiving-hijacking, attention-seeking dipsticks who want to experience an artificially inflated level of recognition for barely enduring any plight whatsoever.Drink-free days, meanwhile, sound like a happy medium. Have two days off from booze a week and you’ve reduced your alcohol intake by nearly a third. Have three days off and you’ve nearly halved it.Make no mistake, this campaign has been organised for middle-aged dullards like me. In my late teens and early 20s I routinely went days and days without drinking, only to overcompensate by going on a disproportionately nutso bender every fortnight or so.But with two young kids, it’s stupid of me to drink to excess any more, because toddlers don’t understand the concept of the considerate lie-in. If I wake up reeling from a big night out, bloated and sweating and pulsing with self-hatred, it’ll still have to be at quarter to six in the morning, to allow my three-year-old to jump on my head and scream the lyrics of a self-penned song entitled If You Wanna Nay-Nay.Instead, when I drink, it’s just for something to do. Prestige drama on the telly, a single bottle of beer, asleep in my clothes on the sofa by 9pm. That’s the pattern my evenings take. I don’t get drunk. I don’t cause problems. But I probably drink more now than I ever did as a teenager, which is ridiculous. Middle-aged drinking creeps up on you, and this campaign has been designed to remind you of that.Having a few deliberate alcohol-free days a week is a no-brainer, the same way as having a day or two without meat. It’s a small reduction that I won’t even notice. So sign me up. I mean, not tonight because there’s still half a bottle of wine taking up precious room in the fridge. But the day after that. Probably."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a450f081a1caa5bd105bce570d2ca3937968b5d/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f24755184fe1077c4446c4b4f9ea2130","title":"i couldnt go to the jobcentre i didnt have a cv building my business as a refugee","story":"When Moh Agha fled the war in Syria and arrived in the UK, he started selling books on ebay to support his family. Now he stocks more than 3,500 items and runs training courses for other refugees. This is how he got back in businessMoh Agha had a lot to take in when he first arrived in the UK with his young family in November 2013. “It’s not easy moving to a new country with a wife and two small children,” he says. “Everything was unfamiliar. We had no friends or family, it was very cold and people spoke very fast and with a strong accent.”After fleeing Syria for Saudi Arabia, the family arrived in the UK. “We moved from London to Bristol, then settled in Wolverhampton,” he says. “It wasn’t easy for me to go to the jobcentre, because I didn’t have a CV I’d always owned my own business. I wanted to open a shop, but it was very expensive because of council tax and business rates. I also found it hard to leave my wife Ranim and my daughters Yara and Amal (now 11 and six) at home alone, because they didn’t speak English. So when I discovered ebay and selling things from home, I realised it could be the solution.”Around this time, by chance, Agha attended a very British institution: the car boot sale. “I met a lady who was trying to sell old books – she had maybe 700 or 800 of them,” he recalls. “She didn’t want to take them home at the end of the day so she was giving them away for free. I took them back to my garage, sorted them out and listed 20 for sale on ebay. The next day all of the books were sold. I then listed the rest and spent the next six months looking around for more. The profit was small, but I was happy to be building a store and getting good feedback.”As Agha and his family began to build up a network of fellow Syrians between Manchester, London and Bristol, he realised that many in his community were struggling to find traditional items they missed from home. “I went to a big wholesaler in London and bought some Syrian kitchenware and house decorations and listed them,” he says. “I made a profit straight away and I realised that there was a real demand there, so I started to import more items from Egypt and Lebanon.”But building up an online store from scratch wasn’t without its challenges. “I’d watch videos explaining how to sell on ebay, but I couldn’t always understand them because they were in English or out of date,” he says. “I realised many people in my community needed these items, but didn’t know about ebay or were not sure how to use it. So I started making videos in Arabic, advertising my items and explaining how to make an ebay account and use PayPal.”Agha’s store, Almaskiya, now stocks 3,500 different items – from prayer mats to copper falafel makers – and he’s not just selling to the Syrian community anymore. “There’s a mould to make sweets that we use every Eid,” he says. “I made a 20-second video explaining how to use it, and now people from Europe are buying it at Christmas and Easter. We have orders for it every day now, actually. And there’s a metal straw that we use to drink tea in the Middle East. The idea came to me that people who drink coffee might want to use it to keep their teeth white. That’s become one of our bestsellers.”The business is growing – “we make a good profit in high season and we cover our costs the rest of the time” – but Agha hasn’t stopped there. “After I made the videos explaining ebay, a lot of people asked me how they could start selling too,” he says. Agha now runs free workshops around the UK for people interested in becoming ebay sellers. “Even though I know these people could become my competitors, I believe that everyone has their own strategy and their own way of doing things – and there’s room for millions of sellers. When I hear people thank me or say: ‘I’m going to pray for you’, or I see them start businesses with a good turnover, I feel proud,” he says. “It’s the best part of my day.” Millions of people are using ebay to start a side hustle, make more of a hobby or carve out a career.

And why should we care? Author of The Multi-Hyphen Method, Emma Gannon, explainsAlex Haddow, a comedian and picture editor, agrees: “I feel that by doing lots of things that pique my interest all the time, I get the most out of everything,” she says. “And because that keeps my interest up, I put more into them and get better results.”At the same time, the internet has given us access to a myriad of free tools and a huge global audience of potential customers and clients, whether using e-commerce hubs such as ebay, or building a following via social media – making many business ideas more viable than before. Not only is it easier to take that first step, but it’s reassuringly non-scary. After all, there’s no risking it all to follow your dreams it is, by definition, a bit on the side. Unsurprisingly, the rise of the multitasking worker comes hand-in-hand with fewer people working in a traditional “job-for-life” role. According to HR organisation the CIPD, around a quarter of workers have been in a job for less than two years, as working on a project-by-project basis lessens the stigma around job-hopping (and creates more impressive-looking CVs).Simultaneously, advances in technology have led to general job security being called into question. I started my side hustle in 2010, when I began to suspect that my magazine job wasn’t going to be around in five years’ time, and have been earning money with a blog and consultancy business ever since. This means we’re quicker to move on and less likely to look back. “I resent the job-for-life notion,” says journalist and volunteer Georgie Bradley. “The idea of clocking in, chaining myself to the desk, then clocking out nine hours later seems soul-destroying.”Researching my book on multi-faceted careers, The Multi-Hyphen Method, I met many more people making side hustling an art. Janet Oganah is a prime example: a former family law barrister, she is now a civil servant and podcaster. “Choosing a multi-hyphenate lifestyle was not an easy decision,” she says. “But it was one of the best ones I have made. I was invested in my legal career I did important work that changed lives. But I was uneasy about relying on one income stream, particularly with the cuts to publicly funded work.” Oganah turned to podcasting as a lucrative, creative way of ersifying her career. For Sally Steel, a teacher who launched a crochet business on ebay, the flexibility was vital for family life: “I wanted to work more creatively and be able to do the school run. I started teaching part-time, building my business while my twins were asleep or at nursery,” she says. “It meant I could spend more time with my children while earning a living. And the happiness I feel at being my own creative boss is worth all the hard work.” This fulfilment is a key factor. For Emma Glass, a paediatric clinical research nurse and author, it’s achieved through the variety of her days. “I feel lucky to have opportunities in both nursing and writing,” she says. “I like working in a clinical environment and with patients, and then spending the evening with publishers and writers and having entirely different experiences within a single day.” Of course, nobody wants to have 17 jobs to make ends meet, and it would be irresponsible to glorify that, but embracing multiple skills to create a modern portfolio career is exciting. We’re told to pick one thing to be good at from our school days, but we all have so many skills and interests. Being a multi-hyphenate answers this, expanding our earning potential and giving us the flexibility to choose how and when we work.

Want to get in on the action? From planning and packaging to photography and postage, here’s how to start your own online empireBuilding a business on ebay is like building any business – it takes passion, determination and hard work. But the difference with building a business on ebay is that the platform has been designed to help you, and with ebay’s business tools and its step-by-step guides to using them, you’ll be on track to ebay success before you can say “Buy it Now”.Research and planningFirst, you need to do some research. Filter by “Sold Items” on the ebay app or go through “Advanced Search” on desktop to see what items like yours have sold for. As well as scoping out your competitors, this is an easy way to explore the site and get a feel for how it works.Once you’ve got a sense of the price bracket your product is in, you can add your postage and packaging costs. Remember to consider other practicalities such as where you will keep your goods and how quickly they can be dispatched to your customers.Once you’ve worked out the details, it’s time to open up ebay and PayPal accounts and register with HMRC. Check HMRC’s website for details on how and when to get VAT registered. And voila – you’re now an ebay business seller!Get advice from the sourceOn top of the direct access to millions of potential customers around the world, ebay’s Seller Hub and its smart suite of marketing and growth tools make it a powerful platform for starting a business. But before you can make the most of them, you need to know how to use them.The ebay Seller Centre is the best place to start. It is straightforward and helpful, advising you on the different levels of engagement, the fee structure and what you get for your money. Look at the ebay tools on offer and think about what you need at this point – some will be more useful now, some you’ll want to call on later.FeedbackThis can have a huge impact on your business, so you’ll want to make sure that you keep your customer feedback positive. Fortunately, this is largely down to being organised and good at communication – these are the keys to customer service. If your items are of good quality, accurately described, dispatched on time and delivered when and where you say they will be, you’ll be well on your way to building the relationships and reputation a successful business and brand needs.Respond quickly to any customer queries that come up on “Ask the Seller a Question” ship immediately once the payment is received and let your buyer know when their goods are on the way. Finally, restrict your communications with buyers to ebay’s internal messaging system – it acts as a safety net. Build a brandLook at what catches your attention on the site and gets the right message across. Aim for a username and an image that reflect your business and will be an easy search for potential customers. Any logo should reflect this – and the item and shop description should clearly highlight what you sell and make it attractive to potential customers.Make your photography as clear as possible by shooting items in natural light against a white background. You can have up to 12 images for each item, so shoot from different angles, add a ruler if you need to indicate size, and remember that no words are allowed on photos. These images should represent your products authentically and accurately – this should minimise returns.Learn the languageGetting the title right on all items you sell is vitally important – particularly if you’re selling your own products to a new market. After that, it’s all about your product description. Imagine you’ve just started selling your own range of homemade face creams what are you going to tell your potential customers about them? First, make sure all of the basic details are spelled out as clearly as possible, such as the core name of the product and the quantity or volume of the units you are selling.Next it’s about how you want the product to be perceived. Taking the face cream business as an example, be mindful not to append superlatives such as “miracle” or “wonder” to the product description. If you’re selling something you’ve made yourself, no matter how special or effective the formula that you’ve come up with may be, you’re much better off describing something as “artisan” or “small batch”. Not only will this be more accurate, but it will also sound more realistic and authentic – an important consideration when building your brand and gaining consumer trust.But ebay also does some of the work for you – when you start selling, the platform will autopopulate various category options for you based on similar items, from which you can review and choose the most relevant for your product.Start smallBefore throwing yourself into huge numbers of orders, it’s important to make sure that you’ve got a handle on fulfilling your promises and offering a good service. So it’s better to start small to make sure you get a good idea of how to do things right. Remember, too, that as soon as you’re a business seller, you’ll need to offer returns on all of your products, so iron out that process as well. Then, once things are running smoothly, you’ll know the time is right to start putting a few more items up for sale. Keep on top of things and plan ahead relentlesslyKeep planning. Growing a business on ebay needs the same dedication and attention to detail as planning any other enterprise, so always stay on top of costs, profits and time management. Write a business plan, so you know exactly what you want to achieve.Finally, remember to keep a checklist, day in, day out. People do this in different ways: while some opt for the classic pen, paper, and Post-its or the always stylish Moleskine diary, others are taking advantage of the plethora of great organiser apps, such as Todoist, to keep on top of things. Whichever option works for you, the most important thing is to know what’s coming up and how to prioritise things.Millions of people are using ebay to start a side hustle, make more of a hobby or carve out a career.

But it also now includes the first nation to est, Ireland, major cities including New York and key medical organisations. Major oil companies such as Shell have this year cited estment as a material risk to its business.Fossil fuel estment began on US university campuses in 2011 but now s 37 nations around the world. Supporters of estment say existing fossil fuel resources are already far greater than can be burned without causing catastrophic climate change and that exploring for and producing more fossil fuels is therefore morally wrong. They also say fossil fuel companies are risky investments as global action on emissions gets tougher.Some investors argue that remaining as shareholders and persuading fossil fuel companies to change can be more effective. However, another new report finds this approach has not delivered any significant change to date.The new estment report, by Arabella Advisors, calculates that investors with $6.2tn in assets under management have committed to est from fossil fuels, up from $5.2tn in the previous report in 2016.“I commend the estment movement for its incredible progress,” said Mary Robinson, former UN high commissioner on human rights and former president of Ireland.Bill de Blasio, mayor of New York City, and Sadiq Khan, mayor of London, which is in the process of esting, said in a joint article for the : “We must use our economic might to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy. Taking this kind of action now could help us make a crucial difference to the people we represent and the future of our planet.Jeremy Grantham, co-founder of GMO, one of the world’s most influential asset management companies, said the financial case for estment was compelling. “Investors with long-term horizons should avoid oil stocks on investment grounds. They face a sustained headwind. Ethical arguments for estments are simply not necessary. They are a pure bonus,” he said.The Arabella Advisors report noted that the American Medical Association (AMA) and the UK’s Royal College of General Practitioners had both ested. “It is unwise to own fossil fuels companies long-term and the products of these companies are harmful to human health by producing dangerous air pollution and contributing to global climate change,” said Dr Todd Sack at the AMA.Divestment appears to be concerning oil and gas majors. In Shell’s last annual report it states: “It could have a material adverse effect on the price of our securities and our ability to access equity capital markets.” Furthermore, the World Bank Group has committed to stopping funding oil and gas development and major insurers including Swiss Re have decided to stop underwriting coal projects.The report on investor engagement on with fossil fuel companies, from shareholder advocacy group As You Sow, found that 160 climate change shareholder resolutions were filed at 24 US oil and gas companies between 2012 and 2018.However, none of the companies have adopted plans or targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels and most are investing to maintain or expand production. “The oil and gas sector has not stepped up to address the growing risks to their companies, the broader economy, and our planet,” said Andrew Behar, As You Sow CEO.The call for ethical investment was backed by Pope Francis in June 2018, when he addressed the heads of oil companies. He said “disturbing and a cause for real concern” that carbon emissions were still rising and added: “Even more worrying is the continued search for new fossil fuel reserves, whereas the Paris agreement clearly urged keeping most fossil fuels underground.”Ellen Dorsey, at the philanthropic Wallace Global Fund, said the pressure to est would continue. “Today, our movement pledges to increase ested global assets to $10tn by 2020.”Robinson backed the clean investment call: “This is what climate justice requires.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/964661bba03fb4f7b56a13143658dafb564c360e/0_17_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d89144b8b677f41924d57d032efa9fc","title":"water voles returning to national park in west country after 30 years","story":"150 ‘Ratty’ river creatures to be released in Somerset estate where they had become extinctOne of the most beloved and endangered riverine creatures is returning to a west country national park where it has been extinct for more than three decades.Over the next few days 150 water voles will be released at six locations in the Aller river on the Holnicote Estate on Exmoor in Somerset.The new arrivals at Holnicote will be closely watched to see how they are settling in. Rangers, volunteers, students and members of the public will monitor their numbers.They will use simple field signs to record their presence and behaviour, from actual sightings and “plopping” sounds as they e into water to the tell-tale signal of grass blades nibbled off at distinctive 45 degree angles.The streams and banks can be easily seen from many of the footpaths on the estate, and as water voles are active during the day they should once again become a regular sight in the area.Alex Raeder, the National Trust’s south-west conservation manager, said: “I remember being enchanted by these creatures as a child. They were once a vital part of the Holnicote ecosystem and could be again.“These voles should soon be busy burrowing into the muddy banks and creating more natural-looking edges to streams with shady pools that are great for so many other small creatures.”The water voles will be released in sibling groups and breeding pairs. A further 150 will be released in the spring.Water voles – immortalised as Ratty in Kenneth Grahame’s The Wind in the Willows – became endangered due to the degradation, fragmentation and loss of habitat caused by farming intensification and urbanisation after the second world war.They were also hunted by the American mink which either escaped or had been deliberately released from the fur farms of the 1970s and 80s. Rangers on the Holnicote Estate have carefully monitored the surrounding streams for mink and there have been no sightings for three months.This is the National Trust’s first reintroduction of water voles in the south-west and the second by the conservation charity in England in the past two years. Water voles were reintroduced at Malham Tarn in the Yorkshire Dales in August 2016 –the first time water voles were in the lake for 50 years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c62f2941147bdc25037f132faab8652f40c217b/0_2_1498_899/master/1498.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23252d3156eac3508fa8c40d97ec8125","title":"can you ever forgive me review melissa mccarthy","story":"In this shaggy, melancholic true story, the Oscar nominee delivers some of her best work yet as a struggling biographer who finds an unlikely new source of incomeIt’s not been a great year for Melissa McCarthy, an actor who has enjoyed a number of standout years since she broke out in 2011’s Bridesmaids, bagging an Oscar nomination in the process. Her brand of often hilarious yet too often lazily repetitive comedy had been wearing thin already and with the one-two punch of Life of the Party and The Happytime Murders, two critically eviscerated and commercially underperforming disappointments, her luck seemed to be coming to an end. But with quite miraculous timing, she has found her way into this year’s awards conversation with her first of two more serious-minded roles.In the charming, fact-based Can You Ever Forgive Me? the character of Lee Israel allows for McCarthy’s comic skills to shine through, exemplified in an opening scene that quite perfectly sets up her irascible, heavy-drinking antiheroine as she gets fired from a day job she hates anyway. While Israel had written a number of moderately successful biographies of historical women, the money hadn’t lasted very long and with her agent constantly brushing her off and her ex-girlfriend refusing to accept her calls, she struggled to survive. Through an unlikely set of circumstances she found herself carving out a new career as a forger of celebrity letters, enjoying both the lucrative rewards and the ego boost to her skills as a writer.With direction from Marielle Heller, who impressed with her nuanced debut The Diary of a Teenage Girl, and a script co-written by Nicole Holofcener (who was originally attached to direct), Can You Ever Forgive Me? benefits immensely from their combined abilities. Both have incredible respect for their characters, avoiding over-embellishment, and with Israel they have (semi-)constructed another fascinating, flawed, frustrating and funny female character. As her agent (a fun cameo from Jane Curtin) explains, life would be a lot easier and work would be a lot more fruitful if she just stopped being so difficult. “You can be an asshole when you’re famous,” she tells her.But at 51, Israel is uninterested in playing the game (or selling out like Tom Clancy) and there is an understandably exhausted arrogance from someone whose undeniable talents are not enough to warrant a steady income. For every moment that Israel deserves sympathy, there are five others when her behaviour infuriates and McCarthy is so perfect at expressing just how head-smashingly difficult it is to be around her. It is hard to imagine that Julianne Moore was originally set to inhabit the role as McCarthy plays it with such confidence that it feels written directly for her. One of the reasons she makes for such a talented comic actor is her ability to take her characters so far and with this more dramatic turn, there is a similar fearlessness. It’s one of her best performances to date and opens the door on an entirely new and hugely exciting stage of her career.She is buddied up, reluctantly of course, with Richard E Grant’s decaying dandy and together, they share a spiky, increasingly warm, chemistry. There is an unfettered mustiness to the pair and the bookshops and bars they exist in, with Heller creating such an evocative atmosphere of early 1990s New York that a light whiff almost emanates from the screen. It is rare to see a film led by two gay characters over the age of 50 and there is a specific friendship they share both are implicitly aware of the alternate routes they have taken in life partly as a result of their sexuality and both more explicitly aware of the loneliness that now hangs over them. There is a melancholic atmosphere to the film at large, a frankness about the impossibility of dreams and the importance of growing old without shackling one’s self to an idealised notion of what life will be.Sometimes the shagginess of the film can make it feel a bit slight and at times it does work better as a concentrated character study, but it’s such a joy to spend this time with McCarthy, drunkenly scheming and grumbling, that it’s hard to complain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/605e778731419ead32f1e8e3d635e7d56ce31552/100_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4daa1b11b9d45eca5e8984acb5d1a279","title":"hotel mumbai review dev patel anthony maras","story":"Patel is subdued yet excellent in Anthony Maras’s white-knuckle retelling of the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks At the five-star Taj Mahal Palace hotel “guest is God”. So says head chef Oberoi (Anupam Kher) to his staff before they begin serving the dinner during which the hotel will come under siege from four gunmen intent on a massacre. Based on the series of terrorist attacks that occurred in Mumbai in 2008, Hotel Mumbai recounts how the Taj’s guests and staff fought to survive those four days.It’s an ensemble piece as director Anthony Maras weaves various perspectives into a tightly constructed narrative. Dev Patel (delivering a subdued yet excellent performance) plays a server under the watchful eye of Chef Oberoi who is suddenly tasked with keeping his guests alive when the attacks break out. Armie Hammer is the Jack-and-Coke drinking all-American husband of Nazanin Boniadi – the couple decide to leave their baby upstairs with the nanny while they dine in the hotel’s restaurant. Jason Isaacs’s sleazy Russian businessman dines nearby. Other narratives include the Mumbai police officers who infiltrate the hotel to get to the CCTV cameras, Patel’s character’s wife watching the news footage, and a young Aussie couple backpacking across India.For all its subplots, Maras keeps a tight leash on the film’s narrative strands as we watch characters move in and out of each other’s stories. The use of real news footage on background televisions is a clever way of dealing with exposition, allowing the plot to move briskly along.The impact of the terrorist attack on locals and visitors is shown in equal measure, a change from the disaster movie genre that typically favours showing Americans overcoming tragic circumstances in a foreign country. Time isn’t given to exploring the relationship between locals and guests beyond “guest is God,” and one scene attempting to do so between a racist guest and Patel’s character is a little on the nose. Class is handled with a bit more complexity as the line between guests and staff remains in place despite the life-and-death situation. Maras makes an unusual decision in giving much of the narrative space to the four gunmen, seemingly in an attempt to humanise the terrorists. The film’s more humorous moments occur in these scenes. One of the men takes a bite of a pizza until he’s told by his brother-in-arms that it’s pork. Spluttering wildly, he’s laughed at, “they’re just vegetables”. It’s funny until they turn and shoot a woman in the head. It’s in these moments of jarring tonal shifts where Hotel Mumbai’s otherwise tight pacing and structure begins to unwind. Scenes of violence are graphic but the film’s real horror comes from its tension. In a closet, a baby’s cries are stifled while the gunman stands outside. The receptionists are held at gunpoint and told to call guests’ rooms telling them to unlock their doors. But despite these tonal issues, Hotel Mumbai is an excellent, white-knuckle thriller – and an unlikely crowd-pleaser."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d63d5b9419dcc516eb4e680448051b7376b2619d/0_0_3504_2102/master/3504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8cf1987ae22b097103b46a85e190e8a0","title":"if beale street could talk review barry jenkins tragic romance soars","story":"With his follow-up to best picture winner Moonlight, the writer-director brings James Baldwin’s 1974 novel to the screen with heartbreaking, visually audacious resultsWith his third film, the writer-director Barry Jenkins carries with him an impossible weight of expectation, the kind of which he was less burdened with when Moonlight premiered in 2016. Before then he had made an acclaimed yet small-scale 2008 drama called Medicine for Melancholy, and little did any of us know just how far his follow-up would go, from gaining enthused festival buzz to becoming a groundbreaking best picture Oscar winner. Two years later he returns with a wider, hungrier audience in tow and his decision to adapt a much-loved James Baldwin novel attaches an even greater level of anticipation along with unfair yet unavoidable pressure.While If Beale Street Could Talk has a more traditionally structured plot than Moonlight, it’s still far from conventional, with Jenkins telling his story via a shifting, time-jumping narrative. The story focuses on Tish (Kiki Layne) and Fonny (Stephan James), childhood friends who become lovers yet whose bond is tested when Fonny is falsely accused of rape. As he awaits trial behind bars, Tish finds out she is pregnant and, with the help of those around her, works to try to get him released before the baby arrives.It’s a film with love at its root, both familial and romantic, and Jenkins fills so much of it with a radiating warmth. The decision to move back and forth through the story allows us to understand and invest in the central relationship and there’s a nuanced delicacy in how he conveys the early stages of falling for someone. It’s the small moments that make you realise and, as he showed us in Moonlight’s heart-grabbing diner scene, he has a skill for recognising the important subtleties of body language. In matching the newcomer Layne with James, best known for playing Jesse Owens in Race, he has found a pairing whose chemistry charms and bewitches – with every scene we feel more engaged and then enraged when they’re pulled further apart.As a black man in America, Fonny is the victim of a system cruelly stacked against him and Jenkins weaves outrage into his film without a heavy hand. Anger over unbearable injustice is replaced with sadness over seemingly insurmountable loss, of the artist, husband and father he might never be, and there’s a stinging prescience in Fonny’s downfall. But there remains an optimism throughout and an unapologetic belief in the restorative power of love. Jenkins’ love for the material shines through yet the downside is that it can often cloud his vision. He has spoken about his desire to remain faithful to the text and at times, especially with Tish’s narration, the dialogue can feel too verbose, too constructed for the screen. The languid pace and unconventional structure works for the most part but at times it can feel a tad unfocused, with some scenes failing to land with the same crashing impact as others (Dave Franco’s cameo as a sentimental landlord proves a particular head-scratcher).Yet our attention endures as Jenkins remains a constantly evolving visual artist. The film is achingly beautiful, each frame artfully composed and each song choice thoughtfully matched. With a wider canvas and what appears to be a bigger budget than he had for Moonlight, Jenkins has created a film rich with lingering imagery, without it feeling too overstylised. Working with a bigger cast, he again showcases his knack for human choreography, picking actors so perfectly suited that one small complaint is that I wanted to see more of them. As Tish’s mother, Regina King is wonderfully measured, with a natural maternalism that leaps from a need to nurture to a desperate need to protect in a standout confrontation scene in the final act. The ever-underused Teyonah Parris, so good in the criminally underseen sitcom Survivor’s Remorse, is effectively feisty in regrettably brief doses and there are small, impressive turns from Colman Domingo as Tish’s father and Brian Tyree Henry, who delivers a chilling speech about the after-effects of prison in another standout scene.As the focal lovers, these are star-making turns from Layne and James, the latter in particular making a searing impact. He’s effortlessly charismatic but also gut-wrenchingly vulnerable and his tortured face will burn its way into your memory. Given the film’s unabashed belief in love, it’s satisfying to feel so much while watching it. Sensorily and emotionally, it’s an almost overwhelming experience.• If Beale Street Could Talk is showing at the Toronto film festival and will be released in the US on 30 November and in the UK on 18 January"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d311559f4129fa26f82b272847014ee9214000a/0_2115_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7766388283eb6885e06e22d375c7edc9","title":"rachel roddy mexican potato cakes and salsa recipe","story":"A cheesy Mexican potato cake, made in Rome, via south America, Mexico and FranceI’d been living in Rome just shy of a year when the film was released in 2006. It was shown at the Greenwich cinema here in Testaccio, a quarter that feels a world away from decadent Esquilino and the fringes of Termini train station, where I myself lived for two months when I first arrived in the city.Early in the film there is a scene where a woman shouts, in hard Roman dialect, “immigrants out” – an an ongoing theme in the film, along with those of language, money, Italian bureaucracy and misunderstanding. But above the struggles, with Tronco’s infallible energy and compassion rises the impression that everything in Rome becomes, in some way, Roman. And under Tronco’s guidance, 10 musical traditions and languages are wrought together into compositions: Arabic disco meets Latin groove, Mozart meets Sahara blues and Sufi folk. It is joyful.Like the orchestra born at this cultural crossroads, the Nuovo Mercato di Esquilino is a pulsing, multi-ethnic one: Egyptian butchers are butted up next to Hungarian ones, Bangladeshi fishmongers chant alongside Roman fruttivendolo, while young Ghanaians ferry vegetables on iron trolleys. Talk to anyone for more than a few minutes and it is clear there are struggles – you can feel them almost hanging in the air as they do in the film. Above them though, rises the music and life of a busy market, dozens of languages and customers converging into Italian, and just as many scents, all of them persistent and vital.It is difficult to find coriander in Rome, but here the smell of it is omnipresent, along with cabbage leaves, spices and the cool scent of meat fat. Coriander is a flavour I used to find awkward: turns out I was the awkward one, and it is now one I crave – no other herb can quite hit that corner of my mouth. I buy it bunches with tufty roots from an Indian stall, and green chillies from the Ecuadorian couple. Back home, I pull Diana Kennedy’s The Art of Mexican Food from the shelf for the late Senorita Esperanza’s recipe for potato cakes, first made for me 15 years ago by a French friend living in Camden.The cake are simple: 400g of boiled potatoes, crushed with your hands and mixed with 100g cheese – ideally queso anejo, but salted ricotta works, too – along with a whole egg and a handful of chopped parsley. You plop tablespoonfuls of the mixture into a frying pan with a finger of hot oil, press the top slightly and cook, flipping halfway, until both sides are golden.There must be a table sauce with these cakes, according to Senorita Esperanza. The partners in the Mexican salsa are tomato, seeded chillies, onion and coriander,. Coriander wakes up in the presence of raw heat, becoming its true self metallic and soapy flavours give way to something citrussy sharp but soothing. Topped by a spoonful of salsa, the hot potato cakes are an absolute delight to eat.And in the making, a Mexican recipe, taught by French women to English ones, then made in Rome with ingredients bought from an Bangladeshi and an Ecuadorian. If that isn’t the music of food, I don’t know what is.Prep and macerate 40 minCook 40 minMakes 12 small cakesFor the salsa1 medium white or red onion, finely chopped1 large, ripe tomato, finely chopped1-3 moderately hot green chillies (traditionally serranos, but choose what is available), deseeded and finely chopped1 small bunch coriander, roughly choppedSaltFor the potato cakes2 medium potatoes (approx 500g)1 large egg, beaten100g queso anejo, Romano cheese, salted ricotta or pecorino, grated2 tbsp parsley, finely choppedSalt and black pepperOil for fryingFirst make the salsa: Mix the chopped tomato, onion and chillies with the coriander leaves, adding salt to taste and moistening with a little water. Leave to sit for 30 minutes while you make the potato cakes.Boil the potatoes in their skins until tender. Once cool enough, peel and then either crush the potatoes with your hands or a fork, or pass through a potato ricer.

On that count he will make nine changes to his team. “I can’t make decisions just to get a win,” he said. “A lot of these guys who are coming into the team have played zero minutes in the league. The right thing for them – and ultimately the right thing for us – is to give them game time.”Southgate smiled when it was put to him that it was “quite incredible” that the role of an England manager now appears to involve providing time on the pitch for players who would not ordinarily be involved for their clubs. That, however, is the current position for Southgate and, as such, England’s attacking midfielders will be Loftus-Cheek, with 33 minutes in two substitute appearances for Chelsea, and Delph, yet to feature at all for Manchester City. Reluctantly Southgate has abandoned his policy that, if players are not involved for their clubs, they should not expect to win international caps.Southgate also revealed he was contemplating switching back to a four-man defence in the coming months and, analysing the shortage of obvious replacements for Kane, appeared to end any hopes that Glenn Murray and Troy Deeney might have of a call-up. “There aren’t many English strikers playing,” he said. “There are obviously some older ones who have good goalscoring records at club level but I’m not sure that’s necessarily the route we want to go.”With Jamie Vardy’s self-enforced exile further reducing England’s options, Southgate was also asked about the chances of a recall for Theo Walcott. He claimed “the door was always open to everyone”, though a more accurate assessment of his thoughts could probably be taken from the fact that he answered by talking up Marcus Rashford and Danny Welbeck, as well as saying he still had high hopes for Liverpool’s Dominic Solanke, another player not to feature for a single minute this season.In Kane’s absence Eric Dier will captain a side that features James Tarkowski alongside Harry Maguire and Kyle Walker in defence, with Trent Alexander-Arnold and Danny Rose as the wing-backs and Jack Butland in goal.“Well, not many England sides have played a World Cup semi-final and a third-v-fourth play-off,” Southgate replied testily to the statistic about England’s three-match losing run. “That focus will come on me and I’m not concerned about it. I will have to live with whatever people want to say about my record, relegations and whatever else fits the bill.“But I’m comfortable in my own skin. The priority is not me. It’s developing the England team.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9623e86cc2d8c3732b28a82f6f3468cc9885f892/0_98_1632_979/master/1632.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74e8d734dfecc2994669e62a7f486512","title":"scotland albania nations league match report","story":"There was no acceptable alternative to victory for Alex McLeish in this, Scotland’s Nations League opener. The manager – unmoved from the pitchside for 90 minutes in pouring rain – knew that all right, such has been the scale of audible discontent surrounding the Scottish team. Handily for McLeish, Albania provided woefully limited opposition on the kind of occasion disappointingly removed from those that made Hampden Park a place for visiting teams to fear. Still, in this context a win mattered more than anything. That Scotland fully deserved it was a bonus.This success affords McLeish that priceless managerial commodity: breathing space. Earlier friendly fixtures cannot be discarded in analysis of this, McLeish’s second tenure, but here Scotland won when it mattered. The Nations League may yet prove their major tournament salvation, given 20 years have passed since the Scots appeared in a finals. Steven Naismith, a late call-up to McLeish’s squad, made the difference against Albania.“We were under pressure,” conceded McLeish. “I know the way football works but I’m building a wall, I’m not papering over cracks. Everyone said we must win and we did win. It was a very good performance.”McLeish caused a pre-match stir by leaving out Leigh Griffiths, Stuart Armstrong and James Forrest. The deployment of Stephen O’Donnell and Andy Robertson meant they started proceedings with five defenders. At home to the 58th-ranked team in the world this move raised eyebrows. “I think I’m well qualified to select who I choose to,” said McLeish sharply afterwards.And, notwithstanding, Scotland opened in positive fashion. Albania spent the first 20 minutes camped in their own half, which appeared a source of serious touchline frustration for their manager, Christian Panucci.There was also an extraordinary let-off for the visitors. John McGinn’s free-kick was headed into the path of Naismith by Charlie Mulgrew. Naismith had the simplest of tasks to head home but the Hearts player instead watched his effort bounce off a post and across the goalline to safety.Naismith did have the ball in the net before the interval, only for the close-range strike to be correctly ruled out for offside. Albania’s only response came via Ledian Memushaj, who dragged a shot wide after McGinn had handed him possession.Scotland were shortly to receive the early second-half stroke of fortune they, on balance of play alone, may claim was merited. Naismith, on the occasion of winning his 47th cap, was again in an offside position when moving to meet a Robertson cross but no flag was forthcoming and his header found the net after a deflection from Berat Xhimshiti.Albania almost responded within seconds but Bekim Balaj instead fluffed his lines after another McGinn blunder. The same Albania attacker was soon brilliantly thwarted by the outstretched legs of Allan McGregor. In light of this Scotland were glad of the cushion that duly arrived. McGinn’s corner found its way to Naismith, with the Albania goal unguarded because of the erratic e of Thomas Strakosha. Albania never looked capable of clawing themselves back into proceedings and duly did not."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20e2e4a7ea3cebd67044637dd86a3cc140fbdce1/0_1_3047_1829/master/3047.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e80505016709f7b874547c5fe5b2242","title":"the nations league and wycombes marcus bean football weekly","story":"Max is joined by Barry Glendenning, Andy Brassell and Wycombe midfielder Marcus Bean to discuss the home nations, Nicklas Bendtner’s latest scrape, Ryan Babel’s return and Adil Rami’s proposal misfireJoin the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

After protests from her solicitor, Merry Varney, the sum was reduced to £324.Inquests in Reading are held in the town council building because there is no dedicated coroner’s court in the area.Dyball said: “It was a huge surprise. It’s disgraceful. What do they expect us to do? Huddle in a public corridor and discuss behind our hands with our lawyers? How can we express our feelings in private?“It’s a shame that the council would rather keep the room empty than let us use it. It’s been a real disappointment and added to the stress. I have had to pay the £324 in advance or else lose the room.”Dyball, who lives in north Norfolk, sought the help of her local MP, Norman Lamb, to obtain legal aid to ensure she was represented at the hearing. The Legal Aid Agency declined to pay for the family room.Varney, a solicitor at the law firm Leigh Day, said: “This is ridiculous for such a charge to be made against a bereaved family who are there through no fault of their own.“The response from the town hall was that it’s a commercial venture and that’s why they have to charge. It is totally unreasonable for a bereaved family member to pay a fee for a facility offered routinely to other bereaved families up and down the country when attending a loved one’s inquest.”Inquest, the organisation that supports relatives at coroners’ courts, condemned the demand. Selen Cavcav, a caseworker, said: “Bereaved families must be at the centre of the inquest process. This cannot be achieved when they are forced to pay for a basic requirement.“When families are expected to sit next to those who may have been involved in the care of their relative, their trauma is only exacerbated. It is essential for the family to have a private space where they can go during distressing periods and to speak to their legal representatives in confidence.”Reading borough council said: “Family rooms are not generally requested at inquests, but where they are there is a standard charge.“We aim to provide a sensitive service for the bereaved and we intend to do everything we can to assist the family to find an area where they can have some privacy during what will no doubt be a very difficult time, but we cannot always guarantee to have rooms routinely available. In this instance the family were given a discretionary discount on the hire of the room.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/944156be841bbb64fb5c1caad4d1da1cb68a490c/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dfaae015e35dd539023281803ba023fc","title":"psychic school montclair what happened","story":"For six months I attempted to temper my skepticism and tap into my ‘goddess roots’, where fantasy and reality are interchangeableMontclair Psychic School sits above a florist’s shop in the town of Rutherford, New Jersey. On a Sunday in June, eight students sit in a yellow painted classroom, watching a mastiff named Axel sniff a bust of the Buddha.“C’mere, Axel,” says a woman whose T-shirt reads: “Medicine heals the body. DOGS heal the soul.” She offers him a treat. “Good boy.”Axel slobbers on her lap, then lopes around the room, sniffing amethyst crystals, a conga drum and a gold Tibetan singing bowl.“Send your heartstrings out,” says Natalie Anderson, a special education teacher who moonlights as an animal communicator. “Connect. Ask Axel: what’s in his world? What does he know? What does he want? Don’t be shy.”Axel drools on the rug as the students try to read his mind.“He’s saying ‘hikes’,” says one woman. “He wants a job, so he feels like he has a purpose. Maybe he can get a backpack, so his job can be carrying water on hikes?”A description of this seven-hour “pet communication” class reads: “You will learn how to send thoughts to your animal companions and trust what you are receiving back. It is only a matter of understanding telepathic communication, the natural mode of communication for all animals AND an inherent ability for all humans!”“Say whatever’s coming to mind,” Natalie instructs. “Give me that spirit vomit.”“He wants a playmate. And some variety in his dog food.”Axel sniffs a rock painted with a butterfly and the word “BELIEVE”. A lava lamp glows on a wooden chest. On the wall, a clock with the words “I SEE DEAD PEOPLE” printed on its face reads 3pm. It’s time for Axel’s afternoon walk.“Bye, Axel!” the students say. “Thanks so much!”Montclair Psychic School was founded by a woman named Lee Van Zyl in 2006 on the premise that every single person has “psychic abilities”. The definition varies depending on whom you ask but here, in addition to animal telepathy, the school offers instruction in angel-channeling, mind-reading, psychometry and communication with spirits of the dead.I first heard the claim that everyone could become psychic – a popular claim among scattered factions of the New Age movement – while working on an assignment in 2015. A Norse rune reader told me I possessed “dark magic” a crystal ball reader told me I was “very psychic” a dominatrix-slash-medium told me I was a latent witch.I didn’t believe any of them aside from going through a Wiccan phase at 11 and having a psilocybin-induced mystical experience on a golf course at 18, I’d never strayed much from a secular worldview. But I was secretly flattered – until I realized that most of these psychics’ clients probably got similar evaluations.According to them, most people just aren’t aware of their innate paranormal abilities.I wanted to know what would happen if I took these psychic evangelists at their word. Maybe the Norse rune reader was right, and my mind was infinitely more powerful than I’d ever fathomed. Or, as most of my friends insisted after learning of this project, maybe all psychics are charlatans.So from January to June of 2018, when I wasn’t at my job as a factchecker, I listened to the podcast Everyone is Psychic read books like Your Psychic Soul and You Are Psychic! and attended “psychic development” classes promising students they would speak with the dead, see the future, or know for certain what’s inside others’ minds.On a freezing Tuesday in January, I attend a class called Herbs for Dreamwork and Opening Psychic Abilities at Catland, an occult bookshop in Brooklyn which gained minor notoriety in 2017 for organizing a ceremony to “hex” US president Donald Trump.In a black-walled room lit by a single bulb, 17 students sit before Rebecca Fey, an aerialist acrobat and tarot reader wearing skull-printed tights and feather earrings. She’s listing herbs with purported mystical benefits. Mugwort, she says, is great for opening your Third Eye wormwood helps induce visions cinnamon raises vibrational frequencies catnip attracts good spirits wild lettuce can be smoked – Hopi Indians used it to induce trance states.Students scribble notes as Fey explains how to rub herbs into a mirror to practice a form of ination called “scrying”.“Does it have to be so dark in here?” one student asks.“How do you spell ‘scry’?” asks another.In the US, skeptics about psychic phenomena outnumber believers, but not by much. Polls tend to show that around one-third to one-half of Americans believe in phenomena such as telepathy and precognition. These beliefs fuel a $2bn psychic services industry that has been growing steadily since the 2008 recession.When I ask which herbs are best for beginners, Fey says: “You seem like a mugwort person. Burn mugwort to hone your intuition. Stare into a candle flame. Ask what it wants you to know.”After class, students mill around the shop, sniffing bundles of juniper, inspecting ankh pendants and penis-shaped candles. I buy an ounce of mugwort for $3. One woman spends $93.73 on pre-packaged “spiritual bath herb mixes”.Later, I show a friend my new mugwort stash. “I don’t think you’d handle seeing the future very well,” she says. Still, when I get home I burn mugwort in a shot glass and stare into a candle flame, silently asking what it wants me to know. The candle doesn’t answer. The mugwort smells like crappy marijuana, but nothing happens when I inhale its smoke.This is disappointing, though Fey had fairly warned me: “What you’re gonna experience isn’t like on TV, where you touch someone and suddenly see their whole life story. Don’t think of it as, like, zero to 10.”The next morning, I go to my factchecking job. Factcheckers are supposed to ensure the accuracy of every grain of information in a given article. Under a president who makes an average of 6.5 false or misleading claims a day, the often tedious business of factchecking has taken on new urgency.While factchecking in February, I confirm that a pair of cat-shaped Gucci earrings costs $2,390 that an average of 31 American women die from opioids every day that 17 people were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school on Valentine’s Day and that the Milky Way galaxy has a supermassive black hole at its heart.At work, the tyranny of facts feels inescapable.“If it’s coming from spirit, then it’s true,” says Melissa Waite Stamps, a self-described clairvoyant medium who has Morticia Addams hair. “This world is totally nonlinear. It’s a different universe. It’s like being in a dream state.”At age 11, Melissa was inducted as a priestess by her Irish nanny into the Pagan “path of goddess mysteries” without the knowledge of her Upper East Side socialite mother. Now she runs a weekly psychic development Meetup group.On a Monday evening, in a cramped, windowless room near the Empire State Building, Melissa tells six students about how spirits might convey information to channelers: through dreams, goosebumps, flashing lights, radios randomly turning on and off.Then she guides the group on a meditative trip.“Journey now to non-ordinary reality,” Melissa lilts over a recording of singing bowls playing from an iPhone. “Allow your spirit guide to lead you to places where you find the missing parts of yourself. Crystal caves, star systems, universe below the ocean. Travel beyond time and human experience.”After five minutes, we describe our journeys to “non-ordinary reality”.A PR professional flew through the skies with her recently deceased pet monk parrot. A tired-looking nurse met a shepherd in Biblical Jerusalem who revealed her unlimited potential. A wellness blogger drank from a Thermos full of light. I swam in a grotto with Glinda the Good Witch.When each person speaks, the students say: Wow. Amazing. Beautiful.“I used to differentiate between imagination and reality, but now, it’s all real to me,” says Siréne, an artist from Tokyo. Siréne is “learning to speak dolphin”, because, in a past life, he was a “giant bipedal dolphinoid, with tiny little humans as pets”. He misses that life and, when he’s not painting pictures of winged muscle-gods, often returns to it during meditations.In her book Your Psychic Soul, Judith Pennington explains how you know if a past-life memory is true: “Deep inside, you will feel whether it is true or not. But in the end, it doesn’t really matter. What is real in the mind is what is real in your present life.”From this perspective, the question of what is objectively true becomes irrelevant fantasy and reality are interchangeable.Next, Melissa has us pair up to practice “aura reading”.“Using your clairvoyance, give your partner a message from spirit based on the colors you read in their aura,” Melissa tells the Meetup group.I sit across from the PR professional grieving her parrot. She gazes at me, takes deep breaths, and says she sees “a crown of green and white light, like the Statue of Liberty’s”, emanating from my head: “It’s very clear.”I stare back and see no colors surrounding the woman, save an orange glow from a lamp on her black hair. I wonder if she really sees a gleaming crown on my head. I find myself doubting it – I don’t feel any crown of light I have a headache – but, ultimately, I have no way of knowing what she sees or doesn’t see. Psychic lessons aren’t working on me, and I can’t telepathically inhabit her mind to discover if she’s telling the truth.When Melissa checks in with me and my partner, I tell her that if I were to claim I saw glowing colors, I’d feel guilty of making stuff up.“Everyone feels like they’re making it up at first,” Melissa tells me. “Make it up.”When I squeeze my eyes shut, greenish floaters appear.“I guess I’m getting a green vibe,” I tell my partner, “but maybe that’s because you’d look good in green.”“What do you think it means?” Melissa says.“Maybe it would help you to spend time in a green space,” I try. “Like a park?”“My bird was green,” my partner says.“There you go!” says Melissa.“I didn’t know parrots lived there,” my partner says.The notion that every human can develop supernatural abilities has captivated Americans for centuries. It wasn’t just the counterculture that was seduced: the government bought it, too.In recent years, belief in mediumship has gained prominence in pop culture. Oprah Winfrey, Dr Phil and the Real Housewives all feature mediums on their TV shows. Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow’s $250m lifestyle juggernaut, promotes mediums – as well as animal communicators and “Psychic Vampire Repellent” – on its heavily-trafficked website. At the brand’s recent In Goop Health conference, a medium claimed that “death does not exist”.In March, I attend Montclair Psychic School’s nine-hour Unfoldment Into Mediumship class. A course description claims that, by the end of this workshop, students “will have conducted spirit contact with proof of life”.When I arrive, Lee sits puffing on an e-cigarette before one man and five women, all middle-aged. Wearing sweatshirts and mom jeans, they look more like a focus group on suburban Costco shoppers than a circle of aspiring necromancers.“We are here to prove the soul survives,” Lee says. A dark-haired ex-lawyer from Cape Town, she calls her students “darling” as she explains how, in order to channel spirits, “we must learn to quiet our analytical left-brain voice”.“I gave that nagging, critical voice a name,” Lee says. “I call her Frankie.”Throughout class, Lee refers disparagingly to “Frankie Talk”, personifying the voice of rational thought, which, she explains, should be silenced whenever possible.“Frankie” interferes with trust in the “five clairs”, which are like supercharged versions of the five senses. The best known is clairvoyance, which makes symbols and images appear on a screen behind your forehead. There’s also clairaudience, clairsentience, clairalience and clairgustance.As an example of how clairgustance, the “gift of clear taste”, works, Lee says: “You might be sitting with someone and taste bitter lemon. Why? Well, maybe the person likes lemon, but maybe they’re feeling bitter.”Next, Lee guides us through an exercise that’s like speed dating, but with ghosts.“Close your eyes and project yourself into the corner of the room,” she says. “There are spirit people over there. Go introduce yourself. Ask: ‘What was your life like? How did you die?’ Be friendly. Some might be shy.”I close my eyes and try to summon spirit people.“Hi, guys. How did you die?” I mentally whisper. No one responds.Lee suggests icebreakers: “Ask spirit people who are somehow connected to water to introduce themselves. Maybe you’ll meet a surfer, a fireman holding a hose, farmers watering their lands.”I wait for dead surfers and firemen and farmers to appear. Nothing happens.“Now spirit people are gonna tell you how they experienced illnesses,” Lee says. She suggests summoning spirits who died of emphysema, tuberculosis, heart attacks, Alzheimer’s or sugar diabetes. “‘Frankie Brain’ might say: ‘Oh, shit, I’m not getting anything.’ Make it happen.”I picture clusters of ghosts floating by the water cooler, showing me their ruptured aortas and emphysemic lungs.When we return to the mortal realm, Lee asks: “How’d that go?”One student expresses doubt that the spirit people she met were more than figments: “I don’t know – is it just in my mind, or is it really real?”Another student brags about her spirit world networking skills.“I met a skier named Bernie,” she says. “And a pale woman, in a white gown, who was ‘desperate for company’, and a poor little peasant boy.”“The thing about this work is you start to dislike living people,” she says. “It’s much more fun to talk to dead people.”After weeks spent googling terms like “animal telepathy”, targeted advertisements pop up in my Facebook feed soliciting me to participate in a research study about the early signs of psychosis.“BELIEVING OR HEARING THINGS THAT OTHERS DO NOT?” the ads ask. “LOSING CONTROL OF YOUR THOUGHTS?”In the mediumship class, students nod when Lee describes how, as a shy, bullied teenager, she heard voices that others didn’t. “I thought I was schizo,” she says. “I saw the movie Sybil and thought: ‘Oh god, they’re gonna lock me up, because I’m worse than her.’”It wasn’t until she started attending séances with her father, also a medium, that she came to believe she was hearing spirit people.Eventually, these voices “just shut off”, and she became a lawyer. But after noticing that her two-year-old daughter “seemed to be talking to spirits” in 2006, Lee quit her job and founded Montclair Psychic School.When she came out, in middle age, as gay, Lee’s family cut off contact with her. “My living family were no longer speaking to me,” she says, “but the dead were. I still felt like I had family who loved me, because the dead became living and the living became dead.”During my classes, I witness many total strangers cry and talk about loss. In the animal telepathy workshop, a nurse breaks down, saying: “I’m lonely. Everybody I’ve loved has been taken away. My father, my two children, my three dogs. Every time I see the light, it’s like, boom. Gone.”In Melissa’s aura reading class, a wellness blogger moves her hands around in the air like she’s miming washing windows, because, she explains, she’s been “going through a spiritual kundalini awakening” since her father died in 2017.In the mediumship class, a woman in a floral blouse weeps as Lee claims to be channeling the spirit of her son, who died of a drug overdose. “When I feel him all around me, is that him?” the woman asks. “Yes,” Lee says. “He’s saying: ‘You’re my best friend.’”Siréne, the artist from Tokyo, tells me that, for years, he was depressed and suicidal: “I felt like a sponge, absorbing everyone’s feelings, cursed with empathy.” Now in psychic school, where teachers often frame mental illnesses as signs of undeveloped mystical gifts, he feels “more at home”. He’s focusing on “psychopomp work” – the guiding of newly dead souls into the afterlife. After a close friend from childhood killed herself, he says he shepherded her spirit toward a portal in the sun: “You imagine they have wings. Tell them: ‘There’s a better place than here. Fly toward the sunlight.’”As homework for his yearlong psychic certification course at the Edgar Cayce Association for Research and Enlightenment, Siréne has to give 10 readings to strangers. I offer to be his guinea pig. We sit near a sculpture called Durga Killing the Buffalo Demon at the Rubin Museum of Art.Siréne closes his eyes. For three minutes, his eyelids twitch crazily, his mouth agape, like he’s possessed. Then he draws what he saw during his “REM trance”: a Scandinavian man he claims I’ll meet while hiking in France. With swishy blond hair, a tiny chin and a giant neck, the man in the sketch looks like a Disney cherub on steroids. We will have three children, Siréne says, and our family will be like “a harmonious dolphin pod”.Siréne’s yearlong course costs $2,700. I ask if he plans to charge money for his readings. He says no. “If I did, I’d feel like I should be paying the spirits. I don’t think these messages are coming from me. I’m like a telephone.”Stories of self-proclaimed psychics conning clients out of vast sums are legion. Recently, there was the Times Square fortune teller found guilty of grand larceny after bilking a recovering addict of $550,000, having promised to revive his lost love using a time machine and a golden bridge. But this industry rife with scammers attracts plenty of true believers, like Siréne, whose motives seem entirely immaterial.“We’re led to believe we’re just this physical body,” Siréne says. “Right now, I happen to be Asian with black hair. But in reality, we’re everything. We can be a dolphin, an extraterrestrial, a reptilian, an insect. I was a dwarf in the 17th century. The psychic thing lets you know the truth, not just the material self.”Skeptics often call mediums “grief vampires”. They argue that any comfort derived from paranormal belief is false, and comes at a grave cost. Some warn of the potential political ramifications of such belief.In an age of total epistemic confusion, the mainstreaming of parapsychology and related New Age practices seems to run parallel to other anti-scientific trends: climate change denial, the anti-vaxxer movement, conspiracy theories from PizzaGate to QAnon. A recent study found the espousal of conspiracy theories, pseudoscience and belief in the paranormal turn out to be highly correlated with one another.After six months, I drop out of psychic school. I don’t have the patience to stare into a candle flame for 15 minutes a day, and my mugwort stash has been sitting untouched in my underwear drawer for weeks. Since the animal telepathy class, I often try to read the mind of my roommate’s cat, but all I ever gather is that she wants food.Over the phone, I thank Melissa for her teachings.“I hope you find your way back to your goddess roots,” she says.I think I detect a note of pity or motherly concern in her voice, like she’s looking down from the astral plane, feeling sorry that I haven’t found my way back to my goddess roots. But I might just be projecting.I’m not sure. I can’t read her mind.Illustrations by Gabriel Alcala"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de764db5af28bc0d15e9edbdc1a7a0b27ee6d821/448_1143_4229_2537/master/4229.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ac7d2d860c5712b8aa6e4b157e8f4da","title":"russian trolls tweets cited in more than 100 uk news articles","story":"Posts from accounts identified in June add to those previously spotted in British mediaUK news organisations have cited tweets from Russian trolls more than 100 times, a  investigation has found, in stories about topics including Donald Trump, Donald Glover and Lena Dunham.In June the US Congress released details of 1,000 accounts that Twitter believes were run by the Internet Research Agency (IRA), a state-backed misinformation operation based in St Petersburg, adding to more than 2,000 accounts the company had already identified.The accounts were cited in news stories by the British press more than 20 times. Adding to the 80 citations the  uncovered in November 2017, Russian propaganda ended up being published by the British press more than 100 times.One account, @KaniJJackson, posed as a Black Lives Matter activist and tweeted under the names “Kanisha J” and “Remove Trump Now”, with a profile picture of Michelle Obama.That account was cited nine times by publications, including by the Daily Mail in a story about an American football game attended by Trump, by BuzzFeed in an article about Childish Gambino’s song This Is America, and the  in a piece about Hillary Clinton at the Grammys.Another Russian-run account, @wokeluisa, was embedded five times, including in stories published by the , the  and the BBC.  and the BBC have since removed the embedded tweet and acknowledged that the account is believed to be fake.Other publications that sourced material from Russian troll accounts include the Mirror, which used a picture tweeted by the IRA-run account NovostiSPb to lead its coverage of a terror attack in St Petersburg, and the .While most of the accounts removed by Twitter were tweeting in English and explicitly attempting to influence American politics, some were posting in Russian and apparently not targeting the English-language media at all.A BuzzFeed story in 2015 about Russian sanctions banning the import of European cheese embedded two tweets from Russian-language Twitter accounts now thought to be run by the Internet Research Agency.Perhaps strangest of all was the Russian troll who posted a picture of Helsinki with the caption in Russian: “You can’t but love this city. #Moscow.” The apparent error started a meme on Russian Twitter, with users jokingly mislabelling other pictures, which was reported on by the BBC.Whether the initial post, by the Moscow Herald account, was a deliberate troll or a genuine mistake remains unclear.The discovery of another 20 instances of Russian trolls infiltrating British media reports shines more light on the IRA’s success in using humour to influence the discussion of topical news in the mainstream media.While it was rare that the fake accounts were cited as credible by news organisations, their presence in roundups of supposedly grassroots reaction to news events could have altered the perception of how popular the views they supposedly espoused actually were.According to researchers at America’s Rand Corporation, Russia focuses on producing “high-volume, multichannel” propaganda in order to drown out competing messages while ensuring that audience members are likely to identify with the source.“All other things being equal, messages received in greater volume and from more sources will be more persuasive,” the researchers noted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cb42c2592fd3dbc5c5fbc1f9af8e102047dec93/100_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026usm=12\u0026fit=crop\u0026crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026bm=normal\u0026ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly9hc3NldHMuZ3VpbS5jby51ay9pbWFnZXMvb3ZlcmxheXMvZDM1ODZhNWVmNTc4MTc1NmQyMWEzYjYzNWU1MTcxNDEvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=aae05f272f82a7871480a9cb8da73714","title":"migration how many people are on the move around the world","story":"The mass movement of people is arguably the biggest story of our time. How do we define the different types of migrant, how many are there and is the current crisis really an unprecedented problem?These are loaded words because they often suggest a backstory or motive that may be inaccurate.According to the 1951 United Nations refugee convention, the difference between refugees and asylum seekers is clear. An asylum seeker has left their country and is seeking protection from persecution. A refugee has already received such protection.Refugees have the right to international protection while seeking asylum is a human right, which means everyone should be allowed to enter another country to seek asylum. Internally displaced people (IDPs) are essentially on the run in their own country: putative refugees who have not been able or willing to cross an international border.When it comes to migrants, definitions are far woollier. Some presume a migrant is on the move to seek a better life. But if that person is leaving the penury and starvation of a dustbowl farm in the Sahel in order to survive,, are they a migrant or a refugee?The International Organization for Migration (IOM) therefore defines a migrant as any person who is moving or has moved across an international border or within a state regardless of legal status, whether the movement is voluntary or involuntary, what the causes for the movement are, and what the length of the stay is.Expatriate is a weakly defined term that essentially means anyone living outside their native country. In practice, expat has come to mean a migrant from a rich country.We are now witnessing the highest levels of displacement on record. About 258 million people, or one in every 30, were living outside their country of birth in 2017.That is both a record high – there were 173 million in 2000 – and an alarmingly volatile figure: a 2003 projection anticipated that by 2050, there would be up to 230 million international migrants. The latest revised projection is that there will be 405 million international migrants by 2050.Even those figures, however, fail to capture the full reality. There were 25.9 million refugees and asylum seekers in mid-2017. But registered refugees represent only a fraction of all those forced to leave their homes for reasons ning from war to environmental crisis. In total, at least 66 million people globally are experiencing forced displacement – approximately 40.3 million of whom are IDPs.As for expats, estimates vary wildly, depending on definition. The state department reckons 9 million Americans live overseas. About 5 million Britons are thought to do so.Finally, there are 10 million people who are stateless, with no citizenship at all.According to the IOM, the US, Germany, Russia, Saudi Arabia and the UK were the top five destinations for migrants in 2015. The US has about 46 million foreign-born residents, Germany about 12 million.India, Mexico, Russia, China and Bangladesh were the top five origin countries. Nearly half of all international migrants came from Asia, although it is still far more common for Asians and Africans to move within their own continent than to settle further afield.Later in 2017, however, the new president, Donald Trump, slashed the cap to 45,000. According to the International Rescue Committee, the US will only resettle 21,292 refugees in the current fiscal year.By contrast, some of the world’s poorer and often less stable countries – such as Jordan, Lebanon, Pakistan and Uganda – are now the long-term hosts to the world’s largest populations of refugees.Turkey is currently the leading host of refugees, with 3.5 million, followed by Uganda and Pakistan, which both host about 1.4 million, according to UNHCR, the UN refugee agency.But many refugees slip through the gaps when attempts at record-keeping take place. For example, official figures usually exclude Palestinian refugees because they don’t fall into the specific mandate of UN refugees. A separate agreement was reached on their behalf when the 1951 refugee convention was drawn up, specifically to try to avoid what has nevertheless come to pass: a permanent acceptance of their displacement. The number of Palestinian refugees varies depending on the source but there are reckoned to be between 5.3 million and 6.5 million – around one in three of all refugees worldwide. The US last month announced it was cutting all funding to the main Palestinian refugee programme.Not only are the numbers of refugees and migrants underestimated but so too is the chronic length of time refugees remain displaced in camps and so-called “temporary” situations.There are still Palestinian refugees forced from their country in 1948 living in camps in Syria, Eritrean and Ethiopian refugees who have been living in camps in Sudan since the mid-1960s, Afghan refugees who have been in camps in Pakistan since the Soviet invasion in 1979. The list goes on.Moreover, many of the countries from which large numbers of people are forced to flee conflict – such as Syria, South Sudan, Iraq and Yemen – are also host to very large internally displaced populations.“But that scale of movement doesn’t match the move from South Sudan to Uganda less than a year later and doesn’t far exceed what has even more recently happened across MyanmarBangladesh border, or in Venezuela where large numbers of people are moving to Ecuador, Peru, Colombia and other countries in that region.”Migration is arguably politically less acceptable than at any point since the end of the second world war. The anti-immigration response of governments across Europe, and in American and Australia has sent quite clear signs to some of those frontline countries that they can build walls and force back those seeking safe havens.“The last few years have seen quite threatening movements by countries that had offered refugees a relative degree of safety,” said Valdez-Symonds. “Of Kenya towards its refugee Somali populations, for example, and of Pakistan towards its Afghan refugees.”There is an additional complication involving those fleeing environmental disasters, such as flooding or desertification. The 1951 convention doesn’t define these people as refugees but, as Bill Frelick, Human Rights Watch’s refugee rights programme director, says: “If someone’s life is in danger, it really shouldn’t matter if it’s because of a gun or a landslide or earthquake.”Are any countries holding their heads up in this maelstrom? Sadly, experts say not. “I don’t know that anyone has it right,” said Valdez-Symonds. “Canada has a very large and, in many ways, a very good resettlement programme for refugees. But for those who seek asylum across Canada’s borders, its response to those people is not all that good: it has major issues of long-term use of detention centres for those crossing its borders.”Frelick said: “I don’t know of any country I can point to and say: ‘This place has got it right.’ You can say some aspects are far better than other places. The UK can probably still hold itself up as a comparatively better place for resettlement than many others. But our response to asylum seekers is not especially healthy and our response has generally deteriorated over time.”Political and public hostility to migration has resulted in a dramatic reduction in legal routes to migration in the past 20 years. This has encouraged a burgeoning business in illegal people trafficking, now reckoned to be worth more than $150bn each year.Principal areas of activity are from south to north in the Americas (there are an estimated 3m illegal entries into the US each year, according to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime) from Africa and the Middle East into Europe and from south Asia west to the Gulf and Europe beyond.Death is common. According to the IOM’s missing migrants project, almost 30,000 people have died in transit over the past five years, with the Mediterranean, north Africa and central America particularly deadly. The UN is to formally agree a new global compact on migration in Marrakech this December, following 18 months of negotiations. Protagonists say the deal promises a better, more coordinated approach to migration, though efforts have been damaged by the US pulling out of the talks halfway through.Exit West by Mohsin Hamid (fiction)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6badaa7a2446bff3cec73ccaa206b236a3b6d091/0_303_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa3b48860a033a917a28ac7a9e24a6f2","title":"brexit countdown five possible outcomes 200 days to go","story":"From the Chequers plan to a fresh vote, we look at the UK’s options as departure day nearsThere are perhaps few better gauges than this of the confusion still surrounding Brexit: with just 200 days to go before the official departure date, five possible plans are still being touted by MPs, and it is hard to argue that any of them could command a safe majority in the Commons. This is what they propose:The idea as pushed through the cabinet by Theresa May, and still the only comprehensive scheme. The UK’s departure from the single market and customs union would be offset by a pledge for continued EU regulatory alignment, particularly on goods. It is hated by Brexiters, who say it will derail plans for new trade deals, and mistrusted by remainers who argue the customs plan is unworkable.Chances of success: a tough call. The leading Eurosceptic Steve Baker says 80 Tory MPs would oppose it, and Labour is still not convinced.So named as it would be modelled on the Canadian deal with the EU, this would be a fairly straightforward free trade deal, with some add-ons. What these would be remains to be seen – the European Research Group, which represents hard Brexit-minded Tory MPs, has yet to publish its promised plan. Leaks of it show proposals for widespread tax cuts as a “Brexit bonus”, but little in the way of a workable plan for the Irish border. Business groups say it could wreak havoc on supply chains.Chances of success: slim. Many remainer Tory MPs would seem set to oppose it, as would Labour. Brexiters hope it could pass as the only viable option to no deal.A default to World Trade Organization rules for international commerce would form the basis of this plan, the proponents hoping it would include arrangements with the EU on areas such as aviation and medicine. The preserve of Brexit true believers, most notably Jacob Rees-Mogg, who on Tuesday will reiterate his long-held argument that the UK economy would thrive under a WTO regime. He is backed in this by the veteran free market economist Patrick Minford – but not by many others.Chances of success: as a positive choice by MPs, pretty much zero. Only seems possible as a cliff-edge departure if a deal falls apart at the last moment.The softest of Brexits, which would see the UK out of the EU but still tied to many of its mechanisms via membership of the European Economic Area, the semi-detached model used by Norway. Much talked about during the EU referendum, the Norway model has suffered from the narrative pursued by Brexiters, who argue it would amount to a betrayal of the vote. On Monday, the former education secretary and Tory remainer Nicky Morgan said she believed it had majority support in the Commons. There is, however, one problem: Labour has officially ruled it out.Chances of success: if it was down to the inidual beliefs of MPs, probably quite high. But unless there is a major revolt against Jeremy Corbyn’s Brexit policy, it seems doomed.The option that gives Liberal Democrats and other ardent remainers a giddy feeling. Couched by supporters as a “people’s vote” on any final deal, rather than a re-run of June 2016, this proposes giving voters the choice of accepting a final agreement, or staying in the EU. Proponents have a strong argument that so much has changed since the original referendum that another vote is only logical opponents say it is a sneaky tactic by bad losers. It has the support of an increasing number of backbench MPs, plus interest is growing among unions.Chances of success: not great, but worth remembering that Corbyn has yet to definitively rule out backing another vote."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c42b58b9bc9e89df090892345ff5d1049b55e9dc/0_73_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea3817b69e5bae51ca05f9fc3554aa40","title":"swing voters say labour is the party of quinoa","story":"Participants repeatedly mentioned the fancy grain when asked what food it best representedLabour has evolved from being the party of casseroles and bingo to the party of quinoa and student protests, according to research with swing voters in marginal constituencies.Political analysts from the consultancy firm Britain Thinks carried out a pair of focus groups with swing voters from two marginal constituencies, Crewe and Thurrock and, separately, polled 2,000 people nationwide.Participants in the focus groups, which in Crewe were 18-44 year olds, and in Thurrock, older voters, repeatedly mentioned the fancy grain quinoa when asked what food best represented the Labour party of 2018.The Britain Thinks director, Deborah Mattinson, said there had been a consistent message from many of the voters they interviewed.“It was so striking that what people said to us was: Labour used to be working class, it used to be a pie and a pint – it’s now a protesting student. It used to be someone playing the bingo now it’s someone going on a demo,” she said.The much larger-scale polling, carried out last week, underlined those perceptions and sounded a warning that taking a definitive position on Brexit could hurt Labour’s standing.A typical comment from one participant in Crewe was “I think they’re trying to appeal to literally anyone now”.Mattinson said despite their small scale, the focus groups were helpful in understanding voters’ perceptions. “These qualitative workshops with carefully selected swing voters in target seats give us a unique insight into the views that lie behind the numbers. We used extended sessions so we could really understand the emotions that are driving voter behaviour.” Labour, with a mass membership of more than half a million, a sharp social media presence and campaigns on issues from student debt to the ivory trade, has made a pitch for younger voters that culminated in Corbyn being hailed by the crowds at Glastonbury.But party strategists are acutely conscious of the risk of leaving Labour’s traditional base behind. Corbyn’s focus on Britain’s crumbling bus services at prime minister’s questions before the summer break, as well as a “Build it in Britain” campaign, were aimed at winning back some of those voters.The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has also begun a tour of marginal seats, many of them in what might once have been seen as Labour heartlands areas, to listen to what voters have to say about the problems with the economy.The Conservatives, by contrast, were seen overwhelmingly by the focus group participants as the party of “high earners”, and “traditional conservative voters”. Neither party was much trusted, and both were viewed, not surprisingly, as ided but twice as many voters thought Labour was “in touch with ordinary people” as the Tories.On Brexit, the polling suggested that adopting a firmer policy position could undermine political support for the party by alienating one group of voters or another.The Labour frontbench has come under intense pressure to harden its opposition to Britain leaving the European Union or to back a second referendum.The research was aimed at analysing what both political parties could do to tackle the “Brexit deadlock”, at Westminster and in the country.With under 200 days to go until Britain was due to leave the EU, it was unclear whether the prime minister’s Brexit deal could win the backing of MPs – and even less clear what would happen if they rejected it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/713e5c84441ca76ba6ef223ed053166539656d69/0_0_2033_1220/master/2033.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d0796b56e0308d76a9941f5c2360f31","title":"uk parliamentary boundary changes final plans unveiled","story":"Labour calls government plans to reduce size of Commons undemocraticThe government has laid out its final plans for redrawing House of Commons constituency boundaries under a new system that probably would have turned the hung parliament of the 2017 election into a safe Conservative majority, prompting claims from Labour of an “undemocratic power grab”.The plans from the separate boundary commissions for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are the product of long and complex consultations that began in 2016 leading up to Monday’s publication.Under the proposals, the number of Commons seats would be reduced from 650 to 600 and the maps of many constituencies redrawn in an attempt to even up population levels.But as anger mounted on Monday among backbench Tory MPs whose seats would be at risk, there were suggestions that Theresa May would set the changes aside until next year.Despite the broader advantage to the Conservatives, prominent pro-Brexit MPs including Boris Johnson and David Davis could find their seats under threat from the changes, which has led to fears that the vote could become another flashpoint in the party’s damaging split.With the prime minister’s spokesman refusing to commit to a vote on the changes before Christmas, Chloe Smith, the minister for the constitution, said that drawing up the necessary plans would be a “complex and lengthy” process that would take “months to prepare”.Among the changes confirmed are the disappearance of Jeremy Corbyn’s Islington North seat, which would be absorbed into a new area taking in part of the current constituency of Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary. The constituency of Haltemprice and Howden, represented by Davis, the former Brexit secretary, would also vanish.The former foreign secretary Boris Johnson could face a tough battle to keep his Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency, where he has a 5,000 majority, with a Conservative-leaning district to be replaced by a strongly Labour area.The number of English seats would be reduced from 533 to 510, Scotland’s count would fall from 59 to 53, Wales would drop from 40 to 29 and Northern Ireland would lose one of its 19 seats.In a written statement to parliament, the Cabinet Office minister, David Lidington, welcomed the final reports, saying the changes had been made in an “independent and impartial” way. He said adoption of the changes would need the approval of the Commons and Lords, and he gave no details of when this would happen.Labour has condemned the plans as short-sighted, given the need to scrutinise Brexit, and pointed out that studies indicate the new system would have favoured the Conservatives in last year’s election.One study by Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher, academics at the University of Plymouth, calculated that the new boundaries would have given the Conservatives an overall majority of 16 in last year’s election. The Tories would have taken 10 fewer seats than they did and Labour 30 fewer.The shadow Cabinet Office minister Cat Smith said the final recommendations amounted to “an undemocratic power grab”. “With no plans to reduce the number of ministers, the government is weakening the role of parliament and creating unprecedented levels of executive dominance at the expense of backbenchers, when parliament is meant to be taking back control,” she said.“Cutting the number of MPs by 50 as we prepare to leave the European Union is further proof this government is clamouring to tighten its grip on power. With the workload of MPs set to rise after Brexit, with thousands of pieces of important legislation expected to come through parliament, it would be utterly ludicrous to go ahead with these boundary changes.”The Boundary Commission for England said its final report took account of more than 35,000 comments from the public. Sam Hartley, the secretary to the commission, said: “We’re confident that the map we propose today is the best match of the legal rules parliament has set us. It’s now up to parliament to decide whether these boundaries will be used at the next general election.”With Labour fiercely opposing the idea, and some Conservatives possibly rebelling, it is by no means certain the proposed system will be put into effect.The society said changes to equalise constituencies were tinkering when the first-past-the-post electoral system meant the number of votes per MP elected in 2017 varied from just under 28,000 for the Democratic Unionist party to more than 500,000 for the Green party.The review was ordered in 2011 under David Cameron’s government with the stated aim of reducing by 50 the number of Commons seats and creating constituencies of roughly equal populations. They currently vary in England from about 55,000 to 95,000 voters."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/faa313674b5133b64f1ffa2230ac5c494b30ea50/0_208_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33013aae334c291c120b9f4452662e3c","title":"union leaders are definitely not calling for a second vote on brexit","story":"Only in the unlikely event May fails to let Corbyn into power should there be a people’s voteThe key to running any successful conference is to ensure most arguments are kept behind closed doors and that any public debate is sufficiently vaguely worded to achieve consensus amid widespread disagreement. And few do it better than the Trades Union Congress. Proof that the years spent sitting at negotiating tables have not been misspent came in a whistle-stop tour of Brexit on Monday afternoon.The session got under way with a general council statement from Steve Turner, of Unite. After what became the obligatory open-goal jibe at Boris Johnson’s expense, Turner started dancing on the head of a needle. He definitely wasn’t calling for a second vote. Because that would be undemocratic.What he wanted was for the government to come to the right decision over Brexit – a near impossibility given the TUC is firmly opposed both to Theresa May’s Chequers proposals and a no-deal departure. But if this didn’t happen, he wanted the Tories to call a general election that Jeremy Corbyn should be allowed to win. And if for some reason this didn’t happen, the workers should “rise like lions” and demand a people’s vote. Because that would be democratic.“This is not a call for a second referendum,” Turner insisted, clearly horrified that anyone might think it was. Though it sounded suspiciously like one. What he wanted was a people’s vote that would pave the way for a general election that Corbyn should be allowed to win. And if, in the process, the people happened to come to the conclusion that they didn’t like any of the Brexit deals on offer and wanted something else entirely – ruling nothing in or out – then so be it.Len McCluskey, the general secretary of Unite, was up next and he too was keen to protect workers from the haplessness of the government’s Brexit negotiations. Something everyone could agree on. His solution was also for the government to call a general election that Corbyn should be allowed to win. Because then Corbyn could go back to Brussels and have “honest and friendly talks with the EU” to secure a win-win deal for both sides.The Labour leader’s lack of enthusiasm for the EU appears to have escaped McCluskey. In this parallel universe, Corbyn has become a converted Europhile and he and Michel Barnier would raise a glass to their shared love of the single market and the customs union. And only in the vanishingly improbable scenario that May declined to call a general election that Jeremy should be allowed to win so that he and Michel could shoot the breeze over a couple of bevvies should there be a people’s vote on the final deal.Almost all the other speakers were pretty much of the same voice. David Ward, of the Communications Workers Union, argued that he was not yet a champion of the people’s vote but that, if Corbyn was not elected prime minister, then a people’s vote was the only way to unite both remainers and Brexiters. Solidarity is the watchword of the TUC, so no one batted an eyelid at that, even though there wasn’t a person in the conference hall in Manchester who thought there was a cat in hell’s chance of either side ever coming together. The first referendum had seen to that.The one dissenting voice came from Mick Cash, of the RMT, who reckoned that the TUC’s demands to stay in the single market were tantamount to remaining in the EU. Even though Norway and Iceland managed to be in the single market without being in the EU. But the single market wasn’t Cash’s main objection. His real gripe was that it was Chris Leslie, Chuka Umunna, Peter Mandelson and Tony Blair who were demanding a people’s vote. And as they were all against Corbyn, it clearly followed that a people’s vote was a Tory plot to oust the Tories. Far better to have a no-deal Brexit and bankrupt the country than that. The real enemy wasn’t the Tories, it was the Labour moderates.This forced Mark Serwotka, of the PCS, to say that as much as he too hated Chuka – no one wanted a Corbyn government more than him – it was also possible to be on the same side as Chuka in regard to a people’s vote without being on the same side as Chuka. The rest of the TUC agreed wholeheartedly with this sentiment and voted overwhelmingly to back a people’s vote.

The hole is in a section that will not be used for the return journey to Earth.Prokopyev’s video prompted grateful comments on his social media page, with one writing: “You are doing really well. Yes, people did worry too much.” Others joked about the incident: “Next time try drilling holes when you’re sober.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6af15f190aaffc409c7b47a3230e6f7cecd9a83/0_157_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c38f066746f2da254c25d9fda70f0283","title":"british women live shorter lives than most other europeans","story":"Spanish women live the longest, with UK longevity ranked 17th out of 28 EU nations, according to Public Health England’s annual health profileWomen in the UK are living shorter lives on average than most of their counterparts in Europe, according to an analysis by Public Health England.Spanish women have the highest life expectancy in Europe at birth, at 86.3 years in 2016. The average for the UK is 83, taking 17th place out of 28 EU nations. Men in the UK do better, in 10th place and with above-average life expectancy of 79.4, but men in Italy, the leading nation, can expect to live to 81.The data, from Eurostat, is for the UK as a whole rather than its constituent countries, but is being published by PHE as part of its annual Health Profile for England. Data from the Global Burden of Disease study on premature death shows a similar picture.“We are in the middle of the pack and we would like to be at the top. There is no reason why we shouldn’t be as healthy as anywhere in Europe,” said Prof John Newton, director of health improvement at PHE.“It is certainly of concern that we have worse outcomes than other European countries,” he added. “We tend to do badly in men with respiratory disease and in women with cancer, especially breast cancer. It is a sign of the numbers developing disease.”Many of the causes of chronic, long-term diseases in the UK which shorten lives are preventable. Obesity is causing a big surge in the numbers of people developing type 2 diabetes. The report shows the numbers with diabetes are expected to rise swiftly, from just under four million last year to nearly five million in 2035. Along with alcohol, obesity is also one of the factors behind the rise in breast cancer. Apart from the human cost, the bill for the NHS will be huge.Most of the strategies to reduce obesity are aimed at children. “In many ways it is easier to intervene,” said Newton. “We have a duty of care for children. But it is equally important that adults are enabled to eat a better diet.”There is strong policy support for childhood obesity programmes, he said, such as the sugary drinks tax, curbs on advertising junk food to children and pressuring food companies to cut the sugar, salt and calories in their products. There is little directed specifically at adults. However, said Newton, “nearly all of the measures will also improve adult obesity. Effectively we are taking calories out of the national diet,” he said.The report also shows that healthy life expectancy – the number of years people live before they begin to suffer from illnesses – has not much changed in recent years. Women in 2014-16 were spending nearly 20 years of their life in poor health (19.3 years), while men spent just over 16 years in poor health, according to data from the Office for National Statistics included in the report.Long-term conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure and cancers underlie some of these problems.The Alzheimer’s Society said that one million people will be living with dementia by 2021 and that the disease has not had the attention it deserves.“We have stressed for a long time that dementia was set to be the 21st century’s biggest killer – it has already become so, and what is the stark reality for women is now also set to be the case for men,” said Sally Copley, director of policy. “What makes this more sobering is that it is the only leading cause of death that we can’t cure, prevent or even slow down, showing the critical need to tackle the dementia crisis.”Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said there were genetic and socioeconomic reasons people were developing long-term conditions affecting their health, “but there remains a clear connection between the quality of our patients’ lifestyle and their overall health”. That included poor diet and lack of exercise.“GPs are acutely aware of these dangers, which is why we will always try to take into account the physical, psychological and social aspects of the person sitting in front of us, including how their lifestyle might be affecting their health and the ways in which they can work to improve it. Often simple lifestyle changes can have a big impact on long-term health and wellbeing,” she said.“With many patients coming to see their doctor with more than problem, however, finding time to properly assess someone’s lifestyle can be difficult within the constraints of a standard 10-minute consultation.”Of great concern, however, are the social and economic inequalities in health. “People in wealthier parts of the country enjoy 19 more years of good health than in poorer parts of the country,” he said. “They live nine years longer – for men – and seven years longer for women. These are unacceptable variations.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae18c585c76aea928006f99a39174893a97b3ef1/0_147_5064_3039/master/5064.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d3e3ad703fbcfda58dee060ca11a0cd","title":"alastair cook england viking farewell","story":"In France they call it an English Goodbye, the kind of goodbye where a guest at a party slips off discreetly without saying a word to avoid the protracted business of hugs and kisses and handshakes. On a still September day in south-east London Alastair Cook was offered whatever the opposite of this is, the English Top Test Run-Scorer’s Goodbye, a goodbye so prolonged in its successive ovations there would be members of the crowd leaping to their feet in their sleep tonight at the muscle memory of that warm and surely unprecedented farewell.At the centre of all this was The Ovation, the one that surged around this low-rise bowl like a breaking wave 15 minutes before lunch as Cook scored the runs that took him to a farewell hundred in his final Test innings. Resuming on 46 overnight, he had nudged and blocked, then begun to play with a disarming freedom, before cantering through the 90s. On 91 there was a delicious drive for four straight down the ground off Jasprit Bumrah that drew coos and gurgles as Cook stood up tall in the regal manner, the kind of shot that might have been played wearing silk gloves and brandishing a malacca cane.From there every single was applauded urgently. Finally, with Cook on 96 a ball from Ravindra Jadeja was clipped to Bumrah for a single, then transformed into the moment of the Test match summer by a terrible throw back to the bowler’s end that scudded off to the boundary across the hard dry square.And that was that. Enter the Daddy ovation, the 10th ovation of\u0026nbsp13\u0026nbspto Cook’s name so far in this game, from his first appearance on the field to leading the teams off at the close of play. It was always going to be like this here. The Oval is English cricket’s much-loved family funeral parlour, a place of final Tests in hazy September sun, of last things and endings, the field full of shades, my Curtly and Courtney of long ago.It cannot have seen many like this, though. And certainly not at 12.45pm on a grey Monday as the ground rose on all sides for that 33rd Test hundred. Cook stood waving his bat, a batsman’s salute that became a wave goodbye, though in Cook fashion this was a slightly scratchy kind of wave, a wave off the pads for one. As the players waited to resume, the ovation refused to die, drawing a grin and a shrug from Cook and another wave, an undemonstrative man taking a genuine pleasure in the moment of valediction.In the wrong company this might have felt a little mawkish, a little Princess Diana. But Cook is a genuine sporting great, a genius at the hard art of unshowy resistance, in a sport that venerates those who play it in a uniquely personal way. This was more like a Viking farewell.And so Cook will bat no more for England. He\u0026nbspends with 12,472 runs off 26,562 balls at an average of 45.35, with 33 hundreds and 57 fifties. In all he hit 1,442 fours and (it says here) 11 sixes. The best times will continue to shine. The peak was the 2011-12 Ashes, when Cook scored 766 unhurried runs and filled the skies for one glorious Australian summer without wasting a bead of sweat. India 2012-13 was another high, the sweet spot of Cook’s captaincy. For those who watched it that 190 at Eden Gardens was one of those innings that plays quietly in some tiny space at the back of your mind on an endless loop for as long as you choose to remember.From here there will be one more day of applause, with fresh ticket holders through the door on Tuesday, but\u0026nbspbeyond that we are now pretty much done here. At which point one\u0026nbspor two farewell conclusions present themselves.Most obviously, and with all due deference, this is clearly the wrong decision on a sporting level. Farewell innings are supposed to be redolent with frailties, to offer some note of death. This was something else. Past the hundred there was a beautiful Saeed Anwar-style drive through cover. The pull shot emerged once, that lovely moment of abandon where all watchfulness disappears and the bat just whirls through like Mr Banks in Mary Poppins suddenly hurling his bowler into the air.Cook played with a fluency that cannot simply be put down to the relief of packing it in. He is clearly still the best opening batsman in England, albeit, yes, this is a bit like being the most terrifying gerbil. England’s loss is county cricket’s significant gain.Beyond this there was a note of sadness buried within the applause. Cook is a popular cricketer, cherished in a quiet way, an unflashy seducer of the crowds. The perfect staging, a hundred in his final innings, was a huge amplifying factor. But it is still hard to think of another English player who has had a goodbye quite like this, just as it is hard not to feel other kinds of anxiety, other farewells beneath the swell of emotion.Cricket itself is in the process of changing, the Test match rhythms Cook embodies menaced by competing forces elsewhere. It is a period of change his entire England career has coincided with and run alongside and which he now leaves behind to an echo of sustained, quietly hungry applause."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f60063b47abec231803d59a834d33eee8d41431/0_136_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=734ccebccf4e059daaf79a0f0067728d","title":"rugby world cup expand 24 teams 2023","story":"• Rugby World Cup has had 20 teams for two decades• ‘We’re always looking to expand,’ says chief executiveExpanding the Rugby World Cup from 20 to 24 teams is being given serious consideration by the game’s governing body. World Rugby says four more teams could feature in France in 2023, although the 2027 tournament would appear more likely.As things stand Canada, Kenya, Hong Kong and Germany will be involved in a play-off event this year with the winners advancing to the 2019 tournament in Japan. Rugby does not have the global depth of football but World Rugby’s chief executive, Brett Gosper, is keen for more Tier Two countries to share the game’s biggest stage.“We’re always looking from an expansive point of view, rather than reducing so it’s just a question of when rather than if,” said Gosper. “We just want to make sure the teams are competitive enough to move to a 24-team tournament. In order to grow the sport it’s about getting interest from new fans and commercial interest in new markets but you’ve got to make sure you’ve got the teams.”Alan Gilpin, the man in charge of the 2019 World Cup, feels similarly, with the tournament having featured just 20 teams for the past two decades. “We are definitely looking at expansion not contraction. We’d love to move to 24 teams.” Both also dismissed fears that next year’s potentially one-sided pool fixture between the repechage winners and New Zealand will undermine their case for expansion. “We are confident the team that qualifies will be competitive enough, even against the All Blacks,” said Gosper. “We’ll work hard with that team to make sure that team is well trained in advance.”World Rugby are also keeping an eye on the offer from a private equity firm to buy a major stake in Premiership Rugby. “We’re keeping appraised of the situation and are having conversations with the Rugby Football Union,” said Gosper. “We’ll see how it plays out. It’s an interesting occurrence … but elements of rugby are always in conversations about how they can raise the general funding of the sport to accelerate growth. We’ve been in conversations ourselves in the past.“You have to weight that extra money coming in with the cost to control that comes with it. That’s one of the reasons we’ve never ventured into that area before and why we’d always be concerned about the exit plans of other investors. We’re a governing body so we’re control freaks and it’s hard to relinquish control.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddb7d97dc96d00dd8f0ae894e823ada61e96d0d8/0_243_3675_2205/master/3675.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4a2dbea45d2b0d316ade2ebfbb40bb8","title":"tony finau us ryder cup final captains pick","story":"Tony Finau has been selected for the American Ryder Cup team as Jim Furyk’s final captain’s pick.The 28-year-old’s first appearance in the competition was announced after he finished tied for eighth at the latest FedEx Cup event, the BMW Championship at Aronimink, outside Philadelphia. “The final Captain’s Pick is in.

In the first couple of minutes alone, a Q\u0026ampA session with an esteemed human rights lawyer dissolves into a ferocious argument over the “neo-colonialist bullshit” and “self-righteous western paternalism” of the international criminal court (ICC). Moments after we see an animated sequence of a young girl being lifted from a pit of bodies.Anyone familiar with writerdirectorproducer Hugo Blick’s previous lofty BBC series The Shadow Line and The Honourable Woman will know he has a flair for unapologetically complex thrillers that pick away at global conspiracies. This is rich, demanding drama that is well worth investing in.The Honourable Woman was set against the backdrop of the Israel-Palestine conflict with Black Earth Rising, Blick widens his scope even further, to examine the moral jurisdiction of the ICC and the west’s relationship with Africa. Harriet Walter plays a barrister, Eve Ashby, whose adopted daughter, Kate, survived the Rwandan genocide. Kate (Michaela Coel, proving she can do serious just as well as comedy) is dealing with her own ghosts, but when Eve takes on the prosecution of a warlord responsible for recruiting child soldiers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo – though, crucially, also for halting the slaughter of the Tutsis in 1994 – Kate begins to question who is on the right side, and what the right side is.And this is only part of the overall story. As all good drama should, Black Earth Rising asks big, thorny questions, stoking debate rather than closing it down, not least when it comes to conversations over history and to whom it belongs.At a time when the global appetite for political cooperation is in decline, what does it mean to have an international court presiding over predominantly African cases? “I discovered that most, if not all, of the ICC’s formal indictments were against 40-odd black Africans,” Blick has said, of his inspiration for the series. Are we past the age of western interference? Should there be, as one character demands early on, “African solutions for African problems?” Is the ICC enacting self-righteous western paternalism, tainting the global image of an entire continent, or is Eve, as she appears to truly believe, delivering justice to those who need it most?Clearly there are no easy answers, and that point is pressed home one particularly harrowing scene involving UN peacekeepers shows that honourable intentions are not the same as fair and just results.This all takes place against a backdrop of corruption and cover-ups in which everything could be a threat and it seems impossible to take anyone at their word. It weaves a web of possible leads and connections. Why this warlord, and what is the link to Eve and Kate? What’s in the envelope? And where did John Goodman, playing the boss of the law firm Kate works at, get that ice cream?As much as it’s an examination of moral boundaries and international justice, it’s also a solid thriller, taking its time to lay the breadcrumbs of several mysteries amid a constant murmur of menace. It also looks fantastic. Blick loves a lingering shot and there are several conversations lit almost in silhouette that could have come straight from the stage. The cast are as good as it gets.The fact that it crams at least a feature film’s worth of plot into the opening episode could indicate that such a pace will be impossible to sustain, but then again, Blick has managed it before, even if The Shadow Line did turn out to be mostly, sort of, about pensions. Black Earth Rising offers more than ratings-grabbing popcorn thrills. It flings an enormous cast of characters into a series of desperately combustible situations, and it demands that you keep up. It is, potentially, quite brilliant."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d26680365f79e3e41da4881bba03cdf3c06bd380/0_754_3565_2139/master/3565.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e72dea9f924bb5d8fc5e5d42c8f5049","title":"tone deaf playboy club opens in new york defying the metoo era","story":"Club to open more than 30 years after Hefner declared Bunnies ‘a symbol of the past’ and 32 years after the city’s original closedA Playboy Club, replete with “alluring Playboy Bunny hostesses” and a “sexy and sophisticated aesthetic” is set to open in New York City this week, in defiance of both the #MeToo era and Playboy founder Hugh Hefner, who more than 30 years ago declared Playboy Bunnies “a symbol of the past”.The venue, where a top-tier membership will reportedly cost $250,000, will throw open its doors to the public on 15 September, 32 years after New York City’s original Playboy Club closed.That closure came after a waning in interest and decline in membership, but the company behind the new iteration insists there is an appetite for scantily clad women wearing rabbit ears and tails.A Playboy Club source told the New York Post in June that it had already sold “$2.2m worth of memberships”, although with top-tier initiation fees sky high, that figure may be less impressive than it sounds. But at least one person is definitely excited – the writer of a breathless press release accompanying the launch.“The space will feature a lounge area, a game room and a full-service dining room, but by far the most attractive feature of Playboy Club New York will undoubtedly be the return of the Playboy Bunnies to Manhattan,” the release said.“The alluring Playboy Bunny hostesses, waitresses and cocktail servers have a worldwide, well-deserved reputation for their style and graciousness.”The Playboy Club will be located on the west side of Manhattan, about a mile-and-a-half south-west of the original club, and just a few blocks from where hundreds of thousands of people took part in a Women’s March in January.That jarring symbolism is not lost on critics of the Playboy Club. Clark Wolf, a restaurant and food business consultant based in New York and California, described the decision to reopen the club as “completely tone deaf” given the push for greater gender equality.“It’s kind of ridiculous actually,” Wolf said. “People are demanding better conditions and a bunny suit and ears doesn’t seem to be on par with what people are wanting.”Wolf believes that the Playboy Club may be a “conscious or unconscious” tap into the pushback against women who are demanding equal rights.“There is a bitter fight going on right now for middle-aged douchey white men to regain power and control and that is going on at all levels of society,” Wolf said.The first Playboy Club opened in Chicago in 1960, and a slew of others followed in cities around the US. Miami, Dallas, Denver and San Diego all boasted their own clubs, and New York City got its version in 1962. The Playboy Club in London’s Mayfair marked its 50th birthday in 2016.Initially the clubs, where access was granted only with the presentation of a black and gold Playboy key, were a success, even if questions persisted about the working conditions Playboy Bunnies faced.The bunny outfits, Steinem wrote, were “two inches smaller than any of my measurements everywhere except the bust,” and “so tight that the zipper caught my skin”. Bunnies were expected to pad the bust of their costumes, while Steinem wrote that the pay was low, the hours long and the men lascivious.It remains to be seen how popular the club will be with New York City dwellers – especially given the failure of the initial clubs. Playboy claimed that it once had 750,000 members across its 30 clubs, but business and interest dried up in the mid-1970s, and by 1986 every club had shut down.The New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago clubs were the last of the company-owned clubs – some were franchised – to close, in 1986. It was thought – even by Hefner – that the era of the Playboy club had passed.The Playboy Bunny had become “a symbol of the past”, Hefner told the New York Times in 1986.“I’m not having any sleepless nights,” he said of the Playboy Clubs’ collective failure. “If anything, it’s a little overdue.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c70b3c7fe4ec85ba6f0ca28b3c9f1cb00782ab5/0_98_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=815054bf244e9ec44dfd5e347f7a6563","title":"hurricane florence virginia south carolina evacuations","story":"South Carolina governor warns ‘this is a big, big storm’ as states brace for what could be the region’s most powerful hurricaneMore than a million people living along the coastlines of South Carolina and Virginia have been ordered to evacuate their homes on Tuesday, as parts of America’s mid-Atlantic coast brace for what could be the most powerful storm to ever hit the region.Hurricane Florence is expected to bring potentially catastrophic winds, flooding and storm surge. Forecasters predict it will make landfall sometime late Thursday.Currently rated as a category 4 storm – the second most powerful on the national weather service’s (NWS) classification system – Florence would be the first storm of that magnitude in recorded history to strike the eastern coastline so far north if it remains on its most likely track.McMaster ordered the evacuation of coastal areas to start at noon on Tuesday as Hurricane Florence approaches. He said the storm surge could reach as high as 10ft (3m) and estimated that 1 million residents would be leaving the coast.“We know this evacuation order I’m issuing is going to be inconvenient,” McMaster said of the decision. “But we’re willing to suffer some inconvenience.” He added that the disruption was worth the effort to save lives.“This is a big, big hurricane,” McMaster said, noting that wind speeds are predicted to be more violent than in either of the the region’s two most damaging storms of the past 30 years.Virginia’s governor ordered a mandatory evacuation for some residents of low-lying coastal areas beginning on Tuesday morning. State officials say 245,000 people live in the affected area, but officials warned the storm could affect the entire state.McMaster declared a state of emergency on Saturday. The governors of Virginia, North Carolina and Maryland have done the same. The designation gives officials the power to do order evacuations, establish shelters, prohibit travel and impose curfews.“Take steps now,” said North Carolina governor Roy Cooper over the weekend. On Monday he said: “We do know that we’re in the bull’s-eye.”On Monday afternoon, Donald Trump cancelled a scheduled appearance for Friday in Jackson, Mississippi. He was due to campaign for Senate candidate Cindy Hyde-Smith.The NWS is predicting “life-threatening” storm surge and inland freshwater flooding, with some models predicting upwards of 2ft of rainfall. With winds of up to 150mph forecast, Florence will likely fell tree limbs and trigger power outages.Some forecasters are concerned that the storm appears likely to slow dramatically at about the time of landfall, like 2017’s Hurricane Harvey, which stalled out Houston, dropping huge amounts of rain over several days. That storm brought $125bn in damage last summer, mostly in Texas.Florence stands a significant chance of joining 2017’s Harvey and Irma as just the third storm to make landfall on the US mainland at category 4 strength (or higher) since 2005. When storms of that magnitude hit the lower 48 states, they usually travel through the warmer waters of the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico and rarely make landfall so far north up the eastern Atlantic coast. The last storm to hit the Carolinas as a category 4 was Hurricane Hugo nearly 30 years ago in 1989.Florida governor Rick Scott, whose state experiences the most hurricane-force storms in the US, pledged resources, expertise and guidance to the three states in which emergencies have been declared. Officials in North Carolina have already issued mandatory evacuation orders for coastal Dare County and Hatteras Island. The governor also waived certain restrictions for trucks and heavy vehicles to help farmers harvest crops and move livestock before the storm, officials said.“North Carolina is no stranger to hurricanes,” Cooper said Monday, at least partially alluding to the devastating effects of Hurricane Matthew, which struck the Carolinas as a category 1 storm in October 2016 killing 34 in the US, after cutting a vicious path across the Caribbean, killing more than 1,000 in Haiti.Off the state’s coast, large sea swells and dangerous rip currents were already apparent over the weekend, foreshadowing the storm’s arrival. Beachgoers have been warned to avoid the ocean, and ferries that service the state’s coast have been canceled.In Virginia, home to the world’s largest sea base, the US navy has ordered all ships to sea in preparation for the storm, where they can more safely ride out the violent wind and waves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/908899d11bb3caaf53f2ef8614bbf4f8b469db07/0_499_5200_3120/master/5200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d45e0f1dea2a77ef840be8dec57e29e","title":"its not about what is fair macedonians prepare to vote on name change","story":"Many Macedonians grudgingly accept need for name change in order to join Nato and EU North. It’s just a single five-letter word, but in Macedonia in recent weeks it has prompted many column inches of debate, hours of coffee-shop discussions and pages of online abuse.A referendum at the end of the month will ask citizens whether they are willing to add the word to the country’s official name, making it the Republic of North Macedonia.The change is the main part of an agreement between Macedonia and Greece signed by their respective prime ministers in June. Greece has long blocked Macedonian accession to Nato and the European Union, claiming its northern neighbour’s name is an unfair appropriation from the northern Greek region of Macedonia.For many inside Macedonia, changing the name is a delicate issue. “It’s not just about one word. Think about Northern Ireland and Ireland. Words have meaning,” said Sasho Klekovski, a pollster and analyst who opposes the deal.Nikola Dimitrov, Macedonia’s foreign minister, who spent months in negotiations with his Greek counterpart hammering out details of the deal, said it would offer a new path forward for the small nation of around 2 million people, which has struggled since it became independent after the collapse of Yugoslavia.“We have lost a generation. I am 45, I was 18 when Macedonia became independent. In a way this is the second chance for our generation to make it,” he said in an interview at his office in central Skopje, Macedonia’s capital.On 30 September the population will be asked: “Are you in favour of Nato and EU membership, and accepting the name agreement between the republic of Macedonia and Greece?”Government critics say the wording is manipulative, but the defence minister, Radmila Šekerinska, said it was quite proper to phrase the question in two parts. “If there was a chance to get into the EU and Nato without the agreement with Greece, everyone would be thrilled,” she said. “To deny the connection between the EU and Nato and the agreement is to be irrational.”Few Macedonians are positive about the name change, but many speak of it with the grudging acceptance that might be accorded an unpleasant but necessary medical procedure.“We are an isolated, small and poor country, so let’s do it. It’s not fair, but it’s not about what is fair but about what is good for everyone. If there’s a chance for people to live better, let’s take it,” said Sanja Arsovska, 31, an actor at the Skopje drama theatre.The deal has been stridently opposed by nationalists on both sides of the border – on Saturday Greeks protesters clashed with riot police – but polls suggest a slim majority are in favour of the deal, boosted by overwhelming support among Macedonia’s sizeable ethnic Albanian minority.The longstanding dispute between Skopje and Athens has been complicated in recent years by a “antiquisation” project carried out by the nationalist government of the previous prime minister Nikola Gruevski, in which dozens of statues, fountains and grand buildings adorned with faux-marble columns were erected in Skopje.The centrepiece is a fountain complex in the main square, topped with a statue of Alexander the Great on horseback. The monuments incensed Greece, who accused Skopje of appropriating Hellenic cultural and historical heritage.Gruevski was ousted from office in 2016 after a wire-tapping scandal and is now on trial for an array of offences. The new government reached the deal with Greece but will need the support of parts of Gruevski’s VMRO-DPMNE party to see it through, as the referendum is only consultative.VMRO officials are furious that Macedonia will have to change its name not only in international communications but internally as well, with passports, ministry names and all other references to Macedonia to be replaced by North Macedonia.“They would have had a better agreement if they had let the Greeks write it themselves, because probably the Greeks would have been a bit embarrassed to give themselves absolutely everything,” said Aleksandar Nikoloski, the deputy head of VMRO, in an interview at the party headquarters, an imposing building filled with lurid artworks that reflect Gruevski’s grandiose visions.VMRO are under intense international pressure not to scupper the agreement and have yet to announce whether or not they will call for a boycott of the referendum. Nikoloski has denied government claims that the party offered to support the deal in exchange for an amnesty for Gruevski and others.As well as trying to get the opposition onside, Macedonian officials are keeping an eye on Moscow during the campaign. Russia has openly said it opposes Macedonia’s Nato accession and has been accused of working behind the scenes to try to scupper the deal. Greece recently expelled Russian diplomats, accusing them of offering bribes to opponents of the deal.In Macedonia, the main pro-Russia force is Janko Bachev, a fringe politician whose United Macedonia party has sprung up in recent months. Bachev, speaking from the party offices where a Russian flag flies from the balcony, claimed the polls showing a majority of Macedonians in favour of Nato membership were “funded by the CIA” and insisted most Macedonians opposed the deal.“All the main parties here support liberal values such as homosexuality, gay marriage, changing Macedonia’s name and erasing everything that is Macedonian,” he said, adding that the Kremlin instead supported “traditional values” that aligned with the views of most Macedonians. He denied receiving funding from Russia but said he wanted Macedonia to enter into a strategic alliance with the Kremlin.Bachev, who is calling for a boycott of the vote, is not seen as a serious political force by most observers, but western diplomats are nevertheless following Moscow’s moves warily.“For years, Russia never said anything about Macedonia suddenly they are coming out with all kinds of statements,” said one. “I don’t think they are going to launch a Montenegro-style coup here, but could they put a few guys into a crowd and create a disturbance? I wouldn’t rule that out.”Western countries are pushing strongly for the deal to be a success, with Germany’s Angela Merkel visiting Skopje this weekend.If the deal is pushed through, Skopje and Athens have agreed to disagree on who or what constitutes a Macedonian: a sub-clause of the agreement says “the parties acknowledge that their respective understanding of the terms ‘Macedonia’ and ‘Macedonian’ refers to a different historical context and cultural heritage”.When it comes to the Skopje monuments of Alexander the Great and other classical heroes, the government has agreed that within six months it will take “corrective action” by renaming monuments that “refer in any way to ancient Hellenic history and civilisation”.Dimitrov said: “In the past we sacrificed our reality for mythology. Now we are sacrificing mythology for reality, and reality is what really matters.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f9b0e206138a139793113e9528d07d6545a9efe/0_589_2696_1618/master/2696.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc8bf08edb5a182d8a970ecf43500f85","title":"malmo digests swedish election result work together","story":"Some are alarmed by rise of far right, others say Sweden Democrats cannot be ignoredAs Swedes went back to work on Monday with their country facing weeks, if not months, of political wrangling, few of those sipping coffee at the Bröd och Vänner cafe in central Malmö seemed to have any certainty of how the country’s next government would look.“It’s expected,” Karin Kangas, 52, who voted for the Social Democrats, said of the confused parliamentary picture. “I think it’s going to take time.”She hoped that the Alliance bloc of centre-right political parties, which on Sunday night reaffirmed their intention to rule together, would eventually split, allowing her party to remain in power with the support of the smaller Centre and Liberal parties.“The Alliance have already gone out and locked themselves up in a position,” she said. “But if they go out from the people’s vote, you should have Social Democrats, Centre, Liberals and Green party all working together. But it will be very hard to get such an agreement.”Dragan Pau, 64, a builder taking a break from renovating a nearby apartment, said he doubted his party, the far-right, anti-immigration Sweden Democrats, had won the influence it had hoped for.“In Sweden we live in a false dictatorship because none of the other parties will ever let the Sweden Democrats have any power,” he said, as his colleague Adin shook his head in amused disagreement. “It’s going to be the same politics, nothing’s going to change.”Even if the Moderate party and its allies did in the end form a government with the passive or active support of the Sweden Democrats, he said, it was unlikely it would be able to push through the heavy restrictions on immigration it desired.“Even if the blue parties do a deal with the Sweden Democrats to take power, it will still be the same politics. Swedes are too stupid to realise we live in a dictatorship.”Adin, who did not vote despite being eligible to do so, said he had the opposite concern, that the Sweden Democrats would in fact gain influence. “It’s not good that the Sweden Democrats have gone up so much, it’s not good for us immigrants,” he said.“It’s really upsetting,” he said. “The Sweden Democrats, they’ve ided people up into us and them. I’m worried about it.”Like Kangas, he said he hoped the other parties would reach some sort of agreement to prevent the Sweden Democrats from gaining influence. “Now they’ve got to learn to work together. I think it’s going to be a leftwing government.”Susanne Madsen, 61, another Social Democrat voter, was confident Sweden’s current prime minister, Stefan Löfven, would stay in place. “I think that there won’t be a shift in power,” she said. “I don’t know why I think that, but that’s what I think.”She said the result was better than she had feared for her party and its coalition partner the Green party. “I thought the Greens would be knocked out of the parliament, but they made it.”Her partner, Jan Persson, 60, said be believed that if Sweden’s three leftwing parties had more mandates than the centre-right when all the votes were counted then the Social Democrats should lead the formation of the next government. “I think that the biggest bloc should get it, but they need to have some form of cooperation.”Even Daniel Misik, who voted for the Christian Democrats, grudgingly accepted the principle that the bloc with the largest number of mandates should be able to form the next government.“For now the red parties are bigger,” he conceded, but he said he hoped that the advantage would shift to the right as the last overseas and preliminary votes were counted over the next few days.At any rate, he said, it was time for Sweden’s political parties to bring an end to their refusal to negotiate and form deals with the Sweden Democrats."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/671d1dc40d331d50407b9988c4f3c6ec9681cecf/36_0_3408_2044/master/3408.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79f90f95b8b7f83930457ad0b824dc5e","title":"palestinian officials washington diplomatic mission","story":"Senior politician Hanan Ashrawi accuses US of ‘deliberately bashing the Palestinian people by denying them of their rights’Palestinian leaders have condemned a decision by Donald Trump to shutter their diplomatic mission to Washington as part of a “cruel and spiteful” campaign they say represents collective punishment against Palestinians.The move follows a year of US action that includes cutting hundreds of millions of dollars in humanitarian aid to Palestinians and recognising Jerusalem, a city that is territorially contested, as Israel’s capital.Senior Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi said the US government was “extremely cruel and spiteful to persist in deliberately bashing the Palestinian people by denying them of their rights, giving away their lands and rightful capital of Jerusalem”.“This form of crude and vicious blackmail … once again seeks to punish the Palestinian people as a whole who are already victims of the ruthless Israeli military occupation,” she added.Trump has said his decisions – which have ended half a century of bipartisan US policy towards the conflict – had been to pressure the Palestinians to make a peace deal. However, no US peace plans have yet to be put forward even as Trump has promised an “ultimate deal”, a proposal the administration says is being led by Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and a senior aide.Although the US does not recognise Palestinian statehood, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which formally represents Palestinians, has maintained a “general delegation” office in Washington. The mission opened in 1994 and, in 2011 under the Obama administration, staff were allowed to fly their flag over the office.“It is ironic that the US is punishing the PLO, the national representative of the Palestinian people and the highest political body that made the commitment to reaching a political and legal settlement of the Palestinian question and that has engaged in negotiations with successive US administrations for decades,” said Ashrawi, a PLO executive committee member.In November last year, then US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, cited a provision in a US law that meant the PLO mission must close if the Palestinians try to get the international criminal court (ICC) to prosecute Israelis for crimes against Palestinians. However, the law allows the US president to decide either way.The US state department said in a statement on Monday that the mission should close as “the PLO has not taken steps to advance the start of direct and meaningful negotiations with Israel”.It added: “This decision is also consistent with administration and congressional concerns with Palestinian attempts to prompt an investigation of Israel by the international criminal court.”Following the US Jerusalem embassy opening in May, and the shooting by Israeli soldiers of hundreds of Palestinian protesters, the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, recalled his envoy to the US and stopped communication.His foreign minister later asked the ICC chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, to open an investigation into alleged Israeli war crimes, crimes against humanity, and apartheid. Israel, like the US, is not a signatory to the ICC and said the body lacked jurisdiction.Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, is expected to threaten the ICC – which is also investigating alleged US war crimes in Afghanistan – with sanctions on Monday, in part due to potential investigations into Israel’s conduct.The Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Palestinians would “continue to call upon the international criminal court to open its immediate investigation into Israeli crimes”.He said a US official had earlier notified the Palestinian leadership that its diplomatic mission would be closed, which he said was “yet another affirmation of the Trump administration’s policy to collectively punish the Palestinian people, including by cutting financial support for humanitarian services including health and education”.Erekat added: “We reiterate that the rights of the Palestinian people are not for sale, that we will not succumb to US threats and bullying and that we will continue our legitimate struggle for freedom, justice, and independence, including by all political and legal means possible.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7471b963d5b616a9c57a077179dcc1221032b93/0_430_5845_3508/master/5845.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d6a7531a67994db249c6a8c64bae34b","title":"swedish election highlights decline of europes main parties","story":"Decline of the main parties is making it harder to form coalitions and pursue policiesLike all elections, Sweden’s has produced a lot of numbers. One number has received more attention than all the rest: 17.6, the percentage of the vote that went to the rightwing, anti-immigrant, nationalist Sweden Democrats – their highest ever score, and enough to make forming a new government a very complicated job for the mainstream parties.Meanwhile, three other parties – the ex-communist Left, the Centre party and the centre-right Christian Democrats – put on a total of 6.5 points. And the big established parties of the centre-left and centre-right, the Social Democrats and the Moderates, lost 6.3 points between them.The real story of Sweden’s election is not, as the prevailing narrative has it, the irresistible onward march of Europe’s far right but the continuing decline of the major parties of government, the fragmentation of national votes and the rise of a number of smaller parties.In a trend visible across Europe, the electoral base of the leading mainstream parties is shrinking. “The bigger parties are getting smaller and the smaller parties getting bigger,” said Sarah de Lange, a political scientist at the University of Amsterdam and a specialist in Europe’s radical right.Across the continent, mainstream parties and alliances that once dominated national politics are in retreat, most notably on the left, making coalition-forming harder – even in countries, like Sweden, long used to coalition government – and producing weaker, potentially shorter-lived governments.Simon Hix, a professor of European and comparative politics at the London School of Economics, said: “For me, the biggest take-home from the Swedish election is not the further rise of populists but the stunning volatility and party system fragmentation: it’s the Dutchification of European politics.”Across western Europe, from Germany to France and Italy to Austria, parties that have dominated their national political stages since the end of the second world war have lost votes or lost outright in recent elections, not just to nation-first populists, but to liberal, Green and anti-austerity parties, and even new centrist movements.Sweden, it seems, for all its historic two-bloc system and apparently cast-iron political stability, is no exception. “The bottom line is that Sweden is another European country: a fractured political landscape with the extremes doing better, including a populist party to the right,” said Carl Bildt, the conservative former Swedish prime minister.Alexander Stubb, a former Finnish prime minister, made the same point: “Sweden’s election result follows the pattern in western democracies,” he said. “An unclear result, complicated coalitions and the decline of mainstream parties.”Smaller and non-mainstream parties are poaching votes from the big parties on both sides of the left-right ide. Data shows the Sweden Democrats, for example, gained support in almost exactly equal measure from the centre-left Social Democrats and the centre-right Moderates.But overall the picture is consistent. Does this matter? Yes, say analysts, because the flimsy coalitions and splintered legislatures that often emerge from fragmented systems make it harder to govern. “They require coalitions involving more parties, and parties with a wide range of stances,” said De Lange.And that can make it harder for countries to adopt reforms, pursue controversial policies – such as welcoming refugees, a major factor for many voters in Sweden’s election – or play a decisive role on the international stage."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"\u0026lsquoWe are in a new place, smaller, more humble,\u0026rsquo says Clogher diocesan secretaryClogher has just 58 active priests, 28 of whom are over 65, for its 85 churchesDyslexia more than 100 times more likely to be diagnosed than maths-learning disorderOutgoing Barnardos chief executive , Fergus Finlay, \u0026lsquoangry\u0026rsquo at lack of progressPSNI thanks garda\u0026iacute for assistance in locating 56-year-oldOne-third of children accessing age-inappropriate games on internet, survey revealsIndependent Senator secures backing of Galway City Council to reach four nominationsHopeful presidential candidates have been speaking at public council meetingsCandidates from 68 countries include 85 from PolandSouth Dublin County Council votes to defer decision on building nearly 1,000 homes over lack of \u0026lsquoaffordable\u0026rsquo homes\u0026lsquoThese hubs have the potential to develop the very inefficiencies and dysfunctions ... the isional model is directed as remedying\u0026rsquoBoundary Commission proposal to split Co Derry town in to three zones droppedWatchdog says use of HSE \u0026lsquoauthorised officer\u0026rsquo can avoid negative impact on family relationsMental Health Commission stages mock hearing to demonstrate how tribunals operateJoe Queenan filmed by undercover reporter discussing purported project for county Sligo\u0026lsquoInsulting\u0026rsquo reference to women\u0026rsquos place in home must be removed, Taoiseach tells women\u0026rsquos caucusesBono meets President Macon while Adam Clayton visits Irish College\u0026lsquoMany of the women are interested but the fear is the attack and the insults\u0026rsquo\u0026lsquoFitness challenge\u0026rsquo data shows steady declines in exercise abilities during secondary school"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3624742.1536611900!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tech firms must do more to verify age online says naughten","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe digital age of consent has recently been set at 16. File photograph: Getty ImagesBig tech companies will have to work harder to confirm young people’s age when they go online, Minister for Communications Denis Naughten has said. Mr Naughten will be meeting senior executives from Facebook and Google on Tuesday after he addresses a conference on climate change in San Francisco. The latest CyberSafeIreland annual report showed that many children were not telling the truth about their age online, said the Minister. He added that not enough was being done by the technology companies to authenticate the age of these children. The survey was carried out among 5,000 children, parents and teachers who attended courses by the online safety charity.It found that one-third of children have played over-18 games online with significantly more boys (53 per cent) playing them than girls (13 per cent). Some 41 per cent of eight- and nine-year-old boys have played over-18s games.Mr Naughten said in response to the CyberSafeIreland survey that he will be asking the tech executives what they are doing to ensure that age verification works properly. He wants to hear from them “any new proposals or technical mechanisms that they could apply to their systems that would deal with this problem effectively. “Age verification on social media sites is a complex area that all of us as parents need to be far more aware of. But we also need social media companies to make it significantly more difficult for underage children to set up these accounts in the first instance so I’ll be asking the companies what can be done in practical terms,” he said.The CyberSafeIreland survey found almost 70 per cent of children between the ages of eight and 13 own a smart phone and are on social media.It revealed that almost 20 per cent of 12-year-olds are spending in excess of four hours per day online and that 18 per cent of eight to 13-year-old children are talking to strangers online every day. That figure rises to 32 per cent of children who are talking to strangers online every week.Nearly two-thirds of teachers (62 per cent) have to deal with at least one online safety incident annually and a third dealt with between two and five incidents over the last academic year.CyberSafeIreland chief executive Alex Cooney said many nine-year-olds are likely to own a smartphone and be on social media though the digital age of consent has recently been set at 16.The age of digital consent is the age at which a child can give their consent to a platform or online service to collect and profile their information.“Our data highlights the need to start education programmes with both parents and children from a young age with a focus on children embracing a more positive use of technology,” said Mr Cooney. He called on the State to appoint a digital safety commissioner to deal with social media companies who he said should be doing more to protect under-age users."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3611547.1535560761!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"how se%C3%A1n gallagher nearly became president of ireland in 2011","story":"Businessman Seán Gallagher has announced he is to seek a nomination to run in the presidential election in October. Video: Seán Gallagher\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSeán Gallagher reacts as Martin McGuinness tackles him on the issue of a Fianna Fáil fundraiser. Photograph: RTÉSeán Gallagher almost became president in 2011 until his campaign imploded in the final days of the campaign. But what exactly happened?It had been, as everyone wearily attested, a bruising campaign. But the opinion polls on the final weekend all bore the same message: Gallagher was on course to be the next president of Ireland.The 49-year-old Cavan native, who described himself as an entrepreneur and community activist but was best known as a panellist on the TV programme Dragons’ Den, had come from nowhere to the brink of the country’s highest office.As the campaigns of better-known candidates like David Norris, Dana and Mary Davis had wilted under intense media scrutiny, or never really got going in the first place – as in the case of Gay Mitchell and Martin McGuinness – support for Gallagher had grown continuously.Now, with polling day just a few days away, his position appeared unassailable.The secret of Gallagher’s success was hard to fathom it is probably fair to say that he was nobody’s idea of a president before the campaign began.Someone more different than all the previous holders of the office, it would be hard to imagine. But in an Ireland that had been stunned by the economic crash and ravaged by the ensuing austerity, his blend of sunny optimism, plain speaking and relentless talk of recovery had struck a chord with people desperate for a signal towards a better future. He was, apparently, an outsider to the discredited political establishment.But he had the most indispensable quality of a successful politician – people liked him. He made them believe things could be better.How much of this was by design or accident is impossible to know now. But allied to a growing, if subterranean, realisation among Fianna Fáilers – until very recently the largest political organisation in the country, don’t forget – that he was essentially one of them, his rise in the polls had been relentless.With four days to go to polling, he was clear of the chasing pack – polls put him on 40 per cent, 38 per cent, 41 per cent and 40 per cent, will Michael D Higgins trailing in the mid to high 20s. Only a political earthquake could stop him now.“Seven people. One job. The final debate. What will happen here tonight will impact on voters’ decisions, so there’s clearly a lot at stake.”When the programme began a few minutes later, the candidates were offered an opening statement to set out their stalls for the presidency. Most of it had all been heard before.But McGuinness had prepared an attack on Gallagher which would change the course of the election.He went on to say that he had been contacted by a man who had attended a Fianna Fáil fundraiser in Dundalk in 2008 where he had paid €5,000 and had been given a photograph of himself with then taoiseach Brian Cowen.Gallagher had called round to his house to collect the cheque, he said. “The cronyism, the developers, the speculators and those who effectively destroyed the economy of this country, and Seán is up to his neck in all of that and he can’t deny it,” McGuinness said.Kenny turned to Gallagher.“You’re as thick as thieves with Fianna Fáil and you’re trying to deny it?”Haltingly, Gallagher explained his association with Fianna Fáil, painting a picture of largely peripheral involvement. He had been asked to invite “perhaps three or four” local businessmen to a fundraiser. He denied he had solicited or collected money.McGuinness repeated it. “I would caution you Seán, at this stage, that you are in very murky waters,” he warned.“I can tell you quite clearly,” Gallagher explained, “I invited perhaps two to three people to that event. At the event people were asked if they’d like a photograph, as is normal at these functions, and I personally delivered – if that’s the case I don’t remember it – delivering a photograph, but I can tell you . . . ”McGuinness interjected to say he had called to the man’s house to collect a cheque for €5,000.“That’s not correct,” Gallagher replied.McGuinness grinned broadly. “I have to say you’re in deep, deep trouble.”In fact, the story of the fund-raiser was not new. The previous week, the Irish Independent had reported that Gallagher has asked “business friends” to pay €5,000 to “dine with Cowen”. But now Gallagher was adding faces, names, photographs, cheques and envelopes to the story. And for the first time in the campaign, he looked rattled. Seriously rattled.Questions had also been circulated about some of Gallagher’s business dealings. Firms promised investment on Dragons’ Den did not receive the full amounts pledged on air. Gallagher had been paid huge amounts by companies which it turned out were struggling. Some of his companies had received significant State grants.Back on Frontline, an audience member raised specific questions about a cheque for €89,000 for one of these companies that had been misdirected to Gallagher’s personal account. It was a mistake, Gallagher said, and had later been rectified. But the hammer blow was yet to come.Returning after a commercial break, Kenny announced there had been “a development on the Martin McGuinness for President Twitter account. Sinn Féin are going to produce the man who gave you the cheque for five grand.”“You know who it is?” Kenny asked Gallagher.“Yes,” Gallagher said. He was a fuel-smuggler, a convicted criminal and someone with links to Sinn Féin. But he didn’t want to get involved in this. He was shouted down by the audience.Kenny asked, incredulously: “You went to a fuel-smuggler’s house and invited him to a Fianna Fáil do?”Gallagher was floundering now, trying to explain that he had been asked to invite local businessmen. “What I have done – I may well have delivered the photograph – if he gave me an envelope” – here the audience hooted again – “If he gave me the cheque , it was made out to Fianna Fáil headquarters, and it was delivered and that was that. It was nothing to do with me.”It was riveting television. Gallagher, the presidential frontrunner, was unravelling before the eyes of 900,000 viewers at a critical point in the campaign. But to RTÉ’s excruciating embarrassment, the tweet turned out to be from a fake account. But this was never acknowledged during the programme.In December 2017, after years of legal exchanges, RTÉ apologised in the High Court to Gallagher and paid him what he described as “substantial damages” for his treatment by the programme.A 2012 decision by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland upheld Gallagher’s complaints that he had been treated unfairly. RTÉ also conducted its own review of the programme, which found that while Gallagher had been subjected to tough questioning, Higgins had not.But it was not just the tweet, or the Frontline programme that derailed Gallagher’s bid. The following morning, in a bid to rescue his campaign, he appeared on Pat Kenny’s radio show.Asked to address the question about his business dealings put to him by the audience member who described herself as a businesswoman, Gallagher testily replied: “Who is the businesswoman, what’s her background, and where does she come from, and what party is she attached to? I’m tired of people being wheeled out with agendas. You put that person here in front of me and let them tell you and me and the nation their background.”Later he demanded: “You don’t know why she was there or her political background . . . Is she on somebody else’s campaign team? Is she a member of a political party?”A few moments later, Gallagher got his answer. The woman, Glenna Lynch, rang the show. They put her straight on air.“I’m so shocked. I was driving on my way to see someone, a client in work and I had to stop the car. It’s absolutely shocking,” she said.Gallagher was in free-fall now.The final phase of his spectacular fall would not come until that evening, when he was interviewed live on RTÉ’s Six One News by Bryan Dobson.In a relentless, forensic dissection of Gallagher and his campaign’s accounts of his fundraising activities, Dobson secured an admission by Gallagher that contrary to his spokesman’s previous denials to journalists, he had recruited donors and solicited money for Fianna Fáil.In 2011, with the economic crash still the central feature of Irish life, it was hard to construe a more damaging admission. It undermined the central appeal of Gallagher’s campaign – that he was untainted by the failed politics of the past.“The allegation is made that there is something corrupt,” Gallagher pleaded.“There is no allegation of corruption,” Dobson replied. “The allegation is that you haven’t been telling the truth.”“I always tell the truth,” Gallagher insisted.But his campaign was now a flameout. When the votes were cast, Gallagher and Higgins had swapped places – Higgins won 40 per cent, Gallagher 28 per cent, and Higgins – the last man standing after a gruelling two months – won easily on transfers.Gallagher, a picture of impressive dignity for a man who had gone through such a spectacular reversal, stressed that Higgins would have his “full support as president”.“He has given a lifetime of service to this country and I know he will be an outstanding president,” he said at the count.Asked about the dramatic end of the campaign he replied: “Tonight is not the night for blame.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3624601.1536613668!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"joan freeman joins sean gallagher as official candidate","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIndependent Senator Joan Freeman now has four nominations as has Sean Gallagher, meaning both are now official candidates for the Áras.Businessman Sean Gallagher and Independent Senator Joan Freeman have secured the backing of four local authorities to run in the forthcoming presidential election.Mr Gallagher secured the backing of four local authorities in the space of six hours on Monday.Later in the evening he was joined as an official candidate for the October election by Ms Freeman, founder of Pieta House, who said it was a happy conincidence she received her four nominations on World Suicide Awareness Day.She secured the support of Galway City Council, Galway County Council and Fingal County Council on Monday, to add to the nomination she received from Cork City Council last Monday.Earlier, speaking to Kilkenny county councillors in a bid to get their endorsement for a nomination, Mr Gallagher said he is “not seeking to be Michael D Higgins’s replacement, I’m seeking instead to be his successor”.He had already secured the backing of Mayo, Roscommon and Leitrim County Councils by the time he arrived in Kilkenny. But with the Wexford endorsement he is now set to challenge for the Áras.Businessman and former Dragon’s Den colleague Gavin Duffy has three nominations having secured the support of Wicklow County Council on Mondayevening, as well as that of Carlow County Council. Last week he recieved the backing of Meath County Council.Ms Freeman won the Fingal contest by 14 votes to five. She had earlier addressed the council, along with artist Kevin Sharkey, who did not succeed in securing a proposer and seconder among the councillors.Mr Gallagher earned a second nomination on Monday after Mayo County Council backed him with a vote of 12-10 in his favour.He was strongly backed by Fianna Fáil members on the authority. His name was proposed by Cllr Damian Ryan and seconded by Cllr Al McDonnell, both Fianna Fáil representatives.Seven presidential hopefuls – including Mr Gallagher – were due to make brief contributions to the special council meeting. But only one turned up, Sarah Louise Mulligan, a political admirer of US president Donald Trump.All of the other scheduled speakers sent their apologies stating that they could not attend due to other similar meetings elsewhere.The contribution of Ms Mulligan, who at 36 is the youngest candidate in the drive for the Áras, was well received.Mr Gallagher earlier secured 10 of the 16 votes available during Monday morning’s Roscommon County Council meeting, which included four Fianna Fáil votes and one Fine Gael vote.Mr Gallagher has told councillors previously that his priorities would include launching a year of disability from December 3rd this year. This would focus on the 900,000 people across Ireland with a disability, along with their carers and families.Jouranlist Gemma O’Doherty was due to speak at Fingal’s Council Chamber in Swords. She had clashed with members of Clare County Council last week over her claims that there was State collusion in the murder of journalist Veronica Guerin.At a meeting of the council in Ennis to hear pitches from some of those seeking a nomination to contest next month’s election, Ms O’Doherty alleged that Ms Guerin’s brother, Cllr Jimmy Guerin, had defamed her in a tweet posted recently about the matter.Ms O’Doherty said she did her work “on behalf of the Irish people” and that if she felt something was being covered up, nothing would silence her. She said she had been told of collusion in the murder by “a decent honest” member of the Garda and that the issue was not put in the public domain as part of her manifesto.At the Fingal county council meeting on Monday Cllr Guerin excoriated Ms O’Doherty over her allegations that the State was responsible for the murder of his late sister.“In 22 years only two people I have come across say John Gilligan is not responsible for Veronica’s murder: one is John Gilligan the other is Gemma O’Doherty,” he said.Mr Guerin had planned to question Ms O’Doherty over her claims at the meeting, but the freelance journalist did not attend.Candidates need four nominations from councils or the backing of 20 Oireachtas members to run for presidency on October 26th.Mr Duffy became the first candidate to secure a nomination last week after he received the backing of Meath County Council.Ms Freeman, who voted against removal of the Eighth Amendment from the Constitution last May, has said that if elected President her personal conviction would have absolutely no impact on her public duty.“The voice of the people has been heard and there probably will have to be amendments to legislation. That comes with every legislation. We’ll just have to wait and see what is suggested.”Galway County Council – in addition to Ms Freeman – also nominated businessmen Peter Casey and Sean Gallagher, although Mr Gallagher did not attend to make a presentation.Senator Freeman won by 12 votes to seven for Mr Casey and six for Mr Gallagher. She was also absent but represented by her daughter Aisling and drew support from a combination of Fine Gael and Independents, along with one Fianna Fáil councillor, Donagh Killilea.Mr Casey was supported by six Independent councillors and one from Fianna Fáil, while Mr Gallagher’s six votes were all from Fianna Fáil.Sinn Féin, Republican Sinn Féin and Independent Cllr Michael Stroke Fahy were among four abstentions.Ms Freeman thanked the 27 councillors present for the meeting and said her mother would be very proud and this would be “quite a shock to her”.Two nominations – that of Ms Freeman and businessman Sean Gallagher – had been made to Galway City Council after a presentation by nine candidates to city councillors last week.However, Mr Gallagher indicated he would be happy to withdraw as he had already secured the support of four local authorities.Seven councillors supported Ms Freeman, who was proposed by Cllr Terry O’Flaherty (Ind) and seconded by Donal Lyons (Ind). There was one vote against and eight abstentions, while two councillors were absent.Explaining her abstention, Independent Cllr Colette Connolly expressed disappointment that only two of the candidates seeking nominations sent her their profile.Cllr Pearce Flannery (FG) said he would be abstaining as he is supporting President Michael D Higgins for re-election. And his party colleague Cllr John Walsh agreed, noting that Mr Higgins had been twice mayor of Galway.Mayor Niall McNelis (Lab) and party colleague Cllr Billy Cameron (Lab) also said they would support Mr Higgins and would be abstaining. Sinn Féin councillors abstained on the basis that they are running a candidate.President Michael D Higgins has indicated he will run for a second term. Sinn Féin is likely to endorse the Munster MEP Liadh Ní Riada as its candidate on September 16th.South Dublin County Council has agreed to invite prospective candidates seeking a nomination to run in the presidential election to a public meeting to address councillors on Thursday, September 20th. Councillors agreed they would take a vote on whether the local authority would nominate any candidates after the meeting next week.Offaly county councillors look set to back Sean Gallagher’s presidential bid in a vote next Monday.Mr Gallagher had visited the council headquarters in Tullamore along with candidates including Peter Casey and Gemma O’Doherty on Monday.\u0026nbspMr Gallagher, whose mother is from Offaly, denied being Fianna Fáil’s presidential contender."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3624642.1536607231!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"meps to demand continued eu funding for ni peace programmes after brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Parliament:  EU peace funding has “decisively contributed to the peace process in Northern Ireland, supports the Good Friday Agreement, and continues to support the reconciliation of the two communities.” Photograph: Frederick FlorinAFPGettyMEPs in Strasbourg are expected to strongly back a resolution on Tuesday demanding the continued post-Brexit provision of EU funding of Northern Ireland peace programmes. The European Parliament will affirm that EU peace funding has “decisively contributed to the peace process in Northern Ireland, supports the Good Friday Agreement, and continues to support the reconciliation of the two communities.”In a debate on Monday afternoon Regional Affairs Commissioner Corina Cretu welcomed the strong consensus in support of the parliament’s report on peace funding. Peace was hard to build, she said, but easy to destroy – the Commission would maintain its commitment to a programme which demonstrated that cross-border cooperation was not an abstraction but a real part of peoples lives.The motion was supported by Northern Ireland MEPs although Diane Dodds (DUP) said that at times the funding was not always viewed as the report suggested as “neutral” and she complained that some communities had problems accessing it because of red tape.Martina Anderson (SF) said the funding was deeply appreciated and should be continued, “Brexit deal or no deal”.Responding to the debate, rapporteur Derek Vaughan (Socialist group – S\u0026ampD) said he was not claiming that “no EU funds means a return to the Troubles” , but that the funding had made a valuable contribution.MEPs and the resolution welcome the commitments made by the UK authorities to continue funding a successor to the PEACE programme and to the European Commission’s inclusion of funding in the next budget for the 2020-2027 period. Since 1995 and the first EU-funded peace programme, €1.5 billion has been spent in the North promoting cohesion, and economic development. Over €1 billion in EU financial assistance is to be spent in the current financial period to the end of 2020 in the region, of which €230 million will go to the NI PEACE programme (this is 85 per cent EU-funded) and a further €240 milllion goes to the Interreg programme for Northern Ireland, the Republic, and Scotland.

Photograph:   Yves HermanReutersMonday at Westminster began with a little sunbeam of hope about Brexit in the shape of a Financial Times headline promising “Relief for May as Barnier set for go-ahead to pin down Brexit deal”. Michel Barnier offered more cheer later in the day when he said a Brexit deal could be done within six or eight weeks, a statement that lifted sterling.After a weekend of stories about Boris Johnson’s personal life and some overblown outrage about his use of a suicide vest metaphor, here was some good news at last. The EU leaders were about to give Barnier fresh instructions, telling him to stop being so legalistic and inflexible and to offer Theresa May a deal she could get through parliament.On closer examination, the Financial Times story said only that Barnier would receive a new negotiating mandate and it quoted sources warning that there was unlikely to be a significant softening of the EU’s approach. Barnier’s own statement later also fell short of a breakthrough, referring only to the withdrawal agreement and not the political declaration on the future relationship between Britain and the EU.British hopes remain pinned on an informal meeting of EU leaders in Salzburg on September 20th, when the prime minister will make the case for Chequers directly to the other EU leaders. The format will, however, be the same as in previous summits with May making a statement and then leaving before the others talk about Brexit among themselves.There will be no documents at the meeting and it will not produce official conclusions, so any formal movement on Brexit will have to wait until the October summit. Still, the noises that emerge from Salzburg are likely to be comforting enough for May to face her party at its annual conference in Birmingham a week later and to claim that her Chequers plan is still alive.Last night’s poorly attended debate on the EU Withdrawal and Implementation Bill illustrated the prime minister’s difficulty as Conservative Brexiteers lined up to condemn Chequers and to complain even about the terms of a post-Brexit transition period.Her Chequers proposal cannot command a majority in the House of Commons and Labour is almost certain to vote against any deal she presents to parliament. This leaves May back where she has always found herself, spending as much energy negotiating with her own party as with her interlocutors in Brussels."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3624698.1536609595!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"conservative brexiteers line up to condemn terms of transition period","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg arriving at  Westminster on Monday. Photograph:  EPANeil HallConservative Brexiteers have lined up to condemn the terms of a post-Brexit transition period as Michel Barnier suggested that a withdrawal agreement could be sealed within six to eight weeks. MPs were debating the EU Withdrawal and Implementation Bill, which would legislate for a withdrawal agreement with the EU.The withdrawal agreement includes a financial settlement that would see Britain pay the EU £39 billion, the rights of EU citizens in the UK and the Border backstop arrangement. It also creates a transition period up to the end of 2020 when Britain will effectively remain in the European single market and the customs union.Jacob Rees-Mogg, who chairs the European Research Group of Tory eurosceptics, said it was wrong that Britain should remain subject to EU law after it leaves next March.“Having a period of 21 months when our senior law cannot be stopped in this country, when our senior court is the European Court of Justice is a great mistake and is a bit of the legislation that I for one will find extremely difficult to vote for.” Former cabinet minister John Redwood said the government was preparing to agree two new treaties with the EU – a withdrawal agreement and a deal on the future relationship – immediately after Britain left the EU treaty that governs membership.“The money is far too great, the transition delay is far too long, and I’m extremely concerned that we give up one EU treaty only to sign up to another two, which look to me as if they’ll have many of the same problems as the original.” Sterling rallied on Monday after Mr Barnier told an economic forum in Slovenia that he believed it was possible for the two sides to agree on the terms of a withdrawal agreement by November.“I think that if we are realistic we are able to reach an agreement on the first stage of the negotiation, which is the Brexit treaty, within six or eight weeks,” he said.“Taking account the time necessary for the ratification process, the House of Commons on one side and the European Parliament and Council on the other side. We need, we must reach an agreement before the beginning of November. I think it’s possible.”Both sides acknowledge that a deal will not be agreed at next month’s EU summit in Brussels, but the European Council is expected to hold a special Brexit summit in November.Downing Street repeated on Monday that Theresa May remained committed to her Chequers proposal as the only viable plan on the table which respects the Brexit referendum, protects British economic interests and addresses the issue of the Border. Former Brexit minister Steve Baker warned, however, that sticking with Chequers could lead to a “catastrophic split” within the Conservative party, predicting that 80 Tory MPs would vote against it.“It is absolutely no pleasure whatsoever to me to acknowledge that, but I look at the mood of colleagues and the mood of the Conservative Party in the country and I am gravely concerned for the future of our party.” Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

The US wants Kim to proceed with denuclearisation first, but North Korea wants its security guaranteed and a peace agreement to formally end the Korean War of 1950-53. North Koreans wave flowers at Kim Jong-un as he surveys their procession from a balconyHowever, the stalemate has been showing signs of softening in recent days. On Friday President Trump told reporters on Air Force One that a personal letter from Kim Jong-un was going to be delivered soon. “I think it’s going to be a positive letter,” he predicted. Earlier the president had tweeted his thanks to Kim for his “unwavering faith” in him, adding “We will get it done together!” in reference to denuclearisation. Flare-up: aeroplanes forming the number 70 fly in formation “Kim and Trump are trading gestures to appease the US Congress and show to the world that the deal is on. And, indeed, the deal is on but Kim will not fully denuclearise,” North Korea analyst Loretta Napoleoni told The . Analysts have repeatedly warned that despite the current thaw on the Korean Peninsula, Kim has never committed to fully surrendering his nuclear weapons.  Jeffrey Lewis, a nonproliferation expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, tweeted that the understated nature of the Pyongyang parade indicated that North Korea “wants a version of the Israel deal.”He explained: “They don’t test nuclear weapons or show them off at parades we pretend they don’t exist.”According to reporters at the scene, the parade was split into two sections, civilian and military. The military segment featured soldiers wearing uniforms from different periods of national history, then switching to civilian groups, ranging from nurses to construction workers alongside colourful floats. Kim Jong-un clasps the hand of Chinese envoy, Li Zhanshu during the paradeKim surveyed the procession from a balcony in Kim Il Sung square, at times locking hands with Li Zhanshu, a senior envoy sent by Xi Jinping, the Chinese president. Foreign delegations from Russia, Syria, Vietnam and African nations reflected Kim’s concerted push this year in terms of promoting his own personal diplomacy and trying to cultivate a more statesman-like image.French actor Gerard Depardieu was in attendanceIn a break from recent tradition, he did not address the crowd.

Maybe they will buy their dad a Jaguar one day too.”Vinehall School, whose Latin motto is pro aliis optimum agere - “to do our best for the benefit of others”, is near the Sussex town of Robertsbridge and caters for students aged two to 13.Its open day advert was shared on Twitter where users expressed anger at its sentiments, describing it as “vile”, “appalling” and  “wonderfully tone deaf”. The Independent Association of Prep Schools also took a dim view of the advert.A spokesman for the association said: “We understand that the school deeply regrets the advert and has apologised to the parents.“The message portrayed does not reflect the values of IAPS nor does it represent what Vinehall School stands for.”When contacted by The , Mr Powis said: “I very deeply regret the widespread offence caused by the recent open day advertisement.“It was wholly misguided, and should never have seen the light of day. I must stress it is in no way a reflection of the ethos of our school and the worthwhile work we do here.“We are taking a long hard look at how it came to be created in the first place, but as Head, I must take full responsibility for its appearance, and can only apologise for such an unfortunate error of judgement.“Vinehall prides itself on being a friendly, inclusive place, where the values of modesty and broad-mindedness are at the forefront of our guidance and teaching.”Mr Powis declined to confirm whether he drove a blue Jaguar.Please review our commenting policyJohn McDonnell pledges to return power to unions in biggest overhaul of workplace rights in 80 yearsWomen\u0026#39s healthy life expectancy stalled thanks to Alzheimer\u0026#39s diseaseJacob Rees-Mogg: No-deal Brexit will boost UK economy by £1.1 trillion over 15 yearsNHS to be franchised around the globe under post-Brexit plans Britain, France and US \u0026#39plan tougher response to Syrian regime\u0026#39s use of chemical weapons\u0026#39White House \u0026#39working on second Trump meeting with Kim Jong-un\u0026#39Jeremy Corbyn confronted by MPs who accuse him of not protecting colleagues facing deselection threats Comment: These two Tory MPs aren’t bored senseless by Brexit.

I think it is possible.”The episode comes around a week after jumpy financial markets also boosted the pound after Mr Barnier repeated his mantra about wanting to do an ambitious and unique trade deal with the UK.If we are realistic, I want to reach an agreement on the first stage of the negotiation, which is the Brexit treaty, within six or eight weeksThough little has changed on the ground, both sides of talks are staying publicly positive – if only to give them the upper hand in any ensuing blame game that follows a no deal.The next staging post on the road to Brexit is expected to be in Salzburg, where EU leaders will meet for an informal summit next week. Leaders are expected to discuss the UK’s withdrawal, and could agree to a further summit dedicated to Brexit in mid-November, though this is yet to be confirmed.It was reported in the Financial Times that Mr Barnier’s mandate, set by member states, could be revised in order to smooth the way to a deal.\u0026nbspBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

Through making vehicles affordable and by joining forces with business to invest in charge points across our road networks,” she will say.“Governments can help design the zero-emission vehicle ecosystem that makes the low-emission choice the easy choice.”10 photographs to show to anyone who doesn\u0027t believe in climate changeA group of emperor penguins face a crack in the sea ice, near McMurdo Station, AntarcticaAmid a flood in Islampur, Jamalpur, Bangladesh, a woman on a raft searches for somewhere dry to take shelter.

And that it will be reduced by an equivalent amount for the rest of 2019.

Ah, BAME – this acronym, which means black, Asian and minority ethnic, joins many other appellations offered over the decades (not all of them very nice), painstaking\u0026nbspattempts to address the complexities of a multicultural society. But isn’t it, despite its best intentions, rather limiting?\u0026nbspAs a child in Zambia, I was a mwenye, if the speaker wished to be disparaging (it’s an unflattering term that I won’t translate). In most contexts my family was “Indian”, while we regarded ourselves as Keralites (being Indian was secondary). Back in Kerala, if denoted by religion, we were proud to be “Syrian Christians”, members of a Catholic congregation predating the arrival of Islam in India, formed by the disciple Doubting Thomas. Of course this meant we were a cut above those “Latin Christians” who had converted centuries after to curry favour with their Portuguese colonisers.\u0026nbspLater, as a teenager in a new Zimbabwe, I was once again “Indian” and, in a Harare which had been segregated under the Rhodesians, my family should thus have lived in the suburb of Belvedere, which was the Indian zone, rather than as we did on the edge of the “coloured” (mixed\u0026nbsprace) Braeside. I resisted these tortuous preoccupations with skin tones and bloodlines – and by my late teens, inspired by the rising tide which was turning against apartheid in South Africa, I was resolutely, in my eyes, “black”.But when I arrived in the UK, I was suddenly “Asian” – defined by a great continent, of which my home state in India was a mere slender slip of a thing. I was properly foreign, with a student visa stamped in my Indian passport, but my proficiency in English led many to believe I was “British Asian”, alongside an assumption that I was second generation British, well versed in both Withnail and I and the career of reggae DJ Apache Indian, and full of fond memories of that incredible summer of 1976. I have done my homework since, as you can see.\u0026nbspI returned to Africa as a young woman, and when living and working in Mozambique, I was a monye – another disparaging term, not dissimilar to mwenye, but this sobriquet was seasoned with the erroneous assumptions of being Muslim and wealthy. Then, on to the tiny island of Bioko, part of Equatorial Guinea, where I was memorably known as la chica blanca – the white girl. Oh yes, and in Spain some years later, I was declared a hindou, the religious isions that beset my homeland refreshingly ignored. Reader, an identity crisis in the making.The journey so farBut, actually not. For, observers often overlook the ID\u0026nbspand the ego: your own innate understanding of yourself. Are we swayed so much by what others call us? Probably not. Despite my nomadic childhood, my peripatetic young adulthood, my membership of a wider diaspora, angst over love affairs and migrations and appearance and employment, if I’m honest, I’ve always known myself: as impulsive, restless, often inept, but well-intentioned. Despite all the assumptions made in the geographicalreligioussocial “names” I have been given, these qualities best define who I am.\u0026nbspBAME reference the Windrush\u0026nbspgeneration or the recently arrived Somali, or neither, or both?\u0026nbsp(Getty)The journey I have taken to arrive at the roles I currently have – wife, mother, writer, teacher – baffles many people. My first novel (roundly rejected, then published independently) juxtaposes a young woman’s passionate love affair in Mozambique with her arranged marriage in the US. My second, published as my debut by Polygon, follows a widower’s return to India after 30 years in London. My most recent, The Inheritance, features an affair between a young student and an older lecturer, the latter born in Zimbabwe-then-Rhodesia.\u0026nbspAs a writer, if I tap into my experiences of geographical dislocations and multilingual communities, the literary industry and reviewers often locate the story as one of identity crises, of a quest to belong, in which I give “a compelling insight into what it means to be rootless, with characters torn between the culture of their parents and that of the society in which they grew up”. All true. But not the whole story and not a unique story by any means – instead, one that is shared by millions over a shifting, transient world, including readers of fiction. To a lot of us, the mobility and code-switching and reinvention are rather normal. What informs my sense of self? Whom I love, my children, the opinions and advice of the people who are important in my life.BAME at a glanceIt feels churlish to question BAME. But, if identifying a misrepresented or underrepresented minority, then why not just “minority”? The writer and historian Paul Gilroy, in his book There Ain’t No Black in the Union Jack, has already queried the “imploded, narcissistic obsession with the minutiae of ethnicity”. Why the splintering and separation? Does the “B” in BAME reference the Windrush generation or the recently arrived Somali, or neither, or both?\u0026nbspAre we in danger of engendering a hierarchy by stealth, so some minorities are considered more “minority” than others? As a “British Asian” (holding a British passport now, I have become one) I cannot claim to have the same experiences and reception as a Briton with Nigerian origins. But I might well share some of her experiences if she is a woman (like me), if she is a writer (like me), or if she is as scared of her teenage daughter as I am.\u0026nbspAnd if we take the “A” – what constitutes a (British) Asian? Not all of us emanate from the Punjab or Gujarat or Bangladesh, or made a prolonged stopover in east Africa. Not all of our parents arrived in the UK in the 1960s or 1970s. Not all of us live in a large, dense community, or speak its language – or even wish to. Not all of us dance bhangra or admire Bollywood. Our families may not all have served in or near the Raj and we may not have a strong memory of or feelings about partition.Man stabs himself in courtroom being found guilty of sexual assaultUniversities to tackle attainment gap between BAME and white students Disappointed? You might well be, so embedded are the discourses surrounding British Asians. A discourse which can blind an “A” in BAME to the heterogeneity and ersity within – and which is perpetuated sometimes by these iniduals themselves. I once watched on television a very well known British Asian comic whose punchline centred on the unlikelihood of finding an Indian at a Catholic school. The laughter from the audience only served to show how little they knew of the millions of Indians who are Catholic. But, more depressingly – neither it seemed, buying into the discourse, did the comic.To note, the aforementioned Jhalak prize\u0026nbspis the Hindi-Urdu word for “glance”. Considering it is open to all BAME writers, the Bs and the MEs alongside the As, perhaps this is not the most inclusive title?\u0026nbspPerhaps rather than trying to solve issues about ersity by making ersity more explicit and more fractured at the expense of cohesion, we should simply acknowledge that it is, frankly, impossible to categorise a creature as self-reflective and self-concerned as a human being.Sheena Kalayil is a senior language tutor at the University Language Centre at the University of Manchester.

With Theresa May scurrying around the EU trying to deliver Brexit, Greece is\u0026nbspquite right to probe the possibility of bringing the\u0026nbsptreasures homeClick to followThe IndependentThe Elgin Marbles are still one of the most popular displays at the British MuseumIt seems unlikely that several hundred tonnes of marble from Mount Pentelicus near Athens could have a significant role to play in Brexit. But, following a letter from the Greek government to Jeremy Wright,\u0026nbspthe culture secretary, that is exactly what is now happening. Lydia Koniordou, Wright’s Greek counterpart, has asked for dialogue with Britain over the antique sculptures known as the Elgin Marbles.Brought to Britain in the early 1800s by Lord Elgin, the artworks – more properly known as the Parthenon Sculptures – have aroused excitement and controversy ever since. They first went on display in London in 1807, then from 1817 they reached an international audience from a new home in the British Museum. Everyone from Canova to Rodin declared them to be among the most exceptional sculptures ever made. Over two centuries later, they remain one of the British Museum\u0027s most popular displays.Not everyone was happy that Elgin shipped the sculptures to Britain. Lord Byron famously lamented: “Dull is the eye that will not weep to see \u0026nbspThy walls defaced, thy mouldering shrines removed \u0026nbspBy British hands.” But few put his panegyric into context. Byron was a Romantic, who wanted the monumental art of ancient Greek civilisation to crumble poetically as decayed vestiges of lost perfection. He was also making a one-off point rather than speaking from principle, as he personally imported Greek antiquities to Britain and sold them privately.Nevertheless, Byron\u0027s mixed attitudes towards ancient Greece\u0026nbspexpress some of the challenges inherent in questions of cultural heritage, which often see a feverish mix of emotion and romance meet a hard wall of reality.“For me, the Parthenon Sculptures raise some of the biggest questions of cultural property, ownership and where works of art ‘belong’,”\u0026nbspexplains Mary Beard, professor of classics at Cambridge,\u0026nbspThe timing of Greece’s recent letter could not be more significant. Theresa May\u0027s beleaguered strategy to deliver Brexit will ultimately require the consent of all 27\u0026nbspEU members. That means inidual rounds of diplomacy with each country. Greece is taking the opportunity – quite understandably – to probe for a possible quid pro quo, which it hopes will include the Parthenon Sculptures.There have been similar requests from Greece in the past, notably in a campaign by former Greek culture minister Melina Mercouri in the 1980s. However, consecutive British governments have consistently rejected all such requests, although an unexpected door was opened in June when Jeremy Corbyn announced that any government led by him would make it a policy to give the sculptures to Greece.Corbyn\u0027s statement was based on his conviction that the sculptures “belong” to Greece. He referred to them as “stolen” and “looted” by Britain. Many share this view, including members of the British Committee for the Reunification of the Parthenon Marbles, or BCRPM – one of the key groups formed in the UK to press for the sculptures to be given to Greece.The British government\u0027s view goes back to 1816, when a UK Parliamentary Select Committee interviewed witnesses – including Elgin – who had been in Athens at the time, and concluded that Elgin had obtained all necessary permissions from the Ottoman authorities in Athens to remove the sculptures and transport them to England. The Select Committee then voted, 82 to 30, to acquire the sculptures for the nation, before presenting them to the British Museum for public display, scholarship, enlightenment and enjoyment.In many circles, however, there are misgivings about Britain claiming ownership over antiquities that manifestly were not made in Britain. This feeling is tinged with even more awkwardness as the sculptures were acquired during the age of Empire: a period not known for its cultural sensitivity.However, these are generalities. The Parthenon Sculptures have a well-documented and unique history which sheds important light on the controversy.Around 480BC, Athens was entering its Golden Age. It had finally seen off Persia, and the philosophers and playwrights we revere as the founders of western civilisation were starting to tread its sun-hardened streets.Pericles, the city’s leader from around 461BC, decided to mark the city’s new influence and affluence with a vast building project. One of its highlights was to be a magnificent new temple to Athena the Maiden (Parthenos) built on the Acropolis, the city\u0027s highest hill. To ensure the temple was the envy of all, Pericles commissioned one of the city’s sculptors, Pheidias, to decorate the sacred building with a scheme of sculpture that would transport visitors from earth up onto Mount Olympus itself.The artisans in Pheidias’s workshop hacked and smoothed the white marble until eventually the pieces – once vividly painted – were hoisted up onto the great temple. Onlookers were agog, and anyone looking at the sculptures today will know why. The bodies throb with life. The skin appears warm and real to the touch. The gossamer drapery flows as if in natural motion. And the drama of the scenes is charged with an ethereal tension and electricity that is almost unparalleled in art. There are few major sculptors in the last two hundred years who have not looked on them and felt cowed.Once the classical world of mercurial gods and goddesses faded and the era of Christianity dawned, the sculptures began to suffer. Around AD500, the citizens of Athens defaced many and hacked off others in order to convert the Parthenon into a church. This systematic iconoclasm was the single largest act of destruction in the sculptures\u0027 history. Further damage occurred in 1687 when an invading Venetian force bombarded the Acropolis with mortars and scored a direct hit on the Parthenon, which was being used by the ruling Ottomans as an explosives store.The Ottomans – who had conquered Athens in 1456 – are a key player in what was to happen next. In 1799, Thomas Bruce, seventh Earl of Elgin, was appointed Britain’s ambassador to the “Sublime Porte” of the Ottoman Empire at Constantinople. According to some sources, inspired to allow the people and artists of Europe to enjoy the wonders of ancient Greek art, Elgin spent his own money on commissioning artists and sculptors to draw, paint and take casts of the Parthenon Sculptures and other statuary and stonework in Athens.When Elgin\u0027s men arrived in Athens, they found the Ottomans had turned the Acropolis into a military garrison, and soldiers were using the sculptures on the Parthenon for firearms target practice, and hacking bits off to sell to the growing throngs of tourists on the Grand Tour. By this time the Parthenon had only around half of the sculptures that Pheidias originally placed there, with many in poor condition. Mary Beard explains: “The Acropolis was then a rather sordid Turkish military base, and it would have been easy to convince oneself – rightly or wrongly – that the sculpture was better off out of there.”Elgin’s men then began overseeing the removal of the sculptures. Over the course of 10 years, they used local labourers to take down around half of the sculptures on the building (a quarter of the originals), which Elgin shipped back to Britain.Those\u0026nbsp10 years, 1800-10, lie at the heart of the whole Elgin controversy. Opinions ide. Some say Elgin was a hero and conservator who saved the sculptures for the world. Others, like Paul Cartledge, professor of Greek Culture emeritus at Cambridge, differ: “I believe,” he says, “Elgin had purely self-aggrandising reasons for seeking to acquire – for himself and his own personal display – as many of the Marbles as he could.”The 1816 UK Parliamentary select committee concluded otherwise. After examining witnesses and records, it noted that in 1801 Elgin had obtained a firman – an Ottoman legal permit – which, according to a translation shown to them, permitted Elgin to make drawings, create casts and take away “any pieces of stone with inscriptions or figures”.The BCRPM and other reunificationists stress that Parliament did not see the original firman, and so the permit\u0027s specific terms remain unknown. Moreover, they say, even the translated version does not explicitly envisage the wholesale removal of so much sculpture. Elgin was, they say, guilty of mission creep.Whichever view is right, another angle to the question is that Elgin, as ambassador, had the power of the British state behind him. Britain had just defeated Napoleon, who was also an enemy of the Ottomans. Britain was therefore in good odour at the Ottoman court, and Elgin was in a position to ask for favours. “Elgin,” Paul Cartledge believes, “certainly unquestionably exploited the fraught international situation c. 1800, whereby Britain was the enemy of the Ottoman Sultan\u0027s (French) enemy and therefore the Sultan\u0027s ‘friend’.”Those who view Elgin in a more kindly light point to the fact all this removal work was not done covertly or surreptitiously. It was carried out over a period of 10 years, in broad daylight, in central Athens, using hundreds of Greek labourers, under the noses of the authorities, and was even revalidated by a second firman in 1810 when the work was complete and French diplomats tried to hold up the last shipment\u0026nbsp(the French were hoping that they might get some of the sculptures for the Louvre).\u0026nbspThis leads to one of the central disagreements in the whole debate. Greece – aided by allies, including Britain and British philhellenes who had been inspired by seeing the Parthenon Sculptures in London – overthrew the Ottomans in 1832 and restored Greek government. The BCRPM therefore asks how the Ottomans can have given Elgin valid authority to remove the sculptures when they were an illegitimate occupying power.However, the lawyers don’t see it this way. When the Greek government instructed Amal Clooney and Geoffrey Robertson to advise them in 2014, the Syriza government eventually decided that the route to gaining the sculptures was political and diplomatic rather than legal. This came as a surprise to no one. In 1985, Professor John Henry Merryman of Stanford Law School, a leading authority on cultural property, examined the case for restitution and concluded that the modern state of Greece had no legal, moral, or ethical claim to the sculptures.Archaeological treasures of Ancient GreeceThis golden death mask was discovered in the ruins of ancient Mycenae in 1876 by Heinrich Schliemann after he went looking for the palace of Agamemnon, a central figure in the Trojan War.

Countries are forever changing hands, and the Ottomans were, in fact and law, the internationally recognised government of the day. Who else, many ask, should or could Elgin have requested for permission to remove the sculptures to safety?When Elgin got back to Britain, he was suffering from catastrophic debt. He estimated he had spent around £73,600\u0026nbsp(around £3.5m in today’s money) bringing the sculptures to Britain. Parliament offered him £35,000 for the lot, which he accepted. The sculptures went to the British Museum. “It is a myth that Elgin profited hugely from \u0027getting\u0027 the marbles,” Mary Beard explains. “His wife walked out, and he faced bankruptcy, which prompted the sale to the government.” Elgin moved to France, where he died, broken and bankrupt.Once on display in London, the sculptures caused a sensation and started waves of fashion for Greek art and civilisation. “The marbles in London were a vital catalyst for 19th-century Europe\u0027s passion for Greek culture,” explains Dr Greg Sullivan, a leading sculpture historian. “The marbles got into the bloodstream of contemporary 19th-century art. If you attended the Royal Academy art schools or the Derby Mechanics Institute, or if you visited Oxford, Cambridge or Wisbech art galleries, you would be greeted with copies of the statues or casts from the Parthenon frieze.“Flaxman, Westmacott, Gibson, Chantrey. Leighton and Alma-Tadema all acknowledged their influence. It demonstrates how passion for European culture has been a key part of Britishness for centuries, Plaster casts by the British artists Westmacott and Brucciani were given or sold all over Europe to courts and art schools in Germany, Italy, Spain and elsewhere, accelerating the passion for Hellenic civilization. Henning’s miniature relief copies of the frieze were sold and pirated in Paris, Rome, Munich and Vienna.”The sculptures Elgin left in Athens did not fare well. Pollution from the oil refinery at nearby Eleusis eroded many into furry vestiges of their former glories, and a restoration from 1895-1933 by Nicholaos Balanos stapled the sculptures with iron bars which expanded, shattering sections of marble. Fortunately, the casts commissioned by Elgin preserved the details of these sculptures, and have enabled replicas to be made. The British Museum also came in for criticism for an overly abrasive cleaning program in the late 1930s, when it was fashionable to make antique sculptures gleam bright white. However, it was nothing that was not being done at the time to artefacts all over the world, including in Greece. The British Museum subsequently conducted a full investigation, held a conference, and published all results.Looking at all the evidence, Mary Beard concludes: “We must not turn a blind eye to all the problems here, but we should put them in their historical context, without whitewashing or demonising Elgin.”The Elgin Marbles controversy does not, of course, begin and end with Elgin and the wording of his permits. A broader question – which is an increasingly important one – transcends the legal technicalities and asks whether an increasingly culturally sensitive world should be engaging in a general amnesty of cultural artefacts.It is now a real question whether museums should – as a moral act – send objects to the places they were made.\u0026nbspThere can be strong arguments in favour. Some were looted in war. Some would bring tourism to their home regions. Some have ongoing cultural meaning. “To me, the legality of the matter is the least important thing,” says Paul\u0026nbspCartledge. “We don\u0027t actually know what the Sultan\u0027s firman actually permitted Elgin to do. The most important thing is to see what remains of the sculptures – from the British Museum and elsewhere – reunified where they properly can be best appreciated, in the New Acropolis Museum of Athens.”However, against this view is the inevitable sense of loss the world would feel if its principal museums were emptied out. These great “encyclopaedic” or “universal” museums – largely products of the age of Enlightenment – offer a unique opportunity for everyone to experience the interrelationship of all things. In these museums\u0027 vast collections – in Paris, Berlin, St Petersburg, London, Athens and elsewhere – visitors gaze into other cultures, not just into a reflection of their own. They are museums of humanity.Dr Tiffany Jenkins, expert in museums and cultural property, sees strong reasons for artefacts remaining spread around the globe. “The question we should ask is, where is best for the object, in terms of truth, access and preservation? The present situation – where half the remaining sculptures are in Athens and the rest are in London – is a good one. It means the marbles can be seen and understood both in Athens, in the Acropolis Museum close to where they were created, and in London, where they are placed within a universal collection of artefacts from multiple human civilisations.” It is a powerful alternative vision to the idea of restitution, aimed at promoting a wider appreciation of the sculptures.” Jenkins continues: “Like time machines, these museums provide historical context and cross-cultural insight.”The idea of returning objects to their place of origin can also be a challenge if history has moved on. Greece, for instance, did not exist when Pheidias made the sculptures. The Parthenon was a resolutely Athenian project, with the temple used as a treasury for protection money Athens collected from the other Greek city states in the Delian League. Dr James Campbell, fellow in art history and architecture at Cambridge, notes: “It is worth remembering that the Parthenon itself was built on the proceeds of war and taxation and came to be seen by many parts of the Greek world as a symbol of Athenian oppression. It was filled with goods stolen and looted from other cultures.” The Delian League evoked such resentment that it prompted a civil war in which Sparta supplanted Athens as most influential power in the region. So although Greece is unarguably the place where the sculptures were made, they were never a symbol of Greek unity, ancient or modern.“Throughout history, goods have passed across borders and moved from one place to another. Much art fits into this category,”\u0026nbspCampbell continues.\u0026nbsp“Our galleries are full of Italian Masters, Dutch landscapes, French Impressionists. No one is suggesting that every Italian Master belongs to the Italian government. Why, then, do we think the Elgin Marbles belong to the Greek government? Or indeed that the Elgin marbles should be swapped for a better Brexit deal?”Allied to the question of geographical heritage is yet another, more philosophical, perspective. It asks what an object is, and whether an artefact can have more than one identity or tell more than one story. Seen this way, Pheidias\u0027s carvings are simultaneously the Parthenon Sculptures and the Elgin Marbles, and who is to say that both stories should not be told?Dr Tiffany Jenkins elaborates further. “The sculptures have been discarded as well as venerated, seen as historical documents as well as artworks. In the early 19th-century, the Royal Academician Ozias Humphrey, thought them a\u0026nbsp‘mass of ruins’. Most recently at the British Museum they were the centrepiece of a superb exhibition that shed light on the sculpture of Auguste Rodin.”The future of the Parthenon Sculptures is undeniably a decision for Parliament. The British Museum is governed by statute and has no power to give away objects in its collection unless they are duplicates or unfit for retention. Museums also have little interest in the heated and politicised aspects to these debates. On a day-to-day level, museum curators in London, Athens and around the world share with each other and with the public their research, knowledge and an overwhelming love for the objects they care for.16th century Spanish sculpture hit with botched restoration attemptChristo\u0027s latest sculpture weighs 600 tons (and it floats)North Korea displays ice sculptures of ballistic missileHowever, as the recent Greek overture for negotiations shows, one day Parliament may be called upon to make a decision in the case of the sculptures, and perhaps that day will be soon. But the complex, multidimensional questions raised by the Parthenon Sculptures will need to be appreciated in all their shades and nuances. It will simply not do, as Corbyn has done, to fire from the hip and label them as “stolen” property. Neither can the consequences for universal museums be brushed aside, as if the Parthenon Sculptures go, there will inevitably be calls for a mass resettlement of holdings from across the world.“Today, most school children do not learn Greek,” says James Campbell. “Perhaps the sad reason we are even contemplating giving the contents of the British Museum to the current Greek government is that so few British people understand what the Elgin Marbles are, or care.”Any decision on the future of the Parthenon Sculptures should be a reasoned and responsible one. It is unarguable that more people have seen and fallen in love with Greek sculpture and ancient Greece in the free-to-enter British Museum than in the museum in Athens. The sculptures’ future must be assessed for the good of the world. The Elgin Marbles do not belong to the Conservative Party, and they must not be reduced to a cheap chip in the chaotic poker game of Brexit.Dr Dominic Selwood is a historian and barrister.

The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean.

Once there, it is equipped with HD cameras, bait and traps that allow the researchers back on land to capture a vivid picture of trench life.Besides the elusive snailfish, the scientists also managed to capture rare film of long-legged crustaceans known as munnopsids, which are around the size of a human hand.These findings are being presented at the Challenger Conference at Newcastle University this week, where marine scientists gather to share their latest research.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/09/17/fiat-factory.jpg","title":"stockpiling no deal brexit boost uk economy recession cebr research","story":"Created with Sketch.Businesses will run down stocks of imports built up before EU departure, leading to small contraction of economy, says CEBRClick to followThe IndependentMore disruption is likely to be associated with imports of raw materials for manufacturing than with food and medicinesStockpiling supplies of food and medicine to prepare for the UK crashing out of the EU without a trade deal may boost GDP in the short term but it makes a mini recession after Brexit “almost inevitable”, according to new research.The Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) said\u0026nbspoutput could rise by 0.5 per cent because of the extra activity associated with building up supplies.However, businesses are then likely to run down inventories in the months after Brexit, leading to a contraction in the economy, CEBR executive director\u0026nbspProfessor Douglas\u0026nbspMcWilliams said.The government papers on the impact of a no-deal Brexit have highlighted the potential disruption – difficulties in obtaining medicines, sandwich ingredients and various other products.\u0026nbspHowever,\u0026nbspthe single largest cause of disruption will be raw materials and semi-manufactures, which account for £100bn of the UK’s\u0026nbsp£260bn of annual imports from the EU, Mr McWilliams said in a note.Assuming that companies will want to stock an additional three months’ worth of raw materials and semi-manufactures imported from the EU and an additional month’s worth of supplies of finished manufactures would imply additional imports of £38bn, a little\u0026nbspless than 2 per cent of annual GDP.\u0026nbspAccording to the research, production and processing of these additional imports will add about £10bn to GDP.“There is some evidence that a rise in inventories is already happening (eg the rise in inventories in Q2 2018 was greater than the rise in GDP), though it is not necessarily Brexit related,” the CEBR said.“Our rough calculation is that GDP will be boosted by 0.5 per cent on average above the underlying trend in the three quarters from July 2018 to March 2019. And that it will be reduced by an equivalent amount for the rest of 2019.

But I’m very glad that today that this boy has been able to be reunited with his mum.“Some specialists were telling me that it might take more time and that Mohamed should even go to school in Belgium in the meantime.Mother of British boy refused entry to UK says she is ‘dead inside’ British boy refused entry to UK on return from holiday“Whatever has happened has to be sorted out here in the UK. It was shocking for me that the government, based on fundamental principles of human rights and values, has committed such a massive mistake. But I’m also very glad that they corrected the mistake swiftly.”Asked what the experience has been like for Mohamed, Mr Diallo said: “He’s been frustrated, especially when the kids in Brussels had to go back to school. He was alone. I was busy trying to sort things out so he had to stay with my mum who’s an elderly lady.“He was always asking questions: why am I still here? Why am I not back in Sheffield? Why can’t I see my mum?“I don’t wish any kid at all, on this planet, to go through what Mohamed has gone through.”Hawa Keita)Ms Keita, who is of Guinean origin and lives in Sheffield, said last week that the situation had made her feel “dead inside”. She denied Home Office claims that she received a letter in March stating her son’s passport had been revoked.The letter, which Ms Keita said she saw for the first time by email on 28 August, states that the child’s claim to British citizenship was no longer valid because it had “come to light” that the man she was married to at the time of his birth was not settled in Britain.But Ms Keita said that this man was her Guinea-based ex-husband whom she was in the process of orcing. She explained that she had moved to the UK and was living with another partner a British man and the father of Mohamed.UK news in picturesAlastair Cook celebrates his century in his last ever innings playing for England during the fourth day of the fifth test cricket match against India at The Oval.

Of these women, 20 were removed from the UK directly from detention.The figures come\u0026nbspafter a report by Stephen Shaw in January 2016, commissioned by the Home Office, called for the “presumptive exclusion” from detention for pregnant women to be replaced with an “absolute exclusion”.Red Cross calls for overhaul of UK’s immigration detention systemUN backs calls for time limit on UK immigration detentionThousands locked in immigration centres in ‘unacceptable’ conditionsIn the review, Mr Shaw cited evidence from the Royal College of Midwives of the “special vulnerability” of pregnant women and the organisation’s warning that “appropriate maternity care could not be given to women in detention”.\u0026nbspThe report found that pregnant women had miscarried in Yarl’s Wood. It also cited an incident of a pregnant woman being detained at the same time as two men with suspected scabies.In response to the findings, the Home Office\u0026nbspenacted a 72-hour time limit on detention of pregnant women, extendable to up to a week\u0026nbspwith ministerial authorisation. But the department refused to implement a\u0026nbsptotal ban.“This new approach and our wider reforms strike the right balance between safeguarding pregnant women and vulnerable people, and maintaining effective and proportionate immigration control.”The latest statistics suggest that the numbers of pregnant women in immigration detention have fallen substantially – by around 50 per cent –\u0026nbspsince the time limit was implemented in 2016.\u0026nbspBut lawyers and campaigners\u0026nbspsaid it was a “disgrace” that pregnant women\u0026nbspcontinue\u0026nbspto be detained despite independent expert advice that it can be harmful for their mental and physical health.\u0026nbspResponding to the figures, Labour’s shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said:\u0026nbsp“This treatment of pregnant women is a disgrace. It completely flouts the independent expert advice that the government has received.”Patrick Page, a senior caseworker in public law at Duncan Lewis,\u0026nbspsaid in many cases\u0026nbspthe detention of pregnant women only served to “instil fear”.“Having represented women in this situation, I know that 100 detained pregnant women means 100 shocking arrests, 100 degrading and disorienting journeys to detention centres, 100 experiences of poor or nonexistent antenatal care in detention, of poor food and thin mattresses\u0026nbsp100 pregnant women worrying that their stress will affect the health of their unborn baby, 100 women who will carry this ordeal with them forever,” he said.“And for what purpose, when the vast majority are eventually released, except to instil fear? Ultimately, detention itself is inhumane, and the detention of pregnant women is just one of its more repugnant features.”Angela Crawley, the\u0026nbspSNP\u0026nbspMP who submitted the written question, said there was “no justification” for detaining pregnant women in immigration facilities.\u0026nbsp“Pregnant women are vulnerable and will almost always have specific, and sometimes serious, healthcare needs,” she added.In his follow-up report, published in July 2018, Mr Shaw acknowledged that the change in the law had led to a “significant reduction” in the number of pregnant women detained, and said he “appreciated” that it may not be immediately obvious that a woman is pregnant.But he maintained his recommendation that the detention of pregnant women is completely banned, adding: “Nonetheless, I think it would assist decisionmaking if the default position were to be an absolute exclusion of pregnant women from detention.”Natasha Walter, director of Women for Refugee Women, which submitted evidence to the Shaw report and campaigns for an end to the detention of pregnant women, said the reduction was a “step in the right direction”, but said the government could go much further.\u0026nbsp“There is no need for the use of immigration detention, particularly for such a vulnerable group of women. The vast majority of pregnant women who are held in detention are not removed from the UK, but are released back into the community to continue with their cases,” she said.“Evidence shows that detention is harmful for the mental and physical health of pregnant women. It would be much more humane – and more straightforward and less expensive – to ensure that they could live in the community while their cases are resolved, without the trauma of detention.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “Detention is used sparingly and we operate a strong presumption in favour of liberty.“The adults-at-risk policy aims to ensure that those iniduals who are most vulnerable to harm are less likely to be detained and that\u0026nbspif detention is necessary\u0026nbspit will be for the shortest time possible.”Asylum and ImmigrationEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2017/09/06/17/inequality-1.jpg","title":"uk rich poor health inequality life expectancy england","story":"Created with Sketch.Health inequalities across the nation revealed by Public Health EnglandClick to followThe IndependentThose in the most deprived areas have higher death rates for heart disease, chronic respiratory diseases and cancerPeople in the richest areas of England have 19 more years of good health than those in the poorest areas, according to a new report.While average life expectancy has reached 83.2 years for women and 79.6 years for men, there are “stubborn inequalities” between different parts of the country, says\u0026nbspPublic Health England (PHE).Those in the most deprived areas have higher death rates for heart disease, chronic respiratory diseases and cancer, partly as a result of smoking and obesity problems.Children are twice as likely to be born with low birthweight and more than three times as likely to suffer tooth decay.“Inequalities in health undermine not only the health of the people but also our economy,” said Duncan\u0026nbspSelbie, chief executive at\u0026nbspPHE.Rise in life expectancy slowing down in the UK, figures showMen could have same life expectancy as women by 2030s, research findsMiddle-aged drinkers should have alcohol-free days, health chiefs urgeEating red meat and cheese can help heart health, scientists claim“As we work to develop the NHS long term plan, we must set the ambition high.“If done right, with prevention at its centrepiece, the payoff of a healthier society and more sustainable NHS will be huge.”The Health Profile for England, released by PHE on Tuesday, also reveals women are dying earlier in the UK than in most EU countries.UK women rank 18th\u0026nbspout of 28 for life expectancy while UK men fared better at 10th.In England women spend 19.3 years, or just over 23 per cent of their lives, in poor health, compared to 16.2 years (around 20 per cent) for men.Low back and neck pain and skin diseases – including dermatitis, acne and psoriasis – are the two leading causes of morbidity for men and women. Hearing and sight loss also rank highly for both sexes.These common illnesses and disabilities are increasingly important because they cause a significant burden to health and care services, said Professor John Newton, director of health improvement at PHE.“The NHS needs to respond to these changes,” he warned.“In many ways it needs to respond more quickly than anytime in its history, because the speed of the change in these data, in the epidemiology is really quite remarkable.”The worst jobs for your health110 10.

So today I want to give the prime minister fair warning.

But neither the Department for International Development (Dfid), which has provided the charity with £6m in funding over the past three years, nor the Charity Commission were made aware of the allegations\u0026nbspuncovered by The Independent\u0026nbspuntil two months ago.Despite the revelations, Dfid\u0026nbspsaid it would continue to fund Restless Development.The allegations come\u0026nbspin the wake of the Oxfam scandal –\u0026nbspin which the organisation covered up predatory sexual behaviour following the Haiti earthquake\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspand subsequent criticism of the charity sector’s lack of transparency.The latest accusations\u0026nbspare specific to Restless Development’s operations under the International Citizen Service (ICS) – a government-funded programme which offers overseas placements, typically three months long, for 18- to 25-year-olds. Working in countries including South Africa, Tanzania and Bangladesh, ICS volunteers help set up schools, improve access to safe water and educate locals on health and hygiene.But young British people who volunteered in South Africa in 2012 and 2016 – after raising £800 of funding themselves – claim\u0026nbspstaff and other volunteers were involved in sexual relationships. They also said\u0026nbspthey were forced to stay in unsafe living quarters, told to travel with drunk drivers, and exposed to “unprecedented” violence between feuding taxi gangs.Those who raised the alarm say management\u0026nbspdismissed their concerns and “swept them under the carpet”.In 2016, two male volunteers in Libode, South Africa, allegedly engaged in relationships with female pupils they had been teaching in an ICS-associated school.Restless Development was made aware of the incident only when its London office was alerted\u0026nbspby a British volunteer’s parent. The charity admitted the students involved were taken back to the volunteers’ host homes, but claimed no sexual activity took place and\u0026nbspsaid\u0026nbspthe pupils were over the age of consent. The two male volunteers were subsequently dismissed.During the same placement – which was based in three towns in south-east South Africa – it was also alleged\u0026nbspa team leader had relationships with a string of volunteers, breaching the charity’s code of conduct.A staff member was additionally accused of sexual relations with a female British volunteer, while a\u0026nbspfield officer reportedly asked volunteers for money so she\u0026nbspcould buy alcohol. When not working in the community, volunteers are alleged to have repeatedly left their host homes to get drunk – despite being warned the area was dangerousRestless Development denies the allegations of sexual misconduct.\u0026nbspWorld news in picturesAn Indian man makes his way through floodwaters from the overflowing Panchanai River in Siliguri.

Restless Development said it subsequently strengthened its security protocols.Four years later, safety concerns were raised again – this time relating to dangerous transportation in Libode. Volunteers were expected to travel in taxis involved in violent feuds between rival drivers\u0026nbspthat saw a number of fatal shootings in the area. Volunteers said they were not told in advance about the risks. On two separate occasions, they were allegedly told to travel with a drunk taxi driver, though the charity says the issue was “resolved” at the time.Restless Development said “immediate action” was taken to address the “unprecedented” violence between taxi drivers and subsequently decided to stop bringing volunteers to the area.One British volunteer who worked in the charity’s Tanzanian office told\u0026nbspThe Independent that safety in general is a concern across the entire ICS programme – despite the mitigations put in place.Volunteers from 2016 also claim their concerns were dismissed by senior staff in South Africa, who put complaints down to a “failure to adapt” to circumstances. The volunteers said grievances were repeatedly “brushed under the carpet” and insist the London head office was alerted only to the most serious incidents.Issues with handling of complaints were not restricted to South Africa – one volunteer in Zambia “felt that volunteers were encouraged by staff to keep incidents to themselves so as to not scare the other volunteers”.Restless Development said it has phone lines set up in London and overseas specifically for volunteers to report concerns.But a former Youth Stops AIDS (YSA) employee who worked with Restless Development’s London team accused the organisation’s head office of “a lack of professionalism” and said they were not surprised by the allegations.A former UN employee echoed a similar sentiment, saying\u0026nbspthat the complaints made against Restless Development are not uncommon within international development.“Similar abuses occur in international development, some of which I, unfortunately, observed although to a much lesser degree,” he said. “The cases vary from minor abuse of authority to outright harassment.”Vicky Browning, CEO of the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations, admitted it was impossible to eradicate the sort of incidents seen in South Africa under Restless Development.AFPGetty)“Sadly we cannot guarantee zero incidents,” she said. “What we can do is make sure there is zero tolerance. We will not accept or allow it, we will not hide it – and we will deal with it.”\u0026nbspThe ICS scheme, which has provided placements for more than 17,000 British volunteers since it began in 2012, received £145m from the government – 90 per cent of its budget – between 2011 and 2018. Separately, Dfid\u0026nbsphas provided Restless Development with £6,392,267 over the past three financial years.Having been alerted in July to the allegations uncovered by The Independent, the Charity Commission said the “safeguarding related incident in South Africa in 2016” is now “being considered as part of our wider assessment to ensure that appropriate action has been taken.”Restless Development, however, claims it found no evidence to support any allegations of sexual misconduct. It said a “small number of volunteers” were disciplined for alcohol consumption, while an intern field officer who asked for money for alcohol was dismissed for inappropriate behaviour. On accusations of a lack of professionalism, it said: “Professionalism is built into our work and our values, and they are core to who we are and what we do.”Department for International DevelopmentEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log in"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/05/09/Ayanna-Pressley.jpg  width= 2346  height= 1760  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/05/09/Ayanna-Pressley.jpg","title":"democratic party grassroots left 2018 midterms ayanna pressley alexandria ocasio cortez","story":"Created with Sketch.Candidates Ayanna\u0026nbspPressley\u0026nbspand Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u0026nbsphave toppled establishment Democrats with openly progressive campaignsClick to followThe Independent USDemocratic Party primaries have seen a string of shock victories for campaigns led by grassroots left groupsHow grassroots left is reshaping Democratic Party ahead of 2018 midtermsWhen Ayanna Pressley topped a 10-term congressman in a Massachusetts district once represented by John Fitzgerald Kennedy, she became the latest face of a burgeoning movement of the grassroots left. This is a fight for the soul of our party and the future of our democracy, Ms Pressley said. That movement is reshaping a Democratic Party still searching for leaders and identity in the era of Donald Trump.\u0026nbspGrassroots activists on the left have a mixed record in Democratic primaries this election year, but the self-described progressive movement has scored enough victories to suggest its popularity is based on more than just protesting the Trump White House. The movement is also remoulding the Democratic Party into a younger, more erse and decidedly liberal party.\u0026nbspAyanna Pressley and New York\u0027s Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, two women of colour, both defeated Democratic incumbent congressmen in their primaries. The progressive movement has helped nominate three black Democrats for governor\u0027s seats, including a clear upset in Florida, where Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum knocked off establishment favourite Gwen Graham. Mr Graham\u0027s establishment credentials could not have been stronger. Her father, Bob, is a Florida icon who served as governor and US senator.\u0026nbspGeorgia\u0027s Stacey Abrams, meanwhile, trounced a primary opponent recruited and backed by much of her state\u0027s Democratic old guard. Ms Abrams would become the first black woman elected governor in any US state.\u0026nbspScores of other down-ballot candidates are running for local, state and federal offices with backing from grassroots groups like Inisible, MoveOn.org, the Working Families Party and the offshoot of Bernie Sanders\u0027 2016 presidential campaign, Our Revolution.\u0026nbspWhy it mattersThe ersifying, more liberal slate will be measured by the outcome in the November vote.\u0026nbspRepublicans — and some Democrats — argue that the party is going too far to the left for American voters, particularly outside of the cities and close-in suburbs where Democrats\u0027 base of white liberals and non-white voters is concentrated.\u0026nbspProgressive nominees like Ms Pressley and Ms Ocasio-Cortez are running in Democratic strongholds, so their wins in November are all but guaranteed. But Republicans will use the rise of the left — and its support for policies like single-payer health care and scrapping US Immigration and Customs Enforcement — to tar all Democratic candidates.\u0026nbspThe counter argument from Democrats and activists on the left is two-fold: 1) Many issues that more liberal candidates support — some gun regulation, expanding Medicaid, raising the minimum wage — actually have widespread public support, even among independents and some Republicans and 2) the more openly liberal candidates from outside the old-guard establishment can bring in new voters who do not regularly cast midterm ballots.\u0026nbspBeyond November, the new generation of Democrats will have a say in how the party governs. Ms Pressley and Ms Ocasio-Cortez will not determine whether Democrats pick up the 23 new House seats they need for a majority, but they will help shape the arguments within the Democratic caucus.\u0026nbspThey and their fellow freshmen will have a say in whether a new Democratic majority returns Nancy Pelosi to the speaker\u0027s chair. They will have leverage — much like the arch-conservative Freedom Caucus does with the House GOP leadership — over every debate, from health care to the potential impeachment of Mr Trump.\u0026nbspSo, for example, while there might not be enough support for a real push toward single-payer health care, the movement could draw the party toward supporting a public health insurance option to compete alongside for-profit companies selling policies in Affordable Care Act exchanges. And, even if an immediate $15 minimum wage is too heavy a lift, perhaps the left-flank forces a compromise of graduated raises over time.\u0026nbspWhat to watch out for\u0026nbspDelaware Democrat challenges incumbent as part of \u0027blue tsunami\u0027Democrats take double-digit lead over Republicans ahead of midtermsDemocrats need to focus on young people in the 2018 midterm elections Trump unprepared for impeachment and Democratic takeover: reportSanders-backed progressive could become Florida\u0027s first black governorBefore primary season concludes, there are a few more key match-ups to measure the left\u0027s influence. In Delaware, military veteran and activist Kerri Evelyn Harris is aiming on Thursday to knock off moderate Democratic Senator Tom Carper. She is a big underdog, but even a competitive finish will serve notice anew that incumbents must at least contend with the left base. Similar dynamics exist in New York, where actress Cynthia Nixon is trying to topple Governor Andrew Cuomo in a 13 September primary.\u0026nbspSome of the most intent observers of the party\u0027s evolution are the gaggle of aspiring presidential candidates. Certainly, some of those figures have helped drive the shift — Mr Sanders and his 2016 campaign, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and her outspoken economic populism.\u0026nbspBut Mr Sanders, Ms Warren and the rest are also careful to watch the base and not get caught flat-footed as it evolves. That is one reason potential candidates like Senators Cory Booker and Kamala Harris and former Vice President Joe Biden have made sure that their endorsement and campaign finance activity this midterm cycle has ned the spectrum of the party\u0027s down-ballot candidates: If the so-called progressive movement becomes the centre of the party, no one who wants to be the Democratic presidential nominee boxed out.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/03/07/gettyimages-951829602.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/03/07/gettyimages-951829602.jpg","title":"china muslims uighur reeducation islam xi jinping communist party xinjiang","story":"Created with Sketch.Communist Party denies unfairly detaining Muslims\u0026nbspbut crackdown\u0026nbspdescribed as brainwashing by critics and witnessesClick to followThe IndependentReleased detainees say they were forced to listen to lectures, sing pro-communist hymns and write \u0027self-criticism\u0027 essaysInside China’s ‘re-education centres’ where Uighur Muslims are pressured to give up IslamOn the edge of a desert in far western China, an imposing building sits behind a fence topped with barbed wire.Large red characters on the facade urge people to learn Chinese, study law and acquire job skills. Guards make clear that visitors are not welcome.Inside, hundreds of ethnic Uighur Muslims spend their days in a high-pressure indoctrination programme, where they are forced to listen to lectures, sing hymns praising the Chinese Communist Party and write “self-criticism” essays, according to detainees who have been released.The goal is to rid them of devotion to Islam.Abdusalam Muhemet, 41, said the police detained him for reciting a verse of the Quran at a funeral. After two months in a nearby camp, he and more than 30 others were ordered to renounce their past lives. Mr Muhemet said he went along but quietly seethed.“That was not a place for getting rid of extremism,” he recalled. “That was a place that will breed vengeful feelings and erase Uighur identity.”This camp outside Hotan, an ancient oasis town in the Taklamakan Desert, is one of hundreds that China has built in the past few years. It is part of a campaign of breath-taking scale and ferocity that has swept up hundreds of thousands of Chinese Muslims for weeks or months of what critics describe as brainwashing, usually without criminal charges.Though limited to China’s western region of Xinjiang, it is the country’s most sweeping internment programme since the Mao era – and the focus of a growing chorus of international criticism.China has sought for decades to restrict the practice of Islam and maintain an iron grip in Xinjiang, a region almost as big as Alaska where more than half the population of 24 million belongs to Muslim ethnic minority groups. Most are Uighurs, whose religion, language and culture, along with a history of independence movements and resistance to Chinese rule, have long unnerved Beijing.After a succession of violent anti-government attacks reached a peak in 2014, Xi Jinping, chief of the Communist Party, sharply escalated the crackdown, orchestrating an unforgiving drive to turn ethnic Uighurs and other Muslim minorities into loyal citizens and supporters of the party.“Xinjiang is in an active period of terrorist activities, intense struggle against separatism and painful intervention to treat this,” Mr Xi told officials, according to reports in the state news media in 2017.In addition to the mass detentions, officials have intensified the use of informers and expanded police surveillance, even installing cameras in some people’s homes.Human rights activists and experts say the campaign has traumatised Uighur society, leaving behind fractured communities and families.“Penetration of everyday life is almost really total now,” said Michael Clarke, an expert on Xinjiang at Australian National University in Canberra, Australia\u0027s capital. “You have ethnic identity, Uighur identity in particular, being singled out as this kind of pathology.”China has categorically denied reports of abuses in Xinjiang. At a meeting of a UN panel in Geneva last month, it said it does not operate re-education camps and described the facilities in question as mild corrective institutions that provide job training.“There is no arbitrary detention,” Hu Lianhe, an official with a role in Xinjiang policy, told the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. “There is no such thing as re-education centres.”World news in picturesParticipants wave flowers as they march past a balcony from where North Korea\u0027s leader Kim Jong Un was watching, during a mass rally on Kim Il Sung square in Pyongyang.

Their accounts were echoed in interviews with more than a dozen Uighurs with relatives who were in the camps or had disappeared, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid government retaliation.The Times also discovered reports online written by teams of Chinese officials who were assigned to monitor families with detained relatives and a 2017 study that said officials in some parts of Xinjiang were indiscriminately sending ethnic Uighurs to the camps to meet numerical quotas.The study, by Qiu Yuanyuan, a scholar at the Xinjiang Party School, where officials are trained, warned that the detentions could backfire and fan radicalism. “Recklessly setting quantitative goals for transformation through education has been erroneously used” in some areas, she wrote. “The targeting is imprecise, and the scope has been expanding.”The Xinjiang government issued “de-radicalisation” rules in 2017 that gave vague authorisation for the camps and many counties now run several of them, according to government documents, including requests for bids from construction companies to build them.In government documents, local officials sometimes liken inmates to patients requiring isolation and emergency intervention.“Anyone infected with an ideological ‘virus’ must be swiftly sent for the ‘residential care’ of transformation-through-education classes before illness arises, a document issued by party officials in Hotan said.The number of Uighurs, as well as Kazakhs and other Muslim minorities, who have been detained in the camps is unclear. Estimates range from several hundred thousand to perhaps one\u0026nbspmillion, with exiled Uighur groups say the number is even higher.China bans \u0027extremist\u0027 Islamic baby names in Muslim provinceThousands protest China\u0027s plans to demolish mosqueChina\u0027s Uighur minority shackled by technology as thousands detainedInternational community silent as China continues religious crackdownChina \u0027forced Muslims to eat pork and drink alcohol\u0027The Chinese government says it is winning a war against Islamic extremism and separatism, which it blames for attacks that have killed hundreds in recent years. Information about such violence is censored and incomplete, but incidents appear to have fallen off sharply since 2014.Still, many who have emerged from the indoctrination program say it has hardened public attitudes against Beijing.“It was of absolutely no use,” Omurbek Eli, a Kazakh businessman, said of his time held in a camp in 2017. “The outcome will be the opposite. They will become even more resistant to Chinese influence.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/21/18/high-street-closures-0.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/21/18/high-street-closures-0.jpg","title":"brexit shipping panic belgium zeebrugge plans no deal tariffs border control","story":"Created with Sketch.\u0027It is scary, now, all companies around here and on the continent, they start to be worried\u0027Click to followThe IndependentEuropean shipping firms begin panicking about no-deal Brexit: \u0027Okay, it could be serious\u0027With arms flailing and raised voices, a shipping manager and a customs chief in the Belgian port of Zeebrugge talk through all the things that could go wrong if the Brexit talks fail.Trucks backed up for miles on the highway. Car manufacturing plants idled as deliveries are delayed. Mountains of paperwork paralysing small companies that can\u0027t afford teams of lawyers.Not since the 1970s have port towns like this had to deal with customs in their massive trade with Britain, and that could change on Brexit day on 30 March\u0026nbsp2019. Britain and the European Union are struggling to agree on the terms of business after that date, raising the chances of a sudden return of tariffs and border controls. And while Brexit has not so far been a big concern for many people in continental Europe, the prospect of there being no deal is starting to unnerve companies and authorities – particularly in places like ports that operate on the front lines of global trade.“It is scary,” says Marc Adriansens, the managing director of the ICO car shipping company. “Now, all companies around here and on the continent, they start to be worried. And they say: ‘Okay, it could be serious\u0027.”Kristian Vanderwaeren, the administrator-general of Belgian customs, says this will cost companies a lot to prepare for. “It\u0027s a huge, huge problem,” he says.Ominous warnings of what would happen if trade is suddenly disrupted between Britain and the EU have dominated headlines since the campaign before the Brexit vote in June 2016.The aim for both Britain and the EU is to agree on the terms of future trade as well as on two-year transition period after Brexit day that would give companies and governments more time to adapt to any new rules.The lack of progress is raising the risk of Britain falling out with no agreed terms, a feared situation called variously a “hard”, “no-deal” or “cliff-edge” Brexit.What is at stake is visible during Mr Vanderwaeren\u0027s check of the port – in the brisk traffic of trucks on the aptly-named Britannia dock. Everything from engine parts to orange juice is lined up for transport to Britain, part of the half-a-trillion pounds in goods and services traded between the continent and the UK\u0026nbspevery year.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesJohn Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

I see it as a huge big exercise of trust and I do believe everyone breathed a sigh of relief’A bus stop and red post box stand in the border town of Jonesborough, Co ArmaghEver since the Middle Ages, ships from England have been mooring on the Flemish coast to unload wool and pick up local cloth and other goods from European partners far and wide.Commerce has grown over time and Zeebrugge is now the port that handles the most cars anywhere in the world, with about 2.8 million rolling through every year – one million of which are to and from Britain.The local authorities are getting ready for the worst of Brexit outcomes to protect that business.Joachim Coens, the CEO of Zeebrugge port, says that if tariffs and customs checks on trade with Britain do in fact return, new digital technologies can be used to smoothen out border controls somewhat.Mr Vanderwaeren plans to double the number of customs officers in Zeebrugge by hiring another 140 to check the Belgian border. The IT system has been upgraded, scanning machines for customs checks have been bought and more sniffer dogs will be made available.“We are preparing for a Brexit-proof port,” said Mr Coens.The Republic of Ireland, an EU member country, gets most of its goods transported through UK\u0026nbspterritory and has sought to ensure it is not cut off from the rest of the bloc because of Britain\u0027s exit.It got help from a new ship, formally called the “Celine” but also dubbed “the Brexit Buster”. that will be able to transport goods directly between Dublin and Belgium, bypassing Britain.Irish taoiseach Leo Varadkar was on hand when the ship, which is 234 meters\u0026nbsplong and has nine decks big enough to carry vehicles, was christened in April.Brexit will fail regardless of Boris Johnson and Theresa May\u0027s jabsWe know Brexit will disrupt healthcare, shouldn’t we get a Final Say?Turtles, whales and birds under threat from Brexit funding cutsDrop hard Brexit or we\u0027ll back public vote, trade unions tell MayNo-deal Brexit \u0027could lead to the military on the streets\u0027That will not be enough, however, to soften the impact of a “hard” Brexit on Zeebrugge, where nearly half of all goods shipped through the port either goes to or comes from Britain.Mr Adriansens says his company handles half of the one\u0026nbspmillion cars traded annually with Britain through the port.After the Brexit vote in 2016, sales went down by 15 per cent and have not recovered. He says there could be another 20 per cent drop if Brexit happens without a trade deal.“Out of the 500,000, this is 100,000 cars...This is something we don\u0027t like to lose, but we cannot control that,” he said.Beyond the volume of business, the speed of transport is also key, not just for perishable goods like food that can rot if left in containers but also for manufacturing products.Modern car plants, for example, do not store many parts on location, meaning their production schedule depends entirely on the timely delivery of the parts, often from various countries.That production could get held up if Brexit creates traffic jams on both sides of the channel.About 4,000 trucks drive through Zeebrugge to Britain, says Mr Coens.“If they are even blocked for a few hours then you have 60 kilometres (40 miles) of blockage,” Mr Coens added. “Nobody wants that.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/10/17/india-flooding.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-3906401  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt=   srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/10/17/india-flooding.jpg","title":"sweden democrats election exit poll latest social democratic party far right moderates","story":"Created with Sketch.Click to followThe IndependentSweden Democrats: Far-right party claims victory despite third-place finish in general electionThe leader of a far-right party with roots in the neo-Nazi movement says it has “won” Sweden’s national election, after preliminary results showed it secured more than a sixth of the vote.\u0026nbspAfter a campaign dominated by debates over immigration, 17.6 per cent of the electorate opted for anti-immigrant party the Sweden Democrats, up from 12.9\u0026nbspper cent in the last election.\u0026nbspVoters simultaneously handed Sweden’s ruling Social Democratic Party its worst-ever election result – 28.4 per cent as the count neared completion – though that was still enough to leave it the single largest party in the Riksdag, Sweden’s parliament.\u0026nbspHung parliament looms as far-right sees rise in supportMajor gains expected for far-right party as Sweden goes to pollsHow a nationalist, anti-immigrant party took root in liberal SwedenThe ruling Social Democrats, Greens and Left Party coalition won 40.6 per cent\u0026nbspof the votes while the opposition bloc made of the Moderates, the Christian Democrats and the Centre Party and the Liberals won 40.3 per cent\u0026nbspof the votes.The potential for an immigration backlash resulting in a big boost for the Sweden Democrats inspired fear among many Swedes before the election.

We must gather all good forces. We won’t mourn, we will organise ourselves.”Final election returns were expected later in the week.

More than 300 firefighters, five aircraft and two helicopters were mobilised to tackle the extremely difficult situation due to strong gusts of wind, Athens fire chief Achille Tzouvaras saidThe elections are far from over\u0026nbsphowever, as there will be a drawn out period of negotiations between the centre-left and centre-right blocs requiring cross bloc alliances to be formed, or a joining of forces with the\u0026nbspinsurgent Sweden Democrats, a move which is unpopular with most parties.The preliminary results made it unlikely any party would secure a majority of 175 seats in the 349-seat Riksdag. It could take weeks or months of coalition talks before the next government is formed.Both the left-leaning bloc led by the Social Democrats and the centre-right bloc in which the Moderates is largest of four parties have said they would refuse to consider the Sweden Democrats as a coalition partner.Sweden – home to the Nobel prizes and militarily neutral for the better part of two centuries – has been known for its comparatively open doors to migrants and refugees.Sunday’s general election was the first since the country of 10 million took in a record 163,000 refugees in 2015 as mass migration to Europe rose dramatically.Mr Lofven eventually said Sweden could no longer cope with the influx and immigration laws were tightened.\u0026nbspPartyNumber of seatsNumber of seats in previous electionSocial Democrats\u0026nbsp101\u0026nbsp113Green Party\u0026nbsp15\u0026nbsp25Left Party\u0026nbsp28\u0026nbsp21Centre-left bloc\u0026nbsp144\u0026nbsp159Moderates\u0026nbsp70\u0026nbsp84Centre Party\u0026nbsp31\u0026nbsp22Liberals\u0026nbsp19\u0026nbsp19Christian Democrats\u0026nbsp23\u0026nbsp16Centre-right bloc\u0026nbsp143\u0026nbsp143Sweden Democrats\u0026nbsp62\u0026nbsp49Like other far-right parties in Europe, the Sweden Democrats, which first entered parliament in 2010, has strived to mend its public image in recent years in a bid to garner more supporters.Sweden Democrats\u0026nbspleader, Jimmie Åkesson, has claimed there is no place for racism in the party and has expelled\u0026nbspsome members for expressing pro-Nazi views. He has also changed the old party symbol, a flaming torch, into a softer looking blue and yellow flower.He has also, however, infamously called Sweden’s growing Muslim population “the biggest foreign threat since the Second World War”.His party presented the vote on Sunday as a ballot on hot button issues including immigration and Sweden’s famous welfare system.The party\u0026nbspmade its first mark in politics by gaining\u0026nbspmunicipal council seats in 2006, and since then slowly helped revise long-accepted social norms for what Swedes could say openly about foreigners and integration without being considered racist.At a post-election rally, Mr\u0026nbspÅkesson said the party’s improvement on the 12.9 per cent\u0026nbspit scored in 2014 represented victory.“No one can take that away from us,” he said. “We will have an immense influence over what happens in Sweden in the coming weeks, months, years.”He also criticised Mr Lofven’s government for “prioritising” the needs of new immigrants over the ones of Swedish citizens.“We won,” he said as he declared the estimated 14 parliament seats the Sweden Democrats picked up a victory other parties could not ignore in coalition negotiations.“This party has increased and made the biggest gains. Everything is about us,” Mr Åkesson said. “I am ready to talk with others.”Although Sweden\u0026nbsphas long been lauded as a bastion of liberal values, fears of straining its generous welfare system prompted a wave of anti-immigrant sentiment in recent yearsIn May, the government announced plans to cut, almost by half, the number of refugees and migrants entering the country.This may mean some kind of accommodation of the Sweden Democrats may be likely –\u0026nbspif not now, then some time in the future.Many therefore believe\u0026nbspthe Moderate Party leader, Mr Kristersson will seek to form a minority centre-right administration with ad hoc parliamentary support from the Sweden Democrats and\u0026nbsppossibly an official alliance with the Christian Democrats.What any\u0026nbspagreement could look like remains to be seen and according to Nicholas Aylott professor of political science at Södertörn university could result in “a rather extreme form of minority government – one whose only party has attained just a quarter or even a tenth of the seats in parliament.”And though this situation has been brought about by the rise of the Sweden democrats and\u0026nbspother parties struggles on how to manage their presence in parliament, some observers say that the patterns of voting this election does not necessarily indicate the rise of the right wing.”The aggregate movement of voters does not say everything about the way in which voters have shifted parties from the previous election to today. The losses of the social democrats are not necessarily the gains of the radical right.” Professor Sarah De Lange, from\u0026nbspthe University of Amsterdam, who specialise in\u0026nbsppopulist\u0026nbsp and\u0026nbspradical movements. “More striking than the gains and losses of inidual parties is the further fragmentation of the party system. The bigger parties are getting smaller and the smaller parties getting bigger.”“Instead, the voters that have deserted the social democrats and the mainstream right are likely to have left to a variety of parties for a variety of reasons,” Ms\u0026nbspDe Lange addedOthers believe if a shift does not occur in Swedish politics then the Sweden Democrats are likely to continue to make larger gains similar to other far right parties across Europe.“If things carry on as they are going, it will happen,” said Ann-Cathrine Jungar, a far-right specialist at Södertörn University. “In Denmark, Norway, Austria, the far right is now accepted by the centre right. I can see that here one day.”Swedish Journalist Alex Valencia Rodallec agrees: “If the other parties can break the block system this might mean Sweden Democrats’s decline. This is still a win for them so everything depends on the other parties. If they keep adopting SD’s policies then we will see a continued growth”.\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/30/18/jimmie-akesson.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/30/18/jimmie-akesson.jpg","title":"swedish election exit poll latest sweden democrats far right result votes","story":"Created with Sketch.Anti-immigration nationalist party would be second-largest in parliamentClick to followThe IndependentLeader of far-right Sweden Democrats says result is a \u0027win\u0027 for his partySweden election: Hung parliament looms as far-right Sweden Democrats see biggest rise in supportSweden\u0027s ruling centre-left party\u0026nbspis leading in preliminary results but achieved its worst ever share of the ballot in a general\u0026nbspelection, as\u0026nbspnearly\u0026nbspa fifth of voters backed the far-right Sweden Democrats.As the count neared completion on Monday morning, all indications are that it will be\u0026nbspa hung parliament with\u0026nbspthe ruling Social Democrats\u0026nbspleading on 28.4 per cent of the vote.Put together with their\u0026nbspleft-leaning coalition partners, the left looks to have\u0026nbspgained 40.6 per cent of the vote, compared to\u0026nbsp40.3 per cent for\u0026nbspthe opposition centre-right Alliance - a deadlock that is likely to lead to weeks of wrangling before a majority government can be agreed.Of the remaining votes, some 17.6 per cent went\u0026nbspto the Sweden Democrats, a party with roots in the white supremacist fringe that has previously been described as neo-Nazi.\u0026nbspTheir result is\u0026nbspeither better or worse than predicted, depending on the poll, but\u0026nbspregardless means they have secured\u0026nbspfar greater support than in the previous election four years ago when they won 12.9 per cent.Speaking at a party rally Mr Lovfen said he would continue to “work on calmly” as prime minister until a new government formed.Sounding sombre and firm, Mr Lofven told his supporters the election presented a situation that all responsible parties must deal with, adding that a party with roots in Nazism would never ever offer anything responsible, but hatred.We have a moral responsibility. We must gather all good forces. We won\u0027t mourn, we will organise ourselves, he said.Acrimony between the two main political blocs has defined Swedish politics for decades, and the rise of the Sweden Democrats – considered pariahs in parliament\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbsphas complicated the political landscape. Both blocs have said they will not accept the party in their groupings.Jan Bjorklund, the leader of the centrist Liberal Party, said he wanted a centre-right government but ruled out working with the Sweden Democrats.In 2015, the Swedish government allowed 163,000 migrants into the country with a population of 10 million.The number was far lower than the asylum-seekers Germany accepted that year, but the highest per capita of any European nation.Before the election, the rising prospects for the Sweden\u0026nbspDemocrats had many Swedes worried about an erosion of the humanitarian values that have long been a foundation of their country’s identity.World news in picturesParticipants wave flowers as they march past a balcony from where North Korea\u0027s leader Kim Jong Un was watching, during a mass rally on Kim Il Sung square in Pyongyang.

Mystery as huge \u0026lsquoANCIENT CREATURE\u0026rsquo washes up on Russian beachBeyond the reach of other fish they are free of competitors and predators.As the footage clearly shows, there are lots of invertebrate prey down there and the snailfish are the top predator. They seem to be quite active and look very well-fed.Their gelatinous structure means they are perfectly adapted to living at extreme pressure and in fact the hardest structures in their bodies are the bones in their inner ear which give them balance and their teeth.Without the extreme pressure and cold to support their bodies they are extremely fragile and melt rapidly when brought to the surface.The new species of ghostly \u0027snailfish\u0027 were captured on film feeding and interacting (Image: SWNS)He and colleague Dr Alan Jamieson led a team of 40 researchers from 17 nations in an expedition to the Atacama Trench in the Pacific.About 100 miles off the coasts of Peru and Chile, it\u0027s one of the deepest places on Earth.The new fish have been named \u0027the pink, the blue and the purple Atacama Snailfish\u0027.They do not conform to the stereotypical image of a deep sea creature.

After waiting an additional 12 to 24 hours the researchers send an acoustic signal.This releases weights and the lander rises to the surface with the help of flotation - enabling the team to catch specimens and take video footage of life at the bottom of the ocean.On this latest expedition more than 100 hours of video and 11,468 photographs were taken at the seabed.The new fish have been named \u0027the pink, the blue and the purple Atacama Snailfish\u0027 (Image: SWNS)As well as the snailfish, the team also filmed some astonishingly rare footage of long-legged isopods, known as Munnopsids, which are about the size of an adult hand.These crustaceans have small bodies, extraordinarily long legs and swim backwards and upsides down.They propel themselves with paddles on their their \u0027tummies\u0027 - before righting themselves on the seafloor and spreading their long walking legs out like a spider.Dr Linley said: We don\u0027t know what species of munnopsid these are but it\u0027s incredible to have caught them in action in their natural habitat - especially the flip they do as they switch from swimming to walking mode.The snailfish will be featured as part of the Challenger Conference 2018 which kicks off at Newcastle University from today and runs until Friday.

But the British won’t do that.One Brexit red line that Theresa May is adamant that she will never cross is her insistence that no British PM could sign the EU’s proposed text on the Irish border, which would see Northern Ireland become part of the customs territory of the EU.But the two sides need to sort this issue out. For the alternative is no deal, a scenario that neither side is prepared for.One Cabinet minister tells me that “no deal would be almost a state of economic war” between the UK and the EU.This is an exaggeration. But it does show the tensions it would lead to. No deal would also result in the kind of Irish border that both sides say they are keen to avoid.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, is prepared to ­produce a de-dramatised ­version of the backstop.This would concentrate on the 16 areas where the EU thinks there would need to be checks between Britain and Northern Ireland.The hope is that the dry, technical nature of this ­document will make it less controversial.But the UK will still struggle to sign up to this backstop.Why? Because it would still leave the threat of a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the country. The Government COULD accept some regulatory checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. But it COULD NOT accept Northern Ireland being part of a different customs territory to the rest of the country.Senior figures on the UK side are instead mulling an approach where the checks are split three ways between the UK, Northern Ireland and the Republic.Their thinking is that the point of the backstop is to keep the Irish border as it is today but not to create a back door into the EU for goods.If the responsibility for that was split three ways with the UK doing regulatory checks on goods going into Northern Ireland and the Republic taking care to ensure that all goods from the North exported via its ports are properly declared, then you would have a solution that was acceptable to the UK.The EU will be very wary of this idea. It doesn’t want the Irish to have to carry out any additional checks.It also wants to keep the UK in a customs union with the EU, and the Northern Ireland question helps them in their attempt to do this.But the UK should point out that if disagreement over the Irish border prevents any kind of deal, then there will have to be a hard border.The Government is hopeful of making some progress on a deal with the EU at the Salzburg summit later this month. One of those closely involved in the negotiations tells me: “Salzburg won’t be dramatic. But look for a shifting of the plates. They need to give her something to stand up and point to.”What May must avoid is being faced at the end of the negotiations with a choice between staying in a customs union or no deal.A customs union would send Britain out into the world with one hand tied behind its back while no deal would cause real problems in the short-term.BORIS Johnson has received multiple ­communications from the Tory inquiry into his newspaper column on the burka.I understand that the former Foreign Secretary received an initial letter asking him if he wished to say anything in his defence. Those with knowledge of the inquiry say that he responded to that with a vigorous defence of free speech and the need for politicians to be able to take part in these debates.Johnson’s response was met with a further ­communication from the party asking him if he wanted to say anything about his particular ­comments about people wearing the burka ­looking like letter boxes and bank robbers. My information is that Johnson has not responded to this letter. The Tory inquiry simply says that it does not ­comment on ongoing investigations.In truth, this absurd exercise should be dropped. The Tories having an inquiry into the newspaper column of a backbench MP is ridiculous. If it is still dragging on by conference, it could become yet another thing that causes trouble there.Of course, the reason so much attention is paid to Boris Johnson is his status as the members’ favourite to be the next Tory leader. Since quitting over Chequers, he has enjoyed a resurgence in popularity with the party rank and file.Oddly, though, his status as favourite might help Theresa May if a vote of confidence in her was called. As one Cabinet minister explains: “At the moment, there’s a majority against Boris having the top job. So you have to vote for Theresa as you can’t risk him being in the final two.”IN the event of no deal there would be 12 weeks of disruption at the border, ministers will be told on Thursday.Ministers will be summoned to Number 10 for a two-hour Cabinet meeting on no-deal planning.Originally, it had been expected that this meeting would take place at Chequers. But it was then pointed out that this would look like a crisis summit and the idea was shelved.It will be emphasised to ministers that no deal means no deals. In other words, don’t expect a series of workarounds to be agreed between Britain and the EU to keep things ticking over.At best, the Government is hoping for a couple of bilateral deals in areas that are of overwhelming importance to the EU. If no deal does become the most likely scenario, I am told no-deal readiness will become pretty much the sole activity of the civil service.Ministers will also get to discuss a Treasury forecast of the short-term economic impact of no deal. But, rather absurdly, these papers won’t be circulated until Tuesday.THE police and intelligence work that has enabled two Russian operatives to be identified as the lead suspects for the Salisbury attack is impressive.But we shouldn’t kid ourselves that this public exposure will put a stop to Russian mischief.The very decision to use Novichok in the attacks shows that Moscow really didn’t care if it was traced back to Russia.I AM told that the Budget this autumn will not be a dramatic affair.With better than expected tax receipts, Chancellor Philip Hammond should be able to fund an increase in NHS spending without raising the headline rates of tax.However, other tax changes – including to the Enterprise Investment Scheme – are being discussed.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Many of them need to listen to Sir Christopher Meyer, a former Remainer who is now looking forward to a brighter future free of the EU’s iron grip.It is crucial that everybody involved in these next vital months of negotiations is genuinely ambitious about what Britain can be as a truly independent country.We have the fifth-largest economy in the world and we’re a “soft-power” titan.There might be people in Brussels who think we are doomed to failure once we leave — but there shouldn’t be any ­sitting on our side of the table.If the Government prepares us properly for a clean break over the coming months, we’ve no reason to be scared for the future. It will strengthen our hand in negotiations, too.So get on with THAT, Prime Minister.THE Russian bear is roaring, and we don’t seem ready to defend ourselves.Today a respected intelligence expert suggests our border control could have been hacked by Russian spies in the run-up to the Salisbury attack.The Prime Minister has been admirably tough with the Kremlin, even if Jeremy Corbyn and other useful idiots have attempted to undermine her and our ­national security at every turn.But there is no room for complacency.

Catch a tiger by the toe. If he squeals, let him go. Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.”But what you may not know is that the original word used in place of tiger was the N-word.MUMBO JUMBOMeaning: A generic term for confusing or meaningless language.Origin: Historians and etymologists often trace this phrase back to the Mandinka word maamajomboo”, which refers to a masked male dancer who would take part in religious ceremonies.According to the Oxford English Dictionary: “Mumbo Jumbo is a noun and is the name of a grotesque idol said to have been worshipped by some tribes.In its figurative sense, Mumbo Jumbo is an object of senseless veneration or a meaningless ritual.”British explorers of the 1730s were terrified of “Mumbo Jumbo”, as they called him, and found his speech and movements confusing.CHINESE WHISPERSMeaning: A game in which a message is passed along in whispers, often distorted between the start and finish.Origin: The notion of “Chinese whispers” stems from an idea in the 1800s that Chinese people spoke in a way that was deliberately unintelligible. It associates the Chinese language with “confusion” and “incomprehensibility.”Now, the game is more commonly referred to as “the telephone game” in the United States.DRINKING THE KOOL-AIDMeaning: A negative connotation used ironically to refer to caving into peer pressure or persuasion.Origin: The phrase dates back to the 1978 Jonestown deaths, in which hundreds of members of a cult committed suicide together by drinking poison mixed with Kool-Aid, a brand of flavoured drink mix.THE ITISMeaning: A general feeling drowsiness or tiredness.Origin: According to Mic, the phrase “The Itis” actually originates from the word “n*****itis”, which was used in the US to reinforce the stereotype that people of African descent were lazy and didn’t enjoy working.RULE OF THUMBMeaning: A basic rule.Origin: This one isn’t about race, but it’s still pretty sinister. According to the , the phrase dates back to 1886, when Sir Francis Buller ruled that a man could beat his wife with a stick no thicker than his thumb. Hence “rule of thumb.”American author William Safire disputed this story, writing in the New York Times that it actually dated back to 1692.Sir William Hope wrote: “What he doth, he doth by rule of Thumb, and not by Art’’ in “The Complete Fencing Master.”“GOING DUTCH”Meaning: Comes from Dutch treat meaning that they are too stingy to pay for you so you pay for yourself.Origin: Derives from the 17th Century when England and the Netherlands were in conflict.“DUTCH COURAGE”Meaning: Used to imply that the Dutch were so cowardly they needed booze to face things.Origin: This also derives from the 17th Century when England and the Netherlands were in conflict.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Or from carbon dioxide produced when stomach acid mixes with bicarbonate in the small intestine.Or gasses can be produced by bacteria that are located in the large intestine.The smelliest farts are due to sulphur containing gases, one study found.Sixteen healthy adults were fed pinto beans and lactulose, and the smell was evaluated by two judges - yes really, poor things!The good news was in a follow up experiment the researchers found a charcoal lined cushion helped quash the smell of the sulphur gases.And last but not least in the fart news stakes, Prof Collins said its bad news for jet setters.Pressurised cabins on aeroplanes mean youre more likely to pass flatus due to the gas volume expanding at the lower cabin pressure, compared to being on the ground, she said.So what should you do next time youre overcome by the urge to pass wind in a public place?Try to take yourself off to the loo, but whether you make it there or not, Prof Collins said the best thing for your gut health is to just let rip.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

East, where the sun rises, was where medieval Christians looked for the second coming of Christ.Eden is represented by a circular island at the very top of the map surrounded by a ring of fire and separated from the land masses by water.Eve is seen taking fruit from the tree of knowledge from a terrifying serpent perched in the tree.Hereford Cathedral’s commercial director Dominic Harbour said: “The map disarms anybody who stands in front of it.It’s really a cacophony of too much going on at the same time.

I wouldnt necessarily interpret it as helping May.However, the news was welcomed by Eurosceptics who have repeatedly called on Member States to pressurise the hard-line Commission to compromise.Henry Newman, director of the Open Europe think tank and a former advisor to Michael Gove, said: This is long overdue.The EUs only offer is a trade agreement for just Great Britain, essentially annexing Northern Ireland in a separate regulatory and customs regime. Impossible.Even if he is, Theresa May must not follow suit.The Chequers offer is already so over-generous it has triggered Cabinet resignations and Tory mutiny. If Barnier now wants to make it work for fear of a No Deal, it is a signal for us to realise the EU is on the back foot and to extract more concessions.Mrs May must not give an inch over free movement or anything else. Nor commit a penny of our divorce bill without tying it to a decent deal.It would be fatal for her. Chequers looks almost dead as it is. Even if Barnier breathes life into it, many Tories are still vowing to vote it down.Barnier has been overplaying his hand for two years.

On Friday, February 3, 1961, the reservoir overflowed down the spill for the very first time. I remember that day well.She was brought up there from the age of 4 to 13, an only child, with her mother, father and a succession of cats and other animals.The traditional cottage and cow barn were built from granite quarried on the site itself.They were beautiful buildings in a remote wooded valley bottom surrounded by wildlife and a wildflower-filled meadow.Margaret said: It was very beautiful - I cant emphasise that enough: absolutely lovely.But when Margaret was 13, she and her parents moved to her grandparents house at nearby Sancreed where she still lives today.Soon after, Nanquitho was compulsorily purchased and demolished to create a supply of drinking water for the local area.From planning to completion, the dam at Drift took 23 years to build, and between 1938 and 1961 a number of families moved out.Margaret can still see where the Lost Valley once stood from her bedroom window.She remembers the waters drawing back to reveal the skeleton of her old home in the 1970s, the 1990s, and once again, this summer.She said: It was strange to see the ruins: not eerie, but very interesting."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000432749091.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"gibraltar national day celebrations","story":"Todays holiday celebrates the 1967 referendum, when residents voted overwhelmingly in favour of British sovereignty.“Our ancestors came from every shore of the Mediterranean and beyond, from Genoa, Malta, India, North Africa, Britain,” he said.“They built their dreams in the face of adversity.

YEEEEES!”And for what?Stacey Dooley, that’s what. Star of BBC3’s box office smash Stacey Dooley Investigates: Second Chance Sex Offenders and now Stacey Dooley investigates how many people had to Google her name on Sunday morning.She is by no means, though, the most anonymous of the new batch on the 16th series of Strictly, which was quick to remind us of its past triumphs, and equally swift to jog our memories about all the things that remain wrong with this show.Bruno Tonioli is still there, for starters. So’s Tess with those links that all seem to have passed through about ten light-entertainment BBC sub committees, where they’re vetted for any hint of spontaneity.“Swapping the radio studio for the dance studio.”“Swapping the newsroom for the ballroom.”“Ditching the cricket balls for the glitter balls.”Devotees of the show don’t care about these details, of course, and nor do floating viewers if they throw us a single high-profile comedy bone, in the Ed Balls mould, who can transform Strictly Come Dancing into the funniest show on television.Much like last year’s box-ticking frenzy, though, something has gone badly wrong with the booking process again and the class of 2018 has no maverick entertainer, just a lot of people you might vaguely recognise off the telly.Among the slightly more famous contestants there’s dance-trained Pussycat Doll Ashley Roberts, Steps’ Faye Tozer, Lee Ryan out of Blue, Kate “The Silverback” Silverton, from BBC News, cricketer Graeme Swann and Susannah Constantine, who seemed to have got lost on the way to the Loose Women studio and mentioned “the menopause” before she’d even done her Mrs Overall impression in that group dance.Once through that lot, though, you’re into Stacey Dooley territory with Danny John-Jules, a Paralympian, some bloke called Charles off Casualty, who warmed the nation’s heart by referring to himself in the third person, and comedian Seann Walsh, who confirmed: “I’m not here to make anyone laugh.”A statement that should be all over Seann’s Edinburgh Fringe poster every year.The two bookings that irked me most, though, were local radio DJ Vick Hope, whose only recognisable feature is her perfume  and internet vlogger Joe Sugg, whose presence really did flag up TV’s general failure if 13million people are logging on to watch this bloke put cling film over his mate’s toilet bowl.It also told me, without much competition from The X Factor, Strictly’s got complacent and rather full of itself.The solution would seem obvious, though. Rip up the flat fee booking system, drop the salaries of the makeweights and spend the excess on a marquee booking like Richard Madeley, Prezza, Eamonn Holmes, Cherie Blair or Farage, who’d empty Britain’s streets with his jive.This is not just my opinion, obviously. Almost everyone who’s looked at this year’s Strictly line-up has concluded it’s not good enough.You can be pretty damn sure then the BBC will take the criticism on board, channel the opinions through a thousand sub-committees and conclude that, yes, unequivocally what this show needs is same sex couples.We live in nutty times.The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “JFK: Remembering Jack is a book about which man?”Emma: “Pass.”Bradley Walsh: “2017, The Queen’s Sapphire Jubilee, marked how many years on the throne?”Emma: “100.”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “Which UK Prime Minister starred in the 2003 episode of The Simpsons?”Mikayla: “Winston Churchill.”Bradley Walsh: “In the 1930s, Caroline Mikkelsen became the first woman to set foot in what continent?”Barrie: “Australia.”A CRACKING new series of Celebrity Island with Bear Grylls was immediately transformed into Fantasy Island on Sunday night, thanks to the arrival of Roxanne Pallett, who made an early promise/threat.“If someone gets stung by a jellyfish,” she claimed, earnestly, “I would wee on them.”And if they didn’t get stung? Roxanne would probably p*** on them from a great height anyway.You feared, then, for the latest selection of male celebs, James Cracknell, Anthony Ogogo, Martin Kemp, Towie’s Pete Wicks and star of The Specialist Eric Roberts, an obvious Hollywood casualty who still boasted: “I’ve been nominated for an Academy Award and three Golden Globes, and I’ve had so much fun I can’t see straight.”Yeah, can’t see straight, can’t stay awake and can’t remember anyone’s name either, so he started calling Martin Kemp “Colin”. Eric’s fantastic entertainment, though, and unlike the others has the gifts of honesty and intuition, so he was having none of Roxanne’s Penelope Pitstop routine.First she succumbed to “trench foot”. Then she was rescued from the water after her leg became dangerously entangled with the voices in her head, and finally Roxanne had to be evacuated from the island when the camp fire ignited long-buried memories of a teenage house fire.A tale of the unexpected that earned her a fond farewell from the other islanders and a muttered aside from Eric.“That story. When’s the movie coming out?”About the same time as The Specialist II.Alan Shearer: “After two defeats, Fulham have got a win and a victory.”Matt Murray: “If England had gone on and got that second goal, they’d have gone on and got it.”Neil Warnock: “The bookies are never wrong, but they weren’t right last year.”Lee Dixon: “You can sing about England’s midfield about as long as the cow’s come home.”THERE will be no more lift-exiting or corridor- charging for Keeley Hawes after BBC1’s Bodyguard killed off her Home Secretary Julia Montague on Sunday night.A revelation that may have one or two of you screaming: “Thanks for the spoiler alert,” but tough luck. The rest of us are fed up putting everything on hold for stragglers who think the world revolves around their schedule.And anyway, codes of silence should exist only for those truly great dramas, like The Sopranos or ER, which understand you have to earn the right to kill off one of your main characters and jumping that gun smacks of arrogance.As popular as it’s been, Bodyguard clearly isn’t in this bracket.It’s far too full of plot holes and box-ticking to be anywhere near Sopranos class, in fact, and Richard Madden’s Sergeant Zoolander character doesn’t begin to look capable of carrying the show on his own.Don’t, however, rule out the possibility of a last-minute redemption.If Bodyguard really is as edgy, risk-taking, different-from-the-herd and brilliant as writer Jed Mercurio seems to think, then it’ll conclude the person responsible for the explosions, death and every other misery visited on humanity wasn’t a white, middle-class man.I’m not exactly holding my breath here, though.On Friday’s This Morning, Eamonn Holmes announces: “Next, masturbation, we’re getting stuck into that.Martin Lewis is here at 10:45, Matthew Wright’s popping in at ten past 11 . . .”And if Jamie Oliver appears, we’ve got a whole studio full of them.THIS week’s winner is Kim Woodburn and Mata, from The Emperor’s New Groove.Emailed in by James McGuire.

She was arrested in 1976 but Christians grew to millions. Will Never be successful.”The crackdown on the Christian faith comes as part of a government campaign to demand loyalty to the atheist Communist party.Fu added: “The international community should be alarmed and outraged for this blatant violation of freedom of religion and belief.”This suppression of religious freedom coincides with President Xi Jinping’s consolidation of power, which makes him the most powerful leader of China since Mao Zedong.The government is now reportedly escalating its’ most severe crackdown since religious freedom was granted in 1982.In Beijing, the Zion church was closed on Sunday by about 60 government workers accompanied by police cars and firetrucks, according the church’s pastor Ezra Jin Mingri.Zion is the largest house church in Beijing.Jin said officials declared the gatherings illegal and closed it after freezing his personal assets for not complying with their demands.Jin told the Associated Press: “Churches will continue to develop.“Blocking the sites will only intensify conflicts.”Chinese officials have reportedly disputed these allegations, reinforcing that they respect religious freedom.Religious believers are only allowed to worship in only government-sanctioned congregations, according to Chinese laws.However, millions of Christians belong to underground churches that don’t follow government regulations.China’s Muslims are also affected by the government’s anti-religious crackdown.Reports say about one million Muslims have been detained in indoctrination camps where they are forced to denounce Islam.The government denies these camps were set up for indoctrination, but have stressed the importance of tackling extremism."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT0004242825631.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=627\" height=\"3000\" width=\"1960","title":"princess eugenie wedding bash expense katie glass","story":"When 28-year-old Eugenie ties the knot to tequila mogul Jack Brooksbank next month they will do so in front of 250 more guests than her cousin Prince Harry had.The bash will last TWO days and be organised by Peregrine Armstrong-Jones, the man behind Posh and Becks’s bling-tastic nuptials.We are told the party will feature a champagne reception hosted by the Queen.There will be a horse-drawn carriage ride to St George’s Chapel, which will be laden with flowers arranged by Elton John’s florist.There will be a three-course dinner in a marquee laid with a glass dance floor. The first night will culminate in a “festival and funfair”-themed party where 500 guests including Naomi Campbell, George Clooney and Kate Moss will ride dodgems and play on coconut shies as Robbie Williams and Ellie Goulding perform.So far, so OTT.And good for her! If Princess Eugenie wants a Big Fat Royal Wedding, she should have one. Why not get Gypsy Wedding stitcher Thelma Madine to team up with Chanel and make a £50,000, 20st, glow-in-the-dark dress?Why doesn’t Eugenie ride to the church in a giant horse-drawn orb like Katie Price or say her vows on golden Beckham-style thrones?It is beautiful Eugenie has found love — she should celebrate however she wants. But where Eugenie’s special day crosses into outrageous is in expecting the public to pay her gigantic security bill.Eugenie’s insistence on being paraded through the streets of Windsor like Marie Antoinette means security is now going to cost us, the taxpayers, an astronomical TWO MILLION POUNDS.Officers on overtime rates will be drafted in, with dozens required to search the procession route in advance.Hard-working Brits who have struggled with eight years of austerity and been exhausted by endless police cuts will bear the brunt of that extra policing so we might catch a glimpse of Eugenie sashaying past in her open-top carriage.Is this what Eugenie meant when she said in a recent interview that she wanted to “share our world” with us?There’s nothing more tasteless than asking other people to pay for your extravagant wedding.Recently a story went viral about a bridezilla called Susan who’d demanded her friends cough up towards her £47,000 bash.Yet Eugenie’s demands make small change of that. As her guests romp on dodgems and get hammered on cocktails, we’ll be hoping we don’t get stabbed or sprayed with acid on the way to the shops because there probably won’t be many cops to help us.Extreme? Maybe not when we hear — as we did last month — that a third of bobbies on the beat have been axed in the past three years, while crime has shot up.Some fed-up villagers have even started paying for their own security firms.You hear that, Eugenie? Paying for their own security!Indeed, we might ask why Eugenie’s dad, Prince Andrew, worth some £65million, isn’t dipping into his reservoir of cash to pay the security bill?It is he who is apparently so keen for Eugenie to make a carriage-drawn arrival at church. Just as Andrew was adamant his daughters should retain Princess status in the face of Prince Charles’ worthy attempts to slim down the monarchy.Perhaps Eugenie’s groom Jack Brooksbank — the great-grandson of Sir John Spencer Coke, the son of the 2nd Earl of Leicester — might stump up some cash?Or Eugenie herself could contribute? Even if it might mean troubling her £3.6million trust funds or taking one fewer holiday this year?In an interview with Vogue Eugenie spoke with her sister Beatrice about wanting to be seen as “real”.Yet in some ways, “real” is exactly what Eugenie is. A marginal royal, she has no official royal function.She is not responsible for carrying out any royal engagements or public duties. For us, then, she does nothing.For Prince Harry, it made sense to indulge in a whistles-and-bells Royal Wedding .People like Harry, you see. Harry performs royal duties . He has served in the Forces and established the Invictus Games. An psos Mori poll this year had him and his gran — aka the Queen — as the world’s most favourite royals. For us Brits he was the favourite.But we can’t and shouldn’t roll out the platinum carpet for every minor royal who ties the knot. To do so makes a mockery of the royals’ claims they want to modernise.It reinforces the dated and offensive notion that the aristocracy are born to deserve better than us.In that Vogue interview Eugenie spoke about how she wanted her wedding to be plastic-free. How very woke.I just wish this supposedly modern royal was as conscious of social inequality as she is of the environmentOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Canterbury MP, who unexpectedly won her seat in last year\u0027s snap general election, has been heavily criticised in a letter sent out to members for attending a demonstration against antisemitism on March 26 this year. She joined other Labour MPs and Jewish leaders in a rally outside Parliament demanding the Party got a grip on the anti-Semitism crisis. But activists say that Ms Duffield, who is Canterbury\u0027s first Labour MP, has involved herself with groups and organisations that are campaigning to damage our Party. They say the demonstration groundlessly accused the Party of systematic antisemitism.   The Canterbury Labour Party has informed its members that an emergency motion has been approved by the chairman to hear matters regarding Ms Duffield‘s actions.    The signatories say they are unhappy with Ms Duffield’s actions and reaffirmed its support for Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader  However, the single mum who is Kent\u0027s only Labour MP, has previously denied that she was being disloyal in any way to Mr Corbyn\u0027s leadership. The letter reads: “We have observed the words and conduct of our Labour MP, Rosie Duffield, and we are dissatisfied at her decision to involve herself with groups and organisations that are campaigning to damage our Party, as well as impede its efforts to ensure the right to criticise crimes committed by the state of Israel. “We are particularly concerned that Rosie chose to show her support for these parties at a demonstration organised to groundlessly accuse the Party of systematic antisemitism. “She compounded this conduct by carelessly appearing to threaten the leader at a meeting of an organisation which, though affiliated with the Labour Party, does not at all times share its priorities.  The letter continued: “With regret, this Constituency Labour Party  censures Rosie Duffield for this conduct. “We also urge her to consult with and seek guidance from the democratically elected officers of the Canterbury Constituency Labour Party on issues of this level of contention.   “On matters of political sensitivity the democratic support of this CLP will clearly strengthen her position in dealing with others. Ms Duffield said earlier this year: For me, this demonstration was about antisemitism and what we are doing about it. It was not about Jeremy Corbyn and his leadership, although I accept some have tried to make it about that. I attended to express my solidarity with those in our Jewish community who have experienced antisemitism. Indeed, I have myself seen some of the most horrendous and sickening antisemitic comments and attacks on social media and emails directed at some of our comrades and my friends.

With four people under one roof and two school-aged kids it’s easy to get through 10 loads a week. Research found 40% of clothes are creased, but not dirty, when they hit the wash after a day’s wear. The aerosol Day 2 is supposed to remove the need for over-washing. If, as claimed, it can freshen and soften fabric, deodorise and, fabulously, remove creases, bring it on. However second only to hand washing, washing clothes is one of the best ways of keeping germs, coughs and colds at bay. Humans constantly shed skin cells, secrete sweat and ooze skin oils onto everything we wear.  But if a spray can buy an extra 15 minutes in bed or a Sunday night in front of the Bodyguard and not the ironing board, count us in. One of the main draws has to be the claim you can ditch the iron. If true, it sounds like a winner. But for \u0026pound7.50 for 200ml or \u0026pound4 for the travel size of 75ml, convenience doesn’t come that cheap. So we put Day 2 to the test. How would it fare against cheaper alternatives such as Febreze or, the hang it out of the window and hope for the best technique? Instructions are: Lay out items flat, spray lightly, smooth out fabric and hang for 15 minutes. Simple! Denim jeans  Levi’s CEO and president Chip Bergh went on the record to say you should never wash a pair of jeans, merely spot clean any stains on them. My apologies if you’re having your tea. And we’ve got to admit Day 2 is brilliant at refreshing your denims. It certainly made them feel softer – like they’d been washed with fabric conditioner. They certainly smell fresher, too. But as for never washing your denims, that’s crazy talk, Chip.  Smooth test 3/5   Sniff test 5/5  School uniform  Until someone turns up on Dragon’s Den with magic self-cleaning school wear, laundering uniform is like Groundhog Day. We took a crumpled cotton school dress, sprayed then stretched and smoothed. The results were actually, jaw-droppingly good and took a smidgeon of the time ironing would. I’m not sure about the benefits of not washing clothes daily as we head into norovirus season though.  Smooth test 5/5   Sniff test 4/5  Dry-clean dress  This is surely the holy grail: a dry-clean item you can eke out for longer. Compared with a liberal squirt of Febreze or deodorant there’s not much to choose between them, but Day 2 leaves no white marks or stickiness on the fabric. On viscose the creases dropped out but were still visible. The spray contains “stiffening molecules”, apparently.

Dan Swales, 34, an RAF medic, was six miles into the race when the man alongside him fell ill.  Dan immediately stopped and started giving CPR to the stricken runner, Chronicle Live reports .  Tragically the ordeal was a devastating reminder of his efforts to save his own son Noah, who stopped breathing when he was 18-months-old.  Noah, who had a rare form of meningitis , died.   But memories of his beautiful little boy had spurred Dan on to tackle his second Great North Run to raise funds for the 4Louis charity, which provides keepsakes and support for bereaved parents. Dan, 34, said: “I glanced at the man running next to me, asked him if he was all right and he said ‘no, not really - I feel dizzy.’ I put my arm around him and took him to the side, then he collapsed on the floor. “He went on to his back and wasn’t responding. Then another man stopped and said he was a fireman but used to be a nurse. “We put him in the recovery position on the kerbside, called for medics and assessed him.  “At pretty much the same time, we both realised we couldn’t feel a pulse so we went into CPR. “An armed response police officer came over from the other side of the road with a medibag. “I explained I was a medic and the other man was an ex-nurse, so they let us take the lead. “The police officer took over the CPR while we started protecting his airways, putting oxygen in him and attaching defibrillator pads.”  After two shocks from the defibrillator, a faint pulse returned, and the man was then taken to hospital in an ambulance.  A member of the man’s family said on Facebook : “You are amazing and the whole family wants to say thank you.”  Dan said: “I don’t know how long it took but it seemed a lifetime. “The main thing is he’s alive and I hope he makes a full recovery. I’ve been in touch with a family member on Facebook. “If the defibrillator hadn’t been there, and the right people at the right time, it could have been another story. “But I’m a medic - I did it with my own son and I’ve done it many times before.

Whether those tears will come from the child or the parent is anyone\u0027s guess. Sometimes the youngster will turn on the waterworks, not wanting to be separated from their mum or dad, other times it will be the parent who is having a hard time letting go and leaving their little one in the care of strangers. Two primary school teachers from Gloucester knew how difficult dropping a child off for their first day can be, so they prepared a little treat to make it easier for parents.  And it had many mums in tears at the school gates, reports Gloucestershire Live . Mrs Barwell and Miss Sian of Kingsholm C of E Primary School welcomed children in the doors and handed parents an envelope with a special message on the front. The notes were actually sweet poems, which read: The day is finally here and now you are alone,  Sit down to have a brew and think of how they\u0027ve grown!

Chloe Sparks, from Cambridge, was out with her friend to enjoy a meal at The Regal branch of Wetherspoons in the city last Friday when she discovered her vegan-friendly meal tasted like meat.  After taking a mouthful of the \u0027five bean chilli\u0027 she quickly realised that something was wrong.  Chloe told Cambridgeshire Live she was really shook up by the experience and as a result made herself sick in the pub\u0027s bathroom.

I asked to speak to the manager but he didn\u0027t believe what I was saying, he kept telling me it was the five bean chilli. Eventually he took it into the kitchen and I was offered a refund for the meal.

Mark D\u0027Amico and Kate McClure set up a GoFundMe page for Johnny Bobbitt Jr after he performed an act of kindness on a dark highway last year.  When Kate\u0027s car ran out of petrol, the struggling opioid addict approached her and spent his final 20  buying her some fuel. But Kate and Mark, from Bordentown, New Jersey, are now accused of defrauding Johnny and taking most of the cash that was meant for him. The Marine veteran\u0027s lawyer claims the couple treated themselves to luxuries including a BMW car, a Louis Vuitton bag, Chanel sunglasses, Nike shoes and an iPhone 10.  Lawyer Jacqueline Promislo claims the couple deposited the online donations into their bank account last fall and began to spend the money immediately. She told the New York Post: They went on shopping sprees. [Bobbitt] tells me they had a Louis Vuitton bag and Chanel sunglasses, a new iPhone 10. I know they spent a lot of money. Last week, authorities raided the couple\u0027s home and seized their BMW as part of the ongoing investigation. Mark, 39, and Kate, 28, have not been charged with a crime.  The couple recently went on national TV to claim that only 150,000  of the money was left. They claimed they spent the money on care for Johnny. But Promislo claims the pair have lavished themselves with the cash. She claims they have amassed a huge shoe collection - including pairs of Nikes - and have been on expensive trips to California, Las Vegas and the Grand Canyon. She added: “Until we have a forensic accountant go through it, I can’t say that they spent his money. But now that they say there is no money, where did it go?”  Promislo claims the couple spent 68,000  on Johnny, 35, and gave him a used truck to drive and a trailer to live in. But the couple never gave him the key to the truck and they drove it until it broke down, the lawyer claims. She said Bobbitt lived in the trailer in the couple\u0027s driveway, but with no access to his money he decided to leave in June. Earlier this summer, when reporters found him back living under a bridge in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, he claimed the couple had taken the money and spent it on themselves. Mark, a carpenter, and Kate, a receptionist, have since sold the truck and trailer that were given to Bobbitt, Promislo claims.

The National Hurricane Center  said the storm is a large and extremely dangerous hurricane which is predicted to bring life threatening impacts to North Carolina and neighbouring states in the southeastern US.  South Carolina\u0027s governor has ordered the evacuation of an estimated one million people from noon tomorrow as they brace for a hit from the most powerful storm to take aim at the US mainland this year. The storm had winds of 130mph  and was due to gain strength before making landfall, which the US National Hurricane Center said was likely to occur early Thursday in the Carolinas, bringing heavy rain that could cause severe flooding through the region.  We do not want to risk one South Carolina life in this hurricane, Governor Henry McMaster said at a news conference. In North Carolina, officials already had ordered some 250,000 residents and visitors to begin evacuating the Outer Banks barrier islands. We are in the bull\u0027s-eye, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said at a news conference. This is going to be a statewide event. The United States was hit with a series of high-powered hurricanes last year, including Hurricane Maria, which killed some 3,000 people in Puerto Rico, and Hurricane Harvey, which killed about 68 people and caused an estimated 1.25 billion in damage with catastrophic flooding in Houston.  As of Monday afternoon, Hurricane Florence was about 1,170 miles  east-southeast of Cape Fear, North Carolina, and was a Category 4, the second-strongest on the Saffir-Simpson scale, the NHC said.  US President Donald Trump , whose administration faced severe criticism for a slow response in Puerto Rico to Hurricane Maria, cancelled a political rally planned for Friday in Jackson, Mississippi, over safety concerns related to Florence, his campaign said.  Cooper said he had asked Trump to declare a federal state of emergency for North Carolina. Florence could bring a life-threatening coastal storm surge, and inland flooding as far north as Virginia, the NHC said.  Historically, 90 percent of fatalities from hurricanes, tropical storms and tropical depressions have been caused by water, said NHC spokesman Dennis Feltgen said. Some 27 percent of the deaths have come from rain-driven flooding, sometimes hundreds of miles inland. In Holden Beach, North Carolina, longtime residents could be seen boarding up homes and securing possessions. It\u0027s scary to all of us. We know we can\u0027t play around with this, said Jennifer Oosterwyk, who owns the Sugar Britches boutique on Holden Beach and lives in nearby Wilmington. Oosterwyk was gathering tax documents and other important papers from her store on Monday, and said she planned to drive 150 miles  inland to ride out the storm in Cary. As the storm advanced, Monday afternoon was a postcard-perfect day on Holden Beach with bright blue skies, placid puffy clouds and light breezes.

Jeffrey Dahmer , who was known as the Milwaukee Monster or Milwaukee Cannibal, murdered, dismembered and then ate 17 men and boys from 1978 to 1991.  Various body parts were found in his flat, which included three heads that had been preserved in a fridge. The American serial killer, who had homosexual fantasies, was known to drug and rape his victims. But his killing spree came to and end in 1991 when one of the victims managed to escape. Dahmer was sentenced to 900 years in prison but in 1994 he was murdered by a fellow inmate.   Now a new Netflix series \u0027Dark Tourist\u0027, looks at the attraction that brings people who have an interest with places associated with death and tragedy, News.au reports.  Presenter David Farrier says of the city of Milwaukee: It\u0027s famous for beer and cheese, and a serial killer. Over the years Dahmer has brought a bizarre cult and Farrier meets with one fanatic - a self-titled dark tourist - called Natalie. She speaks about why she finds his story so fascinating and said: There’s never been a case quite like his, where there were lobotomies, attempts to turn people into zombies, cannibalism, all of this in one. He wasn’t a sadist either, he actually granted the small mercy of drugging and strangling his victims...  During one part of the show, she holds the skull of a “South American male”. When Ferrier questions if there are similarities between her and Dahmer, Natalie at first denies it but then explains that she is “weird”. The series takes a stranger turn when the presenter visits Dahmer’s lawyer Wendy Patrickus, who reveals a piece of paper which illustrates the sick shrine Dahmer created in his flat. She said: “He saved the entire bodies of these two on the end... he had a thing for hands, he’d save the hands a lot of times and obviously the penis. Farrier replies: “It’s so odd because it’s almost like a child’s drawing and yet it’s about something so incredibly... I mean this is like True Detective or something right, but beyond. “It’s so eerie thinking of Dahmer drawing this, and signing it.” "},{"url":null,"title":"paris ritz burglary saudi princess","story":"NewsParis Ritz \u0027burglary\u0027: Saudi princess claims £700,000 of jewellery stolen from plush suiteSources in the French capital say there is no sign of forced entry in the unnamed royal\u0027s suiteShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByDave Burke18:38, 10 SEP 2018NewsThe Saudi princess says the valuables were taken from her suite on Friday  \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThieves escaped from a plush Paris hotel with more than \u0026pound700,000 worth of jewellery belonging to a Saudi princess, according to reports.

Also known as Hijri New Year, it falls in the second holiest month in the religion\u0027s calendar following only Ramadan .  As well as marking the beginning of Islamic year 1438, the celebration allows Muslims to think about what they want from their own lives. Although schools in the UK do not give time off to Muslim children for the celebration, in their homes they may see feasting and fasting for the event. Here\u0027s everything you need to know about the Islamic New Year. What is Islamic New Year?  Islamic or Hijri New Year is the day that marks the beginning of a new Islamic calendar year, this year falling on September 11 .  The date actually changes with the moon as the Islamic calendar is lunar, so last year year it fell on September 22, 2017. The Islamic lunar year is eleven to twelve days shorter than the solar Gregorian year, which is why dates differ. The date is the first day of the holy month of Muharram, and it\u0027s common for a day in the Islamic calendar to be defined as beginning at sunset. What is Muharram?  Muharram is marked as the second holiest month of the Muslim calendar, coming after Ramadan.  Prayers and fasting feature in daily observances, building up to the 10th day, the Day of Ashura when some fast during the hours of daylight on the ninth and 10th, reports Time and Date .  It is said to be in commemoration that Noah left the ark and that God saved Moses from the Egyptians. For Shi\u0027a Muslims, the Day of Ashura is also a day of mourning for Husayn ibn Ali, a grandson of the Prophet Muhammed who was martyred in 680 CE at Karbala, in modern-day Iraq. What do worshippers eat on Ashura after fasting?  Ashure or Noah\u0027s Pudding is a firm fixture, with traditionally at least seven ingredients, but regional iations.

I think it might be good for both of us.”While Kamara has remained in Scotland this week for treatment, Kallman is off on international duty, though not with the full squad.But while, after winning his first full cap earlier this year, he appears to be dropping a level as he joins the U/21 squad for two vital Euro qualifiers, he’s happy.The 20-year-old is very much of the opinion that his near-certain involvement against Denmark and Poland will be a case of taking one step back to make two forward.The Dens loan signing from Turku doesn’t hide from the fact he would love to have competed at the higher level.For him, though, time on the park is what matters most and that’s why he’s more than happy to be representing his country in the younger age group.“Of course you always want to go forward and I heard back in Finland they were looking to put new players into the team and the manager said I was one of the options,” he said.“However, then again you have to think about that. Now I am in the U/21s and we have two qualifier games.“I’ve played with them all the time and am going to play as the first striker for them. You have to know which are the best moments to go to the first team because, if I go to the U/21s, I’ll get playing time and we have two games to try to qualify with them.“For that reason I think it might be better to be with the U/21s to get playing time. If I got called up to the first team, yes, I would be there but how much playing time will I get, I don’t know.“It’s easier to say afterwards because you don’t know how much time you will get but with the U/21s I know I am guaranteed playing time.”And the benefit to Dundee of his trip back to the continent should be the competitive nature of the action he sees.Not only are the opposition he’ll face of a decent standard, there’s plenty of stake in the fixtures.If the young Finns can win both, they would still be in with a chance of qualifying for the Euro finals, though the history of the group so far does suggest they will have their work cut out.When they faced the Danes at home last year they were on the wrong end of a 5-0 drubbing, so to beat them in the away tie will be a big ask.Kallman, though, is up for the challenge and is determined to do all his can to at least extend Finnish interest in qualification.“These will be a tough two games. They are the deciders for us because teams are four and five points ahead of us in the table with Poland first and Denmark second.“We have to at least not lose these game to still have a chance to proceed.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"craig easton sees irn bru as a chance for dundee united kids to get their fizz back","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United reserve team boss Craig Easton believes Saturday’s Irn-Bru Cup clash with Alloa will be the perfect test for his young team.The Tangerines second string were on the wrong end of a 5-1 score in the Reserve League at Hearts on Monday.But Craig believes the margin of the home team’s victory was not a fair reflection on his side’s play and is viewing the weekend tie as a chance to show that.“We are looking forward to the game even though it comes on the back of what wasn’t a good result for us against Hearts,” he said.“It wasn’t a 5-1 performance, though. We missed two penalties and we were always in the game until the last two goals went in later in the second half.“So, I think the score was harsh on us in the end but you still don’t want to lose five goals in any game and you want to defend better.”Looking forward, he suspects Alloa will not be much changed from the side that drew with United in the Championship last weekend“I think they don’t have a massive squad so it could be similar to the league game against us on Saturday. They are a good, fit and organised outfit. It will be a hard game.”As was the case in the first-round victory over St Johnstone Colts last month, the United ranks at Tannadice on Saturday are likely to be bolstered by several first-team men.And young midfielder Archie Thomas is back in contention for a starting place.He was injured in the first minute of the first-round victory but returned for half an hour of Monday’s game.United have set the entry price for Saturday’s game at £10.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b618c05b50b5-923x564.jpg ","title":"csaba laszlos new boys are showing some promise at dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIt remains early days so far as judging new-look Dundee United goes but there is no question Csaba Laszlo’s team are getting to know each other.After a sticky start to the season, there have been definite signs over the last three, unbeaten, Championship outings that the team is coming together.And the Tele takes a look and how the new men have contributed, so far.Matej RakovanAfter joining up on the same day as fellow-goalie Benjamin Siegrist, one of the big questions going into the campaign was which of the pair would get the nod. It was the Slovakian and, so far, he’s justified the faith shown in him with a string of impressive performances. He did make an error for the goal lost against Partick, but by then the game had been comfortably won.Frederic FransThe Belgian was added to the squad to provide steel in central defence and the fact he had experience of the Scottish game from a spell with Partick made him a sensible addition. So far he’s lived up to expectations and looked a strong and calming influence.Paul WatsonProbably the most low key signing, at first it seemed doubtful if the man who was a squad player at Falkirk would feature too often. Given his chance at Queen of the South last month, the powerful centre-half grabbed the opportunity and impressed in each of his three league games to date, scoring three goals in the process. With the arrival of Rachid Bouhenna, he still faces a challenge to keep his place.Christoph RabitschThe Austrian has had a robust start to his United career and a couple of rash tackles when he was already on a booking have seen him subbed to prevent the team being reduced to 10 men. The 22-year-old was publicly slapped down by Csaba for that. He appears to have taken it on board and there’s no question his ability to get in about opponents is an asset.Adam BartonCaptured from Partick Thistle just before the Betfred Cup games kicked off, the tall Englishman has added to United’s new-found aerial strength. Most of his appearances so far have been in midfield, so he’ll face a challenge once skipper Fraser Fyvie returns from injury, but he’s also been used in central defence and that versatility has given the manager more options.Fraser AirdOne of the first signings of the summer, the Canadian has added pace in the wide areas. He earned his move on the strength of performances against United for Dunfermline last term and, so far, he might just have been the best of the new bunch.Yannick LoembaThe winger was an unknown quantity who hadn’t had much football in the last year or so. However, there’s been no evidence of that and he’s made a lightning start to his time with United. The 28-year-old always wants on the ball and his eagerness to get forward has made him a fans’ favourite.Pavol SafrankoThe loan signing from Aalborg marked his debut with an excellent goal in the win at Queen of the South and has looked the part since. Well-known to the manager from their time together in his native Slovakia, Safranko looks to be the centre-forward United have been crying out for.Craig CurranA dead leg picked up in pre-season delayed his involvement until the opening league game when Dunfermline won at Tannadice. As his fitness has improved after that injury, Curran has shown himself to be a hard worker and chipped in with a goal against Partick.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b92a037afa2f.jpg ","title":"dundee council set to net seven figure sum for sell off of waterfront land","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA residential site at the Waterfront is set to be snapped up for a seven-figure sum this week, the Tele has learned.Councillors are to meet on tonight to discuss a number of land sell-offs to allow further development in Dundee.Among the areas that will be discussed behind closed doors is the newly-approved residential block to be built on Site 6, across the road from the V\u0026ampA.Ediston Real Estate, which submitted the planning application to build the flats, was among the bidders for the land, the deed for which still rests with Dundee City Council.It has reportedly submitted a bid of £1.45 million.However, the Tele has learned that Robertson Capital Projects has come in with a higher bid which is likely to be approved tonight.Robertson Capital – part of the Robertson Group, which is also building the office block on Site 6 – is understood to have submitted a bid of £1.6m for the right to build on the site.A source said: “The meeting will decide on the sale of the area which will have the block of flats built on it. The council still owns the site at the moment.“The architects and developers who lodged the application said they wouldn’t buy the land until they were given planning permission.“Ediston Real Estate put in a bid but it has been outbid by Robertson Capital, which has submitted a bid of £1.6m.“It is very likely that it will get waved through on Monday.”Discussions on the deal are to be held in private, with few details of the meeting publicly available.The plan to build 99 flats on Site 6 were approved by councillors last month following Ediston’s application. The block will sit on the north-eastern corner of the site, away from the office block currently under construction that overlooks the V\u0026ampA.A total of eight plots have been earmarked for Site 6, with a central courtyard in the middle.At last month’s planning committee, councillors disagreed over the decision not to require planners to include parking spaces at the complex for residents.Conservative West End councillor Donald Hay had attempted to stop the development but could not find a seconder to enable his motion to be put to a vote.Mr Hay said he was concerned at the number of flats being built without parking in the city centre.However, former city development chief Mike Galloway said people would be able to apply for the residents’ parking scheme, which would give them access to city centre multi-storey car parks.He added that the council could build further parking facilities in the city centre if demand was identified but there were as yet no plans to do so.The nearest car park is the Greenmarket multi-storey, a few minutes’ walk away.The city council declined to comment.The Robertson Group and Ediston Real Estate had not responded to a request for comment at the time of going to press.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee have a real gem in young striker cedwyn scott says berwick boss","story":"\t\t\t\t\tYoung Dundee striker Cedwyn Scott has earned high praise after a brace on his debut for Berwick.Boss Robbie Horn was highly impressed by the teenager.His double came in a 5-3 win at Albion Rovers when he grabbed the third and fifth goals in a dramatic tie.Horn said: “My research had shown that Cedwyn was a good player but he is better than I had hoped for.

I was having a look to see if I could go elsewhere because the playing time here has been limited,” he said.“In the end there wasn’t anything that I felt attracted me more than Dundee United did, so that’s why I’m still here.“The club had made it pretty clear to me that, if I wanted to move on, they weren’t going to stand in my way, they’d let me go.“Between now and January I’ve got to get my head down and try to get time on the park.“And when it comes to January I will re-evaluate because I will only have six months on my contract left. I will have to look at it.“Right now, though, I’m just doing my best to try to get back into the team and see how that works. I’m not looking at anything else, I’m just focused on getting in the team and contributing.”With that in mind he is not looking at tomorrow and the Irn-Bru Cup, a competition United have made clear is not a priority this term, with any sense of disdain.He sees it as another chance to show manager Csaba Laszlo, who’s likely to be watching from the stand as reserve manager Craig Easton takes charge of the team, he should be in the starting line-up every week.For fans turning up, history suggests McMullan’s presence could mean they will be in for another late show.When the teams met at the same stage this time last year, he and Willo Flood struck deep in injury time to earn United victory.And in the first round this season, it was McMullan’s last-gasp strike that secured a remarkable comeback win over St Johnstone Colts, who’d been two up late on. This time he’d settle for the winner to come a little earlier than that.“I’ve done that a couple of times with late goals in this cup,” he added.“Hopefully, we don’t leave it until that late again and the boys can do well and get into the next round.“It would be nice to have a more straightforward victory but it is going to be a hard game and we saw at the weekend how tough it is playing against Alloa.“We just have to take it as it comes and see how we get on.”With Alloa expected to be along the same lines as when they lined up against United in the Championship last Saturday, McMullan knows making the third round could be a big ask.“I wouldn’t think they will make too many changes but it’s an opportunity for us to show what we do and we will try to take it.“It will be a good learning process for the younger ones in our team and a good test against seasoned pros who know what the game is all about.“For me, it’s an opportunity to show what I can do and that’s what I have to keep on doing.“I feel I’ve done OK, it’s just the chances haven’t been there for one reason or another and there’s not a lot I can do about that.“All I can do is stay patient and, if an opportunity comes, do all you can to make sure I take it as best I can.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b92a88abb327.jpg ","title":"kyle falconer on dundee weve always been standing on the shoulders of edinburgh and glasgow but its our time now","story":"\t\t\t\t\tKyle Falconer will join the likes of Primal Scream and Be Charlotte by performing at the opening of the V\u0026ampA Dundee this week.The View frontman has been announced as the latest name appearing on the main stage on Saturday during the 3D Festival in Slessor Gardens.Up to 20,000 people are expected to attend the festival next Friday and Saturday as the long-awaited £80 million design museum finally opens.While Friday night’s event headlined by Primal Scream is sold out, Kyle will take to the stage at 12.30pm the following day at the non-ticketed Saturday programme.With The View on indefinite hiatus, Kyle has been touring his debut solo album No Thank You.But he admitted to feeling a tiny bit relieved when he finally got the call inviting him to play at next Saturday’s opening.“At the start when everyone was getting invited to play I was a bit put out because I hadn’t been asked,” Kyle told the Tele.“I thought it’s because The View haven’t been doing anything for a while, but then I got the call so it’s all good.

They don’t understand how difficult it is to go to places like Alloa and do what you usually do.“Looking at the pitch, compared to Tannadice it’s completely different altogether, so you have to adjust your game. Alloa are playing there nearly every week so they’re used to it.“You’ve got that against you but it’s not just us, it’s going to be every team that goes there.“It was a difficult task on Saturday but again that’s an excuse and we shouldn’t have excuses.“We should be going there and doing the job.”Barton and central-midfield partner Christoph Rabitsch endured a difficult afternoon as Alloa’s Allan Trouten and Steven Hetherington engaged them in a physical battle.And the 27-year-old Englishman admits they lost control of the match.“We didn’t control the game at all, it’s as simple as that, we tried and couldn’t. It’s just the way the game was,” he added.“I’m sure at home it will be a completely different game but we weren’t used to the conditions and the width of the pitch, so it was tough.“I thought we deserved a point. I don’t think we deserved to win the game and fair play to them because they gave everything they’ve got.“We went to Alloa knowing it was not going to be easy. We didn’t underestimate them but they just played their game very well.“Even in midfield I drop in to get the ball and we mostly look like a back three.“We couldn’t do that against Alloa because it would give them a chance to press us and we were unable to do that.“That was one way in which we were affected in the way we like to play but I’m sure a lot of teams will go there and struggle to play their game.”Barton was honest in his assessment of the performance and says United’s players are not used to a more physical game but insists he knows they’ll need to get used to it.“It turned into a bit of a scrap. We don’t set up to play that kind of football and we don’t have the players who do that.“A lot of people would say you need to be able to adapt to most games but even the best players in the world don’t do the scrappy side of things. It’s just the way it is.“It’s in your nature, you can’t work on the physical side on the training pitch, you can work on being organised and having a better structure but you can’t go into training and work on aggression.“It just doesn’t happen and if you’re an aggressive person, great – if you’re not then you’re not.“You can’t wake up one day and say ‘I’m going to be aggressive’.“We’re not bothered about the play-offs, we want to win the league and we need to go to Alloa and win.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"restrictions on tay road bridge","story":"\t\t\t\t\tRestrictions are on place on the Tay Road Bridge this morning.Due to high winds, the bridge is closed to double-decker buses.\u0026mdash Tay Road Bridge  September 10, 2018The 50mph limit has also been cut to 30mph for all vehicles.Measures were placed at 1.55am and are still in place for the morning rush-hour.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b45cc3d57c90-e1531308229935.jpg ","title":"revealed these are the men dundee fans want in charge if neil mccann leaves","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee supporters have revealed who they want to take over if Neil McCann leaves the club.Five straight defeats at the start of the season have heaped pressure on the current incumbent of the Dens Park hot seat.The Dee are slumped at the foot of the Premier League table and with a trip to McCann\u0026#8217s former employers Rangers next up, on September 15, there are concerns the club could soon become entrenched in the drop zone.A Tele online poll revealed yesterday that 80% of surveyed fans wanted McCann to leave.In the same survey we asked who supporters would want to take over in the event of McCann\u0026#8217s departure, and the voting was tight.Of the 186 people who suggested a new manager, the most preferred candidate was Robbie Neilson, with 28 votes. 100vw, 643px\" /The 38-year-old, who made 21 appearances for Dundee United in 2011-12, led Hearts from the Championship to the Europa League in the space of two years before leaving for MK Dons in November 2016.

But Cllr Gowans added: \u0026ldquoInverness schools are one of the biggest budget pressures we\u0026rsquore going to face. The last estimated cost to resolve the issue would be something like \u0026pound200 million.\u0026ldquoThat would affect every single service within this council \u0026ndash not just Inverness. But they\u0026rsquove been restricted to Inverness members.\u0026ldquoI cannot fathom why such important issues as Inverness schools, and the implications that has for the resources of Highland Council, are not being brought forward in an open, transparent way in the chamber so they can be discussed.\u0026ldquoThat way, we could reassure communities that this matter is being addressed.Ross and Cromarty area committee chairwoman Fiona Robertson, an independent councillor, did not join the chorus but, speaking after the committee meeting, said: \u0026ldquoWhen it comes to the allocation of the grant, then all councillors need to be involved at a much earlier stage.Tuesday 11 Sep 2018 2:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/03969000/03969761.jpg","title":"New bridge to link Inverness Campus and retail park","story":"\u0026nbspA \u0026pound1.96 million contract has been awarded to design and construct a new bridge linking the north end of Inverness Campus with the Inverness Retail and Business Park.Highlands and Islands Enterprise  is leading the development of the campus and has commissioned Wills Bros Civil Engineering Ltd to build the new bridge.The contract forms part of the overall \u0026pound2.7 million cost of the project.

Cormack utilised that link and made a compelling case about Aberdeen’s future plans.Wicks said: “There is such a strong relationship with the US and Scotland as we have the likes of Donald Trump and his golf.“If you look at the visitor statistic of people coming into Scotland a very high proportion are Americans.“They love golf, the whisky trail and there are some really interesting opportunities for us to broaden that relationship and look at new ideas and partnerships.”Football, or “soccer”, is thriving in the United States and is closing in on the big three of American football, basketball and baseball.A Gallup poll recently found 7% of Americans named soccer as their favourite sport to watch.That represented a 3% gain from four years previously.Soccer was the only sport to post such a large increase.Gridiron was at 37%, down from 39%, basketball 11%, down from 12%, and baseball 9%, down from 13%. Ice hockey was at 4%, up from 3%. Only 1% of those polled over 55 named soccer as their favourite sport while the figure was 11% between those aged 18-34.It is expected soccer will surpass baseball in popularity.The rise of soccer in the United States also came despite the national team’s failure to qualify for the World Cup in Russia – the first time they had not been at the finals since 1986.The MLS recently signed an historic eight-year TV deal with ESPN, Fox Sports and Univision worth 720m with games now broadcast in 140 countries.“You look at some of the clubs out there in the MLS and what they are achieving and the fan experience that they are able to deliver,” said Wicks.“There is a lot we can learn and we have to be cognisant of that. There are wider opportunities.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/09/EE1_8875.jpg-e1536501009610-562x564.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet could you help rehome any of these cats","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAre you looking to get a new cat?

We joked about it for a while because we’re not religious so a church would be quite weird.“It was actually better. What we did was better than what I imagined.“I hope it kind of starts a trend, that’d be quite funny.”Despite being a little on the cosy side, the coffee shop made a surprisingly good venue for a wedding.With tables and chairs swept away and disposable coffee cups hanging like decorative bunting, the Starbucks was transformed from its usual look, while still maintaining the character and charm of the place where the happy couple first met.There was just about standing room only for the personal and warming ceremony, conducted by a humanist society speaker.There were a few tears in the emotional ceremony, but thankfully there were no interruptions from anyone looking to come in to buy coffee.The shop struck the perfect balance, with decorations and photographs giving it a personal touch while not going so far that it was unrecognizable as a coffee shop.Joanne even made Starbucks coffee cups threaded together and hung from the ceiling like bunting.She added: “It took my sister, the bridesmaids and I up until 9pm the night before.”Jonathan said: “We actually just came up with it together, but it was more Joanne’s idea.“She came up with the idea of just doing it at Starbucks.“We approached them expecting them to say no but they actually said ‘yes, we like the idea, we like your story, let’s do it’.

O\u0026#8217Donnell was released down the right, his low cross was missed by Russell and came through to skipper Andy Robertson at the back post, the captain\u0026#8217s effort was blocked by Elseid Hysaj.The loose ball broke for Russell but Berat Xhimshiti was in the way of the Sporting Kansas City man\u0026#8217s volley.Scotland were so close to making the breakthrough in the 24th minute when John McGinn\u0026#8217s swirling free-kick from the left was nodded across the six-yard box by Mulgrew.Naismith was there but directed his header from three yards against the left post with the ball bouncing across goal before being cleared.The Scots continued to press and probe as half-time approached, but at times the final pass was not quite right to make the most of some opportunities.Four minutes from the break McLeish\u0026#8217s men could have been one up.Robertson got forward down the left and found Callum McGregor on the left side of the penalty area, his ball across the six-yard box was turned in by Naismith, but the Hearts striker was deemed to be offside.However, replays indicated that he was level with the last defender.Despite their dominance in the first period the Scots were given a warning of Albania\u0026#8217s threat seconds later when Ledian Memushaj won the ball high up the pitch drove towards the box and fired narrowly wide from 20 yards.Armstrong was brought on in place of Kevin McDonald and he had a hand in the Scots taking the lead in the second minute of the second half.The Southampton midfielder worked some space on the left, laid the ball off to Robertson and his cross to the back post was perfect for Naismith to head home from four yards.Soon after though there was a scare for the Dark Blues with McGinn\u0026#8217s short backpass almost giving Bekim Balaj a chance.Conceding seemed to spark Albania into life with Sabien Lilaj\u0026#8217s fine pass picking out Balaj in space just 12 yards out with Allan McGregor required to make a great save to turn the shot away for a fruitless corner.Moments later Lilaj stung the palms of McGregor with a dipping strike from 25 yards.Just before the hour Callum McGregor was denied by Frederic Veseli\u0026#8217s block after the Celtic midfielder burst through when the ball broke to him in the middle of the park.Midway through the second period Balaj wasted another chance for the visitors volleying over after Emmanuele Ndoj picked him out with a cross from the left.But in the 68th minute the game and the points were safe with Naismith getting his and Scotland\u0026#8217s second.Keeper Strakosha came to try to punch McGinn\u0026#8217s corner from the left, but got nowhere near it, the ball glanced off the head of Veseli and came through to Naismith at the back post and he headed into the unguarded net.Scotland could have added more goals in the closing stages, but two was enough to secure a deserved win.Scotland: Allan McGregor, Stephen O\u0026#8217Donnell, John Souttar,

accommodation is more than welcome, a larger amount of affordable housing to buy needs to be built across Argyll.I was also very happy at a recent meeting with my fellow Conservative councillors to discuss the huge importance of having a more streamlined planning service that helps rather than hinders economic strength across Argyll and Bute.An effective planning system plays an important role in supporting growth – promoting and enabling the homes, jobs and services that communities need, creating a more competitive local economy and minimising uncertainty and delay for those proposing or affected by development.We in Argyll are seeing a tremendous increase in our industrial output and we as a council must not place barriers in the way of future growth in this area.Councillor Alastair

It strikes me this sort of selfish attitude is something that may also be contributing to the growing problem of drivers throwing rubbish out their windows on Argyll\u0026#8217s road network.If you can\u0026#8217t find a public toilet, at least find a tree to hide behind when you\u0026#8217re caught short \u0026#8211 and a bin to chuck your rubbish in.Name and address supplied.Sir,At Royal Mail we never forget that we form an essential part of the UK’s social fabric.We know our postmen and postwomen are valued members of the local community as they deliver letters and parcels six days a week \u0026#8211 in all weathers. We’re also continually looking to make our services even better to give customers greater convenience as they shop online.I’d like to make your readers aware of a few changes to their doorstep deliveries so there are no surprises.Customers expecting tracked items from large retailers are among those to benefit from these changes. If they are not at home when we deliver, they will now receive email/SMS notifications on the whereabouts of their delivery. For customers who have provided their contact details, the notifications will confirm when their items have been delivered to a neighbour, as well as specifying the neighbour’s address.The \u0026#8216Something for You\u0026#8217 card is also going digital, making it easier for customers to retrieve their item if they are not at home when we deliver. Email and SMS notifications will let customers either re-arrange their parcel delivery for another day or collect their item from their local Customer Service Point using relevant identification. Customers will no longer need to go home to collect the physical card \u0026#8211 which we’ll continue to post through letter boxes.And finally customers taking pre-paid parcels  to selected Royal Mail Customer Service Points will receive an acceptance scan as soon as they drop off their item thanks to new scanning technology.Gerry McAuley, delivery director, Glasgow Mail Centre.Sir,The Supreme Court appears to have come to a sensible decision for the terminally ill in its landmark right-to-die ruling.One year ago my adult children and I watched helplessly as a most loved, mentally alert member of our family, with terminal cancer, suffered a needlessly horrible and prolonged death.This, after the patient had pleaded, for two weeks, with family doctors and religious leaders to end the constant suffering by requesting some form of assisted dying.This Supreme Court decision has come too late for our loved one but hopefully Westminster and Holyrood will now each consider and pass a bill to allow assisted dying and prevent suffering for current and future patients.Gordon Caskie, Muasdale.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 32","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 3:16 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowSomething slightly different in this edition.

I foolishly stood up too soon approaching the Kilmartin stop and fell forward, landing head to door and feet in the air.Thank you to the doctor who checked me over, and to the driver and passengers who waited until I had been checked.Janet Jardine, KilmartinSir,I would like to give thanks to Tarbert Festivals Committee for all their hard work in organising the very successful Seafood Festival.Tarbert Festival Queen 2018 Chloe MacDonald with her Princesses Cara and Kaitlyn were beautiful and a great credit to the festival.My thanks again to everyone who helped in any way to make this year’s festival such an amazing event and to the very many people who visited the village for the occasion.Councillor Anne Horn, TarbertEditor\u0026#8217s note: With apologies to Councillor Horn for the delay in publishing this letter, originally submitted in July.Sir,The closure of the tourist centres at Tarbert and Inveraray is very worrying and I can’t understand why VisitScotland, backed by the Scottish Government, came up with such a decision.Tourism is extremely important to Argyll and Bute, and all agencies should be working together to assist the tourists that come to this area.Tarbert is in my council ward and I know how valuable the centre there is. The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray. They searched all the places they had visited, including the George, but the keys were not found, so they returned to Cairnbaan by taxi.Fortunately the hotel found the keys and managed to make contact with them, and they returned to Inveraray by taxi to collect the keys from the staff who had been kind enough to wait for them.Once again I would to thank you for your help in making my guests\u0026#8217 stay memorable.Pauline Houston, Crinan Canal CottageSir,I was very happy to attend this year\u0026#8217s Islay, Jura and Colonsay Agricultural Show.It was great to hear about the terrific work being done by the Islay Development Initiative with their Islay Pollinator Initiative which generates employment, including two Modern Apprentices in Beekeeping.I spoke to local farmers about single farm payment delays, feed prices, fuel prices, broadband speed and the poor quality of our infrastructure. I also met with the Islay Book Festival team and heard from my constituents from across Islay, Jura and Colonsay about numerous local issues, all of which will addressed.A huge thank you to all the hard-working volunteers who helped make this year\u0026#8217s show possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 33","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 19/08/18, 2:04 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There has been talk of a new rugby pitch for a while, but plans presented to community councillors on Monday go further than that.We hope everyone involved is as enthusiastic as Mid Argyll Rugby Club and more power to their elbow.This year\u0026#8217s has to go down as one of the best Mid Argyll Shows in recent times.The weather helped bring out the crowds in big numbers, but the real credit must go to the volunteers who organise the show.

Macmillan is there to help people with cancer live life as fully as they can.Offering a broad range of cancer information and support services \u0026#8211 including a free support line and a community of over 7,700 healthcare professionals \u0026#8211 demand for Macmillan’s services is constantly growing, but we rely on the generosity of the public to provide this support.Macmillan’s Coffee Morning takes place on Friday September 28 \u0026#8211 but people can host whenever they want. Whoever they invite and whatever they serve, people are highly encouraged to host a Macmillan Coffee Morning in a way that suits them.If people can’t bake, that doesn’t have to stop them.

Jemma won the two-lap race in 25.7 seconds and placed highly in another three events. Beth won the high jump clearing 1.14m and the long jump and Kirstie had an outstanding run to win the four-lap race in 55.5 seconds. The other event winner in this contest was Jemma’s twin sister Jorja who won the javelin throwing 14 metres.Local girl Neve Bowden was the under 9 champion thanks to wins in the four-lap race and long jump. Scarlett Speirs from Inveraray was runner-up winning the high jump and two-lap race. Carla Renton from Campbeltown won the javelin in this age group.Violet Campbell from Glenbarr dominated in the under 13’s contest winning all five events including a 6.49 metres throw in the shot putt. Emma Plumber from Tayvallich was runner up with Kyra Robertson from Ardrishaig in third place.Karis Kidd from Ardrishaig was the under 15 champion, winning the two running events and the long jump and finished 1.5 points ahead of Amy Gibson from Bunessan on Mull who won the high jump with a 1.40 metres clearance. Caryn Kerr from Campbeltown was third on overall points and won the shot putt with a 6.67 metres throw. The previous week Caryn won the junior shot putt at Oban Highland Games.Three girls tied on points in the under 7’s competition and the final placings were decided on the most individual wins which resulted in Cara Green from Ardrishaig the winner ahead of Zara Whyte and Chloe Hill.Ruairidh Charnock from Lochgilphead was the boys under 7 champion just one point ahead of Olly MacVicar from Tighnabruaich. Ruairidh won the two-lap race and long jump while Olly won the four-laprace and javelin throwing nine metres.Local boy George Balkeen dominated in the under 9’s with a clean sweep of wins which included impressive performances in the two-lap race recording 27.9 seconds, four-lap in 61.6 and a 10.50 metres javelin throw. Luke MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was second overall and Ciaran Johnstone from Oban was third.Roan MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was the under 11 champion thanks to wins in the two running events and finished four points ahead of Sam Gillespie from Lochgilphead who won the high jump and javelin throwing an impressive 14.25m. Third placed Robert Kerr from Campbeltown won the long jump in this section.Two Kintyre boys excelled in the under 13’s with Lewis Gilchrist from Tayinloan champion thanks to wins in the two-lap race in 22.9 and four-lap race in 48.2 seconds. Runner-up Ruaridh Campbell from Glenbarr won the shot putt throwing 9.76 metres and third placed Murray MacDonald also impressed winning the high jump with 1.31 metres and long jump.The entry was disappointing in the two older age groups where Finlay MacLean from Oban won the under 15’s ahead of Ewan Ferguson from Lochgilphead. Finlay won four events and Ewan won the high jump.Jake Gillespie from Lochgilphead was the under 17 winner ahead of Shaun Doy from Kilmichael Glassary. Shaun won the long jump and high jump clearing 1.55 metres. Jake recorded 22.1 seconds in the two-lap and threw an impressive 10.33 metres in the shot putt. Jake had a very successful summer season competing at the local Highland Games in Argyll and ended the circuit at Oban Games the previous week winning the overall Argyll junior championship.The two annual trophies in memory of the late Hugh MacArthur, founder member of the local club in 1984 who died in June 2015, were contested in the under 9 boys and under 9 girls.

A glass pane at Belleisle pro Richard Gordon’s shop was smashed in the 4am raid. Titleist and Wilson clubs were taken, in addition to Richard’s Ping bag and clubs. Police told the pro there’s been around 25 similar thefts in Scotland since April. And they are working with the Scottish Professional Golfers’ Association to track down raiders. “It’s absolutely gut-wrenching,” said Richard, 45. “The bag and clubs were presented to me in April in Phoenix, Arizona,” he said. The pro was given the accolade of being named Ping Custom Fitter of the Year for Scotland. His precious set of clubs includes a titanium driver, along with a three-wood, hybrid clubs, a full set of irons and a putter. All are high-end, high-value clubs - as are the other makes taken in the raid. Richard and his staff moved into the new South Ayrshire Council shop facility around two-and-a-half years ago. “It’s fully alarmed, and has CCTV cameras,” he said. “Security is excellent, but these raiders are prepared to go to any lengths.” It’s been reported, in other raids, that thieves have smashed through metal shutters, and even brick walls. The pro shop at Dundonald Links, between Troon and Irvine, was also targeted in a recent raid. Richard praised the way the police are conducting their inquiries. “They’ve been highly forensic in their investigation - even trying to get DNA,” he said. “The CCTV shows hooded figures, but it’s something the police are still looking at,” he added. Richard has been associated with Belleisle for 25 years, and has been head pro for 11 years. Richard’s wife Vikki works with him in the business, and Lee Hughes is his assistant pro. Richard said: “I love Belleisle, and it’s great that South Ayrshire has invested so much in municipal golf facilities.” “I think South Ayrshire runs the best municipal golf course in Britain if you exclude St Andrews.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrGet into GolfAyr NewsSouth Ayrshire CouncilSt AndrewsTroonDundonald"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13191066.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_IBP_AYP_290818CHAMPION_11JPG.jpg","title":"hundreds flock welcome back inspirational","story":"NewsHundreds flock to welcome back inspirational world record breakerPupils, parents and teachers surrounded the car park of Kyle Academy to show their appreciation of Gavin Drysdale, who smashed a world record at the European World Para Athletics in Berlin.Share\u0026nbspByLochlin Highet14:05, 4 SEP 2018NewsKyle Academy pupil Gavin Drysdale \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHundreds of people flocked to a school to welcome back an inspirational hero. Pupils, parents and teachers surrounded the car park of Kyle Academy to show their appreciation of Gavin Drysdale, who smashed a world record at the European World Para Athletics in Berlin. S6 pupil Gavin, of Ayr, brought home the gold in the race running 100m category with an incredible time of 17.37 seconds. And he was given a hero’s welcome as he was led in by a bagpipe performance. He made his way round the hundreds of emotional crowd, and there was barely a dry eye to be seen. It was clear to see how much Gavin had brought the community together, and how immensely proud they were of the superstar. A teacher was even seen asking “is my mascara running?”, which summed up the emotional parade for Gavin. And it was so clear to see how delighted Gavin was with the turnout, with pupils even running over to grab selfies with him. A buzzing Gavin said: “The reception I got coming back to school was overwhelming. “I wasn’t expecting anything like that reaction I got, it was great. “Kyle Academy are always very supportive of any competition I am doing.” Gavin, 17, has cerebral palsy and has been race running for 10 years. He trains at Dam Park, and when he started way back in 2008 he was the only race runner from Scotland. Now there are over 100 competitors from the country.  He is part of the race running club which is supported by Blue Rock Insurance Brokers. The race club is a branch of Ayr Seaforth and is coached by David Phee. Gavin also trains at Red Star in Glasgow with Janice Eaglesham. And the race running has came so far since he started, and these games have helped it get well on its way to being a part of the Paralympic games. Gavin competed in a special racing trike, which has impressive Continental tyres on it. Gavin is still on cloud nine after bagging the top prize in Berlin. He said: “When I won I was totally stunned. “I felt like I had already won a gold medal just by being there, so the fact I actually won was amazing!”  All the way through Gavin’s journey, his mum Margaret and dad Peter have been there supporting him. His family and friends have helped him along the way, and his sister Natalie even had banners up at the family home to celebrate his success for when he got back. Dad Peter said: “We are just so proud of Gavin. “We were so relieved when he won the gold - as we knew how much hard work he put into his progress. “The games went great, and it’s incredible to see how well the Scottish athletes done at the games.  “We have to extend our thanks to Kyle Academy for being so supportive and for this spectacular welcome they have given us.” Gavin isn’t just a star on the track, he has just sailed through S5 picking up an impressive five highers at A and B grades. He was also a part of the Commonwealth games baton relay in 2014. Headteacher for Kyle Academy, Mary Byrne said: “The whole school is so proud of Gavin. “We are delighted that we are able to show our support for him, and everyone at the school is delighted for him.” "},{"url":null,"title":"prestwick airport could used free","story":"NewsPrestwick Airport could be used as free parking base for ScotRail passengers on Ayr to Glasgow Central lineGovernment officials have pledged to examine the possibility of using the airport - which they own - for free parking relief to help ease the pain of commuters.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson16:08, 6 SEP 2018NewsPrestwick Airport could be used for free parking \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPrestwick Airport could be used as an unlikely saviour in the ongoing crisis at Ayr Railway Station. Government bosses are examining a plan to utilise the flight hub - which they own - for free parking. A number of services on the Ayr to Glasgow Central line will start and terminate at Prestwick Town from next Monday. But with concerns over a lack of parking in the town, transport chiefs have begun scrambling for other options. Ayr MSP, John Scott, led calls for the move to be considered during First Minister\u0027s Questions today in Holyrood. After raising the issue with Nicola Sturgeon, he told the Ayrshire Post: This is now a crisis situation and we should be looking at all available options. Parking in Prestwick is at a premium as it is, so if the airport can provide free spaces until this situation is resolved, it is something we should look at. Responding to Mr Scott\u0027s idea in parliament, Ms Sturgeon said: It strikes me as a very good suggestion and I can\u0027t think of any immediate objection anyone would have. We know the pressure this is putting on commuters. The First Minister has pledged to explore the option with her officials. Four carriage services will continue to operate between Ayr and Glasgow, but six carriage trains will be halted at Prestwick as part of ScotRail\u0027s plan to combat overcrowding on the line. It comes as crisis engulfs Ayr station with the crumbling overhead hotel, owned by a private Malaysian businessman, subject to a large exclusion zone.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnNicola SturgeonPrestwick AirportScotrailGlasgowAyrTransportAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"stagecoach accused turning ayr street","story":"NewsStagecoach accused of turning Ayr street into \u0027deathtrap\u0027 as double deckers thunder down back roadNeighbours say double decker buses accessing the Waggon Road depot in Ayr are thundering along quiet Green Street at all times of the day and night after a route change.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson13:59, 7 SEP 2018NewsResidents protest outside the bus garage \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFurious residents claim a bus giant has turned their back street into a deathtrap.

said demolition was the only economically viable option left.\nHe said: \u0026ldquoThe building is not physically incapable of repair, therefore the overriding principle that needs to be satisfied is one of economic viability.\n\u0026ldquoThis application is supported by feasibility reports and valuations which estimate the building is beyond the point of economic repair.\n\u0026ldquoVarious

scheme for a development which would retain the front facade of the church and the spire was also evaluated, and this would potentially result in a loss of around \u0026pound1m.\n\u0026ldquoThe applicant provided subsequent figures that would need to be invested in order to make a profit. \u0026nbsp\n\u0026ldquoThese assessments conclude that in order to make a reasonable profit, 29 units would be required on site, with 24 units behind the facade and five on the site behind the church.\n\u0026ldquoIt is accepted that not all options have been explored, but it is reasonable to assume that the applicant has demonstrated that a substantial and likely inappropriate development would be required to make the scheme viable.\n\u0026ldquoI am satisfied that the viability argument has been met.\nSpeaking in favour of allowing the demolition, East Berwickshire councillor Helen Laing said: \u0026ldquoI just think this is really, really sad to lose this fabulous building.

nurseries for delivering increased free childcare has come in for criticism by inspectors.\nLanglee Primary School Nursery is one of seven early learning centres across the Borders trialling an increase in funded early learning and childcare from 600 to 1140 hours.\nBy 2020 the additional hours should be available across the whole Borders.\nEducation bosses at Scottish Borders Council believe Langlee Nursery is capable of catering for up to 100 three-, four- and eligible two-year-old children.\nBut experts from the Care Inspectorate found the centre, which is part of the new \u0026pound10 million Langlee Primary School, is struggling to cope.\nInspectors weren\u0027t happy with the lay-out of the new nursery and highlighted the \u0027high number of accidents\u0027 that had happened as well as a shortage of staff.\nA spokeswoman for the Care Inspectorate said: \"Providing lunch for a large number of children provided a significant organisational challenge and resulted in a poor experience for children.\n\"Staff tried hard to make lunch positive and did ensure children had something to eat and drink but opportunities for independence and children\u0027s choices were limited.\n\"On the day of our visit it was apparent that the space allocated to the nursery was not working well.\n\"The quality, layout and aesthetic appeal of play activities for children over three needed to be significantly improved.\n\"There had been a high number of accidents in the nursery and we asked senior staff to audit these to see if there was a pattern to time, event or children involved.\"\nLanglee Nursery is made up of two classrooms and a central atrium area.\nAnd most children have access to an outdoor play area as well.\nParents praised staff in their responses to questionnaires sent out by the inspectors.\nBut the inspectors also found problems with the turnover of staff and the need for bank workers to fill in.\nThe spokeswoman added: \"There were acknowledged challenges in the staff team.\n\"The nursery had increased in the number of children quite significantly in the last year and the staffing had lacked continuity.\n\"Additional staff needed to be employed to ensure the children\u0027s needs could be met and this was being addressed.\"\nWhile previous inspections of Langlee Nursery by the Care Inspectorate led to gradings of either \u0027very good\u0027 or \u0027good\u0027 the latest inspection found the quality of environment, of staffing, and of management as only \u0027adequate\u0027 with only the level of care and support still deemed \u0027good\u0027.\nA spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said: \"The council has already taken significant steps following the care inspectorate visit and has addressed a number of the matters raised, for example improving lunch routines.\n\"SBC takes very seriously any recommendations made during these inspections and regularly monitors progress.\n\"We are confident that the matters raised in the report are being addressed and additional support will be provided to ensure good progress is achieved quickly.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"duncan-smith-urges-no-10-to-talk-to-critics-of-brexit-plan","story":"Downing Street should seek to \u0026ldquothrash out its differences with its Brexit opponents rather than setting up a unit to \u0026ldquoaccuse and attack them, Iain Duncan Smith has said.\nThe former Tory leader told Newsnight that a meeting with critics would carry the party with them, after a senior fellow Brexiteer warned that Theresa May\u0026rsquos Chequers deal could split the party.\nFormer Brexit minister Steve Baker said he was \u0026ldquogravely concerned about a potential schism in Tory ranks if the Prime Minister did not change direction.\nIt came as the EU\u0026rsquos chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier suggested it was \u0026ldquorealistic to believe a Brexit deal could be agreed between the UK and EU in the next six to eight weeks.\nSteve Baker warned of a split in Tory ranks \nHis intervention moved the currency markets but opinion was divided on whether this meant he thought that the Chequers plan might succeed in some form.\nMr Duncan Smith spoke to Newsnight on Monday after a group of Tory MPs who oppose the Chequers plan were invited to a meeting at Downing Street.\nHe told the programme: \u0026ldquoI always think that rather than allowing a unit in Downing Street to take on its own colleagues and backbenchers, and accuse and attack them, I think the best thing is always for them to say, \u0026lsquoI tell you what, let\u0026rsquos get together and thrash this out and see what we can come up with\u0026rsquo.\n\u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos a far better approach because it carries the party with you.\nMichel Barnier said a deal in November is possible \nMr Barnier had sparked excitement earlier in the day while speaking at the Bled Strategic Forum in Slovenia, saying: \u0026ldquoIf we are realistic, I want to reach an agreement on the first stage of the negotiation, which is the Brexit treaty, within six or eight weeks.\n\u0026ldquoThe treaty is clear, we have two years to reach an agreement before they leave\u0026hellip in March 2019.\n\u0026ldquoThat means that taking into account the time necessary for the ratification process in the House of Commons on one side, the European Parliament and the Council on the other side, we must reach an agreement before the beginning of November. I think it is possible.\nHowever, another Brexiteer, Crispin Blunt, played down the significance of the comments.\nCrispin Blunt played down Mr Barnier\u0026rsquos remarks \nHe told Newsnight: \u0026ldquoIf you listen carefully to what Michel Barnier said there was no movement, there was an expression of confidence that we can get an agreement on the withdrawal agreement where we are going to give them \u0026pound39 billion.\n\u0026ldquoTerrific.  Unsurprising that they are going to go for that agreement.\n\u0026ldquoHe has been distinctly cool on Chequers. Simply saying it is the basis for discussion is hardly earth-shattering, and then you have had strong opposition to Chequers from people like the French Europe minister and others.\nMr Baker, a leading figure in the pro-Brexit Tory European Research Group, said the party\u0026rsquos annual conference in Birmingham, starting on September 30, could prove a decisive moment as Mrs May is forced to acknowledge the scale of grassroots opposition to her proposals.\nNumber 10 said critics of the plan had yet to come forward with a credible alternative which would avoid the return of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.\nBut Mr Duncan Smith told Newsnight there were \u0026ldquoplenty of solutions for that and those will be presented later on.\nHe added: \u0026ldquoThe key point is the  Commission has to be prepared to come to that party and say, \u0026lsquoyes, we are prepared to show some flexibility on this\u0026rsquo, so that there can be a UK-wide free trade deal.\n\u0026ldquoIf they do that I think you could make dramatic progress.\n.push,i[r].l=1*new

not been seen for more than 30 years, the National Trust said.\nSome 150 of the mammals, immortalised as the character Ratty in Wind In The Willows, are being released on the River Aller in the National Trust\u0026rsquos Holnicote Estate on Exmoor in Somerset, where they were last seen in the 1980s.\nTheir return to the estate\u0026nbspis part of the charity\u0026rsquos \u0026pound10 million Riverlands project to restore five rivers across England and Wales, and it is hoped the voles will boost the wildlife of the waterways running through the Exmoor property.\nThe species is thought to have been decimated by mink \nWater voles have seen numbers plummet across the country in the past few decades in the face of loss of suitable habitat and because they are preyed on by invasive American mink which escaped or were set free from fur farms.\nThey are thought to have vanished from Holnicote because of the mink, which then died out themselves because they had eaten all the available prey of water voles.\nSurveying of the streams in the estate in the past few months has revealed no presence of mink, the National Trust said.\nMr Raeder said volunteers will help monitor numbers \nThe 150 water voles have been bred from British animals and are being released in groups of siblings and in breeding pairs at six sites on the river, from where they will be able to spread along the streams of the catchment.\nA further 150 will be released in the spring.\nAlex Raeder, National Trust South West conservation manager, said: \u0026ldquoI remember being enchanted by these creatures as a child, and hugely welcome their return.\n\u0026ldquoThey were once a vital part of the Holnicote ecosystem, and could be again.\nA further 150 will be released in spring\n\u0026ldquoThis ambitious project not only brings back to its rightful home a much-loved small animal, which sadly became extinct due to human activity, but also adds to the whole wealth of wildlife and enjoyment of this wild and stunning estate.\n\u0026ldquoIn true Wind In The Willows-style, these voles should soon be busy burrowing into the muddy banks and creating more natural-looking edges to streams with shady pools that are great for so many other small creatures.\nRangers, \u0026ldquovole-unteers, students and the public will help to monitor the new arrivals, which join wildlife such as otters, kingfishers, dippers and grey wagtails along the river.\nThe reintroduction is part of a scheme on the Holnicote estate \nThey will look out for and record tell-tale signs of the water voles, including the \u0026ldquoplopping sound of them jumping into water, droppings, burrows and grass blades nibbled off at a 45-degree angle.\nThe reintroduction is part of a scheme on the Holnicote estate by the National Trust and tenant farmers to improve agriculture for the benefit of wildlife and to use\u0026nbspnatural methods in the Porlock Vale catchment to reduce flooding.\nIt is the trust\u0026rsquos first reintroduction of water voles in the South West, but follows a similar scheme by the charity to release hundreds of the mammals at Malham Tarn in the

bibliographic and local studies librarian at Live Argyll, after a conversation with Major Struthers\u0026#8217 son Charles.\u0026#8216He said he had \u0026#8216one or two things\u0026#8217 belonging to his late father,\u0026#8217 Eleanor explained. \u0026#8216It turned out to be eight boxes full of artefacts that we\u0026#8217re still going through now.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s one of the best collections from the First World War that we have seen.\u0026#8217There are parts of shot-down airships, a parachute, fragments of a radiator from a zeppelin and much more.Accompanying the artefacts, are photographs, many taken by Major Struthers himself, documenting his personal life and military career, as well as the history of airships.Major Struthers, who was mentioned in dispatches, was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, with two bars later added, for his missions with the Royal Naval Air Service, which amalgamated with the British Army\u0026#8217s Royal Flying Core to become the Royal Air Force in 1918.Major Struthers was recognised for flying more hours than any other airship pilot during the war.Aged 52 by the time the Second World War broke out, Major Struthers was too old to serve but he was in the Royal Observer Corps, his patch stretching from Sutherland to Machrihanish.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s local to Oban but it\u0026#8217s an Argyll story,\u0026#8217 said Eleanor. \u0026#8216Major Struthers was actually based in Cornwall during the war.\u0026#8217Diana Manning, from Drumlemble but originally from Cornwall, attended the exhibition\u0026#8217s Campbeltown opening to find out more about the Cornish history, and found it \u0026#8216fascinating\u0026#8217.During her opening speech, Eleanor said: \u0026#8216I think this is an area of World War One that people don\u0026#8217t really think about.\u0026#8216They think about later aircraft, especially in World War Two, but I don\u0026#8217t think they know the role they had in World War One.\u0026#8217Councillor Donald Kelly, who attended the opening, said he thought it was essential to engage with local school children: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s important that youngsters today know what went on in the past \u0026#8211 especially involving someone from Argyll.\u0026#8217The exhibition, which was launched in Oban in July, will be in Campbeltown until September 29, before moving on to Helensburgh and Dunoon.Councillor John Armour, Campbeltown\u0026#8217s library supervisor Christine McPhee, Eleanor McKay and Councillor Donald Kelly at the exhibition\u0026#8217s opening.

The other three who added \u0026#8216marks\u0026#8217 to the 10 mile, two wheeled, race against the clock were: Lynsay McGeachy, Jackie Westerman and Mark Davey.In total 16 riders, of mixed abilities, competed in a pleasant 17ºC air temperature with a wind strength of between 6mph and 12mph although all were sure at times it was far higher.KWCC organiser Robbie Semple reversed the route, from the August event, to go anti-clockwise which was ideal as only about a-quarter-of-a-mile was full into the wind.The rest of the route had a mix of cross winds and a tail wind on the long main runway straight. On a virtually pan flat course unlike most road time trials there is no assistance from descents.Since the last event a 10 mile guide to rider\u0026#8217s times has been produced.

Y. Maxtone, the following year Mr Maxtone partnered Miss B Strang.1921 must have been a strange year for mixed doubles. The winner is inscribed as P. S. MacNair without a partner. Sometimes it can be a struggle to get teams, so perhaps MacNair played singles against a doubles pair.In 1922 honours were taken by Miss C. K. MacNish and Mr E. Armour. In 1923 a different pair emerged Miss J. I. McKersie and Mr A. G. MacKelvie.Miss B. Strang returned, partnered by Mr L. Edwards in 1924. In 1925 a christian name is inscribed for the first time, when, Bella Strang, taking her third win, was partnered by  Mr C. MacTaggart.Mrs W. McKersie and Mr C. McTaggart won in 1926 and Miss S.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.

And it takes the masterplan a stage further with more detailed ideas for each of the zones proposed in its vision, including calling for the Scottish Government to be invited to base its HQ for its proposed state company on the site, as well as suggesting offshore windfarm company Inch Cape \u0026ndash which wants to place a substation on the land to bring energy ashore from proposed turbines \u0026ndash should also be encouraged to put its Scottish base there.  The community council document comes in the wake of a brochure produced by neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council promoting its vision of a Port of Prestonpans cruise terminal at the former power station site.  That proposal sparked anger among supporters of the masterplan vision, who accused the Prestonpans group of ignoring the views of the local communities.  It led to the launch of \u0026lsquoGreenhills: delivering the Masterplan\u0026rsquo, a campaign by local groups and businesses backing the consultation document.  Now Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council has drawn up a draft brochure which sets out why it supports the plans and proposes a range of detailed ways it could be taken forward.  That includes putting head offices for Inch Cape and the Scottish Government energy interests in one part of the site, identified as its \u0026lsquoEnergy Quarter\u0026rsquo.  It also floats the idea of flooding the power station footprint to create a marina \u0026ndash as suggested by a local fisherman \u0026ndash with associated retail and leisure facilities, attracting businesses such as a film studio or 3D printing innovation to the site, or even creating a brewery.  Graeme Jeffrey, community council chairman, said: \u0026ldquoAs a community council we are promoting our vision of what we would like to see. It supports the masterplan, looking at how it could be delivered.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe have set out our ambitions for a public energy company and its contribution towards tackling fuel poverty.  \u0026ldquoWe will be consulting on proposals later in the year and will make sure that Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council have an opportunity to provide their views."},{"url":null,"title":"hearing-to-take-place-on-substation-plans-at-former-cockenzie-power-station","story":"  Scottish Ministers called in the planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd  earlier this year before East Lothian Council had been given a chance to make a decision on the proposal.  ICOL wants to build a substation, which will bring energy from an offshore windfarm onshore and into the National Grid, on the former power station footprint.  The application has been opposed by local community councils and the council, who believe it is not the best use of the site, which was bought by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower in March and is subject to an ongoing masterplan process for its future.  However, within weeks of the council buying the site, Scottish Ministers called-in the only lodged application for the land, from ICOL.  They said the move was because it was of \u0026ldquonational importance and denied any link to the fact that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on a state visit to China \u0026ndash whose state-owned company Red Rock own ICOL \u0026ndash at the time of the announcement.  The reporter appointed to investigate the application carried out a site visit at the start of this month.  Following that visit, it was announced a hearing into the plans would be held and Allison Coard was named as the appointed reporter who would oversee the hearing and report back to ministers.  Ward councillor Lachlan Bruce welcomed the announcement.  He said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom glad that there is going to be a hearing on this application.  \u0026ldquoI, of course, would prefer if members of the public could also speak at the hearing to give their views and opinions but I do think that community councils being invited is a welcome step.  \u0026ldquoOf course, this is again lengthening the process of the application out. If it had been left by the Scottish Government for East Lothian to make a decision we probably would have had an outcome by now and members of the public would also have had their chance to have a say.  \u0026ldquoI am confident that the hearing will be a further step in helping to convince the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos independent reporter that the current Inch Cape application is wrong for the site and wrong for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton and Prestonpans.  Invitations have been sent out to Prestonpans and Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Councils inviting them to be represented at the hearing, along with East Lothian Council and representatives of ICOL.  All four have confirmed they will be attending the hearing.  In a statement following the visit, it was announced: \u0026ldquoThe reporter considers it would be helpful to have some wider community participation at the hearing and suggests that these views might be represented by one or both of the local community councils.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe appointed Reporter has decided that a hearing should be held on certain matters to help her consider the application, and the council has confirmed in writing that we will participate in this procedure. The council welcomes the Reporter\u0026rsquos decision to invite both Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council and Prestonpans Community Council to participate in the hearing.  A preliminary date for the start of the hearing has been announced as Tuesday, October 2, with a venue and more details of those attending to follow.  A spokesperson for ICOL said: \u0026ldquoWe welcome the announcement that a hearing will take place on the planning application for the proposed substation, in line with planning guidance for schemes of national importance.

In preparation for the fundraiser on September 22, Jane has taken to the waters off Dumfries and Galloway\u0026rsquos coast and has also linked up with the Bass Rock Swimmers, who are based in North Berwick.  Despite being an accomplished swimmer, Jane said there were still challenges.

Yet I know people who are in their 30s and 40s who are much older than me, and folk in their 60s and above who are younger. My oldest daughter is in her early 20s and is already lamenting the fact she is no longer \u0026lsquoyoung\u0026rsquo.  The truth is that age is a mentality or, as is often said, \u0026lsquojust a number\u0026rsquo. Of course, deteriorating health and pain can come with age, as I have experienced, but even then, getting this far makes me very thankful despite the wear and tear.  I often say that life is like toothpaste: we use it with abandon at first and then, as we realise it\u0026rsquos running out, each squirt becomes increasingly more precious and satisfying.  \u0026ldquoA whole summer seems nothing these days, it\u0026rsquos over before you get used to it, a friend said to me recently. And indeed it is nothing if we measure it by days passed.  Yet if we measure not the passing of hours, days or years but the accumulation of memories and experiences, then time seems longer, both in quantity and quality. The trick, then, is to make those experiences and memories, and to truly live in them as they happen. This means understanding what is truly meaningful to us, and what gives genuine joy and fulfilment.  I think that is the secret to a long life, regardless of what number you reach. It\u0026rsquos not just about how much toothpaste is in your tube, it\u0026rsquos about how much you savour and use the amount you have. All of us savour key moments, of course. The first day at school for our children, our holiday time, time with friends or spent doing things we enjoy.  Yet inevitably such moments are less common than what we might call the daily routine of life. I suppose that\u0026rsquos what makes them stand out. Thus the daily routine of \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo life shoots us by, almost without us noticing. And that\u0026rsquos most of our life.  And so I am now more determined than ever to make my life \u0026lsquonot normal\u0026rsquo for as long as I may have left. This isn\u0026rsquot a commitment to hippy living in a campervan  but a conscious decision to savour every day as if it were my last. And what really helped me in this realisation was a conversation one day while waiting for a train. . .  One spring morning just before this summer, I was standing on the platform at Prestonpans station waiting for a train. I was not used to getting this early train and was surprised how busy it was. I was heading into Edinburgh to do some storytelling and so unusually sharing my journey with commuters.  It was a beautiful warm sunny morning, the herald of the heatwave soon to arrive. As I waited for the train I scrolled on my phone. Then I heard a voice behind me saying: \u0026ldquoOn your death bed, will you really look fondly back on the countless hours, equivalent to years of your life, spent scrolling on a phone? Will you remember just one per cent of that activity, or even want to?  I turned round to see who was speaking to me there was nobody. Then I noticed the hawthorn tree.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos better, the hawthorn said. It was resplendent with blossom, leaning over the edge of the side of the bridge which takes the cars below the station.  Perhaps I had seen it before, but this time I really noticed it because it had spoken to me. I studied its flowers and took in the immense beauty of it. It\u0026rsquos perfectly situated to admire, but the hawthorn seemed sad.  \u0026ldquoCan you imagine the effort it takes to get this magnificent and beautiful? it said. \u0026ldquoYet nobody seems to notice me.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure they do, I replied. \u0026ldquoNo, they don\u0026rsquot watch, insisted the tree. And so I did.  The hawthorn was right. People walked past the tree, stood next to it, but nobody seemed to notice it, and certainly nobody took any time to admire it.  \u0026ldquoBut they are busy, I said in our defence.  \u0026ldquoWe are all busy in different ways, said the tree. \u0026ldquoBut we can choose to be \u0026lsquotoo busy\u0026rsquo for some things while being busy doing others. Often you decide what is important to be busy with so you exclude what you think are the less important things.  \u0026ldquoLike looking and admiring you? I replied sarcastically.  \u0026ldquoPrecisely, said the hawthorn, perhaps not understanding a sarcastic tone.  Suddenly the train arrived. People put away their phones and I bade a hasty farewell to the tree. We all crammed into the carriage and it filled up to the brim. I saw the blazing white of the hawthorn\u0026rsquos blossom through the window. Then we headed for Wallyford.  The train ground to a halt and the doors opened. There was a crush and people calling out politely \u0026ldquoplease move up. I wondered if everyone would get on, and I think they did, but only just. Now the train felt overloaded and it literally ground its way out of the station.  When it arrived at Musselburgh, the doors opened to present a human wall made of commuters from the Pans and Wallyford. There was simply no way anyone was getting on. I watched from the privilege of my seat. Two young men with suitcases, obviously going on holiday had no chance, and didn\u0026rsquot even try.  As the train pulled away, leaving dozens of people stranded on the platform, I felt a sense of guilt at having a seat. At Waverley we were trapped in a bottleneck by ticket collectors, ensuring that none of the lucky ones who had actually managed to get onto the train would escape paying for their good fortune.  When I returned I had to cross the bridge to my car. And there was the hawthorn tree, showing off its blossom like a peacock trying to impress a mate with its feather display.  And I have noticed the hawthorn ever since. The blossom faded as summer arrived and now it bears it berries. Its haws glisten where once there was blossom, reminding me that summer has had its course, and asking the question of how I made it memorable.  I am so thankful for the hawthorn\u0026rsquos advice. It was simple but so important. The trick is to live in the moment to notice that which makes the mundane and normal extraordinary or beautiful or special.  We can pepper our daily life with simple but extraordinary moments of connection, so a day never really remains \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo. We just have to truly live in that moment, to come out of our busyness and worries, and savour it.  Maybe the hawthorn tree will speak to you if ever you find yourself at Prestonpans train station. Or maybe someone else will your child, your grandchild, your partner, friends, your grandparents, your work colleague, or perhaps your inner self.  Maybe it wasn\u0026rsquot actually the tree which spoke to me. Perhaps it was my inner self. But then again, perhaps it was a speaking hawthorn, and you have to be \u0026lsquonot normal\u0026rsquo to hear it!"},{"url":null,"title":"leader-of-councils-conservative-opposition-steps-down-after-health-issues","story":"  Councillor Brian Small, who has held the position since being one of seven Conservative councillors elected in May 2017, stood down for a brief period last year following a severe bout of sepsis before returning to the post.

Charles Church, from Mactaggart and Mickel Homes, told the committee concerns had been raised about issues with the building contractors used on the site and they were looking at possible penalties for any future breaches of the agreed construction management plan.  Mr McMillan asked if it would be possible for any financial penalties paid to be put towards local community groups or projects. Mr Church told him that was a consideration, adding that Mactaggart and Mickel Homes \u0026ldquoalready has a fund called building communities where we invest in local communities.

The Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland  told East Lothian Council the plans to build next to medieval Dirleton Castle, which dates back to the mid 13th century, were too \u0026ldquomodern and suburban.  The association said the new development,\u0026nbspproposed at Castlemains Farm immediately to the east of the castle, would \u0026ldquoirreparably damage the setting of Dirleton, destroying the important edges that define the village and separate it from the surrounding countryside.  And at a meeting of the local authority\u0026rsquos planning committee in Haddington, councillors voted by seven to four to reject the plans, which had been recommended for approval by their own officers.  Local ward councillor Jane Henderson said that the intervention from APRS had been \u0026ldquocritical as she criticised Historic Environment Scotland, which is responsible for Dirleton Castle, after it\u0026nbspfailed to formally object to the proposals.  The public agency, who were consultees on the application, told the local authority that while they acknowledged the development might have an impact on the castle, which is a scheduled monument, they considered the proposals\u0026nbspnot to have an impact of \u0026ldquonational significance.  Councillor Henderson said: \"I am particularly disappointed in Historic Environment Scotland. How they can hold that name and come through so weakly on the setting of a castle, you have to ask questions about that.  However, the agency said it had already responded to a previous application for housing on the same site which had later been withdrawn.  They said: \u0026ldquoWe were consulted by East Lothian Council on the planning application for Castlemains Farm in January 2018, on the potential impact of this application on the setting of Dirleton Castle and Gardens which is a scheduled monument.  \u0026ldquoThis second planning application addressed the concerns that had been raised when the first planning application was submitted, primarily the impact of the development on the relationship between the castle and the land to the south and east. As a result, we did not object to the application.  \u0026ldquoWe did, however, highlight a risk of impact from landscaping and lighting, and have recommended further mitigation.  Developers Queensberry Properties told the committee they had held extensive consultations with council planners and the local community but they admitted they had come to an impasse with Dirleton Village Association and had to \u0026ldquoagree to disagree.  Their spokesman told the committee that while they wanted the new houses to face outwards on the edge of the village instead of presenting visitors with a view of \u0026ldquogarden sheds and trampolines, the village association wanted the houses to \u0026ldquoturn their back on the outside world.  Architect John Finlay, who helped produce the Dirleton Expects document outlining the village association\u0026rsquos vision for its future, said: \u0026ldquoThe design is as alien as if it had landed from outer space. It even has a suburban road, with all the clutter that entails, in the forefront of the castle.  Martin White from Gullane Area Community Council said the group was opposed to the development because \u0026ldquoyou do not hide castles.  He said: \u0026ldquoDirleton Castle is one of East Lothian\u0026rsquos top five visitor attractions. It may not be of national impact but it certainly matters in East Lothian.  The council received 71 written objections and only one representation supporting the development, which cited a need for affordable housing in the village.  Dirleton Castle is a medieval fortress which dates back to the mid-13th century and has been at the centre of numerous sieges. At one point it was owned by the Ruthvens, who were involved in several plots against Mary Queen of Scots and King James VI.  Councillor Stuart Currie, planning committee member, raised concerns that the development appeared to bear little resemblance to the original development brief for the site that the local authority had consulted on with the community.  However, planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire said the fact those opposing the development did not have the support of Historic Environment Scotland and the council\u0026rsquos own heritage officer led him to back the planning officials\u0026rsquo recommendation to approve it.

Former Brexit minister Steve Baker said he was \u0026ldquogravely concerned about a potential schism in Tory ranks if the Prime Minister did not change direction.  It came as the EU\u0026rsquos chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier suggested it was \u0026ldquorealistic to believe a Brexit deal could be agreed between the UK and EU in the next six to eight weeks.  His intervention moved the currency markets but opinion was divided on whether this meant he thought that the Chequers plan might succeed in some form.  Mr Duncan Smith spoke to Newsnight on Monday after a group of Tory MPs who oppose the Chequers plan were invited to a meeting at Downing Street.  He told the programme: \u0026ldquoI always think that rather than allowing a unit in Downing Street to take on its own colleagues and backbenchers, and accuse and attack them, I think the best thing is always for them to say, \u0026lsquoI tell you what, let\u0026rsquos get together and thrash this out and see what we can come up with\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos a far better approach because it carries the party with you.  Mr Barnier had sparked excitement earlier in the day while speaking at the Bled Strategic Forum in Slovenia, saying: \u0026ldquoIf we are realistic, I want to reach an agreement on the first stage of the negotiation, which is the Brexit treaty, within six or eight weeks.  \u0026ldquoThe treaty is clear, we have two years to reach an agreement before they leave\u0026hellip in March 2019.  \u0026ldquoThat means that taking into account the time necessary for the ratification process in the House of Commons on one side, the European Parliament and the Council on the other side, we must reach an agreement before the beginning of November. I think it is possible.  However, another Brexiteer, Crispin Blunt, played down the significance of the comments.  He told Newsnight: \u0026ldquoIf you listen carefully to what Michel Barnier said there was no movement, there was an expression of confidence that we can get an agreement on the withdrawal agreement where we are going to give them \u0026pound39 billion.  \u0026ldquoTerrific.  Unsurprising that they are going to go for that agreement.  \u0026ldquoHe has been distinctly cool on Chequers. Simply saying it is the basis for discussion is hardly earth-shattering, and then you have had strong opposition to Chequers from people like the French Europe minister and others.  Mr Baker, a leading figure in the pro-Brexit Tory European Research Group, said the party\u0026rsquos annual conference in Birmingham, starting on September 30, could prove a decisive moment as Mrs May is forced to acknowledge the scale of grassroots opposition to her proposals.  Number 10 said critics of the plan had yet to come forward with a credible alternative which would avoid the return of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.  But Mr Duncan Smith told Newsnight there were \u0026ldquoplenty of solutions for that and those will be presented later on.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe key point is the  Commission has to be prepared to come to that party and say, \u0026lsquoyes, we are prepared to show some flexibility on this\u0026rsquo, so that there can be a UK-wide free trade deal.  \u0026ldquoIf they do that I think you could make dramatic progress."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8666280.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"ratty-returns-to-river-as-charity-reintroduces-water-voles-to-exmoor","story":"  Some 150 of the mammals, immortalised as the character Ratty in Wind In The Willows, are being released on the River Aller in the National Trust\u0026rsquos Holnicote Estate on Exmoor in Somerset, where they were last seen in the 1980s.  Their return to the estate\u0026nbspis part of the charity\u0026rsquos \u0026pound10 million Riverlands project to restore five rivers across England and Wales, and it is hoped the voles will boost the wildlife of the waterways running through the Exmoor property.  Water voles have seen numbers plummet across the country in the past few decades in the face of loss of suitable habitat and because they are preyed on by invasive American mink which escaped or were set free from fur farms.  They are thought to have vanished from Holnicote because of the mink, which then died out themselves because they had eaten all the available prey of water voles.  Surveying of the streams in the estate in the past few months has revealed no presence of mink, the National Trust said.  The 150 water voles have been bred from British animals and are being released in groups of siblings and in breeding pairs at six sites on the river, from where they will be able to spread along the streams of the catchment.  A further 150 will be released in the spring.  Alex Raeder, National Trust South West conservation manager, said: \u0026ldquoI remember being enchanted by these creatures as a child, and hugely welcome their return.  \u0026ldquoThey were once a vital part of the Holnicote ecosystem, and could be again.  \u0026ldquoThis ambitious project not only brings back to its rightful home a much-loved small animal, which sadly became extinct due to human activity, but also adds to the whole wealth of wildlife and enjoyment of this wild and stunning estate.  \u0026ldquoIn true Wind In The Willows-style, these voles should soon be busy burrowing into the muddy banks and creating more natural-looking edges to streams with shady pools that are great for so many other small creatures.  Rangers, \u0026ldquovole-unteers, students and the public will help to monitor the new arrivals, which join wildlife such as otters, kingfishers, dippers and grey wagtails along the river.  They will look out for and record tell-tale signs of the water voles, including the \u0026ldquoplopping sound of them jumping into water, droppings, burrows and grass blades nibbled off at a 45-degree angle.  The reintroduction is part of a scheme on the Holnicote estate by the National Trust and tenant farmers to improve agriculture for the benefit of wildlife and to use\u0026nbspnatural methods in the Porlock Vale catchment to reduce flooding.  It is the trust\u0026rsquos first reintroduction of water voles in the South West, but follows a similar scheme by the charity to release hundreds of the mammals at Malham Tarn in the Yorkshire Dales over the past few years."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8666283.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"bee-haven-wins-shed-of-the-year-competition","story":"  George Smallwood\u0026rsquos Bee Eco Shed won the top spot in the annual competition.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In lengthy posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be, if not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to return to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But if this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But if Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":null,"title":"face-to-face-with-philip-long-the-director-of-the-new-va-dundee-on-building-the-citys-future","story":"  And what an institution.

No small task in a city that has been hit in recent decades by all the typical problems blighting post-industrial cities.  When we speak the opening is still a few weeks away. Long is sitting in a Portakabin across from the museum\u0026rsquos staff entrance, discussing the past, present and future of this project. When he first came to Dundee in 2011 the city\u0026rsquos waterfront had a long way to go. Where we are sitting, he points out, was the site of the city\u0026rsquos brutalist swimming pool. He used to go himself and be \u0026ldquohorrified and exhilarated by the fumes, he says.  All change. Across the way the museum remains sealed off from prying eyes but the fit-out is complete, the installation of the exhibitions and displays very advanced and the restaurant and caf\u0026eacute ready to go. It\u0026rsquos a Thursday in mid-August. \u0026ldquoOn Monday we have all our visitor assistants starting. That is exciting, says Long.  \u0026ldquoAbout two years we sat down as a team and said what needs to be achieved by the opening day and worked back from that to see exactly what needed to happen in relation to everything else that needed to be done and who needed to do it. And we are on track with that plan.  As you would expect, Long is an articulate spokesman for his museum. Married with two boys, he\u0026rsquos a young-looking 52, who\u0026rsquos been working on this project since 2011. \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom a little greyer than I was seven years ago, he says. \u0026ldquoI need a haircut. But I\u0026rsquove been busy.  Well, indeed. The construction of the museum has been a huge financial and technical challenge. Kengo Kuma\u0026rsquos original plans had to be reined in when the tenders for the building came in much higher than expected almost double the original \u0026pound45m. And though more money was found for its construction  it still proved a complex and testing build.  Not that Long was ever in any doubt that it would be completed. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos been developed in quite a small city, comparatively, in difficult years of political complexity and economic uncertainty. And I think the prospect of a new V\u0026ampA here was such an exciting prospect that I never thought it wasn\u0026rsquot going to happen.  Now it is on his shoulders to make it a success, of course. Is he ready for the challenge? The size of it is certainly clear to him.  \u0026ldquoPreviously, I was a curator at the National Galleries of Scotland with a responsibility for managing elements of that. But I think there is not much that can prepare anybody for the scale of this project, he admits  But that, adds Long, is also the thrill of it. \u0026ldquoTo have the responsibility to develop a new design institution in Scotland that will take very seriously its role to help people understand why design is important, that is going to look at the amazing design creativity of this country, that can bring international exhibitions to Scotland in that wonderful building, and be part of the V\u0026ampA family, then that is an amazing prospect.  The question might be what does that all entail? Or, to put it more bluntly, what does a director do? He breaks his answer into pre and post opening. \u0026ldquoThe responsibility of the director during the development phase is to develop a sense of ambition and vision for the project. What is it? What is it going to be?  And, having done so, he adds, get that vision across to the people working on the building, its stakeholders and the general public.  His job will now change, Long says. \u0026ldquoThe role will be to make sure that it does fulfil those ambitions and its intention to be an institution that helps make people understand why design is important in all our lives is fulfilled, that it creates opportunities to get more people involved, and that it makes a contribution not just to Dundee but to the country more widely.  What he wants is a building that is welcoming to everyone in Dundee. \u0026ldquoMuseums can be intimidating places or seen as places for an elite. We have developed V\u0026ampA Dundee to challenge that.  In what way? Outreach programmes, talks, forming young people\u0026rsquos groups, he explains. \u0026ldquoWe have engaged with over 100,000 people since 2012 and many of those are here in Dundee.  In a parallel universe Long could have been exhibiting in the museum rather than running it. Or even building the thing.  \u0026ldquoI almost became an architect when I was at school. I had a place to do architecture so maybe doing V\u0026ampA Dundee is fulfilling some of these early ambitions, he says.  Having grown up in Edinburgh\u0026nbspLong actually studied sculpture at art school. \u0026ldquoI trained as an artist, but I very quickly became interested in museums and galleries and how they could make a difference to people.  After studying in England, he returned to Scotland where he worked for the Fine Art Society in Glasgow, before getting a job as a junior curator at the National Galleries of Scotland. He then worked his way up to a senior position.  \u0026ldquoI had a chance to create exhibitions and work with artists and get involved in some major projects, like the development of the former Dean orphanage into the Dean Gallery, now Modern Two. I also looked after the development of Charles Jencks\u0026rsquos Landform and I worked on the development of the Artist Rooms project specifically so it could be shared across the country.  The V\u0026ampA Dundee is of a different order, it must be said. Because there is so much riding on it. But Long reckons it will deliver because the city wants it to. Needs it to, even.  \u0026ldquoWhen I came here what I sensed was there was a real enthusiasm and energy for making a change. But in terms of the physicality of the city there was much to be done on that. The V\u0026ampA Dundee is a complete new development contributing to the economic future of the city.  \u0026ldquoBut what I\u0026rsquove also seen is a sort of change in energy and sense of being able to get things done. Dundee applied to be UK City of Culture. It lost to Hull. It came a very close second, but it didn\u0026rsquot sit back and commiserate. Shortly afterwards it was successful in being awarded the title of Unesco City of Creative Design.  \u0026ldquoWhat I\u0026rsquove seen here in the city is one success leads to a greater ambition. There\u0026rsquos that sense in the city of: \u0026lsquoWe get things done here.\u0026rsquo I think that is really building confidence here.  In this Saturday\u0026rsquos Herald Magazine, the inside story of the V\u0026ampA Dundee."},{"url":null,"title":"labours-mcdonnell-holyrood-could-expect-100m-from-vat-on-private-school-fees","story":"  Speaking to the Herald on Sunday, the senior shadow cabinet figure said Holyrood would get a \u0026ldquofair share of resources from a policy his party believes could raise over \u0026pound1bn.  He also claimed that improvements made to the school system by Labour would \u0026ldquoeradicate the desire of parents to use the independent sector.  However John Edward, director of the Scottish Council of Independence Schools, said:  \u0026ldquoEvery year, our schools save the Scottish education budget \u0026pound180m, add \u0026pound450m to the Scottish economy and generate \u0026pound250m in tax. In straightened times, they secure high attainment and offer subject choice, ied curricula, wide extra-curricular provision and learning support. They should be left alone to continue that contribution to the nation.  Labour last year unveiled plans to remove the \u0026ldquoVAT exemption on private school fees, the proceeds from which would be used to pay for free school meals in the state sector.  Across the UK, around 6.5 per cent of pupils are estimated to be educated independently, although the figure is lower in Scotland. North of the border, 29,647 children and young people \u0026ndash 4.1% of the total \u0026ndash attended one of the 72 establishments that were members of the Scis in 2016.  Defenders of the Labour plan believe it would provide a spending boost in state schools, while critics said it would create an exodus from the private sector which would end up costing the taxpayer.  McDonnell, an ally of leader Jeremy Corbyn, spoke to this newspaper about the impact of a policy Labour believes could raise between \u0026pound1bn and \u0026pound1.5bn.  With most of the proceeds earmarked for increased education spending, the Scottish Parliament could expect to receive a fixed share under the Barnett Formula.  He said: \u0026ldquoOur view is that private schools should be treated no differently in terms of their services than any others. That\u0026rsquos why we believe charging VAT is fair.  \u0026ldquoThat would give us the opportunity of raising significant funds that could then be invested in education as a whole. We don\u0026rsquot see why private schools should be treated differently in this way.  The MP said Labour is working on \u0026ldquodetailed costings for the policy but said \u0026pound100m would be line with what Holyrood could expect under Barnett.  In the context of investment and improvement in state schools, he added: \u0026ldquoI can see private schools becoming unnecessary.  Private schools are also facing higher costs in Scotland after the SNP Government backed the abolition of the tax relief they enjoyed on business rates, a decision that may cost the sector \u0026pound5m.  Scottish Tory MSP Liz Smith said: \u0026ldquoIt is very disappointing to see a sustained attack on independent schools at a time when they have met the conditions of tougher charity tests and increased their provision of bursary support for those families who would otherwise not be able to attend independent schools."},{"url":null,"title":"the-women-of-the-revolution-inside-the-kurdish-rojava-revolution","story":"  In contrast to the misogyny and anti-democratic values of the jihadists of the Islamic State group, an extraordinary egalitarian and pluralist engagement is under way.  Foreign Editor David Pratt goes to the heart of the Kurdish Rojava Revolution and meets some of the women making it happen.  As befitting such a memorial to great sacrifice, it\u0026rsquos a solemn place. To wander its avenues flanked by 1,300 headstones one can only but ponder on the lives of those buried there. Sometimes though there are clues in the faces that peer out from the glass mounted framed photographs left by relatives and loved ones.  Most of those depicted are young, in their late teens and early twenties, and rather uncommon for a cemetery dedicated to fallen soldiers, many are women.  It was grey and overcast with brooding storm clouds scudding across the sky like giant Zeppelins, the day I visited the Martyr\u0026rsquos Cemetery in the northeast Syrian town of Kobane.  Almost four years have passed since that bitter siege in 2014 when Islamic State  jihadists overran most of this city near the Turkish border, only to be beaten back by the determined and near legendary resistance of mainly Kurdish fighters.  Today many consider the battle for Kobane to be a key turning point in the war against IS in Syria.  Since then something equally extraordinary too has happened in this remote corner of northern Syria a place the Kurdish name for which is Rojava or quite literally Western Kurdistan.  It\u0026rsquos a story that defies the usual narratives about Syria and the Middle East. One totally at odds too with the reactionary, hierarchical, misogynistic and vehemently anti-democratic diktats espoused by the jihadists of IS.  It was six years ago when the Syrian government regime of President Bashar al- Assad found itself embroiled in a civil war. It was at that moment too that Kurdish political parties in Rojava declared autonomy and began their extraordinary project of self-government and equality for all races, religions, women and men. Out of this was born the Rojava Revolution as it has now become commonly known.  With gender and religious equality enshrined within the revolution\u0026rsquos constitution, women, especially, play a crucial role in shaping the political direction of this remarkable movement.  All too often in the course of the revolution women or their loved ones have also made the ultimate sacrifice for a cause in which so many here passionately believe.  Women\u0026rsquos People Protection Units  were formed that fought alongside their male counterparts in the YPG, both forces being under the command and control of the leading political party of the Rojava Kurds, the Democratic Union Party .  \u0026ldquoWe came to plant flowers, we do it once a week or whenever he comes to our mind, Zuleyxa Bilad tells me while standing in the Martyr\u0026rsquos Cemetery with her daughter Gardenia alongside the grave of her husband who was killed in the bitter battle for Kobane.  It was at the height of the fighting that the YPG fighter was shot by an IS sniper in the city on a day that also saw 27 of his comrades killed, many women among them.  I asked Zuleyxa if her daughter Gardenia now five years old knew what had become of her father?  \u0026ldquoGardenia knows everything because I explained everything to her and sometimes she cries, Zuleyxa replies.  \u0026ldquoLater she will understand that her father along with his brothers and sisters died defending the revolution for all of us, so that life will be better for her and the next generation when they are adults, Zuleyxa added, before both mother and daughter continued adorning the grave with the flowers and plants they had brought from the market in Kobane.  Women have borne the brunt of the fight against IS and shouldered the responsibility of defending and shaping the Rojava Revolution in so many ways. Some like Zuleyxa have lost husbands, sons and daughters. Others themselves have served and perished on the frontlines.  So many of the graves in Kobane\u0026rsquos Martyr\u0026rsquos cemetery have the names of young women inscribed into the marble of their headstones or have pictures of them smiling and dressed in the khaki military fatigues of the all-female YPJ People\u0027s Self-Defence Units.  As well as resisting IS in Kobane, women were also involved as part of the umbrella Syrian Democratic Forces  that comprises both Kurds and Arabs, in the fierce fighting that culminated in October last year in the ousting of IS from its self-proclaimed capital Raqqa, most of which now lies in bomb blasted ruins.  More recently women have fought and died too on the battlefields surrounding the city of Afrin. There Turkish forces and their militia allies who have much in common with the jihadists of IS, have advanced forcing many Kurds and others to flee eastwards to Kobane.  \u0026ldquoOur family\u0027s ancestors have been living in Afrin for over 200 years, says Nuri Urik, a 45-year-old Kurd who, along with his family and thousands of others, was forced from Afrin by the fighting.  Today, he and his wife, children and grandchildren have taken up home in Kobane.  \u0026ldquoThe whole journey was traumatic with the constant bombing, but the moment that we left Afrin was the worst, nobody remained in the village, everyone left, Mr Urik recalled, of the day just a few months ago when he and his family fled.  During the journey, his daughter-in-law Hemide Dede was pregnant. Once in Kobane, she gave birth to his granddaughter Xedice, who when we talked was just weeks old.  Tough as life is in Kobane the womenfolk of Mr Urik\u0026rsquos family now find themselves in a very different environment to the one they would have been subject to had they stayed in Afrin at the mercy of the occupying Turkish forces and their Islamist militia allies.  The beating political heart of the Rojava project is generated by communal assemblies, in which local people take decisions for themselves, be it about jobs, the environment, healthcare, literacy, the rights of the displaced or whatever. In every sphere women are scrupulously given an equal voice to men and women co-chair every meeting and every assembly.  Emina Bekir and her colleagues Almaz Rumi and Heval Heyad run the Kobane Women\u0026rsquos Board, the sharp end of an administration that deals with the day-to-day work of providing facilities to help women, ranging from creches to literacy project for the elderly.  \u0026ldquoThings are far from ideal and basic resources remain out biggest problem, but we have every right to be proud of what we have achieved so far and with adequate overseas support who knows what we are capable of, says Emina Bekir head of the Kobane Women\u0026rsquos Board. She has a point. From local defence groups and Women\u0026rsquos Academies\u0026rsquo to advance equal opportunities in education to \u0026lsquoWomen\u0026rsquos Houses\u0026rsquo where those who have experienced domestic violence can find shelter, support and legal representation there is much to admire.  For their part critics have claimed that the Rojava revolution is \u0026lsquocultish,\u0026rsquo \u0026lsquocommunist\u0026rsquo or \u0026lsquopseudo Marxist\u0026rsquo to mention just some of the negative observations cast its way. But while there are elements of such characteristics, up close the Rojava Revolution remains democratic in a way many in the West would be envious of.  Real people by and large govern here, not the career and opportunist politicians that have come to plague so much of governance in the West.  The real internal hands-on workings of this system became clearer one afternoon while in Kobane when I visited a cultural centre where hundreds of local women and others displaced by the fighting from the city of Afrin had gathered for a conference. Young and not so young, all were members of the local \u0026lsquoParastina Jin\u0026rsquo a local community defence group.  \u0026ldquoRight now here in Rojava there is a revolution within the revolution, insisted Ayse Efendi, who is co-chair of the Movement for a Democratic Society and was presiding over the conference.  Married to former co-chairman of the PYD, Salih Muslim Muhammad, she like many women of the revolution I encountered was keen to stress that what is underway in Rojava is not just a fight for the rights of Kurdish women but also for non-Kurdish minorities, mostly Arabs but also Syriacs, Turkmen and Assyrians.  This is not just wishful thinking but implemented at the most basic level. If for example language difficulties arise during meetings or conferences then interpreters are provided as I myself witnessed.  No distinction on the basis of ethnicity or background is made and it doesn\u0026rsquot stop there. Beyond the region too what the Rojava experience represents says Ayse Efendi is \u0026ldquothe fight for women\u0026rsquos rights internationally.  This global outlook and senses of solidarity was something I was to hear time and again from women\u0026rsquos representatives in Rojava.  To date the Rojava womens\u0026rsquo achievements are nothing short of remarkable in a region traditionally very conservative and home to rural and peasant norms. Here the \u0026lsquoold ways\u0026rsquo included prevailing attitudes that saw the existence of child marriage and keeping women at home.  Many women made the point that historically the problems they faced derived mainly from two sources, the family and the state. Intimidation and arrest were for a long time common in this part of Syria for those women who did not toe the established line.  \u0026ldquoHistorically there were certain people in both these sections of society who believed that if women became educated and emancipated, they would become a source of problems for wider society and the then existing political infrastructure, says Nejbir Teyar a 24 year old spokeswoman for the Kongreya Star .  Kongreya Star is a confederation of Rojava women\u0026rsquos organisations whose guiding principle is that \u0026ldquowithout the liberation of women, a truly free society is impossible. It has been pivotal in the significant advances made in gender relations in the region.  \u0026ldquoWhen you look at Kurdish history, women have always been a powerful influence in the family but we have taken that influence and emphasised its positive rather than negative factors, Ms Teyar explained.  I put it to her that the Middle East was a challenging place to say the least for anyone seeking to enhance women\u0026rsquos rights and asked where might the Rojava women\u0026rsquos revolution be in say five years time?  \u0026ldquoWe are not daunted by such challenges, women have been suffering for thousands of year, but if we organise to get there then nothing can stop us, came her reply adding again too the importance of global solidarity.  \u0026ldquoWe do not see ourselves detached from other women\u0026rsquos struggles internationally, when we see a single women suffer we feel the pain, she told me.  On the morning that I left Kobane to begin my journey home it was an early start. In the dawn light we pulled up at the first of many checkpoints where a young women YPJ member dressed in camouflage fatigues and carrying a Kalashnikov rifle checked our ID. A short time later on the city\u0026rsquos outskirts we passed the Martyr\u0026rsquos Cemetery shrouded in drizzle, but I could just make out the figures of other women YPJ members laying flowers on another grave. The Rojava Revolution goes on."},{"url":null,"title":"teachers-could-get-10-pay-boost-under-35m-government-proposal","story":"  The package would include a three per cent rise for teachers earning up to \u0026pound80,000 a year and a separate \u0026pound25m to overhaul the main grade scale for those in the profession.  However, details of the plan have angered a trade union for other local government staff who are not being offered an extra \u0026pound25m.  Gary Smith, Scotland secretary of the GMB union, said: \u0026ldquoIf there is going to be a load more money for teachers, it\u0026rsquos going to be an explosive cocktail for public-sector pay talks.  Teachers\u0026rsquo pay is determined by a tripartite body that includes the Scottish Government, representatives from councils \u0026ndash as the employer \u0026ndash and union negotiators.  However, the group has failed to reach an agreement after the teaching unions called for a 10 per cent pay rise.  The Educational Institute of Scotland , which represents most teachers north of the Border, has signalled that strike action could be taken unless their demand is met.  Leaked papers from the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, which represents councils, provide a detailed summary of the revised proposal.  In March, Cosla made an initial offer to all bargaining groups, including teachers, of a three per cent rise for staff earning up to \u0026pound36,500 and two per cent for those on higher salaries. The proposal was rejected.  Derek Mackay, the Cabinet Secretary for Finance, then wrote to Cosla last month and agreed to an additional \u0026pound10m which would extend the three per cent rise to teachers earning between \u0026pound36,501 and \u0026pound80,000.  He also backed another \u0026pound25m for a wider \u0026ldquorestructuring of the main pay scale, aimed at improving recruitment and retention.  The paper noted: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government has proposed a better offer for teachers and is prepared to fund it. Collectively it represents an investment over its two elements of \u0026pound35m.  Cosla, which is responsible for making a formal pay offer, backed the plan this month and teacher representatives are now considering the detail.  A local authority source said the two elements, taken together, could result in a sizeable number of teachers getting a rise in excess of 10 per cent.  The Cosla paper cautioned that the new plan would not \u0026ldquoguarantee a settlement with the unions, but stated: \u0026ldquoWhat it would do, however, is force a decision by the EIS to gamble or settle. Gambling on getting a mandate for industrial action in pursuit of an unachievable claim when three per cent is on the table and a desirable restructuring of the main grade on offer would be a bold move by a trade union not known for foolhardy decisions.  The document also suggested that the Government had \u0026ldquoexpressed an eagerness to \u0026ldquode-couple that rise from the pay scale revamp, on the grounds that the second element is a \u0026ldquopolicy intervention designed to correct a \u0026ldquofailure in the teacher market.  Smith\u0026rsquos GMB members, who include cleaners and care workers, have also been offered three per cent \u0026ndash which the union rejected \u0026ndash but not an additional \u0026pound25m.  \u0026ldquoWe don\u0026rsquot grudge teachers anything, but our members are doing more work than ever. It will add fuel to the fire, he said.  Councillor Gail MacGregor, Cosla resources spokesperson, said the Government\u0026rsquos \u0026pound10m had been \u0026ldquomatched pound for pound by council leaders for the general workforce: \u0026ldquoIt should not be forgotten that Scottish local government is the employer and the one making the offer. We are also funding the vast majority of the offer to teachers within the limited resources we have at our disposal \u0026ndash so it would be wrong to solely focus on the \u0026pound10m from Government.  \u0026ldquoSecondly there is a separate discussion around the \u0026pound25m for restructuring of the pay grade and a joint commitment to look at that \u0026ndash but that is nothing to do with the pay deal it is totally separate.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoTeachers\u0026rsquo pay is a matter for the Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers  and negotiations for 2018-19 are now well under way and making progress.  An EIS spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoAt this week\u0026rsquos SNCT Extended Joint Chairs meeting an amended pay offer was proposed. The teachers\u0026rsquo side of the SNCT will now consider the offer in detail. A further negotiating meeting of the Extended Joint Chairs is scheduled for the September 18, where the teachers\u0026rsquo side will respond formally to the offer."},{"url":null,"title":"lifeline-to-scotlands-islands-in-jeopardy-as-ageing-fleet-faces-soaring-passenger-numbers","story":"  The 50-year-old heating engineer has been trying to tell how little he thinks of the ferry service to his island. Now he has decided to show it instead.  So he ushers us in the shade behind his white van and brandishes a photo of the empty car deck of an ageing ro-ro. \"They had told us the boat was fully booked,\" he says. \"But it was empty. Computer problems.\"  Mr Higgins is having a picnic lunch on the front at Brodick, Arran\u0027s main port, as another load of tourists in sunglasses, their faces glowing red from sun and sea, trundle hand luggage along its promenade. \"I like to get off the island when the visitors come,\" he smiles, watching them. \"That is not always easy. In the summer you have to book three weeks in advance.\"  It is a brilliant September day, the Firth of Clyde is a flat azure that melts seamlessly in to the sky and Arran is heaving. It has been all season. So are the boats that provide its lifeline links to the mainland. The island is home to just over 5,000 people. Last year 911,434 passengers were clocked on its two ferry routes. That is 20 per cent more than a decade ago. The figures for cars are rising even faster, by 44 per cent from 2007 to total 229,664 in 2017.  This summer traffic \u0026ndash most of it on what is often a two-boat service out of Ardrossan on the North Ayrshire coast \u0026ndash has grown again.  The passengers Mr Higgins watched had passed through a high-tech adjustable gangway and state-of-the-art terminal . But they did so after coming off a boat built in 1984, the MV Isle of Arran. And that is a problem.  The vessel, its interior a beige time capsule of sticky seats and retro puggies, has had problems, more specifically this year, propeller pitch control problems. Cue service disruption, and not for the first time.  The old boat was supposed to have been replaced this summer by a new high-tech environmentally friendly vessel called the Glen Sannox. That ship is delayed. Hence the frustration of Mr Higgins and much the rest of Arran.  Yet this local row \u0026ndash albeit affecting Scotland\u0027s busiest ferry route \u0026ndash is just one symptom of a much bigger problem, a problem that has been a generation in the making.  Simply put, Scotland\u0027s islands are getting record numbers of visitors but the boats and port infrastructure carrying them are old, really old.  There is a mantra in the ferry industry about this crisis. Nobody, insiders insist, is to blame. And nobody, they add, will be able to find a quick fix.  That is because half of the ferries on Clyde and Hebridean routes have seen out their ideal lifespan of 25 years.  The average age of a ship is 22. In the early 1990s, the last time Scotland had a major burst of ferry-building , the average age was 12. The number, unchecked, has been rising ever since. In fact, it has been a generation since Scotland, one of Europe\u0027s most \"islandy\" nations, was launching enough ferries to sustain its fleet.  The result? Boats break down. And when they break down they are hard to fix. And our islands suffer.  So far this year five ships on Clyde and Hebridean services have been out of service. One, the Hebridean Isles, built 1985, which usually services Islay, has been laid up twice, thanks to damage in rough seas off Tiree and a collision with the harbour at Kennacraig on Kintyre.  Newer ships, such as the MV Clansman, which services the outer Hebrides from Oban, are among those out of action.  Bad things happen at sea that is to be expected. What counts is whether the entire system \u0026ndash fleet-wide \u0026ndash can cope when they do.  Take Calmac. The biggest operator of ferries runs most services to islands and peninsulas in Western Scotland. It is state-owned. Its ferries are owned by another state owned entity, CMAL, which also owns or leases the boats that, under a separate Northlink franchise, service routes to the Northern Isles of Orkney and Shetland.  Between January and the end of July this year, some 2,326 out of 79,203 Calmac scheduled sailings were cancelled. Of these 327 were for mechanical reasons. Most of the rest were because of bad weather.  The figure for cancellations for problems with the ferries looks low, not least because Calmac will stress that it laid on more than 900 extra sailings to compensate for some of them.  However, a ferry that does not sail is not quite like a bus that does not turn up on time. There are rarely alternatives. And with ferries packed to capacity, alternative travel is not always easily arrangeable.  When a boat breaks down, a replacement has to come from somewhere else. Somebody always loses. Calmac does not have a spare vessel, crewed and fuelled, bobbing about at sea waiting to save the day. Indeed, even if it did have a spare, Calmac could far from guarantee it could use it. Why? Every port has its own pecularities, whether it is an ageing linkspan or unusual tide. This is not a standardised fleet. Most ships and ports are bespoke.  Usually Calmac gets the blame. It is the firm with the name on the side of its ships, with their trademark blue hulls and white superstructures. In fact, the firm, which had to compete to secure its franchise from its own government owners, has been warning about a growing problem with its service for years.  Back in 2010 the company bluntly told the Scottish Government that a new ferry would have to be launched every year just to stand still.  In its submission to that year\u0027s ferry review, it said such a drumbeat of production could cut the average age of the fleet from 22 in 2012 to 19.5 in 2022.  Warnings have echoed ever since. In March, Calmac\u0027s chief executive, Robbie Drummond, signalled this summer could be tough. He said: \"Any issues with a vessel on one part of the network will have knock-on effects for other routes, as boats need to be diverted or deployed elsewhere to keep the lifeline network running.  \"Islay has already been adversely affected by such changes this week, with one of the two ferries that normally serve the island needing to be withdrawn to fulfil contractual obligations elsewhere.  \"The working life expectancy of a ferry deployed on routes like those on Scotland\u0027s western seaboard is around 25 years, so with nearly half of the ferries working these routes already beyond that milestone - and having been used intensively during those years of service - the risk of mechanical failures and breakdown is significant.  \"It also takes longer to get older boats back into service when things do go wrong, often due to the difficulty in sourcing parts across Europe.\"  By May there were more grumbles. Mr Drummond, summoned to Holyrood, spelled out the problems again. He told MSPs: \"It remains the case that we have no spare vessels to accommodate this eventuality.  \"It was not a minor breakdown a major vessel has been out for more than two months, and is coming back in for another two weeks while we get back on track.  \"There has been a period of major disruption\u0026mdashthe worst the company has experienced for eight years. We have tried as best we can to provide the best possible service through that period.\"  Key stakeholders are not happy. Outer Hebrides Tourism  reckons it lost \u0026pound6m from service cancellations after the breakdown of one boat. Ian Fordham, its chairman, this week said: \"While the Scottish Government must now invest in CalMac to improve fleet resilience, they should also recompense our local businesses and invest in rebuilding confidence in the Outer Hebrides as a tourist destination after the negative economic impact of this summer\u0027s ferry fiasco. This has hit tourism business not just this summer but its future growth too.\"  It is not as if the Scottish Government is not investing. The current SNP administration has put a cool billion pounds in to ferry services since it came to power in 2007. This includes \u0026pound97m for two new ferries being built for CMAL at Ferguson Marine in Port Glasgow. The first of these, the MV Glen Sannox, was supposed to go in to service this summer to replace the Isle of Arran but will not start operating until, at current estimates, next summer. A second, now codenamed 802, will run to the Western Isles to help address the OHT\u0027s concerns. It isn\u0027t convinced. Among its other complaints were that two new ferries were delayed \"with nothing else in a build pipeline.\"  \"How they will manage this against the backdrop of traffic and visitor growth to the Outer Hebrides?\" it said.  The boom in visitors was not expected. Some put that down to the Scottish Government\u0027s flagship \"road equivalent tariff\" or RET scheme under which a ferry journey should not cost more than a drive. But other factors are at play: the collapse of the pound after the Brexit vote means more tourists from both home and abroad.  Across the Calmac network, the last five years have been busy. Between 2012 and 2017 the number of cars carried grow by 37 per cent to 1.43m per year. Passenger numbers rose 17 per cent to 5.2 million per year.  Joe Cullinane is pleased with that. He leads North Ayrshire Council, which includes key Clyde ferries, including Arran\u0027s. \"The fleet is too old to meet the demands of RET,\" he says. \"RET is great for the added tourism. But the infrastructure is not ready to cope with RET, our roads, our ports and our ferries.\"  The RET pressure has been hardest on Mr Cullinane\u0027s patch. Tiny Cumbrae, gets more visitors than all of the Western Isles put together. So many, in fact, that there is now routine traffic congestion in the sedate resort town of Largs from where a new hybrid ferry sails. Why? Cars queuing for the hop across the First of Clyde.  The new ferries on order at Ferguson Marine are also hybrids. This vexes some of Scotland\u0027s \"armchair admirals\", the voices berating the decision to invest in new tech, rather than tried and tested conventional ships. The delays to the two new ships have been at least partly put down to the risk of innovation. Some critics have also suggested a quick order could be placed for a cheep-and-cheerful diesel-guzzling chugger in a low-cost shipyard in the Far East. Policy-makers reckon that would just be another stop-gap solution.  The Scottish Goverment quango Transport Scotland asked Calmac and CMAL to look for off-the-shelf boats to buy or lease to fill the gaps. It even suggested that it would pay for them. So couldn\u0027t Scotland just pick up a \"rustbucket\" from the Greek Islands or Norway? No. There are just no vessels out there that would work.  Transport Scotland said it \"continued to invest\" in new ships and ports. Its experts stress that ferries should not be seen as ships in isolation. They are part of a complex system that includes ports and other transport connections. They have to \"fit\".  CMAL had no comment. It has its two new delayed ships on order and then will look to get another, for Islay. The future of Scottish ferries - of Scotland\u0027s islands - now lies in the hands of a document CMAL published in January. The Vessel Replacement and Deployment Plan or VRDP is a detailed run-down of what boat should go where for years to come. It\u0027s very last words should be music to the ears of Scottish islanders and visitors. It says: \u0026ldquoConsider the opportunity to develop a medium/large class of major vessel capable of working effectively and efficiently on a number of routes across the network.  What this means is a move to more standardised vessels for big routes, namely from Oban to Colonsay, Islay, Coll and Tiree from Mallaig to Lochboisdale in the Western Isles and Armadale on Skye and from Wemyss Bay on the Clyde to Rothesay on Bute. For standardised ships, these ports will have to have standardised or future-proof harbour facilities built. That is big money. But, crucially, it would mean Calmac could reshuffle its fleet far more easily when something goes wrong.  The VRDP did not say when such plans would be considered. Transport Scotland was able to. It\u0027s next year. A spokesman said: \"The focus of the next vessel procurement will be a new ferry for Islay to replace the MV Hebridean Isles. This will maintain our investment programme, currently focused on the construction of two major vessels for the CMAL fleet and a number of major harbour projects.  \"The development of a medium/large class of major vessel will be considered by Transport Scotland, CMAL and CalMac as part of their programme of work. This is intended to get underway next year.\"  Back on Arran there was more trouble this weekend. The island\u0027s other main ferry, the Caledonian Isles, now exactly 25 years old, was cancelled for technical reasons. Islanders are used to this.  Sheila Gilmore, out walking her cockapoo Archie, was philosophical. Arran born and bred, she now runs the local destination marketing bureau, Visit Arran. \"It is frustrating when you can\u0027t get off the island. We have to get used to that. What we want is to make sure we have two ferries on the main Ardrossan route all year round. Across the network? Resilience is the issue. We need a spare boat.\""},{"url":null,"title":"world-trade-centre-subway-station-reopens-for-first-time-since-911","story":"  Cheers erupted as the first train rolled into the new WTC Cortlandt station.

Mr Still examined video and photo evidence and fans\u0027 testimonies, and visited Celtic Park to look at the concourse at Janefield Road where the North Stand overhangs the road.  He said it was clear \"three times\" the safe amount of fans were packed into the area last Sunday.  Five fans were hurt and dozens had to climb over fences and walls to escape the crush as panic spread through the crowd.  Both the police and the club are investigating the incident.  Celtic announced on Friday that they have drafted in safety consultants to carry out an independent review.  Mr Still, a professor of crowd science at Manchester politan University, told the Sunday Mail: \"The density of fans appears to be six to seven people per square metre - three times the maximum safe level of about two per square metre.  \"At too high density, any trip, slip or fall means people do not have the opportunity to react safely - and this can have a catastrophic effect.  \"It\u0027s just luck that the outcome wasn\u0027t worse.\"  Chief Superintendent Brian McNulty, divisional commander for Greater Glasgow, said the safety of fans is an \"absolute priority\".  He praised staff on the ground that day for \"acting quickly\" to prevent the situation worsening, adding: \"We will continue to work with Celtic FC and with supporters to learn from Sunday and improve future operations.\"  Celtic said it has instructed Fairhurst, consultants in sports event safety management, to examine the incident and urged any fans with information to come forward."},{"url":null,"title":"new-technology-should-mean-shorter-working-week-and-better-wages","story":"  Frances O\u0026rsquoGrady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress , has called for a four-day week for workers, allowing them to share in the wealth generated by technological advances.  She will tell the TUC Congress in Manchester today: \u0026ldquoIn the 19th century, unions campaigned for an eight-hour day. In the 20th century, we won the right to a two-day weekend and paid holidays.  \u0026ldquoSo, for the 21st century, let\u0026rsquos lift our ambition again.  \u0026ldquoI believe that in this century we can win a four-day working week, with decent pay for everyone.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos time to share the wealth from new technology. Not allow those at the top to grab it for themselves.  \u0026ldquoWe need strong unions with the right to go into every workplace - starting with Amazon\u0026rsquos warehouses here in the UK.  Research by the TUC showed that most workers expect only managers and shareholders to reap the benefits of new technology.  However, the survey of over 2,000 workers also found that four out of five employees want to cut their working hours without losing any pay as new technology makes work more efficient.  The TUC believes moves should be put in place to try to cut the working week to four days over the course of this century.  In her speech, Ms O\u0026rsquoGrady accused employers of making staff work unpredictable or unsocial hours because of an \u0026ldquoalways on culture.  She added that too many firms were using technology to treat workers unfairly.  The general secretary said: \u0026ldquoBosses and shareholders must not be allowed to hoover up all the gains from new technology for themselves.  \u0026ldquoWorking people deserve their fair share - and that means using the gains from new technology to raise pay and allow more time with their families.  \u0026ldquoIf productivity gains from new technology are even half as good as promised then the country can afford to make working lives better.  However, while unions believe there are potential gains to be made from new technology, they also have concerns about robots and machinery replacing workers.  A report published earlier this year also warned that the UK is lagging behind other nations in terms of readiness for increased automation.  Pat Rafferty, Scottish Secretary of Unite, has previously claimed that there are positives for workers, but warned against a \u0026ldquonightmare scenario of machines replacing workers and cataclysmic numbers thrown out of work.  Unison have also argued that, while the impact of new technology is sometimes exaggerated by experts, strategies on automation need to be put in place now to ensure workers can transition into other roles.  The Scottish Government has already put a number of steps in place to address the issue, including further investment in digital skills, the creation of a Just Transition Commission, and a plan to provide direct support for additional business research and development."},{"url":null,"title":"why-time-could-be-right-for-tvs-queen-of-calm-to-take-dimblebys-job","story":"  She\u0026rsquos fond of an occasional single malt with ice to help her unwind, or a refreshing G\u0026ampT to perk her up.

The job becomes vacant in mid-December, when David Dimbleby hangs up his colourful tie collection and ends 25 years of pointing at slightly discombobulated audience members while attempting to describe their clothes or hairstyles without causing offence.\u0026nbsp  But first he will be in his usual centre stage spot, when Question Time rolls into the Scottish Parliament debating chamber next month, for a programme that will form part of the Festival of Politics.  The October 11 programme is likely to be the last chance for Scots to see a master chairman at work before a new, fresh-faced presenter takes over.\u0026nbsp  According to the bookies, that will probably be Wark, frontrunner among a Who\u0026rsquos Who of broadcasters linked to a role said to earn Dimbleby around \u0026pound450,000 a year.\u0026nbsp  Challenging the 62-year-old Scot is fellow Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis, BBC News Channel Newswatch host Samira Ahmed, daytime presenter Victoria Derbyshire, Channel 4 anchorman Krishnan Guru-Murthy and ex-Newsnight host Jeremy Paxman.\u0026nbsp  Read more:\u0026nbspKirsty Wark and BBC colleagues call for \"urgent solutions\" over gender pay gap  So, what are Glasgow-based Wark\u0026rsquos chances?

Despite criticism of \u0026ldquodumbing down with guests that include actors and comedians, Question Time remains the UK\u0026rsquos foremost political programme, with about 2.7million viewers.\u0026nbsp  It hit a peak of 8.3m when Nick Griffin of the BNP appeared on the panel in 2009 \u0026ndash a point that ushered in a new, highly controversial style of panel member, and saw Nigel Farage and opinionated historian David Starkey favoured over what some might regard as far more relevant political voices.  That, says former Scottish first minister Jack McConnell,\u0026nbsp  now Lord McConnell of Glenscorrodale, has contributed to the programme losing its way.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos deliberately moved away from a programme that expands the knowledge of the viewer, to one that has attempted to be an entertainment show in which people shout at each other.  In an age when too many media interviews are carefully controlled to produce a line for news, Question Time could play an important role. Instead, it produces zero public benefit in that context.  While reluctant to discuss his friend\u0026rsquos potential role on the programme, his vision of the next presenter is not a million miles away from Wark.  He says: \u0026ldquoThe role needs someone who has authority, who is well-researched and doesn\u0026rsquot rely on research done by a team behind the scenes.

In April, then social security minister Jeane Freeman added: \u0026ldquoThe new Social Security Scotland service will have a presence in every local authority area.  However, despite the new agency due to deliver its first benefit this week, it has offices in just two councils - its HQ in Dundee and an administrative office in Glasgow.  The figures emerged in a parliamentary written answer from Social Security Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville.  She said: \u0026ldquoSocial Security Scotland have been meeting regularly with council representatives to identify suitable opportunities for co-location ahead of local delivery services becoming fully operational. To date, offices in two local authority areas have been acquired, these being the interim Headquarters for Social Security Scotland in Dundee and an interim administrative office in Glasgow.  Ministers have not published a firm timetable for opening high street offices, but the phased roll-out of new devolved benefits means they will be vital by next summer.  However the Scottish Tories claimed the government was falling behind on a key pledge. \u0026nbsp  Tory MSP Michelle Ballantyne said: \u0026ldquoAfter years and years of complaining from the sidelines about welfare reform, the SNP is about to discover just how difficult it is to create a fair and affordable social security system.  \u0026ldquoEarlier this year, it stated every local authority area would have a local presence when it comes to new social security powers. Yet just two of Scotland\u0026rsquos 32 councils have this.  \u0026ldquoThe SNP\u0026rsquos narrative on much-needed welfare reform may have served a certain political purpose for the nationalists. But now ministers have to get on with delivering these payments, and it appears it has got off to a poor start.  Social Security Scotland is due to start its work delivering benefits today, with letters going out to around 75,000 telling them of a new automatic benefit worth \u0026pound221.  The twice-yearly Carers\u0026rsquo Allowance Supplement, which is worth an extra \u0026pound8.50 a week  on top of the UK maximum of \u0026pound64.60, will be backdated to April.  The supplement, will be worth more than \u0026pound30m a year to carers in receipt of DWP Carer\u0026rsquos Allowance on the qualifying date of April 16.  The vast majority of payments are due to be made this month, with the rest in October.

She told the trade union gathering in Manchester that, two years on, nothing had been done to stop Universal Credit cuts, tackle zero hours contracts, build enough council homes or improve wages.  \"We have a hear-nothing, see-nothing, do-nothing government, declared Ms O\u0026rsquoGrady. \"Working people deserve a better government than this one.\"  She called on Mrs May to stand down if she could not deliver a Brexit deal that protected jobs and rights and properly fund public services.  \"If you won\u0027t give us the new deal that working people demand Mrs May, stand down and take your do-nothing government with you. Give us a general election and we\u0027ll do everything in our power to elect a new prime minister who will.\"  Ms O\u0027Grady also accused Boris Johnson of \"dog-whistle racism\" over his recent controversial comments about burkas.  The TUC chief won loud applause from delegates when she said: \"A woman who wears a niqab or a burka is still our sister. We defend the right of Muslim women, and all women, to wear whatever they want.\"  Meanwhile at the Manchester conference, Gail Cartmail, the Assistant General Secretary of Unite, called for those individuals involved in the collapse of construction giant Carillion to face an immediate criminal investigation.  The public service union lead said the Insolvency Service was only just starting to investigate if laws were broken, eight months after the company went out of business.  \"This is simply too little too late, declared Ms Cartmail. \"There must be an immediate criminal investigation into Carillion and we the trade union movement must lead that call. If no laws were broken, then we need, better, stronger laws.\"  She said thousands of workers and apprentices were \"dumped without warning\" when Carillion collapsed.  \"The Government and other organisations are treating Carillion\u0027s collapse as business as normal. There is nothing normal about the biggest corporate collapse in the UK\u0027s history.  \"While thousands of workers have been thrown on the scrapheap, those responsible for driving the company into the ditch have dusted themselves off and started again as if nothing had happened.  \"If nothing criminal occurred, then we should be told how on earth it can be legal to have embarked on the policies pursued by Carillion\u0027s management team which drove it to the wall with little prior warning,\" she said.  Ms Cartmail questioned why a company losing millions of pounds was shown to be making a profit on paper.  \"I am advised not to say this was cooking the books, so I won\u0027t,\" she added.  Dave Prentis, the General Secretary of Unison, attacked the privatisation of public services, saying: \"While Grenfell will forever be associated with neglect, Carillion will forever be associated with greed.\"  The conference called for an independent inquiry into the collapse of Carillion, and into privatisation of public services.  Mr Prentis told the conference: \"Privatisation is all about taking from the needy and giving to the greedy. It\u0027s the pinnacle of vulture capitalism that leaves chaos, waste and human tragedy in its wake.  \"Thirty miles from here lies an unfinished hospital, the Royal Liverpool. A \u0026pound300 million building site abandoned by Carillion, as the company crumbled to dust. Carillion was a private company lauded by successive governments, deemed too big to fail.  \"But its collapse left workers unpaid and apprentices sacked. Thousands of workers left worried about whether they still had jobs, their security wiped out overnight as their future came crashing down.  \"The collapse of Carillion symbolises the failed dogma of privatisation.

That was ahead of economist expectations for a 0.1 per cent and 0.5 per cent rise respectively.  Economic growth was bolstered in part by the UK\u0027s dominant services sector, which grew 0.3 per cent month on month thanks to activity in the professional, scientific and technical industries.  On a three-month basis, the services sector grew by 0.6 per cent on the back of a rise in retail and wholesale trading, bolstered by growth in food sales during the World Cup and hot weather.  Construction also performed strongly, rising 0.5 per cent in July on the back of stronger than usual growth in housebuilding for this time of year.  It sent construction output to a record high, with the sector growing 3.3 per cent on a three-month basis.  The pound was positive on the news, up 0.15 per cent on the US dollar to trade at 1.293, and rising 0.2 per cent versus the euro to 1.118.  Commenting on the figures, the Rob Kent-Smith, the ONS\u0026rsquos head of GDP, said: \"Growth in the economy picked up in the three months to July.  \"However, production fell back, with manufacturing again slipping a little while energy generation and supply fell due to reduced demand.  \"The dominant service sector again led economic growth in the month of July with engineers, accountants and lawyers all enjoying a busy period, backed up by growth in construction, which hit another record high level.\"  A 0.2 per cent contraction in manufacturing dragged on production growth, which was up just 0.1 per cent in July. The agricultural sector also shrank 0.1 per cent.  Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club, said the overall economic performance in July could put the UK on track to beat expectations for the third quarter of 2018.  \"We had expected GDP growth to be stable at 0.4 per cent quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter but the July data means there is a very real chance it could improve to 0.5 per cent quarter-on-quarter.\"  However, Mr Archer said he did not believe the latest release set the stage for a surprise interest rate rise by the Bank of England this Thursday.  \"The Bank will highly likely regard GDP growth of 0.3 per cent month-on-month in July and 0.6 per cent on a three-month/three-month basis as justifying its decision to raise interest rates from 0.50 per cent to 0.75 per cent in August.  \"We do not expect any more[rises in] interest rates until after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019 given the major uncertainties that may occur in the run-up to the UK\u0027s departure,\" he added."},{"url":null,"title":"historic-scots-church-celebrates-375-years-in-the-netherlands","story":"  Founded in 1643, the Scots International Church in Rotterdam was born out of a need for a place of worship for the large numbers of Scottish sailors, soldiers, merchants and builders visiting the city at that time.  Now, the historic church is a thriving 21st century community of people from across the globe that will mark its 375th anniversary this month.  Rev Derek Lawson, who has been based at the church since 2016, said: \u0026ldquoOn Sunday morning I look out on a congregation of around 30 nationalities. We\u0026rsquove changed dramatically.  \u0026ldquoOriginally we were primarily Scottish, but today we are about 30 per cent British, 30 per cent Dutch.  \u0026ldquoHistorically we\u0026rsquove had a lot of Americans and Canadians but now also people from Asia and Africa.  \u0026ldquoThe English Language is the common denominator \u0026ndash it may be their second, third or even fourth language.  A string of events will take place this week to mark the anniversary, culminating in a special service on Sunday which will include a sermon from the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, Rt Rev Susan Brown.  Mr Lawson, who spent many years as the minister of Redgorton and Stanley near Perth, said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore celebrating the past but also looking to the future.  In the early part of the 17th century, Rotterdam was gaining importance as a port and the number of Scottish merchants and workers was increasing, resulting in calls for the city magistrates to be allowed to found a Scottish congregation in the city.  The petition was granted and the magistrates secured the use of a warehouse in Wijnstraat, while the Presbytery of Edinburgh appointed the Rev Alexander Petrie, from Perthshire, as the kirk\u0026rsquos first minister.  As the church grew, it established a school and a poor house in the city and in 1694, its congregation was recorded as more than 1000.  A year later, in 1695, foundation stones were brought over from Scotland and the first church building was erected in the heart of the city.  This church remained in use until the Second World War, which proved to be a difficult time for the congregation due to the 1940 Rotterdam blitz.  \u0026ldquoThere was virtually no contact with Scotland during the Second World War, Mr Lawson explained.  \u0026ldquoAfter a bomb destroyed the building in 1940 there was a real risk that it would not continue.  However, through the efforts of the congregation, and with financial support from Rotterdam merchants, by 1952 the then Moderator Rt Rev Johnstone Jeffrey visited the church to dedicate a new building, which is still used today.  From there it has gone from strength to strength and now boasts a diverse and growing congregation, with continued links to the Church of Scotland, as well as the Dutch Reformed Church.  In 1996, it changed its name to the The Scots International Church Rotterdam in order to reflect the changes it has gone through.  Rev John Russell, who is the Presbytery Clerk of Dunkeld and Meigle in Perthshire, was minister of the Scots International Kirk from 1963 until 1972 and will also attend the anniversary service.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe loved our time here.  \u0026ldquoThe Manse was our first home - we arrived on a cold winter\u0026rsquos night to a warm welcome 13 days after marriage.  \u0026ldquoWhen I was appointed in 1963 I was given the task to reach out to the large English-speaking population drawn from Britain, the Commonwealth and the United States and many other nationalities living throughout South Holland.  \u0026ldquoIn my ministry this outreach was carried out and the congregation became truly multinational, a tradition that has continued throughout successive ministries.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore very pleased to be going back \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos very kind of the church to invite us.  \u0026ldquoOne of our sons who was born in the manse, is coming back too.  Right Rev Susan Brown said: \u0026ldquoHaving family links with the Netherlands, it is wonderful to be able to celebrate with the congregation of the Scots International Church Rotterdam on this special anniversary.  \u0026ldquoIt is a congregation which, over the years, has continually reviewed and renewed its role and vision and as such offers vibrant testimony to the faith that undergirds all it does.  \u0026ldquoMay they continue to be a blessing to all who walk in through their doors \u0026ndash people of all nationalities!  The anniversary service, which takes place at 10.30am on Sunday, will feature performances from music groups within the congregation, as well as a short pageant presented by the children of the church congregation.  Church members will then host an international lunch, featuring food from 30 different countries.  A short service of praise will then be held, led by Rev Lawson, involving the church\u0026rsquos youth group and young adult members.

The Alzheimer\u0027s Society said there are an estimated 850,000 people with the disease in the UK, with this number set to surpass a million by 2025.  Prof De Strooper told the : \"I think we will have a cure. In 10 years we will have a cure.

Constitutional Relations Secretary Michael Russell will today update MSPs on preparations for Brexit, as Holyrood steps up its work.  Besides his chamber speech, Mr Russell will also appear at the delegated powers committee to discuss the Brexit-related Trade Bill.  The SNP government has said it withhold legislative consent for the UK Bill unless Scotland is allowed to sign off future trade deals in devolved areas.  The dispute is developing into another constitutional stand-off, and may result in Westminster over-ruling Holyrood as it did with the EU Withdrawal Bill.

Mr Barnier\u0026rsquos unexpectedly upbeat tone came at a conference in Slovenia, where he said: \u0026ldquoIf we are realistic, we are able to reach an agreement on the first stage of this negotiation - which is the Brexit treaty - within six or eight weeks.  \"The treaty is clear: we have two years to reach an agreement before they leave... in March 2019.  \"That means, taking into account the time necessary for the ratification process - the House of Commons on one side, the European Parliament and Council on the other side - we must reach an agreement before the beginning of November it\u0026rsquos possible.  While the next European Council is due on October 18/19, it is now looking increasingly likely there will be a special Brexit summit in early November.  The chief negotiator also stressed how both sides were \u0026ldquonot far from agreement with some 80 to 85 per cent of issues already resolved.  Yet he did qualify his comments by noting how the thus far intractable issue of keeping a frictionless border on the island of Ireland still needed to be sorted out.  \u0026ldquoWe have to solve this issue of Ireland and some others in the next six to eight weeks, added Mr Barnier.  In response to his comments, Theresa May\u0026rsquos spokesman noted how there had been \u0026ldquopositive engagement with EU leaders over the Chequers Plan and that talks were at a \u0026ldquovery important and intense stage  \"We have said ourselves that we are focused on securing a deal in October and that continues to be what we are working towards.\"  Last week, Chancellor Philip Hammond made clear, before a meeting with fellow European ministers in Vienna, the UK Government was putting pressure on EU leaders to allow Mr Barnier more flexibility in the negotiations.  It is suggested the informal summit in Salzburg on September 20, which Mrs May is due to attend, will discuss issuing additional guidance to Mr Barnier about relaxing his negotiating brief. One EU official described it as Operation \u0026ldquoSave Theresa.

Mr Baker has claimed there are as many as 80 Tories opposed to the Chequers Plan. The Conservative conference faces the prospect of being used to showcase Boris Johnson\u0026rsquos leadership challenge he is due to address a \u0026ldquoChuck Chequers rally, expected to be attended by 1,000 people.

Go further along, and you can see children, wide eyed with wonder, scramble about the RSPB reserve nearby, climbing the local hills.  But their hopes for a quiet retirement have been left shattered on learning that they also now live next door to a site earmarked for industrial development. They fear their quiet rural home straddling Fife and Perthshire is about to be ruined by lorries passing 500 times a day.  Their home backs onto a site where developers are controversially planning to build a waste incinerator.  The moved into the cottage just before developers logged the controversial plans.  Now Kenneth is worried about the effect of noise and pollution on the area, as well as the wider environmental impact on the neighbouring nature reserve.  Kenneth said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore worried about the noise and disruption, pollution and the health impact, both on people and animals.  \u0026ldquoWe are constantly trying to rid out towns and cities of vehicles, but what\u0027s the point if they are just driven out into the countryside. It seems hypocritical.\"  The masterplan to transform the 423-hectare Westfield opencast mine, which has lain dormant since 1998, originally centered on a huge solar farm with scattered light industrial units.  However site owner Hargreaves Services have been accused of going back on its word to build a green energy park after it emerged plans had changed to include the waste-burning facility and also a gas-fuelled power plant.  Main access for the proposed plant would be along the B9097, which runs past the RSP Loch Leven site and directly alongside the accompanying heritage trail.  Kenneth says he and his neighbours, which include an elderly woman who has lived in the area for 16 years, have been kept in the dark about the precise impact of the development \u0026ndash which they believe could see a lorry pass their homes every two or three minutes.  Green activist and former BBC Scotland environmental correspondent Louise Batchelor, who lives in Scotlandwell, near the proposed site, believes the incinerator is unnecessary.  She said: \u0026ldquoWhat was presented in the original application as a green energy proposal with lots of jobs is turning out to be a conventional incinerator with all its polluting implications.\"  Louise added: \"There\u0026rsquos evidence to suggest that where incinerators have been built, recycling decreases.  \"There is huge anxiety on the Perth \u0026amp Kinross side of the border about the amount of extra traffic, including 500 HGVs a day, which will be using the B9097, the sole access to the site.\"  The RSPB also fear the impact of the increased HGV traffic on visitors to the heritage trail.  A spokesperson for the wildlife charity said: \u0026ldquoAlong with other neighbouring businesses and families, we continue to have significant concerns regarding the safety risks to visitors to RSPB Scotland Loch Leven and the Loch Leven Heritage Trail arising from the predicted enormous increase in HGV movements on the B9097 that will be generated by the proposed development at Westfield.  Fife Council approved a provisional outline of the plant in autumn last year.  If the detailed planning application is greenlit, construction could begin as early as January 2019.  Now the Scottish Greens are also spearheading a campaign to halt plans for the incinerator.  Local MSP Mark Ruskell accused developers of \"greenwashing\" plans for the site.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe former mining communities around Westfield vividly remember the dirty days of coal, and have been living with the environmental and health consequences ever since.  \"They deserve a regeneration plan that puts green energy and sustainable development at its heart \u0026ndash not burning the nation\u0026rsquos rubbish on their doorstep.  However Hargreaves insist the site needs a backup energy source if it is to attract other businesses to the site.  Iain Cockburn, CFO of Brockwell Energy, the subsidiary of Hargreaves specialising in the development of the site, said: \"Our October 2016 planning submission included a comprehensive Environmental Impact Assessment in terms of traffic, landscape, ecological impact [and] all other potential impacts that might arise from development and restoration activities \u0026hellip  \"Brockwell and Hargreaves strongly believe that Westfield must have a green renewable energy focus but needs a balanced range of energy generation types if other businesses are going to be attracted to it and the green on-site energy generation used by businesses on the site.

Things were a bit of a struggle.”Nick was determined the dialysis would not take over his life and kept working throughout.He said: “I was team leader at that time for an oil company – in charge of the onshore group.“I was determined to keep on working and have as normal a life as possible but it meant doing dialysis every night after work.“I’d leave home at 7am and not get back until 10pm or 10.30pm every day                                                                                                         “Dialysis was hard. I felt like my life had been put on hold but I knew the treatment was the only thing keeping me alive. “Some days were better than others the staff at the hospital got me through some difficult times.”Despite that, Nick decided to propose to Philippa and booked the wedding at the Winter Gardens in the hope she would say yes.“I left flowers by the kettle one night – happily she said yes,” said Nick.“We’d been together for ten years and she saw me through everything.“She had to put up with an awful lot – the mood swings, not going out because I was too tired all the time – but she still said yes.”The couple got married last August and were on honeymoon when Nick got the call that would transform their lives.He said: “I was really lucky – I was only on the transplant list for two and a half years.“But I didn’t get my hopes up too much until I was taken down to theatre and knew it was going to happen.“I was building myself up for disappointment until that point. It was a really surreal experience.”Happily, the transplant went ahead and Nick woke up to a whole new life.“As soon as I woke up from surgery I instantly felt better,” he said. “Nothing could have prepared me for the difference it made.  “I’d just got married and then I got the gift that I’d waited over two years for.  “To have a life free from dialysis was the best feeling and I felt amazing. I didn’t realise how ill I’d been until I had the transplant and started to feel 100 times better. It was fantastic.”Nick, an electrician by trade, has made the most of his donor’s incredible gift – enjoying life to the full and setting up his own business.He said: “It was something I always wanted to do but would never have been able to achieve on dialysis.“I now have my own electrical business and am working all over Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire.“It’s made a massive difference to Philippa and me too – we can go out and enjoy ourselves now. It’s nice to have that freedom it’s a new life basically.”As for his donor’s family, Nick has written a letter thanking them for his gift.He said: “I know nothing about the person who made my transplant possible but I owe them everything. “They saved my life and are truly my hero. I want their family to know I will be eternally grateful for this incredible gift.”Nick is already on the organ donor register and hopes his story will encourage others to sign up.He added: “It’s quite possibly the most important thing anyone can ever do.”To join the NHS Organ Donor Register, visit weneedeverybody.org                "},{"url":null,"title":"scottish tradesmen it s your call to help children","story":"        Protecting children does not just fall to the police, social workers and professionals who work with them.

/                   \t      \t\tProtecting children...in the average primary class, at least two children have suffered abuse or neglect. The NSPCC\u0027s Childline is on call 24 hours a day to help children who need help.\u0027\u0027      \t         Matt Forde, the national head of NSPCC Scotland, said: “We’re not asking people to spy on families. “But when they see something, in their heart of hearts, they know isn’t right, we’re asking them to report it so that those families can get the help they need.                                                                                                        “The online course both informs and educates about the signs of abuse and neglect and what you should do if you have a gut feeling that something is not right.“We’re not trying to turn plumbers or builders into social workers.“But they do spend a lot of time in customers’ homes and it’s not an unlikely scenario that someone in that situation might gain an insight into a child’s life.“People are often unsure whether they should report it. We would ask them to look at it from the child’s point of view – or their own child’s.                                                                                                        “The police and children’s services are not in the business of getting involved, willy-nilly, when they don’t need to.“In the vast majority of cases, children are not removed from their homes but their families do get the help and support they need.“Often, parents have their own pressures and have lost sight of their child’s needs.“They’re overwhelmed with their own difficulties and have a strong instinct against asking for help.“It’s very often a burden that is lifted when they get a chance to talk about something they have been struggling with on their own for far too long.”                                                                                                        On the flip side of that coin are children who are in imminent danger.NSPCC Scotland asks the public to call its helpline – 0808 800 5000 – or the police immediately in the worst case scenarios.Last year in Scotland, the NSPCC’s helpline referred 2012 calls and emails to local agencies such as the police or children’s services.The majority were from people who were concerned a child was being neglected  followed by concerns about physical abuse , emotional abuse  and sexual abuse .Matt said: “There has been increased traffic to our helpline.“People are often unsure whether to report something – they really struggle with it.“By calling the helpline, they can talk through their concerns and decide whether it’s something that needs to be taken forward.“Our advice would be for people to consider if it was their child in that situation – better safe, than sorry.”As the NSPCC relies on donations from the public to deliver its services in Scotland, the It’s Your Call online course does cost £19 for individual tradesmen, with package deals also available for employers.But Matt is hopeful that it will become a success.He said: “It’s very early days for the It’s Your Call training but we are hoping individuals and employers will take it up.“We are not funded by the government – we raise all our own funding – so a fee is involved to cover the cost of delivering the training. “But we hope people will agree it’s a small price to pay to help children who are potentially being abused or neglected.“It’s about helping to give children a voice when they can’t speak out themselves.”NSPCC Scotland prides itself on providing a voice for children but is also keen that young people, of all ages, are able to make their own voices heard too.The charity holds special Speak Out, Stay Safe assemblies at primary schools in every local authority area in Scotland with that aim in mind.Matt added: “We help children understand what abuse is and what to do if they are affected.“We then go back two weeks later to find out what the children made of it and reinforce the message. “Children often come to Childline when they are aged 12 and above, talking about things that have happened to them for years.“So we wanted to deliver a programme for primary schools in the hope that children would start reporting issues earlier.“Teachers have been very positive about the programme as it’s a topic they often struggle with too.” The NSPCC is the leading children’s charity fighting to end child abuse and protect children at risk in the UK and Channel Islands. Voluntary donations make up around 90 per cent of its funding.Childline open 24 hours a dayThe NSPCC’s Childline service has two bases in Scotland, in Aberdeen and Glasgow.In 2017/18, Childline volunteers delivered almost 280,000 counselling sessions to children and young people across the UK on the phone and online. Based on the population of Aberdeenshire, it is estimated that volunteers delivered around 1800 counselling sessions to children living in that area last year alone.Some of them are going through the toughest times of their lives. They face issues such as mental/emotional health, family relationships and bullying. So it’s vital that they have somewhere to turn. Childline – 0800 11 11 and www.childline.org.uk – is there for them 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.On average, a child somewhere in the UK contacts Childline every 25 seconds.NSPCC Scotland’s Speak Out Stay Safe  service, which helps children learn how to recognise abuse, has now been delivered in the majority of our mainstream primary schools.Sadly, in the average primary school class, at least two children have suffered abuse or neglect.Just £4 pays for a child’s call or contact with Childline and £3 pays for the SOSS programme to reach a child. But the NSPCC relies on donations from the public to provide its services across the UK and volunteers to help deliver them.To find out how you can help the charity or to make a donation, visit the website https:www.nspcc.org.uk/what-you-can-do.

Other than preliminary works there has been no significant progress from the developer or landowner, so the council will begin work on site from Monday  to deliver the park and play area and seek to recoup the cost.         The lack of community facilities at Kingseat has been an ongoing concern for the local community and Councillors for a number of years.The enforcement notices were served in connection with two breaches of planning control, relating to the storage of spoil/materials and the lack of a play park. The focus is on a fenced-off central area of the site where there was previously a bowling green and open space area within the former hospital complex. This was intended to form part of the open space/facilities for residents within the completed development. Avant Homes had 12 weeks from October 20, 2017 to clear the spoil storage area and create a new open space area, including play equipment.                                                                                                         The notices were not appealed by the developer and the period for compliance expired on February 12.Since then the site has changed ownership to ZTR Investments and Aberdeenshire Council gave the new owners time to comply with the notices, while making alternative arrangements. Aberdeenshire Council\u0026rsquos Head of Planning, Robert Gray, said: \u0026ldquoAlthough some preliminary clearing work was undertaken by the new owners there has been no significant progress in forming the park or installing the play equipment. As such the Council has appointed contractors to complete the works. \u0026ldquoThe site owners, Kingseat Community Association, Newmachar Community Council and immediate neighbours to the development area have been formally notified of the start date.                                                                                                        \u0026ldquoThis is the first element of an attempt to facilitate completion of the wider development at Kingseat and deliver some much-needed community facilities for the residents.The work is expected to take up to 60 days to complete, depending on weather conditions.East Garioch councillor Martin Ford said: \"I will be delighted to see a play park in place at Kingseat.\"The Council\u0027s action is fully justified, though it has taken a long time to get to this point. Kingseat residents have been badly let down by the main developer of the site, and the Council has also been too slow to act.\"The play park included in the plans approved in 2004 is long overdue. It\u0027s more than twelve years since residents moved into the first new dwellings at Kingseat, so some children who moved to Kingseat early on have grown up without a play park close to their home.\"                                                                    "},{"url":null,"title":"shop support for crafters","story":"        Local crafts handmade by crafters and artists across the area will now be showcased at an Inverurie shop.

A language that official bodies such as the UNESCO insist has been dead since the 1800\u0026rsquos.\u0026ldquoIt wouldn\u0026rsquot be the first time UNESCO has prematurely pronounced a language as dead. Back in 2009 UNESCO declared Manx extinct despite there being over 1500 speakers of Manx.\u0026ldquoUNESCO was forced to change its classification of Manx from \u0026ldquoExtinct to \u0026lsquoEndangered\u0026rsquo after a group of school children wrote to them in Manx asking what language they were writing in if Manx didn\u0026rsquot exist.\u0026ldquoThe more people I talked to the more I came to find that Norn isn\u0026rsquot dead, it has just become lost in our English. When I gave people examples they shrugged them off as \u0026lsquoCaithness Words\u0026rsquo but it is so much more than that it is \u0026lsquoCaithness language\u0026rsquo if only we put our minds and our hearts to it.With her Norn Min series workbooks Grace Hall is spreading the Norn language both within Caithness and outside of the region as well.She added: \u0026ldquoThe Norn Min series has three workbooks published and another two in the pipeline. Copies of the series have sold as far away as America and Sweden.\u0026ldquoIt was just after the publication of Norn Min buk two that I received an email from the University of Bari in Italy as their Minority Languages department was interested in Norn.\u0026ldquoThey asked if they could use the Norn Min series to create an Italian-Norn phrasebook.

Even though I lived on the other side of town, every summer myself and a friend would go \u0026ndash even when it was raining, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was a great place as the town didn\u0026rsquot have an indoor swimming pool until 1994. Many people learned to swim at the Trinkie.While a slideshow showed images of how the pool used to look and how much Wickers got from it, other more contemporary images show a dilapidated ruin \u0026ndash a far cry from the hustle, bustle and smiles of yesteryear.The new group was formed with a mission to \u0026ldquobring the pool back to life and a number of office-bearers were proposed and elected.James Bremner was elected chairman with other roles going to William Macdonald , Catherine Patterson  and Garance Warburton .Seven committee members were also elected: Fiona Bremner, Trudi Mcalpine, Davina Lyall, Fiona McPhee, Leslie Grant, Roddy Mackay and Councillor Willie Mackay.Ms Patterson underlined that it was going to be no easy fix as \u0026ldquothere are holes in the wall at the deep end, which also has cracks that go right down to the ground.\u0026ldquoThe previous group... had the holes patched up, but they kept reappearing, she said. \u0026ldquoThe wall itself is also crumbling and the bridge that divides the deep and shallow ends has had its fixtures corroded. Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because if nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Tuesday 11 Sep 2018 2:51 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117364.jpg","title":"New service gives job hunters a Fair Start","story":"\u0026nbspScottish Government ViewpointFAIR Start Scotland is the country\u0027s new devolved employment support service.It is focused on supporting unemployed people who have challenges in accessing the labour market for whom work is a realistic prospect.Launched in April, earlier this year, it is an example of one of the first uses of newly devolved powers under the 2016 Scotland Act.The service will run until 2023 and aims to provide tailored, flexible and person-centred support to at least 38,000 people across Scotland who want help to find work, and stay in work.Fair Start Scotland is distinctive in that participation is purely voluntary.This means that people have everything to gain and nothing to lose \u0026ndash choosing to participate will not affect existing benefits or be driven by fear of benefit sanctions.The service is delivered locally, meaning that no participants are left without the support they need.Delivery is over nine geographic areas including the Highlands and reflects local area economies, meeting the needs of employers, disabled people and those at risk of long-term unemployment.Jamie Hepburn, Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills, said: \"What\u0027s crucial about Fair Start Scotland is that it treats people with fairness, dignity and respect and that it is focused on the needs of the individual.\"We are dedicated to delivering a high quality employment support service that will lead to real and sustained job outcomes and help people to achieve their full potential.\"As well as meeting the needs of unemployed people, Fair Start Scotland also seeks to help businesses find the skilled and committed employees they need to thrive.\"One of the many now benefitting is Highlander Alan Cairns .He has not worked for over a year and his biggest barriers to work have been low confidence and computer skills but now he has secured 16 hours of work per week.Alan started on the Fair Start Scotland service in the middle of May and has been attending the service for the past 12 weeks. He can now use Microsoft Outlook and completed his new CV on Microsoft Word and been applying online for jobs.Alan said: \"I\u0027ve attended workshops on confidence building, and digital skills.\"My confidence is improving a lot and so is my computer skills, I have been job searching online and sending emails, I couldn\u0027t do this before.\"* To find out more and check eligibility for the service visit www.mygov.scot/fairstartTuesday 11 Sep 2018 2:51 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117256.jpg","title":"Norse era in Caithness was our very own Game of Thrones","story":"He has taken some of the most dramatic events from a time when the county was the southern part of the Orkney earldom and condensed them into a rollicking, fast-moving narrative in The Katanes Saga .It is based on a series of articles published in the John O\u0026rsquoGroat Journal over a decade ago, reinterpreting source material from ious sagas, and follows on from The Raven Banner, published in the mid-1990s and now out of print. Like that earlier work, The Katanes Saga is told in an unpretentious, engaging, sometimes blokey style. From the drunken arguments to the devious plots to the mutilations and killings, Cassells tells it like it is.\u0026ldquoThe Raven Banner was basically a guide to Norse Caithness with a little bit about each area and what I thought were the main things that happened in Norse times, he explains. \u0026ldquoThe Katanes Saga is far more in-depth.\u0026ldquoThey were people like you and me. They had the same faults. You could meet three Vikings in the pub any night.\u0026ldquoOne word I would use to describe the Norse is pragmatic. They were really pragmatic people. If that\u0026rsquos the way it works, that\u0026rsquos the way it works \u0026ndash if it doesn\u0026rsquot, I\u0026rsquoll do it my way.\u0026ldquoI do mention that of all the Norse earls of Orkney only a handful actually died in their beds. Most suffered violent deaths. One was killed with contact poison from his own auntie and mother on a shirt.Cassells  is a retired Royal Mail manager who previously worked as a lighthouse keeper on Muckle Flugga and Stroma. Those experiences inspired two other books, No More Paraffin-Oilers and A Light Walk.The Katanes Saga sees him returning to a theme that first sparked his interest at an early age. Born in Barrow, he moved to Thurso in late 1950s when his father came to work at the Admiralty test establishment.\u0026ldquoI always liked Greek and Roman mythology and I started reading about Norse mythology as well, he recalls. \u0026ldquoAs a young boy I lived in Sweyn Road in Thurso and I wondered who Sweyn was. A pal of mine said, \u0026lsquoAch, that\u0026rsquoll be Sweyn the pirate.\u0026rsquo So for about a year I had this happy vision of a Pugwash-type character that the street was named after. I then discovered Sweyn Asleifarson.Swyen , iously described \u0026ldquothe last of the Vikings and \u0026ldquothe greatest troublemaker in the westernlands, had an estate at Duncansby and was renowned for raiding, plundering and pillaging. One of the many who suffered at his hands was Frakokk, who had featured in the poisoned-shirt incident: she was burned to death in her farmhouse at Helmsdale, along with other members of her faction, in a revenge attack led by Swyen.It\u0026rsquos an example of the way in which many of the strands are intertwined, as Cassells points out.\u0026ldquoI read the sagas and I started taking a look at place names, he says. \u0026ldquoFor a long time I lived at Scrabster \u0026ndash Skarabolstadr, the \u0026lsquohomestead of the sea-mews\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoAnd the stories were interesting to read. They were intriguing.\u0026ldquoYou try and unravel it and it\u0026rsquos just more or less two families feuding all the way through it. That goes right to the very last act of the local earl being knifed in a beer cellar in Thurso.One of the most shocking events is the burning to death of Bishop Adam by a mob in Halkirk in a dispute over a butter tax.\u0026ldquoHe got a bit greedy, Cassells says. \u0026ldquoThey complained to the earl at the time who more or less said, \u0026lsquoDamn the bishop, you can burn him as you please,\u0026rsquo so they took him at his word.\u0026ldquoBishops crop up a couple of times. There was lot of enmity between the local Norse earldom and the Scottish king over bishops. A bishop got his eyes put out in Scrabster.\u0026ldquoAfter the bishop was murdered at Halkirk, the Scottish king came up here and carried out what was, for want of a better description, pure genocide of the people from the Halkirk area. I believe they were all massacred round about where the Pennyland estate is now in Thurso. Hundreds of people were killed there.\u0026ldquoIn those days you just didn\u0026rsquot go burning bishops \u0026ndash they\u0026rsquore going to come down heavy on you.\u0026ldquoRavenshill Road used to be known as the Gallows Hill, before the atomic houses were built there, so that has been a place for judicial executions for quite a long time.From the machinations of the \u0026ldquofemme fatale Ragnhild at Murkle to the murder of Earl Rognvald at Forsie to the Battle of Clairdon Hill outside Thurso, the power struggles and manoeuvrings come thick and fast. It\u0026rsquos a rapid-fire history lesson, but more than anything Cassells simply wants people to enjoy the stories.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a thing I never learned in school here. It was never mentioned, he says. \u0026ldquoThis is our own local history, and I just hope people think it\u0026rsquos a good read.The Katanes Saga  is self-published and is on sale in Caithness Horizons, newsagents in Thurso, and Wick Heritage Museum.Tuesday 11 Sep 2018 2:51 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Open evening in Thurso for potential Childrens Panel members","story":"AN open evening is taking place next week with the aim of attracting volunteers for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel in Caithness.Tuesday\u0026rsquos event in Thurso will allow members of the public to find out how they can play a part in the children\u0026rsquos hearings system \u0026ndash helping others and giving something back to the community in the process.Volunteers from all walks of life make life-changing decisions that create a difference in the lives of many, and this is very true for children, young people and families in Caithness and across Scotland within the children\u0026rsquos hearing system.It relies on the voluntary involvement of around 2500 people who are willing and able to give their time and commitment to serve as Children\u0026rsquos Panel members.A number of agencies work together with the system to deliver protection, care and support to families, children and young people. These include social work, police, education, the Scottish Children\u0026rsquos Reporter Administration and Children\u0026rsquos Hearings Scotland.No new panel member begins sitting on hearings without a thorough training being delivered beforehand.

He was a third-year medical student who played rugby with the cycling trio and was also a talented musician. He had also been suffering from depression.The idea of cycling from John O\u0026rsquoGroats to Land\u0026rsquos End came to the trio after they had learned that Marcus had previously done the lengthy cycle, not once but twice.Fenn, a final-year maths student from Sheffield, said that Marcus\u0026rsquos sudden death was a huge shock to us all at the rugby club,and for everyone that knew him.\u0026ldquoHearing the news that he had been suffering from depression was a surprise to all his friends and family, he said.\u0026ldquoIn light of this, Marcus\u0026rsquos family have set up a fund in his name \u0026ndash Marcus in Mind \u0026ndash to raise awareness and prevent this sort of tragedy happening to more young men.Giles, a marine and offshore engineering student from Bridgnorth, Shropshire, added: \u0026ldquoThe three of us felt compelled to do something to help raise awareness of depression and mental health.\u0026ldquoAfter learning at his funeral that Marcus had completed this very cycle ride twice, we knew it would be an appropriate challenge.\u0026ldquoWe are using the social media hashtag #ItsOkNotToBeOk and we\u0026rsquore hoping to remove some of the stigma and get blokes like us opening up about mental health.Given Marcus\u0026rsquos and the trio\u0026rsquos links with rugby, clubs around the UK have been aware of the mental health awareness drive that they\u0026rsquore undertaking,Alex, a marine engineering student from Porthlevan, Cornwall, said: \u0026ldquoWe have been in touch with rugby clubs up and down the country. Our aim is to spread our message far and wide and hope others may cycle with us.\u0026ldquoWhen we discovered depression leading to suicide was the cause of Marcus\u0026rsquos death, we couldn\u0026rsquot believe it. We had always seen Marcus as he was at rugby \u0026ndash a strong, witty and kind gentleman.

This has made her challenge to find a way to climb the sea stack all the more unique and has presented a series of challenges in the planning stages.She will take on the climb in aid of the Calvert Trust, which supports people with disabilities through outdoor adventure.Asked why she had picked the Old Man of Hoy, Michelle laughed: \u0026#8220Because it\u0026#8217s the biggest sea stack going. I\u0026#8217d had the idea that I wanted to climb a sea stack before I was injured. It hadn\u0026#8217t really crossed my mind that I would ever be able to climb the old man of Hoy because it is notoriously difficult. I thought one day I would get it done but then I fell and I thought it\u0026#8217d never happen.\u0026#8220A friend came to me during rehab and said I needed to start setting myself goals and challenges but all my interests were based around climbing, which I didn\u0026#8217t think I could do anymore. It felt like that was totally ruled out – how can you climb without legs?\u0026#8220But they sent me some links to some really inspirational paraplegics, who were during climbing but in an adaptive way. Ordinarilly, climbing with two legs is like puzzle solving where you pick a route and decide what will work for you and that\u0026#8217s what I used to love.\u0026#8220When climbing in an adaptive way, you don\u0026#8217t get any of that puzzle solving and when people first spoke to me about climbing in that way I thought it wasn\u0026#8217t really the same so I wouldn\u0026#8217t want to do it. For me it was never about getting to the top of something, it was about the journey and figuring stuff out.\u0026#8220Climbing something in an adaptive way uses a pulley system and you haul your weight up. I thought there was no puzzle to that \u0026#8211 how wrong I was. I\u0026#8217ve not even attempted this climb yet and it\u0026#8217s been the biggest puzzle in the world. Creating the equipment has been the biggest challenge and finding people who have the ideas to make the equipment, it\u0026#8217s a never-ending puzzle.\u0026#8221\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Finalists will also receive feedback from some of the region\u0026rsquos top entrepreneurs and business advisers on how to take their idea forward.Run by Create, the UHI\u0026rsquos Centre for Enterprise and Innovation, the competition is now in its 13th year and is open to all students studying at the UHI as well as non-students living in the Highlands and Islands, Moray and Perthshire.Last year the competition attracted more than 115 entries. This year the entries will be narrowed down to 15 finalists who will discuss their ideas with the judges at the finals day on November 22.Last year\u0026rsquos top prize went to former Inverness College UHI student Paul Beaulieu , from Milton, Invergordon, who took home a cash prize of \u0026pound1500 and a combined legal and accountancy package worth \u0026pound2000 for an idea that could revolutionise how pipes are fabricated and fitted together.Dr Carol Langston, head of Create, said: \"Often people have a business idea, but they don\u0026rsquot know what to do with it, or who to turn to for help. That\u0026rsquos where Create comes in. We work with people to encourage them to be ambitious, bold and creative in their thinking, with the aim of encouraging innovation.\"Former winner Anna Renouf of Orrin Equestrian, is encouraging new entrants to take part in the competition.Since winning the most innovative business idea and the best engineering and technology award in 2015, she has gone on to win \u0026pound10,000 from Scottish Edge and received a Smart Scotland feasibility grant, which has allowed her to focus on the development of her innovative saddle design.Anna said: \"The University of the Highlands and Islands Business Competition represented the start of my business journey and it really gave me the confidence to take my idea forward and develop it further.\"Even now, I regularly seek advice and guidance from the Create team about the direction of my business. The support and encouragement I have received from the team has really helped me to progress my business.\"\u0026nbspTo enter, apply online at www.createhighland by October 31.Tuesday 11 Sep 2018 2:52 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

When the kirk on the shores of Lochbroom was put up for sale by the Church of Scotland back in 2016, it\u0026rsquos future looked uncertain.A determined local fundraising drive saw it eventually taken into community ownership by locals who see it as a key hub in the beautiful, remote area.Celia said: \"We saw how well Donnie Mackenzie\u0026rsquos fundraiser for Clachan did and the huge boost it gave everyone involved. Sara and I thought we would enjoy getting fitter, seeing more of our country, and help Clachan at the same time. Since our local Trust became owners on June 22 we straightaway saw the difference it has made to our community. It has become a community focus right from the start.\"With the doors open more often we know there\u0026rsquos someone there and stop for a chat. For those of us living on the no-through road on the west shore of Loch Broom, we pass Clachan every time we go anywhere so it is ideal.\"\"When Clachan opened during the Lochbroom Sheepdog Trials, the trust displayed some local produce, from handloom weaving, cards, honey, handmade books and paintings, to show the range of economic activity in Lochbroom. That is the tip of the iceberg. There\u0026rsquos only a small population but there\u0026rsquos a huge number of people producing high-quality goods \u0026ndash having their work displayed in a public building helps everybody.\"Sara and I are confident that Clachan will be an asset to the Lochbroom community for many years to come so we are asking for sponsorship. This can be done at the New Broom hub in Ullapool and by emailing me at celiajcharity@me. Thank you.\"Kenneth Macleod, an interim trustee of Clachan Lochbroom Heritage Trust, said: \"I have seen the benefit that grows from rescuing a building, improving it and making it available for wider purposes. Of course Clachan continues for the usual church occasions \u0026ndash we want everyone to know that! \u0026ndash whilst extending its usefulness for other appropriate purposes.\"Tuesday 11 Sep 2018 2:52 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

He been a stalwart for Dingwall, helping to raise thousands of pounds in his role as chairman of the Fire Brigade Community Group, of which he has been on the committee for 54 years.He is also vice-chairman of the Seaforth Highlanders Regimental Association .

Hughes, who has experience on the boards of other blue-chip firms including Vodafone and Morrisons, will also chair the car-maker’s nomination committee.            She will join the company’s board of directors upon its stock market flotation, which is expected to take place some time next month.            Hughes said: “I am looking forward to becoming chair of the board upon the proposed listing of Aston Martin Lagonda.“I am impressed by the turnaround that has been achieved by the team under the leadership of chief executive Andy Palmer and excited by the group’s future.“Private shareholders have displayed successful long-term stewardship to date and are fully committed, as am I, to transitioning the group, the board and its governance arrangements to those expected of a world-class public company operating from the UK.”Hughes’ appointment is among a raft of new directorships announced by the maker of the DB11 and Vanquish sports car models.New non-executive directors include former InterContinental Hotels Group chief executive Richard Solomons and former William Hill and Mothercare board member Imelda Walsh.            In a market update, the company confirmed earlier intentions for a stock market flotation in London.President and group chief executive Andy Palmer said: “We are delighted to have attracted high-calibre independent non-executive directors who will be led by Penny Hughes, the proposed new chair of the board.“The independent directors will bring significant experience to the board as we prepare to float and deliver fully on our business plan commitments.”Last month, the firm said it was exploring plans to float on the London Stock Exchange, ending months of speculation about the possibility of going public.            Aston Martin – founded in London in 1913 and headquartered in Gaydon – will float at least 25 per cent of its shares in the listing, and could join the FTSE 100 if the company’s valuation is adequate.Najeeb Al Humaidhi on behalf of the firm’s Kuwaiti shareholding said: “We have had the privilege to be part of the company’s history for the past 11 years.“We remain committed as we continue to support the growth of Aston Martin Lagonda in this next and exciting phase.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4793706.1536585501!/image/image.jpg","title":"lesley laird tories appear set on rigging the election system","story":"        Performance coaches in elite sport look for marginal gains, the tiny improvement which will give them the edge over rivals. But in the race for power, the Conservatives have abandoned all pretence about aiming higher. This is about holding on at all costs.                 For them it’s no longer about marginal gains, but instead about gaining marginals – whether by fair means or foul.            David Cameron first brought forward boundary change proposals resulting in the loss of 50 MPs at Westminster in 2011, an arbitrary figure plucked out of the air for headline purposes rather than to address the urgent demand of any new reality at the time.            But the world has not stopped turning in the years since then and it’s bitterly ironic that this proposal, which will see power ebb away from elected Members of Parliament, is being resurrected at precisely the time when Brexit will see powers flow back to the UK from Europe.READ MORE: Brian Monteith: Brexit won’t lead to Scottish independence and here’s whyAnd, while the number of MPs holding the executive to account is set to shrink, the House of Lords expands and the civil service continues to grow exponentially. Additionally, with no plans to reduce ministerial posts, there will be even fewer opportunities for MPs to properly scrutinise UK Government decisions amid the expected avalanche of new legislation which will be required.It doesn’t help that the Boundary Commission’s final report and recommendations will not be seen by Parliament until Government decides to publish them. David Mundell has had them since Wednesday.It’s not difficult to see why a strategy of cutting MPs would benefit the Tories. It would afford an instant solution in how to reduce the number of MPs who are making the Government’s life difficult. Meanwhile, rumours abound at Westminster that affected Tory MPs who roll over and accept the boundary changes will be promised safe seats elsewhere.            It could also provide an easier route to victory in more marginal seats if constituencies were gerrymandered to suit Tory voter profiles. And if that didn’t work? Well, you could simply stop potential opponents from voting altogether, under the false cover of claiming that you are making the system fairer and eliminating fraud.READ MORE: Brexit: Anger over ‘lack of clarity’ on job losses and securityRecent trials of voter ID schemes in five English boroughs have not produced a significant crackdown on fraud. To date, here’s been one conviction for ‘personation’ at a polling station, while eight others accepted cautions for misdemeanors including a false statement on a nomination form.The scheme does succeed, however, in alienating voters it’s a sledgehammer approach to cracking a nut which risks making turnout even more depressingly low than it was before.            According to YouGov analysis of the last election, for every 10 years older that a voter was, they were nine per cent more likely to vote Tory, with Labour in the lead among voters right up to the age of 47. But only a little over half of eligible voters aged 18 or 19 actually cast their vote, while among over 70s the turnout was 84 per cent. So, from a Tory perspective, it’s clear that one path to holding on to power is to obstruct the youth vote further.MP numbers – however small – are important. We have seen in the last year the damage that can be done by the 10 DUP members who raked in a £1 billion bung for Northern Ireland in exchange for their obedience.That takes the Government’s effective majority to 13 – by coincidence the same number of Tory MPs supposed to be representing Scottish constituencies and waving the flag for Ruth Davidson’s party. But without the guile of the DUP, the feeble 13 have failed to secure any similar concessions for Scotland while David Mundell maintains his ghostly presence in Dover House and remains our invisible man in the Cabinet without a seat at the Brexit table. But the Tories have a bigger goal in mind and their attempt to swing elections is straight out of the Republican/Donald Trump playbook.            The United States has an unenviable record of voter suppression. So, despite the fact that the US have also had a two-term black president, the old battles of the American Civil War and the civil rights movement are now fought in polling stations and even in the Supreme Court, which five years ago removed a section of the Voting Rights Act which required state-level election law changes to be approved by the federal government. Republicans have been quick to exploit that opportunity, with voter ID legislation which requires the electorate to jump through hoops simply to participate in the most basic process in a democracy, as well as life bans on voting for felons – which disproportionately affects minorities in what is still a deeply racist criminal justice system.I read that in Texas a would-be voter was turned away from a polling station because they only carried a student ID. A gun licence holder, however, would have been allowed to cast their vote. It’s an extreme example, but it demonstrates how easy it would be for new rules in this country to target sections of the population, and then to “inadvertently” disenfranchise them.Leave voters were urged “take back control”, but it’s clear the Tory establishment will do anything, including skew the rules, to avoid handing over the wheel.But this latest Tory power grab could cost us the Union.David Mundell recently warned Scotsman readers that not accepting Theresa May’s Chequers Deal could lead to Scottish Independence, a choice statement from a Scottish Secretary whose errors of judgement in handling Brexit and intergovernmental relations have already fueled the flames of Indyref2.Previous boundary proposals would have led to the loss of six of 59 seats in Scotland – a cut which was disproportionately higher, given the Scottish population.Labour recognises a boundary review is needed ahead of the next General Election but we stand ready to work with all parties in achieving that.But this Government is proving itself to be incapable of working with anyone – and more sinister still, appear deliberately focused on party at all costs, even if that means sacrificing the Union.

SNP Deputy Leader, Keith Brown, and Conservative Secretary for Scotland, David Mundell, have both claimed Brexit could lead to Scottish independence. They are both wrong.                Irrespective of what type of Brexit the UK ends up with, be it a WTO Full Brexit with lashings of Houses of Parliament Sauce, a Canada-plus Free Trade Agreement, or a Chequers-minus deal that delivers Brexit in name only – they are all toxic to the cause of Scottish nationalism.             Brexit is Green Kryptonite, to Keith Brown and Nicola Sturgeon they will be weakened by it, for whatever one thinks of Brexit there is no escaping it makes the case for independence less attractive. Worse still, and despite what Brown and Mundell say, the more calamitous it is the worse independence will look to ordinary voters. If there’s so much havoc leaving the EU what would they expect leaving the UK to be like?            Once we leave the EU on 29th March any benefits accrued to the UK are likely to be lost forever to an independent Scotland seeking to rejoin the EU, while any benefits that once considered worth the high price of EU membership will not necessarily be reintroduced.Brexit benefits should include not facing an annual bill of £10bn – which should deliver a Brexit Bonus for Holyrood of around one billion per annum. It should mean taking back control of our fisheries policy – which will be of greater importance to Scotland to the rest of the UK – as well as shaping agriculture policy to suit the needs of Scottish farmers within the UK’s single market. Further Brexit benefits should include the ability to change our laws about how we trade and apply taxes we should be able to open freeports in Grangemouth and Prestwick that will act as magnets to international duty free assembly – while we can decide to change what items are subject to VAT, what else we tax and at what rate, or what our tariffs for imports might be .Once the UK is outside the EU then the SNP faces the challenge of arguing why it will be easy and painless to extract Scotland from a union of 311 years compared to the calamity it expects from the UK leaving a union of only 45 years. Alex Salmond reckoned Scotland required only eighteen months to exit the UK, yet with no deal yet agreed and a transition period if there is one, it could take five years to leave the EU fully in 2021.Scottish exports to the rest of the UK are £46bn, which is more than its £13bn exports to the 27 other EU states and the £17bn to the rest of the world combined. The Fraser of Allander has put the number of Scottish jobs related to EU exports at 125,000 but for our trade with rUK it estimates 529,000. The threat to our prized financial services economy is existential, with most of their customers being English residents many, if not all, would have to move their HQs and associated operations to Leeds, Manchester or London. If Brexit is tough then independence is off the scale.            Then there is the question of how to get Scotland back into the EU. The first obstacle will be Spain and her allies within the EU. A secessionist Scotland can expect no favours from Spain whatever its political colour and there are other EU members that think the same way. The SNP’s fawning over Catalan separatists will prove to have been a major blunder, even in obtaining EAA status. There’s also the loss of Margaret Thatcher’s Fontainebleau discount on the membership fee that will not be transferable from the UK to an independent Scotland. Indeed Scotland, as part of the UK, is already a net contributor to the EU so it would have to find at least a billion a year  – a difference to the balance sheet of £2bn a year from being in the UK but outside the EU.  If independent, Scotland would already have to find savings or raise taxes to finance its annual public spending deficit of circa £13.5bn, but taking on EU membership costs would ensure extremely painful Scottish austerity is unavoidable.  Then there are the legal requirements of Scotland having its own currency rather that of a country outside the EU – and accepting eventual membership of the euro. Covering that £13.5bn deficit is not an option, for EU membership requires Scotland’s debt to GDP ratio be brought down from an unsustainable 7.9% to no more than 3% within ten years.How “hard” a Brexit the UK has matters too. If the UK settles for importing and exporting on WTO terms then all the problems that critics of this perfectly normal arrangement allege, such as a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland will be visited upon an independent Scotland, only worse. Brown and Mundell are both experienced enough to know their Brexit comments are nothing more than playing to their respective galleries. For Brown it is about rousing his troops to not lose hope that independence is near. For Mundell it is about circling the wagons around his Prime Minister’s besieged Chequers plan. He’s a remainer Cabinet minister who owes his comfy chair to a remainer Prime Minister.            The truth is the best friend of Scottish independence is not Brexit but Jeremy Corbyn. It is Corbyn who will trade a second independence referendum to achieve power and it is Chequers that will make the Tories unelectable and put him in power. So let’s ignore Mundell and chuck Chequers to save the union."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4797818.1536609559!/image/image.jpg","title":"no deal brexit top of the agenda in london as barnier raises hopes","story":"        Theresa May\u0026#8217s cabinet will hold three hours of talks on preparations for a no-deal Brexit later this week, it has emerged as critics accused the government of presenting the public with a \u0026#8220false choice\u0026#8221.                Ministers will gather for a special session of cabinet on Thursday morning, hours before the next round of talks on Brexit between the UK government and devolved administrations, which have been pushing for continued membership of the EU single market and customs union.            The meeting is expected to coincide with the publication of the latest tranche of technical papers on the no-deal preparations across a range of sectors.            Scotland’s Constitutional Affairs Secretary Michael Russell claimed Mrs May is trying to “force people to choose between the disaster of a hard Brexit outside the single market and the catastrophe of a no deal Brexit.”It came as the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator raised hopes that the UK could secure a deal by saying agreement was “realistic” within the next six to eight weeks.Michel Barnier struck a positive tone at a conference in Slovenia, welcoming parts of the Prime Minister’s Chequers plan to keep the UK in the single market for goods.“I want to reach an agreement on the first stage of the negotiation, which is the Brexit treaty, within six or eight weeks,” Mr Barnier added. “We must reach an agreement before the beginning of November. I think it is possible.” His comments sparked a rally in trading of sterling on currency markets.            Downing Street defended Mrs May’s Brexit blueprint after a warning that continuing with it could cause a “catastrophic split” in the Conservative Party.Former Brexit minister Steve Baker said he was “gravely concerned” about a potential schism in Tory ranks if the Prime Minister did not change direction.Mr Baker’s comments followed an article at the weekend by the former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, which compared the Prime Minister’s approach to putting a “suicide vest” on the \u2028country.Mrs May’s official spokesman responded yesterday, saying: “This isn’t language that the PM would choose to use. Beyond that I don’t propose to give that article any more oxygen.”            Speaking ahead of the meeting of the Joint Ministerial Committee on European Negotiations, Mr Russell said it was “an utterly false choice” to suggest that the Chequers plan and a no deal Brexit were the only two options.“We will continue to make the case, vigorously, for membership of the European Single Market – which is around eight times bigger than the UK market alone – and customs union.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4797298.1536564083!/image/image.jpg","title":"parties unite to deal fresh blow to p1 testing plans","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...

The new system of standardised assessments in P1 has already prompted calls for a boycott amid claims that some youngsters have been left in tears and teachers believe them to be a waste of time.Ministers insist that they provide valuable information about youngsters’ development and such assessments have always been held, albeit  not on a national basis.But Mr Gray insisted today that the tests are a “shambles.” He added: “The SNP’s refusal to listen to the mounting evidence against them is bordering on farcical.“Labour will continue to work to build cross-party and non-party opposition to these tests. That is why I have lodged a motion at Holyrood this week calling from the tests to be scrapped for primary 1s.” He added: “Ministers should listen to the sheer number of voices telling them these tests have to go.”            The EIS teaching union, which opposes the P1 tests, has written to opposition parties at Holyrood calling on them to opposing the ban, while the educational charity Upstart has organised a postcard campaign encouraging parents to boycott the tests. Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said he would support such a boycott at the party’s conference at the weekend.A review of the new Scottish National Standardised Assessments, which were introduced last year and also take place in P4, P7 and S3, has been carried out. Mr Swinney has already pledged changes to the P1 tests. But they will not be axed. A Scottish Government spokesman said: “Standardised assessments are delivered as part of everyday learning and provide consistent evidence for teachers to identify the next steps in a child’s learning, which is especially valuable in the early years if we are to continue to close the attainment gap.” Liberal Democrat education spokesperson Tavish Scott said: “Opposition parties are united in their belief that tests of 4 and 5 year-old-girls and boys in Primary One is utterly ineffectual. A vote to scrap these tests is now just a matter of time.            Tory education spokeswoman Liz Smith added: “John Swinney’s cack-handed approach to this row threatens to undermine the work that is needed to raise standards in primary schools.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4797314.1536524678!/image/image.jpg","title":"v a dundee boss especially proud of mackintosh oak room","story":"        The director of the new V\u0026ampA Dundee has said he is \u0026#8220especially proud\u0026#8221 of the conservation and restoration of  Charles Rennie Mackintosh\u0026#8217s original Oak Room.                The Kengo Kuma-designed building will open on Saturday, the striking centrepiece of the continuing £1 billion regeneration of Dundee’s waterfront.            More than a decade after the idea of opening a V\u0026ampA in Scotland’s fourth city was first discussed, director Philip Long spoke of the challenges – and the “thrill” – of setting up the design museum as it prepares to welcome the public.            The museum’s Scottish Design Galleries celebrate the influence of design at home and abroad, from Beano artwork to Hunter wellies and the Fair Isle jumper.The jewel in the crown is Mackintosh’s Oak Room – the painstakingly reconstructed interior of part of Miss Cranston’s Ingram Street Tea Rooms – which has been unseen for 50 years.Mr Long, who came to the V\u0026ampA Dundee from the National Galleries of Scotland, admits that laying his eyes on the exhibit for the first time was an emotional moment.He said: “It’s one of his great, but lost to view, interiors that is now complete and in the museum.“It brings back to public view after nearly 50 years – in fact it’s 70 years since it was used as a tea room – one of this great architect and designer’s works.            “I can tell you, it is a thrilling, quite emotional thing to walk in and see after all of these years.”The interior is on long-term loan following discussions with Glasgow Museums several years ago.Mr Long said: “The thing I’m especially proud of is the conservation and restoration of this original Mackintosh room.“Mackintosh is, after all, one of the world’s greatest architects and designers and happens to be part of Scotland’s design heritage.            “When we set about developing the Scottish Design Galleries, one of the things we needed to ensure was to represent Mackintosh as part of the work we were doing.”Museum bosses anticipate high volumes of visitors and entry over the opening weekend is reserved for those who have prebooked tickets.Access is otherwise free and non-ticketed, with the exception of big touring exhibitions. The first, Ocean Liners: Speed and Style, looks at the design and cultural impact of cruise ships and travel.Mr Long said: “There have been lots of challenges along the way and I’m very pleased and proud that we’ve seen our way through those.“The biggest challenge has been the magnitude of the project overall.            “V\u0026ampA Dundee is not an outstation of the V\u0026ampA in London. As one of the founding partners, V\u0026ampA is a core part, but we here in Dundee are a new team that has come together to develop this project and lead it long into the future.”The question has been asked why the V\u0026ampA chose Dundee to set up home, but Mr Long suggests it was the city that chose the V\u0026ampA. Representatives from the University of Dundee got the ball rolling in 2007, suggesting to the museum that it might like to be part of the waterfront regeneration.Mr Long said: “Dundee really gets the importance of cultural facilities and activities as part of the life of its citizens. That’s been clear over the last 20 years through the investment in new organisations like Dundee Contemporary Arts, or whether it’s the ongoing success of places like Dundee Rep Theatre or the Science Centre or the redevelopment of the McManus.“All of these things demonstrated to the leadership here that investment in culture is the right thing to do. All of that helped set the scene.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4797254.1536508690!/image/image.jpg","title":"lesley riddoch the swedes can resist the far right","story":"        Is Sweden lurching to the right?                Sunday’s elections will doubtless show a rise in support for the far-right Sweden Democrats . Several opinion polls had placed them second, behind the Social Democrat Party  - Sweden’s traditional party of government - and ahead of the centre-right Moderates.             The prospect of such a political shift has made headlines across the world. Of course, every country is grappling with the same problem - public hostility to immigration in the aftermath of wars in Libya, Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and beyond. But let’s be honest. There’s also a good deal of schadenfreude about Sweden’s predicament. This country of almost ten million people has created one of the world’s most equal societies since the Social Democrats first came to power in 1917. Whilst other countries like Britain have found it almost impossible to control or regulate capitalism, the Swedes have made big strides. As a result, their income gap is the world’s smallest their childcare and maternity/paternity care are excellent and their elderly care is widely regarded as the best in the world. On a trip to Sweden’s southern province of Skane, industrialist and Swedish Consul to Scotland Torvald Colliander took me to see the council-run old folk’s home where his mother lived and died. He proudly showed me his own name on the application list. “In Sweden,” he told me, “the only fear is that you wont get into the council home and might have to go private instead.” Public services are that good. Consequently, private provision is rare, everyone uses the same school, doctor and dentist regardless of social background and the wealthy keep on paying tax.            So far it’s worked. The Swedes have been the living embodiment of Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett’s best-selling book The Spirit Level, which demonstrates that everyone benefits from an equal society – including the rich. Additionally, the Swedes have the highest rates of innovation in the EU and union membership is three times higher than in Scotland. In short, the Swedes have been at the top of every international league table for decades – provoking admiration, envy and outright hostility in almost equal measure.In 1960, American president Eisenhower said Sweden’s welfare state had led the country into an orgy of sex, socialism and suicide.  In fact, Sweden was the only country on earth to rival the GDP of post war America, so it was politically inconvenient to discover that a tiny Nordic nation was evolving a more humane Third Way between the command economy and the unfettered free market.Some of Eisenhower’s mud stuck and over the years, politicians in less equal societies have grown weary of Sweden’s apparently effortless social and economic success. So there’s a smug wee smile now that Sweden’s suffering from  an ugly outbreak of the same racism, intolerance and hostility experienced by other countries with lower standards and more wobbly moral compasses. It seems that under pressure, the Swedes react no better than anyone else. You can almost hear the collective sigh of relief from politicians, TV viewers and even activists.But Sweden’s predicament is not quite so simple.            There is absolutely no parallel between the number of refugees and economic migrants accepted into Sweden and any other country – not in Germany and most definitely not in the UK.In 2015, one in six people living in Sweden was born outside the country. That’s a dramatic change from the almost totally homogenous, white society that prevailed in Sweden until the 1960s. Like the other Nordic nations, the Swedes had no empire, Commonwealth or experience of different ethnicities arriving gradually as economic migrants over a century as Britain did.  Instead, Swedish society changed fairly rapidly – the first influx of refugees came after the Yugoslavian conflict and then in 2014, the country accepted 80,000 mostly Syrian asylum seekers – proportionally more than any other country in Europe. That produced other problems, many of them peculiar to Sweden’s high skills economy. In 2015, 35,000 children arrived in Sweden as asylum seekers without parents. Families in war-torn countries heard Sweden was giving permanent residence permits to all Syrians seeking asylum and many managed to scrape the money together to send over one child apiece. That child was often a teenager, without a word of Swedish.In Britain, by contrast, migrants and asylum seekers arrive with a basic grasp of English and can find casual jobs without qualifications. Essentially, Britain’s world of low-pay, zero-hour contracts, means immigrants can get a start. New arrival in Sweden by contrast, often cannot, which leads to unemployment and housing segregation. Still, the ‘refugee crisis’ is not a part of everyday life. Society hasn’t collapsed and Swedes are still more welcoming to incomers than folk from other EU countries.             According to a Europe-wide survey published last year, 64 per cent of Swedes are positive to immigrants from outside the EU compared to 37 per cent across the EU itself. So the big question is not whether the Sweden Democrats will increase their vote  but whether that gives them any meaningful political clout.  Every other party has rejected the idea of forming a coalition, and whilst that may create awkward bedfellows amongst the other parties, there’s a strong incentive to make common cause. But whilst British voters are quite used to seeing large bodies of political opinion frozen out of power as a result of First Past the Post voting, the Swedes with their fully proportional voting system are not. Will exclusion fuel support for the Sweden Democrats or will mainstream parties cooperate, contain the threat and devise innovative ways to boost integration? Despite support from prominent eugenicists in the Nazi era, far-right ideology did not overtake Sweden in the 1940s. The Swedes can resist it again.

Construction began in 2016 and is expected to be completed on schedule in late summer.\nLocated at Seafield the new centre is just a short distance from the long-standing Eric Gray Centre. Once opened the centre will provide specialist assistance for adults with complex care needs and learning disabilities.\nThe building has been designed by Richard Gibson Architects and construction is being led by DITT. The drone footage was shot by Nick McCaffrey.\nThe centre does indeed look good and is on schedule well done DITT , the clients and staff are all looking forward to being in the building. It has taken many years to reach this point  and is much needed.\nI wonder what, if any, proof you have that clients and staff are looking forward to being in the building? If you do have some proof to justify your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in different buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed. I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call  744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame.

The insulation and boiler scrappage schemes that local partners have lobbied for, and secured, have also had a positive impact.\nFuel poverty is measured as a percentage of household income so increasing wages can also help.

Arising out of the local experience of sectarian discrimination, the march helped to set in train a series of events that would change Irish politics forever.\nNationalists in the Six Counties had begun to explore new ways of highlighting the reality of discrimination. They had looked to Governments in Dublin for decades but found little help there. The IRA’s Resistance Campaign had ended in 1962, having failed heroically against the overwhelming military superiority of the British Army and RUC. However, the imposition of internment without trial, the banning of Sinn Féin and the use of the B Specials as a rural terror force, all exposed the violence that lay beneath the surface of the Orange state. \n which read: ‘Protestant girl required for housework. Apply to the Hon. Mrs. Terence O’Neill...’\n\nFive years after O’Neill’s accession nothing had changed. Unemployment and emigration among Catholics was far higher than among their Protestant neighbours. In County Tyrone, with a population of just over 73,000 Catholics to 60,500 Protestants, there were only 52 Catholics employed in local government as against 300 Protestants. Such discrimination was highlighted by the Campaign for Social Justice established by Patricia and Conn McCluskey in Dungannon in 1964. \nParallel with these developments, the IRA and Sinn Féin were rethinking their strategy with more emphasis to be placed on open campaigning against injustice in the North. The Wolfe Tone Society was established as a forum for debate and to circumvent the Stormont ban on the Republican Clubs, the name which, in turn, had been adopted to evade the ban on Sinn Féin. Members of the Wolfe Tone Society, the Campaign for Social Justice and others were involved in the formation of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association  in February 1967.\nIt was direct action on the ground that propelled the nascent Civil Rights Movement onto the streets. The Brantry Republican Club in County Tyrone had campaigned for council housing to be built but when 15 houses were built in Caledon only one of them was allocated to a Catholic. The house next door was allocated to a single Protestant woman, the secretary of a unionist politician. \nLocal people decided to protest. The main organiser was Annie Mary  Gildernew, grandmother of Sinn Féin\u0027s Michelle Gildernew. Over a period of several months in 1967/68 a local family and supporters occupied a house in the Caledon estate. When they were evicted the case was raised in Stormont and began to make headlines beyond Tyrone. This was the spur for the march from Coalisland to Dungannon which received the endorsement of NICRA. \n\n\nIn a pattern that was to become all too familiar in the months ahead, Ian Paisley organised a counter-demonstration for Market Square in Dungannon. This was then used as a pretext by the RUC to ban the NICRA parade from the Square. \nAbout 2,500 took part in the NICRA march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon. The main speaker was Austin Currie MP, later a Fine Gael TD. Also speaking was Gerry Fitt, West Belfast MP. Fitt who, years later, was lifted into the House of Lords by Margaret Thatcher, declared that they would go on until they had “Civil Rights and a 32-County Republic”.\nBut the real leaders of the Civil Rights Movement which began that day were the rank and file, the ordinary people of Tyrone and beyond who marched for justice and freedom. \nThe first Civil Rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon was held on 24 August 1968, 50 years ago this week.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27461  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\n“The denial of rights, equality and respect is as wrong today as it was fifty years ago. - Mitchel McLaughlin\nHundreds of people took part in a commemoration in Tyrone yesterday to mark the 50th anniversary of the first civil rights march to be held in the north. \nThe march retraced the steps of the original march from Coalisland to Dungannon and was attended by Sinn Féin representatives from across the north. \nIt was led by Mid Ulster Sinn Féin MP Francie Molloy, who took part in the original march 50 years ago as a steward. \nMarchers carried replicas of the posters carried by the original march, reading \u0027One man, one vote,\u0027 \u0027Equal housing now\u0027 as well as banners referring to the Caledon housing protest which was the motivation for the march. \nContemporary posters on the threat posed to Brexit to rights were also carried by marchers. \n\nIn 1968 the original march was stopped before it reached the Square in Dungannon by the RUC because loyalist protestors staged a counter demonstration. \nThis time, however, the march reached its destination where speeches were made by Francie Molloy, local MLA Colm Gildernew and Fermanagh/South Tyrone MP Michelle Gildernew. \nThe main speaker of the march was veteran republican and civil rights activist Mictchel McLaughlin. \nIn his speech, the former Assembly Speaker said tat much has changed in the last five decades and that we are on the verge of a major shift towards Irish unity. \n\"The Orange state is now gone and we now have a peaceful and democratic way forward. \n“This is a very different place than it was in 1968 and I am convinced that we are now on the verge of another seismic shift towards a new, agreed and united Ireland that will provide a prosperous and shared future for all our citizens,\" he said. \n\nBut Mr McLaughlin also warned that our rights are still under threat today from Brexit and the right wing alliance between the Tories and the DUP. \n“My deep concern is that there are still people who want to deny rights and equality to their fellow citizens today. \n\"People in the north still face attacks on their electoral and civil rights, alongside the continued denial of rights to LGBTQ couples, women, Irish language speakers, and bereaved families seeking a coroner’s inquest.\n“Today, we are experiencing an unacceptable blockade on rights, imposed by the DUP and facilitated by the British government.\n“Rights are also under threat by a right-wing Tory Brexit and there are unwelcome echoes of gerrymandering and the hollowing out of democracy by the recent Boundary Commission proposals.\n“The denial of rights, equality and respect is as wrong today as it was fifty years ago,\" he added. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27462  ","story":"Sinn Féin Vice President Michelle O\u0026#039Neill.\n Michael McMonagle\n\n“We must specifically acknowledge the damage done by the Catholic Church to the lives of many women and children in the mother and baby homes, the Magdalene Laundries and a succession of abuse scandals and cover ups.- Michelle O\u0026#039Neill\nThe visit to Ireland by Pope Francis this weekend is an opportunity for the Catholic church to address the ongoing legacy of abuse, Sinn Féin Vice President Michelle O\u0027Neill has said. \nMichelle O\u0027Neill made the comments ahead of the historic visit to Ireland of Pope Francis this weekend to attend the World Meeting of Families which is being held in Dublin.

The march was blocked by the RUC at Thomas Street from entering Dungannon’s Market Square, subsequently leading to the second Civil Rights march in Derry’s Duke Street on 5th October 1968.\n\"The first civil rights march was a major cornerstone in Irish history, the people of the north stood up and said no more will we be treated as second class citizens, shaping politics on the island of Ireland for decades,\" he said.\nOver 2,500 took part in the first civil rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon.\nThis would evidently change politics here forever - this was very much a campaign organised by people, from all backgrounds and none. \nProminent republicans were also central to the organisation of demonstrations, including the now Mid Ulster MP, Francie Molloy and the late Stan Corrigan.\nReflecting on the first civil rights march, 50 years on, Colm Gildernew said the first civil rights march should act as a rallying cry to those of us who seek to promote rights, equality and respect for all in society today.\n\"We are currently experiencing an unacceptable blockade on a swathe of rights-based issues by the DUP, including Irish language, marriage equality, women’s health, and legacy rights.  \n\"There are huge concerns arising from Brexit and the recent Boundary Commission proposals, seen by many as a new attempt to gerrymander the north.

They were on active service and at Drumnakilly, close to their homes, they were ambushed and shot dead by a unit of the British Army’s SAS regiment. The Volunteers were brothers Gerard and Martin Harte and Brian Mullin.\nThe SAS killings brought to an end a month which had been one of the most intense and tragic of the war in Ireland. It began on 1 August with the IRA bombing of Inglis Barracks in London, close to Margaret Thatcher’s Finchley constituency. It was the first IRA attack in England since the bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton during the Tory Party conference four years earlier. A British solider was killed in the Inglis Barracks blast. In the following days, the IRA killed three British soldiers and an RUC detective in the North. \n\nOn 8 August, two young nationalist men were murdered by a loyalist death squad in Belfast. There were two more such sectarian killings of young nationalist men in Belfast, on 17 and 18 August. On 20 August, eight British soldiers were killed at Ballygawley, County Tyrone, when the IRA bombed a bus carrying members of the Light Infantry Regiment returning from England. On 31 August, two civilians were killed in Derry after they triggered an IRA booby-trap bomb intended for British forces. \nPolitically this period was dominated by the issue of extradition and, on 27 August, Robert Russell, one of the IRA prisoners who broke out of the H-Blocks in the mass escape of 1983, was handed across the border to the RUC. This was despite widespread protests, including public dissent from within Fianna Fáil.\nIt was on the Long Bog Road at Drumnakilly, four miles outside Omagh, that the three IRA Volunteers met their deaths.\nAt 4pm on 30 August, they were ambushed by British forces who poured a hail of bullets into their car. The RUC and British Army immediately sealed off the area and the bodies of the three men were left at the scene, within the cordon and inaccessible to grieving relatives, until the following afternoon. \n\nGerard Harte  was the eldest of the three Volunteers and was an experienced IRA activist. With his brother, Martin, he was a prominent member of the Loughmacrory St Theresa’s GAA Club, where he organised youth teams. \nMartin Harte was just 21 but had been in the IRA for four years at the time of his death. A talented football player, he had captained the Loughmacrory team. He was the father of a three-month-old son and, to compound the tragedy, his widow was Briege Mullin, sister of his friend and comrade Brian Mullin. \nVolunteer Brian Mullin  had been singled out for particular harassment by British forces. He was arrested and interrogated in Gough Barrack on numerous occasions and a few weeks before his death he and his brothers were beaten by crown forces outside their family home.\n\n\nHundreds of British soldiers and RUC members saturated the Tyrone countryside as the three Volunteers were laid to rest. Speaking at the graveside of the Harte brothers, Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams said the Volunteers were “good, decent, patriotic freedom fighters driven to fight for justice”. \nVolunteers Brian Mullin, Gerard Harte and Martin Harte were killed on 30 August 1988, 30 years ago this week.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27466  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\n“The policy of this government is failing the homeless, failing those renting and those who strive to own a home.

The excellent work done by Barrister Mark Bassett covers EU and Irish law and is unambiguous - with political will, this can be done,\" she said. \nMartina Anderson said that senior figures in the EU, as well as leading representatives from both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have already indicated support for the proposal. \n\"The European Parliament emphatically endorsed a resolution calling for democratic and social rights to be upheld in the north post-Brexit. The Parliament’s Coordinator on Brexit, Guy Verhofstadt supports continued representation for the north, as does the Fianna Fáil leader and Fine Gael MEP Seán Kelly believes it is worth considering,\" she explained. \nSinn Féin recently made a submission to the Constitutional Commission set up to examine the boundaries of European Parliament constituencies which called for the creation of a new constituency in the north and Martina Anderson explained this legal opinion reinforces that submission. \n The Sinn Féin MEP made a direct appeal to An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to uphold the rights of Irish citizens in the north. \n“An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar stated that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish government. This is the first real test of those words. There are a number of regions and territories across Europe that offer flexible and imaginative solutions to ensure citizens maintain their voting rights, it’s time Ireland did likewise. So now it\u0027s over to An Taoiseach. \n“2018 marks the 50th Anniversary of the Civil Rights Movement in the north.

This is the most common form of food poisoning in the UK. \n  \nWe have heavily invested in research throughout the production chain and we have already implemented new ideas such as hot water heating, double barrier changing facilities in each house and other technologies which we firmly believe have had a major impact in reducing the number of our birds which can become infected with Campylobacter. \n  \nFurthermore, we are focusing on excellence in biosecurity and innovative processing technologies.\n  \n\n  \nOngoing challenges\n  \n\n  \nControlling infectious disease in poultry is an ongoing challenge Moy Park face, in particular avian influenza . To address this, they have upgraded their AI contingency planning, rewriting the rulebook in the past year to ensure they have a robust plan in place.\n  \nWe have to think carefully how we would react and prevent spread if AI came in to Northern Ireland and together with agencies and Government departments we exchange views regularly with working groups, in order to remain on top of this key issue, Peter said.\n  \n\n  \nCareer Highlight\n  \n\n  \nOver his 40 years with the company Peter said a key highlight has been promoting ownership and pride with the people he works closely with.\n  \nA back to basics approach is one of my fundamental pillars, and I still firmly believe that bird husbandry and welfare are key to producing a high-quality product.\n  \nThere are endless opportunities for those considering a career in agriculture and food production, and as my wife and son also work in the poultry industry, I can definitely vouch for that!\n  \nAs the world population continues to expand, the demand for goods also increases and food production, and those working in the industry, will have to keep up with this development.\n  \nBy strengthening our production capabilities over the past number of years, we are well placed to meet this demand, with poultry a healthy and versatile source of protein which is also good value for money.\n  \n\n  \nPositive outlook\n  \n\n  \nPeter concluded: As I look back on my time in the industry and at Moy Park, I’ve always started each morning the same way, and I think it has stood me in good stead!\n  \nThe first thing I think of is ‘today will bring a new challenge, a new opportunity and I will most likely learn something new’ as every day is a school day!”\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_995387.jpg--.jpg?1535635242000\n","title":"superb gcse results for dunclug college","story":"  \nDUNCLUG College is celebrating historic levels of achievement at GCSE level. \n  \nAll students, including those with ious learning challenges sat a minimum of 7 GCSE subjects, including the compulsory core of English, Maths and Science and a range of GCSE optional choices in a balance of General and Applied courses.\n  \n Many gifted and competitive students sat 8, 9 or 10 subjects. The overall result for GCSE English for the whole cohort was 80% in the A – C range, with the overall Mathematics result being almost 60%: in each case this represented the best outcomes in the school’s history. \n  \nOverall, almost 80% of students achieved 5 or more subjects in the A – C range with almost 60% achieving this standard inclusive of English and Maths. This significantly exceeds the National and Northern Ireland averages and places our school and is testimony to the success which can be attained at a non-selective school. \n  \n Many factors contribute to such success, not least the support of parents, the commitment of students and the motivational teaching which is inspirational yet grounded, and which proves that high expectations enable students to push boundaries and indeed predictions. \n  \nSubjects which achieved the outstanding success rate of 100% of pupils gaining Grade C or better were as follows: Art, Construction, Media Studies, Double Award Science, Occupational Studies, Further Maths, Prince’s Trust, Agriculture \u0026amp Community Sport. Other high achieving subjects included: Applied Business 70%, English 80%, English Literature 92%, Engineering 70%, French 75%, Geography 79%, ICT 70%, Single Award Science 78%, Technology \u0026amp Design 91%, Drama 91%, Music 82%, BTEC Sport 91%\n  \nThe Principal noted that amongst the numerous excellent combinations of grades were children with special educational needs, and many personal best achievements. It was also very encouraging to note that 96% of all students in the year group achieved at least 5 grades in the A – E range.\n  \nCongratulations to top achievers: Kirsten McLeister - 5 A* and 3A, Craig Francey - 4A*, 4A, 1B and 1C and Charlotte McKay 1A*, 4A, 2B and 1C.\n  \nOther students with a profile of A - C grades in eight or more subjects included: Stuart Adams, Tori Agnew, Chloe Bleakley, Alan Clarke, Daniel Compton, Megan Davison, Laura Du Bois Pidgeon, Amy Ewart, Joy Forsythe, Rachel Greer, Abigail Harris, Timothy Hill, Korben Houston, Lynn Hughes, Deanna Johnston, Jamie Knox, Danielle Mahaffy, Tamzin McClenaghan, Adam McConnell, Grace McCullough, Emma McDowell, Thomas McFall, Megan McKay, Luke Neeson, Robbie O’Neill, Aimee Penney, David Saunderson, Chad Shaw, Joshua Shaw, Robyn Telford, Charlotte Waide, James Warwick, Leah Young. This, in addition to the list of students, too numerous to list, who achieved 7 top grades.\n  \nInterviews are currently underway at the College for Sixth Form places and/or advice for students on the next steps in their learning. Applications are also welcome from students from other schools. Admissions Criteria and the details of subjects on offer are available at the School Office.\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":null,"title":"65300  ","story":"                \nBALLYMONEY Foodbank has seen an almost 20% increase in usage since the introduction of Universal Credit in November 2017.\nThis is the disturbing news revealed by a Director of the local Foodbank after they recently compiled figures covering this past year. \nCo-Director of Ballymoney Foodbank Mr Peter Rawlins said: We looked at the number of vouchers dealt with, the number of people helped and the weight of food distributed in the six months leading up to November 2017 and in the five months after November 2017  and we found there was an 18% increase in first five months of this year. \nMr Rawlins continued: This is a significant increase on the previous six months and on the corresponding months the previous year. Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying:

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

year of our lives but what a difference the past 12 months have made no words can ever express how we all felt this time last year.\n\u0026#8220To have two children going through such life-changing procedures in the same hospital, on the same day, is something we could never have imagined. Caden is improving every day and Ben has never looked back. We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus      return false     else if        your_email.focus      return false     else if        friends_name.focus      return false     else if        friends_email.focus      return false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random return false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n       .ready .click .hide          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.fadeIn          return false                .click .parents.fadeOut          return false                    */       ]]\n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n                           username.focus            return false           else if              password.focus            return false           else                      ]]\n      \n      \"\n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n               return false\" title=\"View The Leader online!\"\n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n banner\" title=\"Advertise with Us\" /\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n          ?

We have come close in the past, making it to the quarter-finals and the semi-finals, so to go one better this season is a great feeling.\n\u0026#8220There is a real buzz and a belief in the team that we can go and win the Irish Cup in our first final.\n\u0026#8220We have gone up against teams from all over the Province this season to get to the final.\n\u0026#8220We didn\u0027t know too much about any of them, they were all an unknown quantity, but we played to our strengths and we have been rewarded.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus      return false     else if        your_email.focus      return false     else if        friends_name.focus      return false     else if        friends_email.focus      return false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random return false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n       .ready .click .hide          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.fadeIn          return false                .click .parents.fadeOut          return false                    */       ]]\n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n                           username.focus            return false           else if              password.focus            return false           else                      ]]\n      \n      \"\n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n               return false\" title=\"View The Leader online!\"\n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n banner\" title=\"Advertise with Us\" /\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n          ?

The Ballymoney man lost his father, Mervyn Robinson, to the\u0026#160 North West 200 in 1980, while in July his cousin, William Dunlop, was killed during free practice at the Skerries 100 near Dublin.\nAll of these setbacks forced a re-think, says Robinson. My main reason for quitting the sport was my wee boy, Max, he told Chronicle Sport.\n\u0026#8220Road racing is getting very dangerous and there have been too many accidents recently, so I\u0027m not prepared to take the chance any more.\n\u0026#8220My main fear is getting caught up in something outside of my control like, like an accident happening in front of me, or a bike seizing or something.\n\u0026#8220William\u0027s death affected me big time, to be honest I felt like packing it in immediately.\n\u0026#8220The\u0026#160 circumstances surrounding William\u0027s death were just awful. The fact he left behind a\u0026#160 young daughter and Janine [his partner] had a second baby on the way made it so horrible for us all to deal with.\n\u0026#8220I thought about it and I decided I wanted to do myself some justice and finish off the season before calling it a day.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus      return false     else if        your_email.focus      return false     else if        friends_name.focus      return false     else if        friends_email.focus      return false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random return false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field -

outside belfast to pay 17 more for gas","story":"\nTowns outside Belfast will be paying 17% more for gas prices following Firmus Energy\u0026#8217s tariff hike next month.\n\n                \nTen Town areas include Craigavon, Antrim, Armagh, Ballymena, Ballymoney, Banbridge, Coleraine, Limavady, Derry/Londonderry and Newry.\n\n\n\nThis is a further blow for consumers\n\nThe Consumer Council\n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nFirmus Energy is to increase gas prices by 12% in the Ten Towns area from 1 October 2018. The Consumer Council has branded the increase ‘unwelcome’ and called for more gas licence holders to enter the market so create more competition.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe council is urging the 38,000 natural gas domestic and business customers to consider ways to save on household energy bills.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nAn annual bill for a typical Firmus Energy customer in the Ten Towns areas using 12,000 kWh on a Pay As You Go meter will increase from £594 to £666, an increase of £72. Whereas the annual bill for a typical Firmus Energy customer in the Greater Belfast area using 12,000 kWh on a Pay As You Go meter will increase from £539 to £604, an increase of £65.\n\nGas prices in Ten Towns will be around 17% more expensive than Belfast, based on SSE Airtricity’s Pay As You Go tariff.\n\n“This is a further blow for consumers following recent electricity tariff increases by the three largest electricity suppliers in Northern Ireland,” said a NI Consumer Council spokesperson.\n\nRichard Williams, Head of Energy Policy at The Consumer Council, said: “This is unwelcome news for Firmus Energy customers, following a 6.8% increase in the Ten Towns area earlier this year. However, we are aware the main driver is the significant rise in global gas costs since the tariff was last set in April. From 1 October, the annual bill for a typical Firmus Energy customer in Ten Towns will increase by £72 a year to £666. It is the sole supplier of gas in the Ten Towns. We would like to see other gas licence holders enter the market so that consumers there can benefit from competition.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8628181.1536329418!/image/image.jpg","title":"candlelight vigil in memory of cameron truesdale","story":"\nA candlelight vigil is to be held in Waringstown tomorrow night  in memory of Cameron Truesdale.\n\n                \nThe teenager  died on Wednesday night after a 20-month battle with cancer.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe vigil will begin at 8pm in Waringstown Park, in the village near Lurgan.

This borough has given so much to me over the years and I am thankful to everybody who has helped me throughout my rugby career so far.\n\n “I would like to thank the council for considering me for this honour and for arranging today’s very special event. I have had the privilege to take part in some memorable sporting occasions and today’s will live long in the memory with the best of them.”\n\n Earlier in the day Rory attended a special Festival of Rugby held at City of Armagh Rugby Club made up of teams from clubs across the borough including Banbridge RFC, Dromore RFC, Lurgan RFC, Portadown RFC and City of Armagh RFC, as well as rugby neighbours Dungannon RFC and Monaghan RFC.  Portadown Panthers opened the festival with an exhibition game of tag rugby, of which Rory is the club patron.\n\n Lord Mayor Julie Flaherty said: “Today has been a real celebration of Rory Best’s sporting achievements and the contribution he makes to our borough. He thoroughly deserves the Freedom of the Borough honour and we could ask for no better example for our young people to follow, both on and off the pitch.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n “The fantastic turnout from the world of provincial and international rugby is testament to the regard with which Rory is held in the professional game, as are the tributes from some of the stalwarts of the game.”\n\n Dr Rory Best OBE received the Freedom of the Borough of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon in recognition of his outstanding sporting achievements of a local man who was raised and educated in Poyntzpass and went to Tandragee Junior High and Portadown College.

We don’t know what to expect from the future. Our  youngest is only 20 months old and our son is going to be four in November.\n\n “We want a chance to prove ourselves and return to our normal life as we are very frustrated with the way things are and for our young family. It is a extremely stressful time for us and we would ask the Home Office for further reconsideration.”\n\nSouth Belfast MLA Máirtín Ó Muilleoir, who has been supporting the family, said he would be asking the Home Office to look again at their case and allow the young family to remain in the city where they have been embraced by the local community.\n\nA spokesperson for the Home Office said: “Each asylum application is carefully considered on its merits against background country information to ensure that only genuine claims are granted.\n\n“Where a decision has been made that a person does not require international protection, and there are no remaining rights of appeal or obstacles to their return, we expect individuals to return voluntarily to their home country.\n\n“The Home Office\u0026#8217s full range of country policy and information notes  is available at https:www.gov.uk/government/collections/country-information-and-guidance.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"movie about british olympic figure skating gold medallists filmed in west belfast school","story":"\n\nTHE\n corridors and classrooms of St Mary’s Christian Brothers’ Grammar School have been transformed from present day to recapture the excitement and adrenalin of 1984 Sarajevo during the winter Olympics for an upcoming Torvill and Dean movie.\nThe film will chart the early years of the British figure skating duo Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean and their journey to achieving Winter Olympic gold with their iconic Bolero.\nThe film, commissioned by ITV and supported by NI Screen has been filming in the Glen Road school while students were off on summer holidays as well as using the Shankill Leisure Centre as the filming schedule continues.\nSchool Principal John Martin said he was very impressed with the attention to detail the film crew put in to recreating the particular period of history.\n“The crew work so quickly to recreate the time and place,” he said. “We have had some of the corridors repainted, signage put up and some of our music rooms have been transformed to look like the Olympic Village were the skaters stayed – complete with itineraries on the walls and training timetables.\n“We are delighted that St Mary’s was chosen for the film project and look forward to seeing the school on the big screen.”\nFilming is continuing on the film with a release date expected in the autumn.\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"well not be derailed by latest mod stunt","story":"\n\nTHE\n Ballymurphy Massacre families have said that the latest ‘stunt’ by the British Ministry of Defence will not derail their much anticipated inquest into the murder of there loved ones.\n\nA preliminary inquest into the atrocity takes place at 2pm today  at Belfast’s High Court.\nLast week the MoD handed over a database containing almost 5,000 names of former soldiers to the Coroner’s Office.\n\nThe spreadsheet contains 1,366 names from the Parachute Regiment, 1,542 names from the Queen’s Regiment and eight names from the Queen’s Division. A further 1,492 names appear to be duplicates, meaning ‘when an individual has multiple regiments, or units on their Record of Service. \n\nThe Coroner’s Office had been attempting to trace former soldiers who may have  been in Ballymurphy during the three days in August 1971 when ten people were shot dead and one died of a heart attack.\nHowever, just days before the inquest was due to begin into the killings 47-year-ago the database containing nearly 5,000 names landed on the Coroner’s desk.\n\nSpeaking to the Andersonstown News Ballymurphy Massacre Families spokesperson John Teggart said: “Six working days before the start of our inquest and they  send this letter, this has been done before with the recent UVF story to attempt to delay our inquest.\n\n“Vital inquest resources are being used up here and that shouldn’t be happening, these stunts are nothing but a waste of time. We would now ask for more resources to be released on the back of this. All they  are attempting to do here is swamp the system days before we are due in court.\n\n“The families are devastated, we were and still are working towards this date, the Coroner  has been very focused in the lead up to this, she is now obliged to look at this list. We hope that it can be done in a speedy fashion.\n\n“We were prepared, we knew it wouldn’t be straight forward, when you’re working with the MoD the resources they have and the dirty deals they’ve been up to all along are well known. They’ve been sitting on their hands this entire time probably thinking they’d pull a stunt like this closer to the time [of the inquest], but to do it six days beforehand is utterly despicable.”\n\nMr Teggart continued: “Sure look at the UVF stunt a while ago, that was done to take the focus off the Paras and the Queen’s [regiment] another dirty tactic and I’d be confident that the MoD had a hand in it. \n\n“The UVF certainly weren’t out to help us that time and now the MoD have decided to swamp the inquest.”\n\nDiscussing what now needs to happen Mr Teggart said: “We need to remain focused and keep on track, we’ve had setbacks before and we’ve dealt with them, we will certainly deal with this one.\n\n“I hope there will be no delay we have a preliminary hearing on Thursday, the Coroner is demanding an explanation, she wants to know why this database has suddenly turned up and rightly so. \n\n“Our inquest is set to last 3-4 months, hopefully this database can be looked at in line with this time-frame so we aren’t setback.\n\n“When we were given a date for our inquest 18 months ago we clapped in the court, that’s unheard of. You now have good, independent people within the courts, the MoD have seen this so the only way they could try and delay this is with the dirty deals that they are doing now. \n\n“Bottom line is, the families are ready to go, the Coroner is ready to go, all the work’s done, the schedule has been set out, justice needs to be served.\u0026#8221\n"},{"url":null,"title":"belfast road is most clamped street in northern ireland drivers spend 34k to","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

road is in Belfast is the most clamped street or road in Northern Ireland, new figures have revealed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.push\n\n\nDepartment for Infrastructure statistics show 16 vehicles were clamped on the Lisburn Road between the start of 2016 and the end of June this year.\n\nIt was almost double the number of clampings carried out on Chichester Street, Northern Ireland\u0027s second most clamped street.\n\nBotanic Avenue, Great Victoria Street, and King Street all had eight clampings each.\n\nBetween January 2016 and June of this year Northern Ireland\u0027s motorists paid out £34,581 to have clamps removed from their cars.\n\nNorthern Ireland\u0027s 10 most clamped roads and streets were all in the Belfast City Council area.\n\nIn 2016 there were 254 cars clamped in Northern Ireland, 305 cars were clamped in 2017, and 91 cars were clamped in the first six months of 2018.\n\nIn Northern Ireland there are two reasons to clamp a car.\n\nAction can be taken for an unpaid penalty charge notice, or against vehicles parked in urban clearways and bus lanes.\n\nA spokesman for the Department for Infrastructure said clamping had been an effective measure to prevent traffic offences.\n\nClamping was introduced for cars parked in urban clearways and bus lanes on March 5.\n\nBetween that date and the end of June 35 cars were clamped and removed for that reason.\n\nThe rule was introduced to stop motorists blocking the main arteries into Belfast by parking illegally.\n\nEnforcement is carried out for the Department for Infrastructure by contractor NSL Services Group.\n\nDrivers are required to pay a charge of £40 to have a clamp removed if the car has been removed to a nearby street, or £105 if the car has been taken to the vehicle pound .\n\nSpeaking at the time of the launch of the measure, Ciaran de Burca, Department for Infrastructure director of transport projects, said: \"Vehicles parked in urban clearway routes and bus lanes during operational hours cause significant delays and congestion for commuters and other road users, particularly during the morning and evening peak traffic hours.\n\n\"For drivers who choose to ignore urban clearway and bus lane regulations, this specially designed enforcement vehicle will carry out the removal and clamping of illegally parked vehicles, leaving main routes unobstructed during these key times and allowing other road users to continue on their journeys without the unnecessary delay caused.\"\n\nEarlier this year the issue of clamping was in the headlines after footage emerged of Sinn Fein MLA Gerry Kelly removing a clamp from his car, raising questions about the legality of clamping a vehicle in a private car park.\n\nSpeaking after the incident, legal expert Joshua Rozenberg said clamping legislation had not been updated in Northern Ireland since the 1970s and differed substantially from other parts of the UK.\n\nClamping on private land in England and Wales became an offence in 2012 under the Protection of Freedom Act, with the same law having been in place in Scotland since 2002.\n\nHowever, it remains legal in Northern Ireland.\n\nCompanies here can still hire contractors to clamp private cars on their land, although companies able to do this must be licensed by the Security Industry Authority  and are regulated by the British Parking Authority.\n\nThe maximum fee private contractors can charge to free a car from a clamp in Northern Ireland is £100.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"belfast security alert ends after suspicious object declared not viable","story":"\n Hi

evidence in the case.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nVictims of the Ballymurphy massacre in west Belfast \n\n\n\n\nHe said they hope to start hearing evidence from military witnesses early next year.\n\nThe Coroner’s Office is currently examining a database of the names of almost 5,000 former soldiers it received from the Ministry of Defence last month.\n\nThe spreadsheet is believed to contain 4,773 entries of individuals from the Parachute Regiment, Queen’s Regiment and Queen’s Division who had been serving at the time of the shootings.\n\nThe Coroner’s Office is attempting to trace former soldiers who may have been at Ballymurphy during the shootings to call as witnesses to the inquest.\n\nIt will sit four days each week from Monday to Thursday, with Fridays set aside for matters including the ongoing work to trace potential military witnesses.\n\n“The opening will include an overview and the background to the incident,” counsel for the Coroner added.\n\nHe also revealed the inquest will look at the investigation carried out by the Royal Military Police following the incident, the original inquest, the Historical Enquiries Team report and the directions given by the Attorney General.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupporters of the Ballymurphy families gather outside Belfast High Court\n\n\n\n\nIn 2011, Northern Ireland’s Attorney General John Larkin directed that an inquest be held into the shootings.\n\nThat came after the Northern Ireland Office ruled out any public inquiry into the killings akin to the Bloody Sunday Tribunal.\n\nSoldiers have long been held responsible for killing 10 people in Ballymurphy but the accepted narrative became clouded earlier this year when former UVF members came forward to claim their organisation was also involved.\n\nA Catholic priest and a mother-of-eight were among those killed during three days of gunfire involving members of the Parachute Regiment.\n\nAnother man died of a heart attack following an alleged violent confrontation with the troops in the west Belfast estate.\n\nThe shootings took place as the Army moved in to republican strongholds to arrest IRA suspects in the wake of the introduction by the Stormont administration of the controversial policy of internment without trial.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nBriege Voyle addresses supporters outside Belfast High Court \n\n\n\n\nAround 100 supporters gathered outside Belfast High Court on Monday in solidarity with the Ballymurphy families before the hearing.\n\nSpeaking outside court Briege Voyle, whose mother Joan Connolly died in the shootings, said they are determined to get the truth from the inquest.\n\n“This is a very very big day for us, we have struggled hard for this for the last 20 years,” she said.\n\n“We are definitely hoping to get the truth, the MoD have to tell the truth\n\n“At the end of the day, our loved ones were murdered, cold blooded murder and they have to admit it.\n\n“Those soldiers are no different to anyone else, they have to answer for it.”\n\nJohn Teggart, whose father Daniel was among those killed in the incident, said it had been a “long long journey” to get to where they are.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nJohn Teggart and Briege Voyle of the Ballymurphy families with supporters outside Belfast High Court \n\n\n\n\n“This is the first day, in our eyes, of the inquest,” he said.\n\n“We will be here every Monday from here on in until November.\n\n“It is really heartening to see so many faces here and so many victims because this is not just about the Ballymurphy families, this is about all of you.\n\n“We stand in solidarity with you as you stand in solidarity with us.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"ex northern ireland defender named new manager of cheltenham","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

I know that they have worked very hard to get the deal done and I am very grateful for the opportunity.\n\n“I only played professionally for two clubs so obviously Cheltenham Town is a club that I know well and one that is very close to my heart.\n\n“It is also an opportunity to move my family back home and I’m looking forward to meeting the staff and players on Tuesday.”\n\nCheltenham are currently 18th in the Sky Bet League Two table.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"final recommendations for northern ireland electoral boundary changes published","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

There would be four new constituencies - Sperrin, Causeway, Mid Antrim and Mid Down.\n\n\nFlashback to 2017 General Election results: \n\nEast Belfast\n .... \nNorth Belfast \n\n\n.... \nSouth Belfast\n \n\n.... \nWest Belfast \n\n\n.... \nEast Antrim \n\n\n.... \nEast Londonderry \n\n\n.... \nFermanagh \u0026 South Tyrone\n \n\n.... \nFoyle \n\n\n.... \nLagan Valley \n \n\n.... \n\n\nMid Ulster \n \n\n.... \nNewry \u0026 Armagh \n\n\n.... \nNorth Antrim \n \n\n.... \nNorth Down\n \n\n.... \nSouth Antrim\n \n\n.... \nSouth Down\n \n\n.... \nStrangford \n \n\n.... \nUpper Bann  \n\n\n....\nWest Tyrone  \n\n\n....\n\nEleven remain with the same name, although their boundaries are altered. They are the four sets in Belfast, East Antrim, Mid Ulster, Newry and Armagh, North Down, South Antrim, South Down and Upper Bann.\n\nAnd effectively disappearing - because there would be no obvious successor in the new plans - would be North Antrim, Lagan Valley, Strangford, East Londonderry and West Tyrone.\n\nA previous proposal to reduce Belfast to three constituencies has disappeared.\n\nThe iations in the number of people living in each constituency would be reduced - meaning they would be closer in size in terms of people represented.\n\nCurrently the smallest constituency is East Antrim with 59,658 electors on December 2015, while the largest is Upper Bann with 80,218.\n\nUnder the Boundary Commission plans the smallest would become Upper Bann with 69,795 people eligible to vote and the largest, Mid Down, with 77,767.\n\n\n\nThe Boundary Commission has been working on the changes since 2013 and the final recommendations come after a large scale consultation process. Almost 10,000 petition signatures and letters were received by the organisation.\n\nThe matter will be put to parliament and debated before new legislation is put in place to enact the changes, if a vote approves the changes.\n\nDeputy Chair of the Boundary Commission for Northern Ireland, Madam Justice Denise McBride DBE, QC said: \"The Boundary Commission has determined its final recommendations after careful consideration of all the evidence collected during three stages of open and transparent public consultation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final recommendation proposes 17 constituencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Commission is grateful to all those who took the time and trouble to respond.

almost 3m more than he paid for it in 2013.\n\nBuilt in 2010, the sun-soaked deluxe pad boasts six bedrooms, a fully-equipped gym, nine bathrooms, a swimming pool and a private jetty that serves a nearby lake.\n\nThe 10,500sq ft home has been tastefully decorated in greys and beige, with a pool table in one of the leisure rooms.\n\nThere\u0027s even a putting green in the grounds where the Holywood-born golfer could take out the clubs and get in a little after-hours practice if the mood took him.\n\nRory and his American wife Erica Stoll - who hails from the same area of Palm Beach where the house was sold - have now moved into a new home once owned by golf legend Ernie Els in nearby Jupiter.\n\nRory and Erica married in April last year at Ashford Castle in Cong, Co Mayo.\n\nThe couple first met when the stunning New Yorker was working manager of championship volunteer operations for the Professional Golf Association of America.\n\nShe famously woke McIlroy up after he had slept in during the Ryder Cup in 2012.\n\nThe new owner of the former McIlroy mansion, which the golfer originally paid £7.2m for, has not been revealed.\n\nIn 2013, McIlroy sold a five-bedroom house with its own golf driving range and putting green at Moneyreagh, Co Down, for £2m. \n\nThe 14-acre estate also boasted five bedrooms and a gymnasium.\n\nIn 2014 the golfer bought a property in Holywood through Simon Brien Residential estate agents.\n\nHe also snapped up a three-storey building there, described as having been sub-divided into five apartments.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"things karen bradley never knew viral trend after secretary of state admits lack of northern ireland knowledge","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Actually, the unionist parties fight the elections against each other in unionist communities and nationalists in nationalist communities. That’s a very different world from the world I came from.” \n\nSince her admission last week the interview has inspired the #ThingsKarenBradleyNeverKnew on Twitter.\n\nFrom where the international airport is, or isn\u0027t, to how people across the divide take their tea, there has been all manner of hilarity.\n\n\"The Apprentice Boys are an exclusive club of trainee electricians, plumbers and joiners,\" joked one scamp.\n\n\"Makes Twitter worth it,\" said Alliance leader Naomi Long. \n\n\"We might have more than our fair share of problems but when it comes to dark humour and laughing at ourselves  we really excel,\" the MLA said. \n\n\"I\u0027m not particularly worried about Karen Bradley\u0027s lack of knowledge about here before she was appointed Secretary of State,\" said SDLP leader Colum Eastwood. \n\n\"I\u0027m very concerned about her lack of action since she arrived.\"\n\n\nThe Guddies are for wearing on your feet and not a 70s TV show starring Bill Oddie. \n#ThingsKarenBradleyNeverKnew\n\n— Marty Morgan  \nSeptember 10, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nMost dogs in Northern Ireland are called Ormo because they\u0027re well bread \n#ThingsKarenBradleyNeverKnew\n\n— DaddyTayto  \nSeptember 10, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nBobby Ewing was in the shower all the time... \n#ThingsKarenBradleyNeverKnew\n\n— Arvo McPart #FBPE #ABTV #Remain  \nSeptember 10, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#ThingsKarenBradleyNeverKnew\n\nGordon Ramsay, Marco Pierre White and Jamie Oliver all hail from Cookstown.\n— Ryan  \nSeptember 10, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nA dreary monday Morning brightened considerably by \n#ThingsKarenBradleyNeverKnew\n\n— Davy Sims  \nSeptember 10, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#ThingsKarenBradleyNeverKnew\n\n\nCatholics put green Milk in their cereal and Protestants put Blue Milk on theirs...\n— Slim™  \nSeptember 10, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#ThingsKarenBradleyNeverKnew\n \n\nMaze prison was actually a Maze and once prisoners found the exit they were allowed to leave.\n— Tim McCullagh  \nSeptember 7, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nBelfast International Airport isn\u0027t actually in Belfast \n#ThingsKarenBradleyNeverKnew\n\n— David McCann  \nSeptember 9, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nChuck Norris was in the RA \n#ThingsKarenBradleyNeverKnew\n\n— The_Flamming_Cahoot  \nSeptember 10, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nIan Paisley was widely misunderstood When he called for an end to \u0027Popery\u0027 he was actually decrying the popular 1980\u0027s perfumed wooden shavings which many middle class women kept in an ornate dish in the living room. \n#ThingsKarenBradleyNeverKnew\n\n— Shirley Anne McMillan  \nSeptember 7, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Apprentice Boys are an exclusive club of trainee electricians, plumbers and joiners.\n#ThingsKarenBradleyNeverKnew\n\n— TimesIwonder  \nSeptember 7, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#ThingsKarenBradleyNeverKnew\n we still have to check under our cars for leprechauns \npic.twitter/zrpRnWxSR7\n\n— Julie Watson  \nSeptember 8, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\"...and I know it\u0027s famous for building the world\u0027s most famous ship - the Starship Enterprise.

I think it is possible.”\n\nHowever, another Brexiteer, Crispin Blunt, played down the significance of the comments.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nCrispin Blunt played down Mr Barnier’s remarks \n\n\n\n\nHe told Newsnight: “If you listen carefully to what Michel Barnier said there was no movement, there was an expression of confidence that we can get an agreement on the withdrawal agreement where we are going to give them £39 billion.\n\n“Terrific.  Unsurprising that they are going to go for that agreement.\n\n“He has been distinctly cool on Chequers. Simply saying it is the basis for discussion is hardly earth-shattering, and then you have had strong opposition to Chequers from people like the French Europe minister and others.”\n\nMr Baker, a leading figure in the pro-Brexit Tory European Research Group, said the party’s annual conference in Birmingham, starting on September 30, could prove a decisive moment as Mrs May is forced to acknowledge the scale of grassroots opposition to her proposals.\n\nNumber 10 said critics of the plan had yet to come forward with a credible alternative which would avoid the return of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.\n\nBut Mr Duncan Smith told Newsnight there were “plenty of solutions for that and those will be presented later on”.\n\nHe added: “The key point is the  Commission has to be prepared to come to that party and say, ‘yes, we are prepared to show some flexibility on this’, so that there can be a UK-wide free trade deal.\n\n“If they do that I think you could make dramatic progress.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"dup member condemns creasy over foster criticism","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

I never fought for women to be made to travel at a time they should be with partners or family or friends.\n\n“So as much as we’ve made some progress, we have a long way to go in Northern Ireland, and it’s the fundamental principle … women will never be as equal as men in the choices they can make.”\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nPaula Bradley \n\n\n\n\nMs Creasy was taking part in a panel discussion on “Our vision for women in 2018”, chaired by Martina Devlin at the International Congress of Parliamentary Women’s Caucuses in Dublin Castle.\n\nPaula Bradley, a Democratic Unionist Party representative for Belfast North since 2011, said Ms Creasy’s criticisms were not in the spirit of the day.\n\n“It’s not embarrassing, it slightly annoyed me, we’re here as part of a women’s caucus.\n\n“It angered me slightly, the one person today who had the back completely ripped out of her was Arlene Foster and not anyone else. That’s bad for this type of event.\n\n“Very much women’s caucuses are here to support women.”\n\nMs Creasy, who also criticised French right-wing leader Marine Le Pen and Australian Liberal Party politician Julie Bishop, said she had asked Ms Bradley for a meeting to discuss abortion reform, and the offer was rejected.\n\n“Caucuses are not about denying women accountability for their actions. I’m sorry that the DUP representative here today didn’t take up the offer to meet with me.\n\n“It may well be a difficult conversation but it is one I want to have and it has been rebuffed, which tells me that women’s rights are not on the agenda.”\n\nMs Creasy confirmed to the Press Association that Irish premier Leo Varadkar assured her he would support her in her campaign for abortion rights.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"no 10 defends mays brexit plan as barnier says november deal","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong fell again after President Donald Trump again threatened to tax almost everything the US imports from China. The index has tumbled almost 20% since late January as the dispute has escalated.\n\nRandy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab, said investors feel China has much more to lose in the conflict than the US does, as it exports much more to the US than it imports from it.\n\n“If Chinese businesses and Chinese consumers get uncomfortable with this whole battle, they get nervous and they get tentative,” he said. “When people do that, they stop spending.”\n\nThe S\u0026P 500 index gained 5.45 points, or 0.2%, to 2,877.13, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 59.47 points, or 0.2%, to 25,857.07 as health insurer UnitedHealth and aerospace company Boeing traded lower.\n\nThe Nasdaq composite edged up 21.62 points, or 0.3%, to 7,924.16, and the Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks rose 4.29 points, or 0.3%, to 1,717.47.\n\nThe S\u0026P 500 fell 1% last week, its worst drop since late June.\n\nNike rose 2.2% to 82.10 dollars. The stock slumped 3% on August 31 as investors worried about potential backlash to an advertising campaign featuring former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick. Nike’s stock has now regained almost all the ground it lost since then.\n\nTechnology companies moved higher as Microsoft picked up 1.1% to 109.38 dollars, and Broadcom rose 3.5% to 240.61 dollars. The S\u0026P 500 technology index is coming off its largest weekly loss since March.\n\nApple fell 1.3% to 218.33 dollars after saying it might raise prices on some of its products, including the Apple Watch and the Mac mini, in response to the tariffs.\n\nThe Trump administration could soon announce tariffs on 200 billion dollars in goods imported from China and has threatened more taxes after that. The administration has already imposed tariffs on 50 billion dollars in Chinese products, which Beijing matched.\n\nHong Kong’s Hang Seng index tumbled 1.3%. After peaking in late January, it is close to entering a bear market. The MSCI Emerging Markets stock index has already breached that mark as major indexes in Turkey and Russia have also skidded.\n\nMr Frederick said the gap between rising US indexes and falling emerging markets indexes is unusual and cannot last for very long: either the difficulties in emerging markets will start to affect the rest of the world economy, potentially slowing US growth, or emerging markets will start improving.\n\nCBS announced on Sunday that Mr Moonves is stepping down after six more women accused him of sexual misconduct as well as retaliation if they resisted him. He denied the charges although he said he had consensual relations with three of the women.\n\nCBS fell 1.5% to 55.20 dollars. It has fallen 4% since the allegations against Mr Moonves surfaced in late July.\n\nAlibaba fell 3.7% to 156.36 dollars. The company’s next chairman will be Daniel Zhang, who replaced Mr Ma as CEO in 2013.\n\nBenchmark US crude fell 0.3% to 67.54 dollars a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, gained 0.7% to 77.37 dollars a barrel in London.\n\nWholesale gasoline dipped 0.5% to 1.96 dollars a gallon, heating oil stayed at 2.22 dollars a gallon, and natural gas rose 1% to 2.80 dollars per 1,000 cubic feet.\n\nBond prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note remained at 2.94%.\n\nThe dollar rose to 111.21 yen from 111.06 yen. The euro rose to 1.1597 dollars from 1.1566.\n\nGold was little changed at 1,199.80 dollars an ounce, silver rose 0.1% to 14.18 dollars an ounce, and copper inched up 0.2% to 2.63 dollars a pound.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"new multi disciplinary gp service create 200","story":"\nDerry has been announced as one of two areas in the north to benefit from multi-disciplinary teams at its GP practices which will create two hundred new jobs in the city.\n\nIt has been described as a ‘new era’ in GP care placing the city will be at the forefront of the ‘major transformative initiative’, according to the Department of Health.\n\nHealth and Social Care Trusts are working with GP Federations to start the recruitment processes for 200 new posts in Derry, with the new services expected to become available in the coming months.\n\nMulti-Disciplinary Teams  involve the establishment of practice-based physiotherapists, mental health specialists and social workers at GP practices -

Only five players attended a pre-season meeting and Down took the field for their National League opener with barely 15 players.\n\nHowever, Rooney\u0026rsquos infectious enthusiasm has transformed Down and three months later the girls find themselves preparing for an All-Ireland showdown.\n\nSport is such a conundrum. All who have been involved in sport at any level can testify to the many frustrating and heartbreaking defeats sporadically interrupted by moments of sheer elation.\n\nIt\u0026rsquos these infrequent moments that keep players and coaches going year in year out in search of just one more. A half, a game even a season can be changed on a block, tackle, score or win and the momentum gathered can be infectious.\u0026nbsp\n\nA group, seemingly going nowhere except deeper into the abyss are suddenly galvanised, working for one another as if their lives depended on it. Success is like a lightning bolt. It can strike when you least expect it and you must keep the energy and drive going. You have to strike when the iron is hot.\n\nYet, as we all know, fairy tale endings only become fairy tale endings when the underdog performs to their very best and leaves the field of play with no regrets.\n\nOn their day the Down girls are a match for anyone as they have proved a number of times this year and they have also shown that when their backs are against the wall they can and have turned games around.\u0026nbsp\n\nDown have talented players all over the park. They will be led by Clonduff sisters Sara Louise and Fionnuala Carr, who were both on the side that won the All-Ireland Junior crown at Croke Park in 2014.\n\nThrow in in Bredagh\u0026rsquos Catherine Rocks, Liatroim\u0026rsquos Aimee McAleenan and Dearbhla Magee and you have the nucleus of an attack-minded side.\u0026nbsp\n\nHowever, Portaferry\u0026rsquos twin terrors Niamh Mallon \u0026mdash skipper of the 2014 side \u0026mdash and Saoirse Sands are the jewels in the Down crown and they have the potential to cut any defence to shreds and no better place to do that than Croke Park on Sunday.\n\nThere were plenty of raised eyebrows when Down got the better of Tipperary thanks to a 58th minute goal from Sara Louise Carr to reach the Liberty Insurance All-Ireland Intermediate final for the first time in 20 years.\n\nIt may have been a surprise, but there were indications that the Mourne girls were making real progress as the summer evolved.\n\nAdmittedly, the league was a disaster, as they lost all five outings, but then they got the better of Derry in the Ulster final. They followed that up with a draw against the much-fancied Oak Leafers in the opening round of the All-Ireland Championship.\n\nThat laid the platform for the rest of the campaign and they defeated Laois to bag the runners-up spot in Group 1 behind Cork, who had overcome all before them.\n\nTipperary topped Group 2 and were six points clear at half-time in the semi-final, but with the experiment of deploying Fionnuala Carr at full forward dispensed with, there was an immediate improvement as the Clonduff colossus began to exert greater influence from centre back. Nicole Kelly put the shackles on the dangerous Nicola Treacy too.\n\nMeanwhile, Niamh Mallon was busily keeping the umpire busy as she racked up nine points, seven from placed balls. That brought Down in touch and Sara Louise Carr, who got married earlier this year, pounced for the definitive goal to go with her earlier two points from play.\n\nCork will be desperate to get over the line having lost the last two deciders, including last year\u0026rsquos to Meath after a replay.\u0026nbsp\n\nMuch like their senior counterparts, they have cruised through to the final, finishing the group phase with a positive scoring differential of 65 points, compared to Down\u0026rsquos -2. Indeed, the Rebels were 12-point victors when the teams met in P\u0026aacuteirc Esler in July.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe Leesiders possess a lot of firepower with Finola Neville, Caroline Sugrue and Katelyn Hickey well able to hit the target. Minor star Cliona Healy came off the bench to have a big impact in the semi-final win over Galway, scoring three points in as many minutes soon after her second-half introduction to edge the Leesiders clear and finishing with four.\n\nHealy wasn\u0026rsquot involved when the Leesiders garnered the Division 2 League title, but she and a handful of other colleagues from the All-Ireland-winning Minor Championship side have made the step up and with that sort of ability to be called upon, they will be hard to beat.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Arts Centre launches new programme  ","story":"\t\t\t\nDOWN Arts Centre has announced its latest arts programme.\n\nThe new-look autumn guide, covering September to December, is brimming with a huge range of exhibitions, music, theatre, comedy, talks, classes and workshops.\n\nA ied season of live performances gets off to a comedic start with Owen O\u0026rsquoNeill\u0026rsquos new one man play, \u0026lsquoTen Songs To Die For\u0026rsquo.\u0026nbsp Also billed for the autumn are local comedians Shane Todd with his hilarious brand new stand-up show \u0026lsquoHero\u0026rsquo and Kevin McAleer \u0026mdash a comedy apparition not to be missed.\n\nMusical highlights include celtic and country classics including the Leading Ladies, charismatic singer songwriter Grainne Duffy and the ever popular Illegals with Niamh Kavanagh.\n\nNew to Down Arts Centre is local musician Tony Wright who will provide a unique night of story and song with a killer sound track.\u0026nbsp\n\nAlso not to be missed is The \u0026lsquoLegend of Luke Kelly\u0026rsquo, a spectacular tribute to the greatest folk artist of the 20th century, a definite must-see for all fans.

community service dedicated to eighth century replica monument  ","story":"\t\t\t\nA REPLICA of St Patrick\u0026rsquos Cross at Down Cathedral has been formally unveiled following a cross-community dedication service.\n\nThe replica eighth century cross \u0026mdash which stands an imposing 12-feet high and weighs five tonnes \u0026mdash is located just yards from where the patron saint is buried on the historic Hill of Down, with the Mournes in the distance providing a stunning back.\n\nBishops from the Church of Ireland and Catholic communities took part in last Friday afternoon\u0026rsquos service and they were joined by local clergy and monks from the Holy Cross Monastery in Rostrevor.\n\nFriday\u0026rsquos ceremony had been pencilled in for earlier in the summer but had to be postponed following the discovery of medieval human remains while contractors were preparing the ground for the installation of the cross, carved from Mourne granite excavated from Thomas\u0026rsquo Mountain high up in the mountain range.\n\nThe intricately designed structure was manufactured by the Kilkeel firm of McConnell Brothers and representatives from the firm were joined by Church of Ireland Bishop Harold Miller, Down and Connor Bishop Noel Treanor, the Dean of Down, the Very Rev Henry Hull, and members of the Cathedral Chapter.\n\nDean Hull, who led the short service of dedication, said the ceremony marked a very special day and was delighted a number of people heavily involved in the project were present, including Dr Mike King from the Down County Museum.\n\nDean Hull explained that Dr King played a key role initiating the replica cross project, financed by Newry, Mourne and Down Council.\n\n\u0026ldquoMike worked hard along with others to bring about the cross which replicates one that was in place around 800AD. Inside Down Cathedral, there are some old stones and through research, Mike discovered they were in fact part of the original St Patrick\u0026rsquos Cross, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoIn some old drawings of the cathedral you can see broken portions of the cross which marked nearby St Patrick\u0026rsquos grave. Obviously this old Celtic cross had fallen down and was broken with some pieces placed inside the church.\n\nDean Hull said Dr King, with the help of Philip Armstrong, redesigned the replica cross based on drawings and sketches and eventually, through the help of McConnell Brothers, the imposing replica cross was produced.\n\nThose in attendance at the dedication ceremony were told that the source of the granite used to make the replica cross was most probably the same as that from which the original was made, Dean Hull said the cross is at the heart of the Christian faith and that because Jesus died on the cross, people are reconciled to God and find forgiveness.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoWe are reconciled to God but through the cross we can be reconciled to each other, with the cross reminding us of our common faith as Christians. It is lovely today that Christians from different traditions are able to stand around this cross today because the cross is a symbol of Christian unity and it reminds us that we have one faith, he continued.\n\nDean Hull said when people look at the cross and reflect back to Patrick and to the days of an undivided church, they are reminded that despite all has happened, \u0026ldquowe are still one in Christ with the cross a symbol of what people have in common\u0026nbsp \u0026mdash Christian unity.\n\nConcluding before the start of a short religious dedication service, Dean Hull thanked the Lecale and Down Historical Society which helped with the restoration project and the former Down Council and current Newry, Mourne and Down Council for their support.\n\nDean Hull\u0026rsquos words were reflected by Bishop Miller, who said a prayer as part of the dedication service along with Bishop Treanor.\n\nThe clerics then gathered at the base of the sculpture where they placed their palms over the imprint of a hand in the cross\u0026rsquos base and were joined by Bishop Grant Le Marque, former Anglican Bishop of the Horn of Africa, who was visiting the Down and Dromore Diocese.\n\n\u0026ldquoHere we have Christian hands together, said Bishop Miller, encouraging other people from all over the world to visit the cathedral to make the same gesture.\n\nHe added: \u0026ldquoThe cross is never just something at a distance it is the very heart of our faith in Christ, our relationship with Christ and our salvation in Christ.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Delight after new Translink bus service is extended to Clough  ","story":"\t\t\t\nA NEW bus service is operating in Clough.\n\nThe Downpatrick to Ballykinlar service is being extended to Clough from this month.

A super effort. The only other male junior, Oliver Robinson,\u0026nbsp did a double. The U-13 boys 100m in 15.15 and a strong run in the 1500m saw him finish in 5\u0026rsquo40.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\n\nA promising start to his career as a Year 8 athlete. The sole senior of the night was Davy Foster in 1,500m running a fast 4\u0026rsquo50. Maybe Davy will stick to these faster shorter distances to try and keep up with his daughters.\n\nGirls galore\n\nTwo of the aforementioned Foster girls competed in the U-11 girls\u0026rsquo 1200m. In a competitive race Jodi hit the finish line in 4\u0026rsquo17 then not far behind was the always-smiling Kari in an impressive time of 4\u0026rsquo43. They both also tried the long jump.\u0026nbsp\n\nIn the U-13 girls\u0026rsquo 100m EDAC had three runners. Heat one saw Kara Trainor finish well in second place in 15.01. In heat three we saw Lauren Madine win in\u0026nbsp a new PB time of 14.16 and Anna Gardiner come home in 15.67 with Lauren taking the overall win and gold medal for the distance.\u0026nbsp\n\nKara\u0026rsquos time placed her sixth overall. It was pleasing to see them follow the lead of the younger girls by trying a field event as well, in this case the discus. Commendable enthusiasm!\n\nFab five females\n\nThe U-13 girls\u0026rsquo 1500m saw a large field of 14 athletes, five of which were EDAC runners and which also included the top class City of Lisburn athlete Katie McCleery, who is ranked in the top 10 in the UK for her age category over this distance.\u0026nbsp\n\nMcCleery made her intentions clear from the start as she immediately hit the front. Lauren decided to track her run and see how she went and was closely followed by Anna Gardiner, Lucy Foster, Kara Trainor and Emily Burns.\u0026nbsp\n\nAll five EDAC athletes looked superb over the three and three-quarter laps. On the last bend McCleery tried to hold on, but Lauren moved up another gear waiting and cruised past to take first place with 100m to run and crossed the line in a superb time of 4\u0026rsquo57 which is a PB by 18 seconds and puts Lauren 8th in the UK for her age for 2018. That was an outstanding performance.\n\nAnna Gardiner was the next EDAC athlete to finish in 5\u0026rsquo05 which is also a significant PB.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\n\nThe PBs were coming thick and fast as Lucy Foster came home in 5\u0026rsquo17 which was 12 seconds better than her previous best. The ever-improving duo of Kara Trainor and Emily Burns battled it out to the end and almost needed a photo finish to separate them \u0026mdash their times were\u0026nbsp 5.41.34 and 5.41.90. This race was really exciting to watch with brilliant efforts from all the girls. By filling first, third, fourth, seventh and eighth places, in the field of 14, there is surely cause for celebration at the depth of talent within the EDAC ranks.\n\nIcing on the cake\n\nLast girl to race was U-15 rising star Kirsti Foster in the 1500m. The girls were mixed with a strong U-15 boys\u0026rsquo field and Kirsti did not take the race lightly, despite carrying a slight niggle from hockey.\u0026nbsp\n\nShe dominated the girls\u0026rsquo field and beat some of the boys too in her race to finish a strong 5\u0026rsquo12 to provide a fitting finale to the night and to the track season.\n\nLaganside 10k\n\nPaula Radcliffe was obviously the star of the show, but EDAC had a few sparkling performances themselves.\u0026nbsp\n\nPaul Lloyd led the troops home and despite narrowly missing out on the elusive sub 40, he felt that he had given his all in the fast-paced race. His time of 40.08 is tantalisingly close and his consistency has to be commended.\u0026nbsp\n\nPhillip Vint, another man who rarely misses a weekend race, came next in 41.10 with Liam Keenan not far behind in 41.36. Gavin Hynds in 41.45 had plenty to celebrate as this was a PB and proves that marathon training doesn\u0026rsquot always slow you down and must be great morale booster for him.\u0026nbsp\n\nDeirdre v Paula?\n\nDeirdre Weatherall finished in 42.08 and was slightly disappointed with that. However, she was cheered up by the fact that Paula Radcliffe had decided to run in the pack and was seen in chat with ious folk en route.\u0026nbsp\n\nThis gave Deirdre the chance to have a sprint finish to the line with the women\u0026rsquos marathon world record holder.\n\nPaula also has European and World Championship medals too numerous to mention as well the accolade of four times Olympian. Many would defer to such greatness, but Deirdre is well known for her fresh-faced enthusiasm and took no time to decide that having a result sheet with her name one place ahead of Paula\u0026rsquos was an opportunity unlikely to be repeated.\n\nAfter reading on Wikipedia that Deirdre is described as the foremost tragic heroine in Irish legend and probably its best-known figure in modern times, she could probably argue that Paula should have been in awe of her rather than the other way round.\n\nThis is the spirit that is key to Deirdre\u0026rsquos rise in the ranks and long may it continue.\n\nLiam Smyth \u0026mdash veteran in terms of longevity in these events clocked up a respectable 44.42. Behind him another historic event was unfolding.\n\nGavin McConvey came in to the finish line in 53.51 declaring that the last time he saw a sub 54 minute 10K was in 2004. Not bad going Gavin, keep it up.\u0026nbsp\n\nRoisin Gaffney, another reliable EDAC runner, finished in 54.09 and for once found, despite her love of the sun, that the heat was oppressive and was glad to be done.\n\nDonal at the double\n\nDonal Smith headed to Kildare on Saturday to take part in an a 5k run in aid of the Injured Jockeys\u0026rsquo Fund - but having discovered that there was a 10K race nearby he decided in true horse lovers\u0026rsquo form to hedge his bets and do both. He did say afterwards that it was a lot for one day and he may need a few rest days, but knowing Donal, that won\u0026rsquot last for long.\n\nNo one from the club made their way to Derry on Sunday morning for the Waterside Half Marathon which this year was also the NI and Ulster Half Marathon Championships.\n\nWhat\u0026rsquos ahead?\n\nThis will probably come too late for regular readers of the weekly papers, but Tuesday is the night for the annual trek to Castlewellan for the lung busting, for some, Mill Hill Mile Challenge.\u0026nbsp\n\nThis is a race that is, or should be, on everybody\u0026rsquos bucket list so if you\u0026rsquore going don t\u0026rsquo forget you must register online beforehand.

They were freed on bail later that evening.\n\nAiring last November, the Alex Gibney-directed documentary was a hard-hitting examination of claims of state collusion in the murders, which broke new ground by publicly naming alleged suspects.\n\nThe six men killed in Loughinisland were Adrian Rogan, Barney Green, Dan McCreanor, Eamon Byrne, Malcolm Jenkinson and Patsy O\u0026rsquoHare.\n\nClare Rogan, wife of Adrian Rogan, said the families would not be deterred in their search for truth and justice.\n\n\u0026ldquoWe are shocked and appalled at the arrest of two journalists related to the No Stone Unturned documentary, which exposed the extent of state collusion between the state and loyalist paramilitaries in Loughinisland, she said.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe British government have systematically denied and continue to cover up its role in the murder of six people in the Heights Bar.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoThese arrests show the lengths of desperation that the British government and state forces are prepared to go to, in order to stifle the truth about what happened in Loughinisland.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe Police Ombudsman\u0026rsquos report into Loughinisland murders was one of the most damning expositions of state collusion in mass murder ever published.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoOur families, and many other families across the island, some of whom have been denied the basic right to an inquest, have campaigned for many years against state collusion and for truth and justice for our loved ones.\n\nSouth Down Sinn F\u0026eacutein MP Chris Hazzard has thanked those who came out to stand with the Loughinisland families on Friday night.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe arrests of two leading investigative journalists who helped lift the lid on collusion following the 1994 Loughinisland murders through \u0026lsquoNo Stone Unturned\u0026rsquo has re-opened many wounds for the families of those murdered, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoThat truth would never have been possible without journalists like Barry and Trevor who acted always with integrity.

He started rowing back to shore, but one of the oars slipped overboard and into the water.\n\nAfter a few unsuccessful attempts to circle the oar, Mr Milligan decided to jump overboard to retrieve it. After getting the oar, Mr Milligan tried to swim back to the boat, but it was drifting away in the strong tide.\n\nA strong swimmer, Mr Milligan struck out for the shore and was about half a mile out when he was picked up by police in a rowing boat.\n\n\u0026ldquoI shouted to the children to keep calm and they did.

He is still the top bid. It is understood that two additional parties are interested in acquiring the 75,000 sq ft red brick building which once provided work for 400 people when it was owned by Hursts, part of the Ulster Weaving Group.\n\nNearly 150 years old, the five-storey mill was used for the wet spinning of flax and most of its flooring is tiled.\u0026nbsp This activity closed ten years ago.

The display was organised by Down District Council as part of their Percy French festival and more than \u0026pound500 worth of fireworks were used.\n\nBilly Caughey was the master of ceremonies for the evening and introduced several bands who played selections prior to the display.\n\nCROSSGAR \u0026mdash Mr James Mejury, founder of the family motor business in Crossgar, died at his home this week. He was 80. A native of Ballyronan, Derry, he moved with his family from Belfast to Shrigley after the outbreak of the last war and began his business in Killyleagh Street, Crossgar.\n\nHis conscientiousness at work meant that 12-hour days were common place. The solution of customers\u0026rsquo problems were his delight.\n\nDRUMAROAD \u0026mdash Gene Fitzpatrick, voted Ulster\u0026rsquos top cabaret artist, is to compere a grand iety concert organised by St Patrick\u0026rsquos Scouts and Cubs in Drumaroad Hall next Tuesday night. A top class line-up includes Fergie, Houl Yer Whist, Dominic Hughes and a local supporting cast.\n\nDuring the past few months the boys and their leaders have been very busy. The cubs spent a very enjoyable five days at Clare, while 30 miles away the scouts were on a ten-day camp at Birr, Co Offaly.\n\nThe scouts won the Diocesan Shield and represented Dromore diocese a few weeks ago at the Melviin Trophy in Dublin where they gained considerable success.\n\nKILLINCHY \u0026mdash A harvest fair in Killinchy Presbyterian Church Hall on Saturday afternoon raised \u0026pound1,300 for church funds. There was a high standard of entries for the ious classes for bread, cakes, fruit and vegetables and sales were also good.\n\nThe crowds seemed to enjoy a iety of sideshows on the football pitch where darts shooting and beanbag games contributed to the fun.\u0026nbsp\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Local minister gets in tune for marathon on the organ  ","story":"\t\t\t\nA PLUMP cushion will be the Rev Mark Spratt\u0026rsquos best friend as he undertakes a 12-hour music marathon.\n\nThe minister of Kilmore Presbyterian Church, near Crossgar, is once again preparing to play an organ and piano non-stop to raise funds for the church.\n\nHe will be playing hundreds of psalms, hymns, spiritual songs, church music, classical pieces along with wedding favourites from 9am-9pm on Saturday, September 15.\u0026nbsp\n\nIt will the second time since 2014 that Mr Spratt will take to the keyboards to raise money for the Drumaghlis Road church where he is Director of Music.\n\nA renowned organist, Mr Spratt told the Recorder: \u0026ldquoI did a 12-hour marathon before in 2014 and that time we raised just over \u0026pound2,000 for the Women\u0026rsquos Association and other church activities.\n\n\u0026ldquoThis time it\u0026rsquos to raise money for repairs to the church\u0026rsquos roof and other property matters and I\u0026rsquoll be happy with whatever the community is able to give.\n\nMr Spratt has successfully completed two other music marathons for Bangor Presbyterian Church where he was part of the ministry team before he moved to Kilmore.

She said people expect the politicians to be at work and backed the clamour for them to engage in meaningful talks on the way forward and get back into government.\n\nThe Dundrum woman said the event, alongside those held in other towns, was designed to send a clear message that people have had enough and want the MLAs back in Stormont working for those who voted for them.\n\nJoan hopes the We Deserve Better campaign is something that will focus a lot of minds, explaining people are aware that some MLAs who want to get back to Stormont as part of a functioning Executive, but this has not been possible as result of the political leadership vacuum due to the DUP and Sinn Fein being unable to agree a way forward.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt feels as if we have been putting up with the impasse but there is momentum for change. Hopefully this movement will be able to grow and put some pressure on the politicians to get back, she continued.\n\n\u0026ldquoA lot of people have said that maybe we should do this again and last week I encouraged those in attendance to take photographs and send them to their MLAs to show the support there is for them to get back to work.\n\nJoan said the simple message from last week\u0026rsquos meeting to the politicians was: \u0026ldquoWe elected you, get back to work.\n\nShe added: \u0026ldquoThe politicians are in effect our employees, we elected them to do a job for us and at the minute they are not delivering.

His greeting at a youth Mass in Galway where he declared \u0026lsquoyoung people of Ireland, I love you\u0026rsquo became a stand out moment, replayed on television on countless occasions since. My own childhood involved attending Mass at the Graan and serving as an altar boy in St Michael\u0026rsquos Church in Enniskillen with many of my primary school classmates. We were lucky too that for much of my childhood our pastoral leadership was led by Father Brian D\u0026rsquoArcy who preached a message of tolerance, diversity in the church, compassion for the complexities of life and the experiences that shape them. Even when a stream of disturbing disclosures arose that challenged the Church and its response to clerical abuse and coverup, Father Brian\u0026rsquos consistently strong and unequivocal demand for accountability, truth, justice and recovery for victims offered a pathway for the institutional church to remain connected with its members.\n  My own life journey took me to Dublin in 1999 and what I discovered very quickly was that the message of compassion, openness and truth that I had faithfully followed and listened to every Sunday did not reflect the views and actions of the hierarchy either in Ireland or in the Vatican. Like many people of faith I found this not just challenging but chilling.\u0026nbsp\n  As I embarked on a legal career in human rights law I spent many days hearing story after story of adults recalling their experiences of abuse and brutal actions at the hands of clergy and lay people at the Residential Institutions Redress Board.\u0026nbsp\n  Those stories will never leave me. Sine then, the full impact of church and state abuse has come through my office door clerical sexual abuse, church authority cover ups, Magdalene laundries, the cruel operation of mother and baby homes, where many single mothers lost their babies to a regime of illegal adoptions and told they had committed a mortal sin. We have been witness to church intolerance towards lone parents, women, advocates of shared education, access to certain healthcare services, separated couples and the LGBT community.\n  And so when I was given a ticket to the Pope\u0026rsquos Mass last weekend I thought long and hard about attending. I could see that for many people of faith this was an opportunity to gather as a church community and celebrate their faith, their God and their Christianity.\u0026nbsp\n  On the other hand I could see that for many victims of the Church the Pope\u0026rsquos visit resurrected those deep seated and enduring feelings of hurt, trauma and damage that has never been properly addressed with actions.\u0026nbsp\n  So many victims have said to me that the abuse itself is not nearly as bad as the culture of cover up, the systemic efforts to sideline and disbelieve victims, to hide evidence and wrongdoers from a process that would lead to truth, justice and love for the victim and their families.\u0026nbsp\n  So I ended up last Sunday foregoing the papal Mass and standing for truth with nearly 10,000 other citizens in Dublin City Centre. It was a personal choice. I am glad now I made that choice. I am sad that the Vatican and the leadership of the Church still don\u0026rsquot get it. Still don\u0026rsquot acknowledge that abuse wasn\u0026rsquot simply perpetrated on children by individual wrongdoers but that their many violations were facilitated, covered up and enabled by Bishops, Archbishops and Cardinals all the way to the Vatican.\n  Ireland has changed utterly since 1979. It is reflected in all the societal changes that have taken place in the last thirty nine years. It is reflected in the fact that the people of Dublin were much more interested and welcoming of the Queen than the Pope.\u0026nbsp\n  It turns out that Pope John Paul was wrong when he said back in 1979 that he loved the young people of Ireland.

This year the RUAS are delighted to welcome Paul Trapp, who is travelling from Wisconsin, USA, to judge. The event is also a great chance to interact with 200 dairy related trade exhibitors on the most relevant technological advances, difficulties and solutions in the industry. \u0026nbsp\n  Rhonda Geary, Operations Director, RUAS said: \u0026ldquo2015 saw the move of Winter Fair to our new purpose built exhibition venue, Eikon Exhibition Centre at Balmoral Park. The move has worked brilliantly and attracted one of the largest attendances to date. In preparation for the 31st Winter Fair we have increased the livestock accommodation and now have stalling, washing and milking facilities for 200 cattle. There is 4750m2 of exhibition space and a full house of 200 trade stands. \u0026nbsp\n  During the Winter Fair there is a busy Seminar Suite with talks presented every half hour from 11am until 3.30pm.\n  Dr. John Bailey from AFBI will speak about better phosphorous management, Bobby Irwin of United Feeds presents a paper on getting the lactation to the right start and Roberta Simmons of the YFCU and Barclay Bell, President of the UFU will speak about succession on farms.\n  CAFRE\u0026rsquos Martin Mulholland will be advising on feed efficiency this winter, making optimum use of grass silage \u0026nbspwhile Christopher Osborne form the UFU will speak about dairy commodity markets and the prospects for 2017.\n  Dr. Sam Strain and Sharon Verner from the Animal Health and Welfare Northern Ireland will look at improved biosecurity and BVD while Jessica Sloss from Red Tractor, speaks about the farm assurance scheme.\n  The live calf rearing demonstration will be making a return for the 2016 Show. \u0026nbspGorteade Cow Care owned by Barry O\u0026rsquoLoughlin will be displaying a fully functioning calf igloo with veranda and Heatwave ad lib calf feeder.\u0026nbsp\n  One of the innovative technological features at next week\u0026rsquos Winter Fair will be the Northern Ireland launch of the CalfApp and Calf Cloud by Volac which won gold at Eurotier in Hannover. It gives information about changes in drinking pattern and fluid intakes and monitors calf health.\n  The launch of the Winter Fair was held at Draynes Farm, near Lisburn, where Michael Drayne led a tour of agricultural journalists and industry representatives around his farm and milk bottling plant. The milk botting plant began when his father began with a horse and cart. Now the business has a fleet of vans distributing milk and dairy produces to customers in four counties. However their products are supplied to customers across Ireland through the Henderson Food Service and other companies.\n  The borehole gives Draynes Farm a constant supply of water which is also useful to soften the mains water for washing.\n  A 50KVA solar panel plant has been installed on the roofs of some of the buildings.\n  Draynes Farm processes 5m litres of milk per year and operates Monday to Friday with their own supply of 1.2 million litres of farm milk held over the weekend until the beginning of a new week. A total of 35 staff are employed in all departments.\n  The Draynes Farm dairy herd uses three Lely Astronaut A4 milking robots. The cows visit the robots on average 3.1 times per day averaging 33 litres per day with some exceeding 50litres. Cows grazed outdoors using a Lely Grazeway \u0026nbsp\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.
