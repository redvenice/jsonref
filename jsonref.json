Tom Jenkins has been taking an enforced break from action photography and pursuing a different kind of vision in his gardenI have never appreciated my back garden so much.At this time of year, I’m usually caught up with all the to-ings and fro-ings of the sporting world: taking photos of traditional spring events like the Boat Race and Grand National, or key matches as the football season builds to a crescendo. Normally I’m away a lot, not really passing an eye over developments in my garden. But this is not a normal year.It was mid-March, and I was sitting despondently in my tiny postage stamp of a garden. The previous week I had photographed the Cheltenham festival, an event I associate with the end of winter, spring coming, the light getting better. A chance to look ahead to a summer of sport, going to events that I love. But this year, the festival had felt all wrong – more like a dangerous party on the eve of war. It seemed all around me the news was harrowing, and sport was getting hammered as event after event was cancelled. My world had suddenly been turned upside-down.I realised then that I had to reframe and refocus. With all my normal avenues for taking pictures closed off, I needed to find something else. I recalled the words of Ed Jackson, a former professional rugby player whose portrait I had taken exactly a year earlier. After suffering an awful accident that had left him partially paralysed, he had developed a mental process to cope with his new situation: focus on what’s in front of you, focus on things you can affect, and try to forget what’s out of your control.Remembering this, I looked round the edge of the tiny piece of lawn and noticed some tulip bulbs that my wife had planted in terracotta pots. Lush green leaves with buds full of promise had emerged from the soil, ready to bloom. In these plants, I saw hope. I saw normality.It occurred to me then that this process of growth and positivity deserved to be documented. Despite the global madness, nature was thriving – and these tulips seemed to be begging me to tell their story. To me, photography is more than just a career: it is my passion, and in these flowers I found the perfect opportunity to take pictures without leaving my home.To test myself, I decided not to use any of my main professional cameras. These are more used to the hurly-burly of sport, all fast focusing and speedy motor-drive. Instead, I turned to what I call my “holiday camera”, an upmarket point-and-shoot that I take away on trips with the family (the last thing I want on holiday is to be surrounded by items associated with work, many of which are heavy). Light, easy to manoeuvre around the plants, and – most crucially – able to focus close-up, this small camera actually turned out to be perfect for this project.As the sun moved round the garden during the day, backgrounds became dark and shadows on the flowers created gorgeous patterns. I would note which times were best to photograph certain plants, and would periodically drop whichever household task I was doing (much to the irritation of my family) to race to the garden and catch the flowers in the perfect light.Like all photographers, I look to light as another tool in the box, an opportunity to create something different. By varying angles, I could make petals look like paper, tightly bunched flower heads look like lips. Going in tight, I attempted to show the beauty of the flowers in a surreal way. The warm spring sunshine of the last few weeks had not only ushered the tulips into full bloom but enhanced their colour and vibrancy, so some of my photographs gained an almost unearthly quality.I’ve never felt so lucky to have my garden, this tiny oasis in densely crowded north London. In the land of quarantine, my house has never felt more like a castle, defending me from the warzone outside the front gate. In that castle, my garden is the green inner sanctum, a place of peace and tranquillity.As I sit here now, in the sunshine, I hear birdsong and the rustling of leaves, with the chirruping of children playing wafting in on the breeze. The sky above my head is free from planes and pollution and a brilliant blue. The sun, bright and sharp at this time of year, makes everything look crisp. In times like these, we remember that nature truly is life-affirming, and the simple act of flowers growing means so much. It shows that in an abnormal world, normality is king."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65fbc339c4c225f301e4f50cef255ac2ea736415/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b76970621d6e1de69c575da67b202bc1","title":"sainsburys man at top steps down panic buying revenues mike coupe","story":"Mike Coupe is preparing to deliver Sainsbury’s annual results on Thursday, his last presentation to investors as head of Britain’s second biggest supermarket chain. After almost six years at the top, the 59-year-old is retiring on 31 May, and will hand over to Simon Roberts, the group’s retail and operations director.You wonder how Roberts might be feeling about that. Few could have predicted the challenges facing the retailer, and the country, when Coupe’s departure was announced in January – just as Public Health England was declaring that the risk to the British public from coronavirus was low.Yet Sainsbury’s upcoming results will not show much evidence of that sales boost, given they cover the 12 months to 7 March. It was only in the final fortnight of that period that frantic stockpiling of toilet paper and store-cupboard essentials such as pasta began in the run-up to the government lockdown.Analysts forecast that Sainsbury’s will have made £584m in underlying profits before tax over the past year – higher than the previous year, when it was hit by one-off costs related to its attempted merger with Walmart-owned Asda.Sainsbury’s will also tell its investors how it expects trade to be affected by the lockdown. Supermarkets should be enjoying a purple patch, as consumers queue outside stores and flock online to buy groceries.Analysts and investors will be closely watching the announcement about the retailer’s idend. The group will be well aware of the criticism that met Tesco’s decision to pay out £635m to shareholders, having received a similar-sized handout from the government by way of a business rates holiday for the rest of the year.Since the coronavirus crisis began, Coupe has become a regular correspondent in his customers’ inboxes, urging them not to stockpile, reassuring them about the availability of groceries and explaining social distancing measures in stores.As his tenure comes to an end, he will be best remembered for the deal he didn’t manage to pull off – the intended merger with Asda – rather than the one he did: the acquisition of the catalogue retailer Argos. But although he will probably leave Sainsbury’s with the share price lower than when he took over in 2014, the boost to the supermarket’s online capabilities from the Argos deal may have helped it cope with the virus-induced demand for deliveries.The anticipated recession will bring more challenges for Sainsbury’s under its new boss. Analysts warn that cash-strapped consumers will start searching out cheaper alternatives, and may switch to discounters Aldi and Lidl, while a fall in disposable incomes could hit discretionary spending at Argos. Supermarkets have performed comparatively well during the lockdown, but the longer this crisis drags on, the more difficult it will be for grocers to avoid its economic consequences."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d9af0c979530bede9f653402e9e295122ef9d9c/409_603_4961_2977/master/4961.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a3a7dc95902374ea4bf99c5e304b9ee","title":"lift the lockdown on the say so of a tory with an empathy bypass no thanks catherine bennett","story":"Far too many are making a ‘commonsense’ case for relaxing restrictionsThe quiet stoicism of some Conservative MPs. “We have to accept a little bit of risk,” says Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, the treasurer of the 1922 Committee. This group of predominantly middle-aged men is defiant in the face of the deaths that could follow an accelerated easing of lockdown, which it supports for economic reasons. “That inevitably will mean that there will be, at each time, more coronavirus cases. And we just have to accept that,” Clifton-Brown has said.Is he well cast as the reaper’s apprentice? Perhaps, if you accept that Clifton-Brown’s tolerance of possibly large-scale virus-hastened exits may be perfectly reconcilable with his vote against assisted dying. Until last week, the main thing one remembered about this MP was an altercation at last year’s Tory conference, involving a missing pass, “remonstration” and the police being called.Now that he argues on the national stage for increasing the virus’s opportunities, we can recognise the earlier embarrassment as a measure of his sang-froid, given that he is 67, male and, it appears, well-upholstered. Even if they have learned to be more careful than the prime minister, anti-lockdown MPs can’t be sure the virus will know its place and threaten only the workers they want to get back into shops, buses and pubs, along with old and vulnerable people nobody can see. If seclusion in the Cotswolds can preserve Clifton-Brown, Covid-19 could still kill his Tory constituents. Though what you don’t see, maybe you don’t miss. Clifton-Brown was last yearranked 650th – the worst MP in the country – in Change.org’s people-power index.If he can’t convince the public that their lives have become unacceptably overpriced, other prominent allies have, mercifully for the virus, stepped up. Luke Johnson, somehow restored to business sagedom since the collapse, amid allegations of fraud and the loss of hundreds of jobs at his Patisserie Valerie chain, has scorned “an exaggerated fear of falling ill from the coronavirus and dying – we have idled the nation and all become hypochondriacs”. A likeminded commentator, Allison Pearson, points out that Britain came through diphtheria epidemics with loads of infant deaths: “Let’s be brave.” The Spectator’s Toby Young concluded, as Downing Street aides reportedly did at first, that the cost of lockdown, prolonging “the lives of a few hundred thousand mostly elderly people is an irresponsible use of taxpayers’ money”. He was entitled to say so, Young pointed out, since he himself had the virus: “My death would be acceptable collateral damage.”Happily, there’s no way of assessing this offer, since Young is still with us and his wife thinks he was never infected. “He is a complete hypochondriac at the best of times,” she writes, “and this pandemic has sent his anxiety levels through the roof.”Actual survivors, including Dominic Minghella and the Times’s Roger Boyes, have, however, in horrifying accounts of being hospitalised, with no visits permitted, allowed us to glimpse what being part of a rational economic sacrifice feels like. Minghella began farewell letters to his children. “This virus is releasing the demons of the night,” Boyes wrote  afterwards. It’s possible that his fellow patient Boris Johnson, having learned that libertarianism does not confer immunity, is now less likely to deplore action on the virus, “beyond what is medically rational to the point of doing real and unnecessary economic damage”.Descriptions of pitifully small funerals, the only type currently allowed, bring home the kind of bereavement, without even the consolation of relations, friends and proper mourning, that yet more families will experience if the 1922 Committee, supported by various Marcus Aurelius fans, is prematurely allowed its “little bit of risk”.The  reported on one such farewell last week, that of Eddie Goodall, who died on 5 April at the age of 83, having caught Covid-19 in hospital. Once, his family would have expected 300 or 400 people at his funeral. “To look at all the empty pews, it was devastating,” his daughter said.How different it might be if people would adopt, as urged by Jonathan Sumption, the former supreme court judge, historian, BBC Reith lecturer and furious opponent of lockdown, a more resigned attitude to earthly sorrow. Attributing the existing lockdown to “hysteria” – the scholarly term for health and safety gone mad – the QC says that previous generations, subjected to worse plagues, would not have understood all the fuss. We have acquired “an irrational horror of death”, he says. “In the midst of life, our ancestors lived with death, an ever-present fact that they understood and accommodated.”Evidently Sumption would have had a thing or two to say to, for instance, Orpheus, irrationally rushing off to Hades or to that other antique snowflake Achilles, screaming over Patroclus to inconsolable authors from Cicero to CS Lewis, who ignorantly refused to accept that they lived in times of exemplary submission, the QC says, to “the wheel of fortune”. Even Philippe Ariès, the historian of death, with his insistence on ancestral equanimity, seems to have conceded, unlike Sumption, that more recognisable expressions of loss had crept in by the time Shakespeare came up with “the funeral bak’d meats did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables”.If there’s a kind of bizarre merit to Sumption’s open indifference to other people’s agony, when compared with Clifton-Brown’s euphemisms and Michael Gove’s reported wish to “run things quite hot”, you can’t help wondering if such colossal failures of fellow feeling might blind leading stoics to the very arguments likely to achieve their economic purpose. Fearful people also crave comfort and companionship. What we won’t contemplate because a former cake-shop magnate says it’s economically mandated, and because Horrible Histories proves the olden days were worse, we may accept out of longing for family and friends. When it’s time to make the case for emergence from lockdown, and the deaths and funerals that follow, they might want to try getting it done by a human."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3c23e1aeca73bd387912cfcb1129567da7438cc/1214_0_4911_2947/master/4911.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4be1da142503ec2594dd28ca58ac1b37","title":"dont despair if your child is glued to a screen it may be keeping them sane","story":"Social interaction is vital for young minds, and social media might be the only way of achieving this during lockdownShould we start to use “physical distancing” instead of “social distancing”? Those keen on the change argue that, despite being physically apart, we can still be socially together. So we can connect and support each other even when avoiding unnecessary face-to-face contact.Sure, change the label. But it won’t change the reality of what might well be a long period of curtailed social interaction with anyone outside our own home, a reality that’s especially significant for children and young people.Social contact and stimulation shape our lives from the very start. By the time they’re a few months old, infants start engaging with the social world around them, participating first in the simplest of interactions through gestures and facial expressions. From then on our lives are governed by our surroundings: they determine how we learn, develop and feel.Harrowing animal research studied by undergraduate psychology students around the world illustrates how the deprivation of social contact in childhood and adolescence can have negative effects on development that extend long into adulthood.So how concerned should we be about the current lockdown and how it might be affecting children and adolescents? First, it’s important to recognise that most of them will not be spending lockdown deprived of all social contact, as in the animal studies, but in close interaction with their family. What they are specifically locked away from is social contact with their peers.The importance of peer contact changes across development. Infants and children mainly depend on attention given by parents or caretakers, with the importance of peer contact growing from that point onwards, probably reaching its maximum importance in adolescence. At this age, you are focused on your peers. In turn, peer approval becomes especially influential in shaping decisions and behaviour, as adolescents start probing their place in a maturing social world.While there is so far only minimal research on the lockdown, one could easily hypothesise that adolescents might suffer especially. The evidence that we do have – colleagues and I are currently immersed in research on the theme – seems to point in that direction. While a study of 60,000 people in lockdown by University College London did not survey under-18s, it found that the youngest in the sample (18- to 24-year-olds) were suffering most, showing the highest levels of loneliness and feeling down, while those over 60 were showing the highest levels of life satisfaction. Anecdotal evidence from parents reinforces the view that it is often teenagers most struggling with being apart from their friends. And we know that most mental health problems first appear during adolescence.And yet, on the upside, we are also living in a time when society is more digitally connected than ever. Technologies such as social media, video call applications, group chats or social video games offer contact without us having to be in physical proximity.At least some of the positive consequences of face-to-face social interaction can be mimicked through digital means. Digital interactions can make us feel less socially excluded and aspects of socialising via technologies have been shown to activate reward systems in our brain.With contact being so important to adolescents, it’s therefore unsurprising that over the last decades they have often been among the first widespread users of these social technologies. And now, the potential of these digital innovations to mitigate some of the negative consequences of children and adolescents separated from their friends should not be underestimated.Many parents are worried, of course, about how their children’s screen time is going through the roof during this crisis. But now more than ever we need to stop considering as a valuable metric the simple time spent on screens. Screens are not drugs that have definite impacts on brain and behaviour indeed, high-quality evidence that screens themselves do widespread harm is almost non-existent.We should instead focus on what activities are engaged in via these screens. It’s the nature of the activities that screens help mediate that determines how we are affected by their use. When we’re sitting across from someone staring at a digital screen for long periods of time, the ersity of activities they they’re engaged in is often not apparent. So we might judge the use uniform and monotonous.So I encourage parents to worry less about time spent by their children on screens and instead focus on what they’re doing with them. Activities such as video calling friends, exchanges via social media or playing Fortnite with friends online will all help keep children and teenagers connected throughout the lockdown.Yet this also puts a spotlight on the digital ide that still affects Britain today, with children in disadvantaged households – without their own personal technological equipment or a high-speed internet connection – experiencing an additional setback, another expression of our inequalities. In the circumstances, our youngest have never been more in need of digitised connection.• Dr Amy Orben is research fellow at Emmanuel College, University of Cambridge and the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5842cd69da4ad8aec3e213e824f89b0502cea37a/43_0_2100_1260/master/2100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3eb087a80f5caf5d422a0087ae3f3049","title":"how a lockdown stroll taught me the true value of danny dyer","story":"Random perambulations resulted in a secret tryst between the Dork Diaries, Danny Dyer and meDuring my mandated morning meanderings my mind returns to one of my favourite books, Arthur Machen’s 1924 non-novel, The London Adventure. Alternatively titled The Art of Wandering, the absurd work is 96 years old but has never felt more contemporary. The haughty writer-narrator, newly bound by the responsibility of fatherhood, must now write for money rather than art, “a prostitution of the soul compared with which the prostitution of the body is a little thing”.Once again Machen mentors me down the tin-can telephone of time. The gaily lit theatres where I plied my trade are darkened. Like the author of The London Adventure, accepting a contracted word count from an unspecified “young man in spectacles” in a Fleet Street tavern on a January afternoon in 1921, with no idea how to fill it, I am now driven to flood this newspaper sewer for money. Though it is “a degradation somewhat below those experienced by the procurers of Soho”, nonetheless, like Machen, I walk my daily allowance, waiting to glimpse the great god Nodens in his great green masquerade.I spent the first month of lockdown refusing to participate in the daily outdoor exercise hour, as a protest against the Brexiters and their incompetence. Has Matt Handcock looked behind the bins for the Turkish PPE? Or maybe it has been left with a neighbour, or just on the doorstep, by a fleeing Amazon delivery person wrapped up in bin bags. Perhaps Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s “while you were out” note blew away.(Note to self. Conspiracy theorists think China invented the virus to secure economic dominance. By this logic Amazon’s Jeff Bezos must have grown it, like an evil dill, in the soft ring of moist skin surrounding his tax-avoiding anus, and then smeared it on every parcel his slaves service, full spectrum delivery dominance within his grasp, the Fu Manchu of superfluous packaging materials.)But now I am doing my daily 10,000 steps. My exercise strike was as ineffective a gesture against Handcock as the dirty protest that has annoyed my nauseated family so thoroughly, though the cats enjoy stalking the attendant flies, and the manure is good for growing indoor edibles, like dill for example. Thankfully, the world of my walks is one of wonder. I nibble my dill, and Danny Dyer’s face scowls out from a plastic box of ponies and fairies. But wait, old friend. I am getting ahead of myself.Every morning, not five minutes from the place I have called home for a quarter of a century, I find myself Bermuda-triangulated into square miles of unknown side-streets. On page 11 of The London Adventure Machen, still unsure what to write, wanders unvisited London byways “that might have been behind the scenes of the universe … shapeless, unmeaning, dreary, dismal beyond words as if one were journeying past the back wall of an everlasting backyard”. Then, suddenly, an urban fig tree appears, “as blessed as any well in an African desert … This was to be the kind of adventure out of which I had agreed to make this book”.At around 11am I took a random right turn at the shut-up chip shop, noting how the timeless patterns of nature were disrupted. Squawking seagull hordes, which have flown in from the Thames to scavenge at school break times on the doorstep of Pizza-Fish 2000 for centuries, realise there’s no fast food to be found. Instead, the street is silent, and they stay at home, relearning their traditional trade from grey-winged gulls old enough to remember the ancestral fish-catching ways.I found myself walking empty pavements past rows of mid-sized semis, and placed out front of one is a green plastic box of books, presumably free to take, arranged spines upwards. Chiefly they are children’s stories, the My Magical Pony novels of Jenny Oldfield, Renee Russell’s Dork Diaries, and Meg Cabot’s Allie Finkel series. But staring up between these jolly volumes is the angry face of Danny Dyer, whose The World According to Danny Dyer: Life Lessons from the East End is their inexplicable and unexpected bedfellow, my Machen’s fig-tree moment.Had a little girl, who normally read about ponies and dorks, somehow misused her birthday book voucher to buy The World According to Danny Dyer: Life Lessons from the East End? Had she been horrified by the questions Dyer answers, such as “Where have all the old school boozers gone?”, “Are there such things as ghosts?” and “Am I middle class?”? Did the book include the suggestion, given in Dyer’s 2010 Zoo magazine agony column, that you should cut your ex’s face, “so that no one will want her”?Had the shock of a child’s encounter with Dyer, and the young reader’s realisation that, yes, she probably was middle class, resulted in the sudden rejection of not only The World According to Danny Dyer: Life Lessons from the East End, but of all books? Or did some belatedly resentful father, far from his own cockney roots, displaced to the environs of the liberal elite, inflict Dyer’s thoughts, on ghosts and on pub, on his innocent daughter, to burst her out of “The Bubble”?I dropped my dill laughing. I could feel an interminable 20 minute standup bit, hell maybe even a whole two-hour show, forming, and took a photo of the box as notes towards my post-Covid comeback. And then I realised. Random perambulations had given me the gift of this private epiphany, a secret tryst between the Dork Diaries, Danny Dyer and me. I would never mention it for money, like the whorish writers Machen despised.But what to write about instead? On page 137 of The London Adventure, five pages from the end, Machen begins to “reflect very seriously” that he still does not have any idea what to write about. Then someone sent me a link to the video for the new single from Oozing Wound, Surrounded By Fucking Idiots, and I thought maybe I should write about that instead. But it was too late."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3409e496addebb0ebbd37033e53b67d3c4b6ea4/0_66_3040_1825/master/3040.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=029423e16ee8b253a4f7127949920a2d","title":"wage inequality is the price society pays for grammar schools torsten bell","story":"The gap between high and low earners is most pronounced in grammar areasSome terrible ideas are brand new, such as injecting disinfectant.

That’s what recent research did by examining grammar schools’ impact on wage inequality.The paper finds that it is significantly higher for those growing up in local areas where grammars are present – lower earners from grammar areas earn less than those elsewhere, while higher earners earn more.This effect is big, with the school system explaining a quarter of the gap between low and high earners. So while the political consensus has been to raise the minimum wage and reduce earnings gaps, grammar schools push in the opposite direction.The evidence from my household confirms that home schooling is a terrible idea, but that problem will disappear at some point.

The performer Dynamo says we need it now more than everMidnight in Tokyo. I’m standing in a narrow alleyway behind one of the hostess clubs in the capital’s red-light district. A large screen displays live updates of the gender balance inside, currently: ladies 113, men 87. Just around the corner is a famous hangout of the yakuza gangs, where a few months earlier there was a bloody shootout and a Korean crime boss was killed.Dynamo, one of the world’s most successful magicians, is used to performing in edgy atmospheres: he’s done street magic for gang members in LA’s Compton, and illicit tricks in Saudi Arabia where magic and the supernatural are banned and punishable by 40 lashes. But Tokyo is the one he’s always dreamed of, especially after he saw Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift in his 20s – a film that includes the immortal line: “The first drifters invented drifting out here in the mountains by feeling it. So feel it!”We’re not really in any danger. These days the area is frequented by tourists searching for a sanitised version of seedy and, besides, we’re with a crowd of people 15 deep. But magic has always thrived on the impression of peril. The most popular early illusions involved sawing women in half or being shackled while submerged in water. More recently magicians, such as David Blaine, have tried to push the human body to its limit. Derren Brown has managed to raise the stakes further not just by appearing to endanger his own life, as he did when he played Russian roulette on live TV, but those of his subjects. In his 2016 Netflix special Pushed to the Edge he appears to coerce a member of the public, who doesn’t know he’s being manipulated or filmed, into pushing someone off a roof to their apparent death.But, increasingly, the idea of making a spectacle out of death and misery seems out of step with our post-truth world. What does it mean, for example, to be able to guess what someone is thinking when Cambridge Analytica was able to make seemingly astonishing guesses about people’s political persuasion, and facial recognition software can link millions of people to their private information? British science fiction writer Arthur C Clarke famously wrote that “any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic”, a statement normally considered to be about the wonder of scientific advancement – but it could also be about the redundancy of magicians.Some of the answers to this potentially existential crisis for magic have been less than satisfactory. Techno-illusionist Marco Tempest, a director’s fellow at MIT’s Media Lab, gives magic demonstrations to rapturous audiences of billionaires at places like Davos, using augmented reality and interactive projections in a bid to outpace technology. But the problem is that Tempest’s demonstrations from even five years ago, when he made drones react to his movements or a robot perform simple sleight of hand, now look entirely unremarkable – already superseded by the automotive dystopias on the Boston Dynamics YouTube channel.“The technology that comes out is so fascinating and moving at such a rapid pace that it’s so hard to comprehend what is going to be out in the future,” says Dynamo when I ask whether people are more amazed by human magicians or virtual achievements. “But I don’t think there’s any piece of technology out there that is more advanced and can grow more than the human mind. The technology that’s getting developed, it starts off as an idea in someone’s head. And that’s what magic is. It’s taking something that just starts in your mind and bringing it to life.”Indeed, the magicians that seem to be doing best are those who have moved beyond the idea of illusion in these untrustworthy times. On Magic for Humans with Justin Willman, a big Netflix show, one of the most interesting tricks is explained in its entirety before it begins. Willman explains that he has hired an audience of stooges for a magic show in a park and then waits for one unsuspecting man to join them, who he picks “randomly” as a volunteer and says he’s going to make him disappear. He doesn’t do anything, just chucks a blanket over his head and pulls it off again, but the fake audience reacts as if he’s gone, so he believes he has. The magic comes in watching a person – waving in people’s faces and getting no reaction – believe they have truly become invisible.Even those that once made a living out of can-you-believe-it stunts are moving away from illusion. Brown’s most recent Netflix special was all about teaching a man who harboured racist views enough empathy to take a bullet for someone of Mexican descent, with Brown relying more on a combination of psychological techniques than showpiece stunts. The final five minutes involved no magic at all, instead letting a moral argument play out between two of his advisers about whether they had a responsibility to resign from the programme if Brown refused to take his own safety seriously. The question of these shows becomes not “How did he do it?” but “Should he do it?”Gustav Kuhn, a former magician turned psychology professor, has spearheaded examination of magic as a field of science. He’s interested in the places magic, clinical psychology and the modern world overlap. In one recent study, for example, he got a “medium” to claim they were talking to the dead relatives of an audience of undergraduate students. Using magical trickery, he was able to guess correctly some of the things the students were thinking.“The sheer number of people, and these are Goldsmiths undergraduates, who believe what they’re seeing is true really shocked me. What’s even more frightening is that even if you tell someone what they’re seeing is a magician who is using deception, they still believe what they are seeing is true. It’s alarming how easily people are led to believe things that are impossible.”This, he says, has a big impact on the way we think about fake news. It’s not merely enough to tell people it isn’t real, to factcheck – people ignore that information. Only when we are told how a trick is done do we stop believing in it, as the Goldsmiths students eventually were.For Dynamo, the distorted dangers of magic and the jeopardy of real life have become inexorably linked. Just a few years ago it seemed he might never make it to Japan. Having suffered with Crohn’s disease his whole life, in 2014 a complication caused by a bout of food poisoning meant he was hospitalised for months with chronic pain and a series of worsening symptoms, including arthritis that affected every joint in his body and meant even some basic tasks, never mind sleight of hand, were impossible.While we’re waiting for shooting to reset, he tells me that although he experienced “the worst pain ever” during those months, he never lost focus on magic – coming up with more than 250 tricks and even learning Japanese from his hospital bed. When he was eventually discharged, he was followed home by paparazzi. He didn’t want photos of him appearing unexplained, so he posted a video outlining his condition. In it he looked unrecognisable, his face and body bloated and swollen, a result of the medication. But with the help of rehabilitation he was able to relearn the fundamentals of his craft. Now, at 37, he’s finally made it to Japan. When he arrived a few days earlier, he was met by hundreds of screaming fans at the airport, a sign of his global appeal (he’d just come off a 145-date live tour, selling out arenas from Cardiff to Cape Town). Now he says he worries less about the damage trickery can do and thinks more about the hope it can inspire.He was raised in what he describes as “quite a broken home”. His father was in jail for most of his young life. He was close to his mother, but she was only 16 when she had him and was also trying to sort her own life out. He was raised by his grandparents and great- grandparents, but says he mostly spent a lot of time alone, on his Bradford council estate. Once he got to school, he was bullied relentlessly, in part because of his size, but also his father’s Pakistani heritage. “I was beaten up quite a bit, because I went to quite a racist school – being of mixed background, you know. My mum’s English so a lot of people now wouldn’t necessarily know, but it is kind of obvious. I got a real rough time.”His grandfather’s magic manuals and the comic books he used to collect provided an escape route, and he was drawn by the super-powers he found in them. At that age, the magic of fantasy fiction and the trickery of illusion were hard to distinguish. “We didn’t have a TV licence, but the local video store gave me a VHS player. So I used to watch everything. Back then I didn’t comprehend the difference between a documentary and a movie. So I was watching these superhero movies, believing it was a real-life story. That gave me belief in myself, that I wanted to grow up and be like that when I was older. Before magic, I didn’t know who I needed to be, who society wanted me to be as a person. I didn’t totally feel comfortable being myself, because I didn’t feel that I belonged into any particular group. I felt like an outsider.”Dynamo agrees with Kuhn that magic can be powerful, and that power has to be wielded responsibly. But he sees his own belief in superhero-like powers changed his life, and he wants to create the same effect, especially for young working-class Brits who had an upbringing like his.“It’s hard to know what to believe, in this day and age. And whether people want to believe what I’m doing is real magic or skill, it’s totally up to them. But I want to inspire the kid who’s living in Bradford now on a council estate and who feels there’s no opportunity for him. He doesn’t know if the country is going to be in a position to provide for him in the future.”Kuhn is not anti-magic, far from it, but he says we need to understand its power. “There’s an evolutionary drive for us to explore things we don’t understand. A magician like Dynamo has universal appeal because he’s dealing with these raw psychological experiences.”The following day, we head out of the city to a car show in an old racetrack deep in the suburbs. A huge typhoon hit this area a few days earlier, and the whole event was almost cancelled, but instead they’ve made it free to all, so throughout the day families wander around as very rich Japanese men in their early 20s arrive in souped-up muscle cars, find a spot and pop their bonnets to show their engines and the boots to show their sound systems. You can see why Dynamo chose to film here, it’s real-life Tokyo Drift.As night falls, Dynamo gets ready for the big stunt. First, he gets four of the boy racers to line up and try to push him over – the four of them should easily be able to topple him, but as hard as they push, Dynamo is able to hold steady. Then he ups the ante and gets one of the guys, who can’t be older than 20, to get in his sports car and floor it with Dynamo standing right in front. The guy starts revving, first a little, then a lot. Dynamo is holding the car back with his bare hands. The wheels are spinning, the air filling with exhaust, but the car isn’t moving. I can feel my heart racing, too. There are little kids everywhere, if it went wrong it would be a disaster. Suddenly, Dynamo jumps out the way and the car zooms to the other end of the lot within seconds.In the past when I’ve watched these shows, I’ve felt uncomfortable – a good magician is a confidence trickster, someone who makes you believe the impossible. I wonder if there’s really more that differentiates David Blaine and David Icke than the calibre of the company they keep. Kuhn’s research suggests there might not be.Dynamo has tried to change my mind about that. In his vision, the magician is a leveller whose modus operandi is not to take advantage of their audience, but to bring something seemingly impossible into a world that can often feel mundane. Talking to him about his motivation, seeing his big tricks up close, has certainly nudged me towards this lighter view of the dark arts.But it’s after the trick is over, when Dynamo has left and the cameras are packed away, that I become a true convert. I spot the guy whose car it was. He’s still agog, bent over staring at his own tyres, trying to work out what just happened. At one point he just looks up at the sky, as if the answer might be in the stars. I start to believe in the magic of magic.All episodes of Dynamo: Beyond Belief are available on Sky and Now TV"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2b6edcd33211629a765f12561fa0cad06366dde/0_104_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=301d29779a0cc2d1e3b02e5bd71f22d0","title":"degrees of separation can universities adapt in the rush to online learning","story":"A potential £1bn bill now faces the sector, but the real problem will be maintaining quality for students in a radically altered world this SeptemberUK universities need to spend hundreds of millions of pounds to deliver degrees online, with warnings that many are unprepared to deal with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on students’ education.Only around 20 universities are in a good position to provide a range of high-quality online courses by the start of the new academic year in September, according to Prof Sir Tim O’Shea, the former vice-chancellor of Edinburgh University. Some of the country’s top-ranked Russell Group institutions, including Oxford and Cambridge, were not in that category, he added.The warning comes as the sector seeks to expand online education in a bid to offset huge losses from tens of thousands of international students cancelling their studies due to Covid-19. Prolonged social distancing also mean freshers could face a radically different university experience, with no lectures on campus and bars closed.Most universities would face costs of at least £10m to create five or six new online degrees in different faculties, said O’Shea, a leading expert on computer-based learning. This would total well over £1bn across the sector.The costs will add to the financial pressures facing universities, with a report from the University and College Union (UCU) forecastingthat the sector could lose around £2.5bn next year in tuition fees alone if the pandemic continues.O’Shea recommended that universities focus on providing the first-year courses for up to five faculties, at a cost of £3m to £7.5 m. His stark assessment came as Durham University stalled controversial plans to provide online-only degrees and significantly reduce face-to-face lecturing next year. The proposals, drawn up by senior managers and private provider Cambridge Education Group Digital, said lecturers would only need six hours of training, and could create online degree modules in six to 12 weeks.O’Shea described Durham’s proposals as “hopelessly unrealistic”, adding that it was “quite impossible” for universities to deliver new online courses for this September unless they were already running successfully elsewhere. Even those universities with existing online provision would need 12 to 18 months to deliver new courses, he added.Private education firms said they have been inundated with requests from universities to help them deliver online education next year. Online learning platform Coursera has received at least 29,000 inquiries from more than 6,000 universities in 120 countries since the pandemic began.“We’re hearing from lots of universities that are facing major budget cuts, so even if they are planning to move all teaching online, they don’t have the core infrastructure to do this,” said Coursera’s chief enterprise officer, Leah Belsky.Many universities would also balk at sharing student fee revenue with private firms, Morris added. But the costs to universities of developing digital education in-house are huge. The deputy vice-chancellor of Coventry University, Ian Dunn, said it took two years and “tens of millions of pounds” to deliver 19 fully online degrees since 2017.O’Shea ided the UK universities into four categories: those with the capacity and will to develop high-quality online education, including the Open University, King’s College London, Edinburgh, Liverpool, Leeds and Coventry those with the capacity but not the will, such as Oxford and Cambridge those with the will but not the capacity, such as Durham and those with neither the will nor the capacity, such as art schools and music conservatoires.Some subjects, such as the sciences, would be particularly difficult to shift online. The Open University launched its OpenSTEM Labs in 2015, providing students with remote access to laboratories and observatories via remotely-operated robotic instruments. But experts noted that no other UK university has comparable provision.Aris Katzourakis, co-president of the UCU branch at Oxford University, said staff would in many cases not be able to replicate laboratory classes online. The zoology professor added that “these elements will not be taught to students to the same level”.In a blog this month on the impact of the coronavirus on higher education, the former universities minister, Jo Johnson, wrote that the crisis has exposed how many UK universities lagged behind their international competitors in developing online learning and were “clearly scrambling to provide anything resembling a coherent online offering”. Martin Weller, professor of educational technology at the Open University, said there was a danger that university senior managers underestimated the difficulty of delivering learning online.Weller said lecturers have told him they have been given a week’s notice to put their course online, and a fortnight to develop a digital strategy. He said: “A danger might be that we see a backlash against online learning because people rush to do it and it’s done badly.”Diana Laurillard, professor of learning with digital technologies at University College London’s Institute of Education, said the shift to online learning required a complete overhaul of traditional higher education. One-hour lectures and workshops would need to be broken up into smaller 10-20 minute webinars, interspersed with practical exercises, question-and-answer sessions and discussion groups.A spokeswoman for the National Union of Students said: “It is obvious that, regardless of quality, online learning simply cannot replicate the laboratory-based or practical learning of many courses.”An Oxford University spokeswoman said its staff have rapidly “bought into the idea that we can deliver teaching and assessment entirely remotely”.Prof Graham Virgo, senior pro-vice-chancellor of education at Cambridge University, said it had taken steps to increase online learning, including a partnership with private education firm edX. He added: “The university is developing ambitious plans to expand its online provision.”Prof Stuart Corbridge, vice-chancellor of Durham University, said it was preparing to teach all courses on campus in September “while also ensuring that teaching can go online if there is a lockdown later in the year or in 2021”.A Department for Education spokeswoman said it was “delighted to see so many providers developing innovative ways of providing quality education, online and remotely”.Marcus Matthews, a final-year history student at the University of Southampton.“It has been quite disappointing, specifically from my faculty, the extent of the response to this crisis, although my degree has limited contact time anyway – it is mainly discussions in the two two-hour sessions we have per week.“In order to replace this, all we are now doing is posting at least three comments on an online discussion board per session. It is now a case of ‘do the reading, post your comments’. There appears to be no form of moderation.“This decision was made without consultation with students, and also the faculty stressed in an email to bear with the staff as they are having to deal with new technology such as ‘phone, Skype and Microsoft Teams’.“This is at a Russell Group uni. There is effectively no incentive to partake in this online learning, as it is in such a simple and condescending format with no consequence if we do it or not. As of this week, only one student has contributed, with one comment. It has effectively ruined the last five weeks of learning of what otherwise would have been an interesting module.” Rachel Hall"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f48f074c4aee1807440a7197ee9b47785a32ec9d/0_107_3261_1957/master/3261.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c2c7b8602e4c4210046cebb5172c6d4","title":"birds join chorus of approval as wildlife thrives in a quieter world","story":"Deer roam city streets and hedgehogs can safely cross roads… but a radical policy shift is needed to protect wildlife in future, say campaigners Britain’s wildlife may be thriving during the current lockdown but its long-term future is looking bleak, according to leading conservation organisations.Nikki Williams, head of campaigns at the Wildlife Trusts, said: “The current crisis means nature is losing out, because many organisations are having to scale back important work caring for special places, which they usually do with the vital help of thousands of volunteers.”Just one example, she said, was the continual battle with the invasive plant Himalayan balsam, which smothers riverbanks and out-competes native wildflowers. If left to its own devices over the summer, this plant will be even harder to eradicate next year.Meanwhile, valuable habitats, such as lowland heaths in southern England and East Anglia, need continual management to ensure they do not turn back into scrub, reducing the opportunities for specialised creatures such as the Dartford warbler, sand lizard and smooth snake.While staff and volunteers are unable to do the majority of conservation work, they are still able to carry out surveys, for example of breeding birds, many of which are run by the British Trust for Ornithology.One noticeable phenomenon of late has been the daily chorus of birdsong, especially in the heart of our cities.Mathew Frith, of the London Wildlife Trust, said: “Many of our birds, such as the robin, wren, chiffchaff, skylark and meadow pipit, nest on or close to the ground, and so are easily flushed by dogs. With parks so much quieter than usual, these species may do well this spring.”The RSPB also notes that the lack of people visiting the seaside will help shore-nesting species such as little terns and ringed plovers, which are especially prone to being disturbed by holidaymakers.As well as the possible benefits to birds of the current reduction in noise and disturbance, some animals also appear to be flourishing. There have been reports of goats roaming the streets of Llandudno, and fallow deer in the east London suburbs, along with numerous sightings of normally shy mammals such as moles, stoats and weasels.The lack of traffic is especially helpful for mammals that are vulnerable to being run over by vehicles, such as hedgehogs and badgers.The big question for conservationists is what will happen when lockdown restrictions are lifted. Any short-term gains made by wildlife may vanish once people, traffic and other aspects of daily life returned to some kind of “normal”, but if our habits do permanently change, as many people are hoping, nature might reap the benefit.But that will also depend on pushing through recent shifts in government policy, as the Wildlife Trusts’ Williams points out. “When the crisis ends, wildlife will still be in decline. The only way to ensure its recovery is to create strong agriculture and environment bills, which put nature, and all the benefits it brings, at the heart of policy and our daily lives.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02a69102a45fbe5bcab38ce5efd44c65eec1face/0_23_5349_3209/master/5349.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9db338a45360870bde84b4b9d4c6a9d6 2020w","title":"astronaut review richard dreyfuss space drama shelagh mcleod","story":"Richard Dreyfuss holds together an earthbound tale of an old widower who dreams of a voyage to the starsAmid the pressures of the current crisis, we could all use some uplifting, unchallenging, bittersweet sentimentality. That’s exactly what’s on offer from Astronaut, a film with a small budget, a big heart and an A-list Hollywood star blessed with enough twinkly charisma to pull off a potentially preposterous role. More at home on a TV screen than it perhaps would have seemed in cinemas, this wistful drama from Shelagh McLeod (her directorial feature debut) may not be earth-shattering, yet it retains the power to charm, thanks in large part to a central performance by Richard Dreyfuss that ranks among his best work.Dreyfuss is Angus Stewart, a retired and recently widowed civil engineer who always dreamed of becoming an astronaut. Ailing with age, Angus has moved in with his daughter Molly (Krista Bridges), a development that hardly delights Molly’s husband, Jim (Lyriq Bent). Secretive Jim is dealing with down-to-earth problems of his own and has no time for talk of stars or wishes. But young son Barney (Richie Lawrence) is delighted to have Grandpa around, sharing his sense of wonder at the magical comet that lights up the sky, adding a fairytale element to the drama. “People have been looking up at the stars for ever,” Angus tells Barney, “and I think it’s always for the same reason: to see where we belong”.Angus clearly doesn’t belong in Molly’s house (“He said he didn’t want to be a burden,” snaps an overheard Jim) nor indeed in the Sundown Valley retirement home, which plays the kind of relaxing music that drove Jack Nicholson to distraction in One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest. Indeed, the only place Angus feels at home is in his dreams of space travel – dreams that could become a reality thanks to a TV lottery organised by billionaire Marcus Brown (Colm Feore) to win a once-in-a-lifetime seat on a commercial spacecraft. Angus may be too old and too infirm to qualify but, in the whimsical, wish-fulfilment world of McLeod’s film, he still has a shot.We know from the outset that this very modest drama has neither the resources nor the desire to turn into a space-travel extravaganza. Indeed, Angus (who once specialised in fixing roads and runways) soon becomes more concerned with the earthbound safety issues Marcus seems to have ignored than in his own rather foolish attempts to win a seat on the ship. Could it be that Angus’s place is down on the ground after all?There are plot holes wider than lunar craters. Could Angus really have made it on to the spaceflight shortlist with just a hastily acquired fake ID, even if Barney does insist that he “could look 65”? Would Marcus really be this cavalier about a mission into which he has sunk so much time and money? And how likely is it that Angus’s particular area of expertise would align quite so neatly with a critical plot development?But to focus on credibility gaps is to miss the point of the story, which (despite the title) has very little to do with space travel. Dreyfuss has compared Angus to Roy Neary, the character he played in Close Encounters of the Third Kind, suggesting that this is what might have become of Roy had he not climbed aboard that alien spacecraft all those years ago. It’s an astute observation, not least because it reaffirms that the main journey here is internal rather than external. Spielberg’s movie may have been a jaw-dropping cinematic spectacle but it was the sight of Dreyfuss obsessively building a mountain from mashed potato that became its defining image.Similarly in Astronaut, it’s not the hokey space-lottery plot that matters but Dreyfuss’s face as he listens to a doctor telling him to “keep up the good fight, Angus, because what’s the alternative?” Later, in a scene filled with verbose small talk, we observe Dreyfuss listening to a chirpy retirement-home manager babbling about fire doors and dinner times while his family attempt to kid themselves that he can be happy here. Dreyfuss doesn’t say a word in the entire scene but his silence is so eloquent that it drowns out everything else. Significant, too, that Angus’s best friend in Sundown Valley is Len (Graham Greene), who doesn’t speak because “no one listens”.There are moments of sharp humour (a brassy singer telling her OAP audience: “I’ll see some of you next week”) and Virginia Kilbertus’s tinkling score manages to combine childish innocence with world-weary melancholia. But it’s Dreyfuss who carries the movie, pulling us over the cracks in the narrative, drawing us into his world, providing a much-needed element of magic.Astronaut is available to stream on all major platforms from 27 April"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/802ed58fbefabc4114ca5e29222fb8ce0653813d/0_66_4601_2760/master/4601.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06a388c301793e0f6e17495110a77c4e","title":"everton appalled moise kean hosts coronavirus lockdown party","story":"Everton have labelled Moise Kean’s actions “unacceptable” after he flouted coronavirus lockdown restrictions.The striker filmed himself partying at home with guests in a breach of social distancing regulations during the coronavirus pandemic.

I know that nice Mr Sunak said freelance journalists earn about £200,000 a year when he announced his support package for the self-employed last month, but I don’t know what happened to mine. Was I mis-sold a heap of PPI? Maybe I bought too many avocado toasts and flat whites. Isn’t that how my millennial brethren mislaid the houses they were supposed to own? Either way, my side hustle is indispensable.Apologies for this unlovely insight into how the word-sausage gets made, but lots of people who write full time have a bit on the side, doing things we wouldn’t necessarily boast about at literary parties. It’s hardly news that journalism is beleaguered, rates low and work spread thin. I occasionally used to beat myself up about not having the courage and talent to live entirely from my creative endeavours no longer. Now, I’m simply grateful, more than ever, for the stability and structure my side hustle brings.The crisis hasn’t really changed the way I work – I have been #wfh for more than a decade – but I’m intrigued by how it has changed the way we interact. I have never met most of my colleagues, but I find myself feeling oddly tender towards them. The glib “Thanks and kind regards” I used to send their inbox avatars no longer cuts it I’ve adopted a genuinely sincere “Best wishes”. Usually strictly business, we have taken to tentatively slipping a personal touch into emails. “Take care,” someone writes from Luxembourg. “Stay safe,” ends a message from Mexico.I’m fascinated by a sparsely populated Instagram feed with pictures of us in makeshift home offices, laptops on piles of books and balanced on the corners of kitchen tables (physios will have a field day when we all get out). Who would have imagined the rigorously professional X has a small fluffy lapdog? It’s an odd and rather lovely consolation to have work humanised like this to see we are parents or cat owners to inspect each other’s mugs. We’re all South Korea commentator Robert Kelly or shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds now, kids waltzing through our Team meetings and making a mockery of our key performance indicators.My side hustle is in one of the industries that is particularly busy currently, so I have been working more or less non-stop since the first rumblings of Covid-19 hit Europe. Colleagues across the world are doing the same I get emails on Saturday nights and Sunday mornings at 4 or 5am on weekdays. I won’t say it’s been hard work, because anyone who is not putting their life and health in danger has forfeited the right to say that now. It’s not NHS hard not Asda-checkout hard. I just get up every morning, sit at my computer and work all day I had my first half-day off this weekend for a month.This is the opposite of a complaint: it’s an acknowledgement of my great good fortune. It might be nice to do a wrist workout trying to lift The Mirror and the Light, or see if I can still murder an easy Chopin prelude, but it’s far nicer to have scaffolding for these shapeless days, and a bit of economic security.My family are bemused at my commitment to keeping the hamster wheel of capitalism turning, but for me, work is identity and sanity. When my best friend and I fantasise about winning the lottery, she says she would stop working in an instant, but I can’t imagine happiness without it. Retirement is theoretical – I seem to have mislaid my pension, along with that £200,000 – but I dread the thought of it anyway.It goes without saying that only some types of work can be a salvation: the ones that are safe, humanely organised and pay a living wage. Our current situation has created and amplified the gaping, uneasy gulfs in the way we work, as it has in so many things. The distribution of work is feast or famine and it’s as unfair as that of other resources. Key workers are frighteningly overburdened, keeping us safe, fed, alive gig economy workers without job stability or sick pay are working past exhaustion and through illness. Meanwhile many have seen work vanish entirely, or become a logistical impossibility. Friends who invented themselves as nimble, multi-hyphen hustlers – more because permanent jobs were impossible to find than through any real conviction – made a virtue out of necessity. Now they are negotiating labyrinthine universal credit applications and facing a deeply uncertain future.Can we do better? We must.

Here in the UK, much of our gardening aesthetic is firmly fixated on flowers (the greater the number of petals and the more dazzling their colour the better). But in some east Asian societies, the focus is all about the amazing architecture of the parts of plants we usually don’t see: the roots.In Japan, a technique called nearai displays plants that have been removed from their containers and the soil carefully rinsed off specifically to reveal and accentuate the structure of their roots. In the related practice of bonsai, one of the most revered schools is the “root over rock” style, where skilled horticulturists spend years trying to mimic how the roots of rugged mountain trees twist and turn over massive boulders, using specially selected stones and a plethora of ingenious techniques.This style morphed dramatically when it hit Bali and Hawaii, using jungle species, such as strangler figs, that produce masses of aerial roots. I love the magical structure and form of “Fuku bonsai” or “Hawaiian bonsai”, which looks like something straight out of the Jungle Book crossed with Angkor Wat. These fast-growing tropical species will produce this effect swiftly, and starting out couldn’t be more simple, even for inhabitants of less idyllic climes.There are really just two simple rules. First, only a few species produce these amazing twists and tassels of roots, the most common of which are the tropical figs. I am a particular fan of Ficus ‘Natasja’, a strangler fig cultivar whose unusually small leaves really help create a convincing sense of scale. The small-leaved Schefflera arboricola is another ideal candidate. These fast-growing species are some of the most affordable bonsai around – you can pick one up for less than £20 in any good garden centre or (in lockdown times) online.Within as little as a week, you will start to see tiny white roots emerging from all over the branches and trunks. In a matter of months these will create beautiful flowing stilts and buttresses. During this time the lid can be removed once a week or so for watering, pruning or training, just give the plant a generous water spritz after opening and before closing it up again. Once these turn brown and woody, your miniature Angkor Wat won’t need the cloche at all, turning a bog standard tiny tree into a true marvel of nature."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7ee92dd41e656a99ca312c7445adfc9ec87efb2/0_0_4608_2765/master/4608.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f0e14e085b9aa4f5d038b8aa87edc92","title":"kids dogs slides and trying to dodge the virus","story":"There’s a good deal to worry about on a short trip out with the boyI’ve mentioned how the current strangeness has given rise to so many wonderful aspects of human nature acts of kindness between neighbours, solidarity among strangers, the bravery and resourcefulness of professionals under unimaginable stress. But it has also shone a light on other, worse behaviours. I know this because I’m guilty of most of them.I’m suddenly adept at auditing passersby, discerning precisely how they’re enabling the virus. ‘That dog next door is certainly getting a lot of exercise,’ I’ll say to my wife, emphasising the word ‘certainly’ in a reedy, suspicious tone that I’m sure is unfathomably attractive. ‘And look how close those friends are all standing – what is this, BURNING MAN?’‘They could be flatmates,’ she replies, with treasonous complacency, ‘I think that’s allowed.’‘Perhaps,’ I say, making a mental note that this is exactly the kind of wishy-washy nonsense a virus-enabler would say.Most of my trips out into the world are with my son. We don’t have a garden and our flat is so small he can’t run for more than four seconds in any direction – ‘any direction’ being his favourite way of running. He’s given all his old toys a second life, playing with each unloved teddy or broken bath penguin until, one by one, they suffer a second death, too.He now says, ‘Ooooh!’ and points a finger at any group of two or more people who pass our window, so I can tell him what they’re doing wrong. After this, we usually share notes about his mother’s suspiciously unserious approach to our Neighbourhood Watch activities.All of this wouldn’t be so appalling if I wasn’t as fallible as everyone else when I do go outside. I make every mistake I loathe in others. I try to stay 2m away from people, but this seems absurd. Stopping 6m ahead of someone rather than politely walking past them, seems passive-aggressive. I mean, I am quite passive-aggressive, but that’s a luxury I only bestow upon close friends and family. Not out on the street, where my need to be liked by strangers takes priority.At the park, my son, drunk on the prospect of touching and tasting any object, proves himself averse to social distancing. I march him past the slides, which I consider little more than stainless-steel platters of concentrated Covid-19, useful only for those hoping to fire their child through a year’s worth of viral load in three seconds, and at a 45-degree angle. From there, I chase him away from dogs, children and gatherings of people who may or may not be Séamas-O’Reilly-approved family units. There have been close calls, none of which would mark me out as Mr Vigilant to any curtain-twitchers. When we return, my wife asks what we did. The boy and I share a glance, and silently agree she can never know."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2353ece8afebf9e65a512bf4f1690962471646a1/651_826_3661_2197/master/3661.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ebf9451c20d2991bd92b593a2637969e","title":"google earth in wool and satin in pictures","story":"Victoria Rose Richards creates “embroidered landscapes” influenced by the Devonshire countryside where she grew up. “I get inspiration from aerial views on Google Earth,” says the 21-year-old artist, who uses wool, French knots and satin stitch to make her “colourful and optimistic” scenes.

I could not have known then how my life would soon be consumed by this story. I have spent the four months since constantly weighing the risks to my family, my colleagues and the people we interviewed against my responsibility as a journalist.Reports about a mysterious strain of pneumonia in Wuhan – a city I had only vague memories of from a reporting trip in 2013 – began cropping up in late December. I relayed to my editor the government’s assurance that there was no sign the virus was being transmitted between humans.Partly, I didn’t think the Chinese authorities would get this wrong after the cover-up and fallout from Sars in 2002-03. But also I wanted to believe them – even as a trained sceptic who has covered China for years. I knew how complicated and difficult life would become if this turned into an epidemic.Within two weeks, officials announced the virus was contagious. Hospitals in Wuhan were rammed with panicked, sick residents, and the city went into lockdown. I struggled with the decision of when to go to Wuhan, or whether or not to stay in China. We knew very little about how the virus was transmitted and how serious it could get.For a few weeks, my mum called every day demanding I come back to the US. She would send message after message, including audio recordings of Taiwanese news shows in case I didn’t have access to the news. My husband, also in the US at the time, was more measured and trusted me to make the right call. My editors said to leave as soon as I felt unsafe. I promised to if things got worse.Over the next few months, I worked in a state of de facto quarantine from my living room in Beijing, in friends’ apartments in Hong Kong and in a hotel in Shanghai with so few guests the staff turned most of the lights off to save electricity. I called people in Wuhan and watched videos of dead bodies in hospitals, health workers breaking down under the strain, residents pleading for help. I scrolled through pages of online posts from people asking for advice after being turned away from hospitals and ignored by overwhelmed government staff. There were several accounts of suicides.Seemingly small, random details about people trying to care for their elderly relatives would bring me to tears. A woman described putting a blanket down in a hospital lobby for her parents, turned away but too sick for the journey home. They slept on the floor and later both died. A young woman studying abroad talked with her sick father until his phone battery ran out as, unable to find transport, he walked several miles home from the hospital. The last time I spoke to her, he was in critical condition.These stories were difficult because I could see myself in them. If my mother were dying and police would not let me through a checkpoint to get her help, I would also rage at them – demanding to know whether or not they were human beings.Then, almost suddenly, the story shifted. The number of daily new infections in China began dropping. After 76 days of people being shut inside their city and their homes, Wuhan would soon begin to let residents leave. I went to witness the end of the lockdown at the start of this month and report on what went wrong in the early days of the outbreak.Wuhan felt strangely calm. People seemed ready to move on, commenting only that things were “much better”. They were no longer angry at authorities for suppressing early warnings of the virus. Seeing other countries struggle, they were appreciative of their own government’s efforts. “Now we know what the word motherland means,” a nurse said while giving me a throat swab to test if I had the virus – a requirement before coming back to Beijing.But there were signs of trauma and resentment below the surface. One woman broke down crying during an interview. Even though the lockdown was lifted, she was scared to go out and she was still angry at whoever had allowed this to happen. Others were filing lawsuits, demanding officials be held accountable.Reporting those stories was also difficult. I was repeatedly told by local contacts that patients, doctors and nurses had been told not to speak to foreign media. “You are Chinese. Don’t have contact with them,” one resident said he had been told by his neighbourhood committee.Still, people spoke to us and I worried about the impact on them. Several said local police had tried to intimidate them for talking to the , and that they had been ordered to cut off communication. When I apologised for causing them trouble, one said: “I’m glad I got to share with you. It’s what we should do.” Another told me repeatedly: “I’m not scared of them.”Recently I was woken up by a phone call from someone I had interviewed in Wuhan. They were frantic. Had I published the story? Could it be deleted? Local authorities had called them in, warning that foreign journalists like me would try to “use” people like them.“I am just a normal person. I don’t want anything to do with politics,” they said, pausing to apologise for calling so early.I groggily tried to explain that we had not used a name, given identifying details or printed any comments that could be construed as opposition to the government. Still, they were worried about their job and family, and confused as to why sharing a personal experience was politically sensitive.That is what has been the hardest, but also most inspiring, thing about covering this outbreak. Not only are people reliving the most painful experiences of their lives when they talk to us, but they are also risking being harassed, or worse, so that the rest of the world can know what really happened in Wuhan. Many of them speak out anyway.

Now they can prove to be catastrophicCut off by telecoms company, pensioner missed call as partner died of Covid-19Barbara Parry* arranged to switch her phone and broadband account from Sky to Now TV in March, a week before lockdown. Instead, she was left incommunicado as her line was cancelled and her phone number reallocated.During the following four weeks, as she pleaded in vain to be reconnected, her partner contracted Covid-19. He died four days later in hospital. Due to the blunders by Now TV, he was unable to call Parry from his deathbed and she was unable to say goodbye. The news was broken by a relative as the hospital could not get through on her cancelled number.“Now TV’s failed promises have left a 79-year-old woman, grieving for a lost loved one, completely on her own, with friends and family unable to contact her,” says her son-in-law, Anthony. “The day after her partner died, the company reneged on a promise to retrieve her old number and said it was not possible. Instead of promised call backs, we’ve had auto-generated emails asking why we cancelled the contract and I’ve spent over seven fruitless hours on the phone explaining it was a life-and-death situation and trying to get her connected.”Ofcom, which regulates the industry, has eased some of the obligations of telecoms firms to reflect the challenges. They are absolved from having to fix problems within the usual 30-day window for customers receiving less than their guaranteed broadband speed and automatic compensation, introduced last year for each day of delay to a repair or installation. Companies are expected to explain to customers why they will not receive a payout and to stop charging those without a service.“Broadband and mobile firms are focusing their efforts on keeping their customers connected, particularly those who are vulnerable and depend on their services the most,” Ofcom says. “We think this is absolutely the right approach. And we recognise this might affect the companies’ ability to comply with some of our rules. We have written to the providers explaining that we will take account of the unique circumstances when enforcing our rules.”The problem is that customers with mental or physical impairments had to be registered as vulnerable with their service providers in order to be prioritised before the pandemic. Now anyone self-isolating due to age or a medical condition falls into that category, but may not be flagged up on their provider’s database.Pensioners Colin and Anne Noddings* found that their landline had been disconnected after Vodafone installed a broadband service. They were told it would take 10 days to restore and Colin had to borrow mobile phones from neighbours to call for updates.Three days later, the couple was informed that their contract had been cancelled for reasons unknown and the phone number they’d had for 30 years, withdrawn. It would take an estimated 15 days to reconnect them.“My 73-year-old wife is classed as disabled as her mobility is extremely limited and I have a heart condition, diabetes and have recently been diagnosed with asthma and COPD,” says Colin. “In the current climate we are both classed as extremely vulnerable but in an emergency have no means of contacting anyone.”Ofcom says it expects companies to provide self-isolating customers alternative means of communication if their issue can’t be prioritised. However, Vodafone only acted when the Observer intervened. It reinstated the line and the original number 13 days after the couple were disconnected and has given them £50 and two months free line rental.Charlotte Hughes* lost her internet connection in January after a cable to her flat was severed. Virgin Media claimed it was unable to reconnect her because of scaffolding on the council block where she lives. The inconvenience for the first two months, when lack of wifi impeded her search for a job, turned to hardship when lockdown began a week after she underwent surgery for cancer. She was unable to order food online and had to risk trips to the supermarket, despite an NHS letter requiring her to shield, and she was unable to seek comfort from friends and family.“Skype is the main way I connect, and I simply cannot say what it meant not to have a reliable enough connection to talk to people,” she says. “This was especially difficult at a time of diagnosis and pre- and post-operative treatment for cancer. I was told that the cable had been severed by a Virgin Media technician connecting a neighbouring flat, but the company displays no sense of urgency or responsibility and clearly has no reliable mechanism for communicating between departments or flagging up unresolved problems.”Virgin Media says that it believed the cable was severed by builders, and that health and safety risks prevented it reinstating the line while scaffolding was in place. After involvement from the Observer, however, it dispatched a “specialist crew” and completed the repair. It has credited Hughes’ account for the 11 weeks she was without service and given her an extra two months free.The online resolution service Resolver reports a doubling of complaints about telecoms service issues since lockdown. “Most people are pragmatic enough to expect service disruptions and slow speeds, but they weren’t expecting poor customer service,” says spokesperson Martyn James. “We’ve never been more reliant on broadband and mobile phone networks, but our data suggests some firms are falling short.”Customers who are self-isolating or in financial straits are advised to contact their provider to receive priority status. If that fails, they can still complain to whichever of the two dispute resolution schemes it’s signed up to – CISAS or Ombudsman Services. These are prioritising those who are left without a connection because of delayed installation, a faulty line or inability to pay their bill. Other complaints will be parked until there is a degree of normality.Parry’s ordeal was caused by disjointed customer service and a failure to escalate the problem. When the Observer alerted the management of Now TV, part of Sky Group, the response was immediate and remorseful. The director of operations called her to apologise, her old phone number was retrieved and her line connected.Managing Director, Marina Storti, says: “We take our responsibility to keep customers informed and connected very seriously, especially in these challenging times, and we know we’ve let the customer and her family down. We’ve spoken to the family and while we know that no amount of money can make things right, we have met the request of compensation and offered to match it with a donation to a charity of their choice.”The company’s contrition is some mollification, but the anguish of losing a loved-one without a farewell will never heal. “It’s hard to put into words how much greater the misery has been because of the mistakes,” Parry says.“They let me down in the first place and they let me down again when we tried to sort it out. I’m a Christian and I believe in forgiveness but this is very tough for me.”* Names have been changed"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fb9e77c4d61627062febe85cb15d6ddf013df8a/0_132_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e846f386dd3b1c165e5721803385ca8","title":"how the 5g conspiracy theories took hold","story":"’s media editor Jim Waterson looks at why conspiracy theories linking 5G technology to coronavirus have taken hold in the UK, with dozens of phone masts vandalised across the country over the past few weeks Last week a mobile phone mast serving the emergency NHS Nightingale hospital in Birmingham was one of the latest targeted by arsonists who wrongly believe 5G technology is linked to the spread of coronavirus.

It would also allow for a better understanding of the range of disciplines which are shaping advice to government.”Others called for the minutes of Sage meetings to be published. The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said: “It’s vital public confidence is maintained in this process. The membership and supporting papers should be published. Total transparency is crucial.”The acting Lib Dem leader, Ed Davey, said: “The public needs to have confidence that it is expert advice that is guiding government decisions. The lack of transparency is unacceptable in this national crisis.”Adam Price, the Plaid Cymru leader, said: “The fact the chief medical officer of Wales couldn’t even ask questions, but Boris Johnson’s chief spin doctor had a place at the table is as shocking as it is wrong. This government needs to start treating people like grown-ups and publish the advice they are receiving.”Downing Street reacted furiously to the initial report, adding it was “not true that Mr Cummings or Dr Warner are ‘on’ or members of Sage”. One insider was frustrated that the government was in a no-win situation. Having previously been criticised for delays and complacency, they said they were now being criticised for having senior advisers attend crucial meetings.Prof Stephen Powis, who is a Sage member and NHS England medical director, said he was confident that what happens at Sage was a “scientific discussion involving the scientists and experts who are members of Sage”.He added: “The experts, from a variety of backgrounds, discuss the evidence they discuss the evidence base of the various topics they come to conclusions around that evidence base,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “It is then, of course, the role of Sage to advise the government.”Asked again at the Downing Street press conference whether Cummings made contributions to Sage, Powis would only say that it is the “scientists that make the scientific contributions”.Previous scientific advisers said the details of Cummings’s involvement in the committee were crucial. Prof Derek Hill, of University College London, said: “I was on a science advisory group for dementia research when David Cameron was prime minister. Advisers from No 10 often turned up, but just as observers.“The question here is whether Cummings not only attends but actively participates in Sage. For example, does he talk more at these meetings than some of the scientists?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6520e87489ed917158f9d1316de3eef690deb3ad/0_224_4325_2596/master/4325.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06da79909958acb5ea346894b18edecf","title":"pompeii ruins show that the romans invented recycling","story":"Excavations reveal that rubbish left outside the city walls wasn’t just dumped. It was being collected, sorted and resoldThey were expert engineers, way ahead of the curve on underfloor heating, aqueducts and the use of concrete as a building material. Now it turns out that the Romans were also masters at recycling their rubbish.Researchers at Pompeii, the city buried under a thick carpet of volcanic ash when Vesuvius erupted in 79 AD, have found that huge mounds of refuse apparently dumped outside the city walls were in fact “staging grounds for cycles of use and reuse”.Professor Allison Emmerson, an American academic who is part of a large team working at Pompeii, said rubbish was piled up along almost the entire external wall on the city’s northern side, among other sites. Some of the mounds were several metres high and included bits of ceramic and plaster, which could be repurposed as construction materials.These mounds were previously thought to have been formed when an earthquake struck the city about 17 years before the volcano erupted, Emmerson said. Most were cleared in the mid-20th century, but some are still being discovered.Scientific analysis has now traced some of the refuse from city sites to suburban deposits equivalent to modern landfills, and back to the city, where the material was incorporated into buildings, such as earth floors.With fellow archaeologists Steven Ellis and Kevin Dicus, who worked on the University of Cincinnati’s excavations, Emmerson has studied how the ancient city was constructed. “We found that part of the city was built out of trash. The piles outside the walls weren’t material that’s been dumped to get rid of it. They’re outside the walls being collected and sorted to be resold inside the walls.”Pompeii was a city of elegant villas and handsome public buildings, open squares, artisan shops, taverns, brothels and bathhouses. It included an amphitheatre that hosted gladiatorial games for audiences of up to 20,000.When volcanic dust from Vesuvius “poured across the land” – as one witness wrote – enveloping the city in darkness, at least 2,000 people died. In 1748, a group of explorers discovered the almost perfectly preserved city under a hardened carpet of ash and pumice. Even a loaf of bread was found preserved by later archaeologists.Pompeii is now a Unesco world heritage site and – in normal times – attracts 2.5 million visitors each year.Emmerson and her colleagues used soil samples to trace the movement of rubish across the city. “The soil that we excavate differs based on where the garbage was left originally,” she said. “Garbage dumped in places like latrines or cesspits leaves behind a rich, organic soil. In contrast, waste that accumulated over time on the streets or in mounds outside the city results in a much sandier soil.“The difference in soil allows us to see whether the garbage had been generated in the place where it was found, or gathered from elsewhere to be reused and recycled.”Some walls, for example, included reused materials such as pieces of tile and broken amphorae, and lumps of mortar and plaster. “Almost all such walls received a final layer of plaster, hiding the mess of materials within,” she said.“The idea has been that all this garbage resulted from that earthquake – consisting of rubble that had been cleared out of the city and dumped outside the wall to remove it from daily life. As I was working outside Pompeii, I saw that the city extended into developed neighbourhoods outside the walls ... So it didn’t make sense to me that these suburbs were also being used as landfills.”Modern approaches to waste management focus on removing rubbish from our daily lives, she added. “For the most part, we don’t care what happens to our trash, as long as it’s taken away. What I’ve found in Pompeii is an entirely different priority, that waste was being collected and sorted for recycling.“The Pompeians lived much closer to their garbage than most of us would find acceptable, not because the city lacked infrastructure and they didn’t bother to manage trash but because their systems of urban management were organised around different principles.“This point has relevance for the modern garbage crisis. The countries that most effectively manage their waste have applied a version of the ancient model, prioritising commodification rather than simple removal.”Allison Emmerson, who teaches classical studies at Tulane University, New Orleans, is the author of Life and Death in the Roman Suburb to be published next month by Oxford University Press."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2bf8eb1efcb6bfa11d77b256ea9bb291111f12b0/0_85_3840_2304/master/3840.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8c860e4149095401d0de0e84f47919c","title":"case for transparency over sage has never been clearer","story":"Emergency response body could have moved quicker at beginning of pandemicAs the coronavirus epidemic spilled out of China and seeded outbreaks around the world, the British government looked to its Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) for guidance on how best to handle the crisis.The members of Sage are not a fixed group of wise academics that wait in their offices for the hotline to ring. The makeup of the group depends on the emergency at hand and is put together at the request of the Cabinet Office. At its best, it gives ministers direct access to the finest minds in the country as it navigates an unfolding emergency.Then there are the behavioural scientists who feed into Sage via the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behavioural Science, or SPI-B. Another group that has a representative on Sage is the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group, or Nervtag, home to the virologists and respiratory disease specialists who study the pathogens and their effects on the body.The combined expertise, with senior medics, social scientists and outbreak specialists, is intended to ensure that all aspects of the unfolding pandemic, from the nature of the virus, to how people will react, are covered. Yet while Sage covers the academic bases, it is unclear whether it has the breadth of voices it needs. Could there have been more in the room, for example, who knew an emergency when they saw one?More than a month ago, Michael Ryan, the World Health Organization’s head of emergencies, made it abundantly clear that governments had to act fast to beat the virus. “The virus will always get you if you don’t move quickly and you need to be prepared,” he said. Speaking from experience with Ebola outbreaks, Ryan went on to add: “Anyone who’s involved in emergency response will know this.”Britain did not move fast and was not prepared. As Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, one of the few members of Sage who is open about his membership, has warned, Britain could have Europe’s worst death toll.It is hard to look at the list and not feel it needs more mathematical modellers or more statisticians. Those disciplines are crucial for pulling in data and working out how the virus is spreading, who it is killing and in what numbers.They are crucial too for cautiously predicting the future course of the disease, which in turn is needed to work out plausible exit strategies and give early warning of a second peak.But what mattered at the start of the epidemic was to move fast, not wait until models revealed the spectacular death toll the country faced if sat on its hands.It is not the only area where expertise appears to be lacking. Sage is not responsible for all of the government’s advice: it goes to Cobra where ministers weigh it up against other considerations.But beyond the clear failure to act fast, two areas that have defined Britain’s ham-fisted response to the coronavirus pandemic are the inability to test at scale and devastating shortcomings in supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE).Where are the experts that could have organised companies to ramp up testing sooner, as is only now coming online? And who would have looked at the PPE stockpile and where the equipment had to go and seen a thorny problem that needed swift and decisive action?The members of Sage are impressive iniduals. But with the government insisting it is following the science, as if science offers only one route through this, the case for transparency has never been clearer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b04e50b5eff60663098079cf329e6c87c0359706/100_0_3964_2379/master/3964.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29a298f2aaf901a8bcb16631106f098c","title":"poorer expectant mums lose over 4000 through unfair anomaly in benefits","story":"System treats maternity allowance as unpaid income, skewing the amount of universal credit paid outPregnant women on the lowest incomes are being denied vital financial support during the Covid-19 crisis, according to unions and women’s support groups, who are calling for urgent reforms to universal credit.An anomaly in the way universal credit differentiates between pregnant earners has created an unfair system, it is argued. Universal credit treats maternity allowance, which is paid to the lowest-earning women and those who are self-employed, as “unearned income”, which means it is deducted from their benefit payments.By contrast, statutory maternity pay, paid to higher-earning women by their employers, who claim it back, is treated as “earnings”, and is therefore largely ignored when their benefit payments are calculated.Both forms of payment are supposed to give women financial support at a time when they need to bond with their baby.Maternity Action, a charity that campaigns on behalf of pregnant mothers, says the inequitable system means some women on maternity allowance who apply for universal credit end up more than £4,100 worse off over 39 weeks of their paid maternity leave than women on statutory maternity pay.“We do appreciate that the support schemes have been developed in difficult circumstances,” said Rosalind Bragg, Maternity Action’s director.“However, it would take little effort to resolve the unfair treatment of maternity allowance in universal credit calculations… The financial cost to government would be extremely low, but it would make a massive difference to women and their families.”Last week, an alliance of 14 unions, women’s rights groups, charities and law firms wrote to Dominc Raab, urging him to take action.Their letter claims that “the prime minister’s announcement on 16 March that pregnant women are classed as vulnerable led directly to many pregnant women being sent home on sick leave, in breach of existing health and safety law”.A DWP spokesperson said: “ It is right that a claimant’s award is adjusted to take into account support they are already receiving, including income through benefits.”But TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said the imbalance was another example of why universal credit needed overhauling. “Britain’s lowest-paid mums are having financial support unfairly deducted at a time when family budgets are already under stress from a new baby,” she said. “Coronavirus has exposed gaping holes in our safety net.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7248e5a8c149c4bbf8d99ee016ab7c0f1d58c5e8/0_216_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40ab1e7f3c4d4fbf077f43334a351b4c","title":"britains lockdown diaries expose gulf in wellbeing between rich and poor","story":"A study of 50 Britons over three weeks shows the emotional toll of struggling to stay afloat as incomes shrinkTed has been buoyant since the first day of lockdown. He is retired and lives in a village near Salisbury with his wife. They are financially secure and “continue to enjoy good health and have all we need at home”. He can still garden, cycle and enjoy the countryside. For him, and a fifth of Britons surveyed, it is business as usual.A collection of lockdown diaries compiled by 50 Britons over three weeks reveals a bleak contrast between those who, like Ted, can afford to cope in the current crisis, and those struggling to feed their families and maintain their physical and mental health.In a study put together by Britain Thinks, a third of respondents keeping weekly diaries admit they are not coping well. Two fifths have seen their incomes shrink and many are struggling to stay afloat. Mental health is a grave concern with almost half of young people and children in the study reporting a marked rise in anxiety and fear for the future. The gulf in wellbeing between this generation and older, affluent respondents is stark.One 36-year-old mother from Glasgow has lost her job and the income of her small childcare business. “There is now no routine and I’m going a little crazy,” she writes. “I struggle to buy nutritious food I don’t know where my next pay is coming from. I am worried no one knows when this will end.” She is overwhelmed by how difficult things are. “I had to leave my 12-year-old in the house with my four-year-old while I went to queue at a shop for some essentials … My heart was racing as I had never left the two of them in the house by themselves.”By the end of week three, the novelty of baking and bonding with family had worn thin. Worried, frustrated and bored were the descriptors most used to describe the current situation. The diarists represent Britons in a range of life stages and working situations: from families with children under five through to vulnerable, older people, small business owners to gig economy workers. The majority say they are adjusting to a lot of change in their daily lives – and most say they are managing it. The hardest hit and most likely to be affected by increased financial and emotional stress were women, 18- to 24- year-olds and those from lower socio-economic backgrounds. The crisis is fostering national unity. All the documented failures withstanding, many still feel the government is doing the best it can and dislike those criticising it.For Sam, 26, a Masters student who lives at home with his parents and sister in Manchester, this doesn’t tally and he is extremely anxious about the increasing death rate. “I’m losing more and more confidence in the government … I’m feeling like the situation in the UK is getting worse and that we are unable to help.”Trust in medical experts and the NHS has gone up each week and appreciation for delivery drivers and supermarket workers is high. “They’re so brave for staying at work and aren’t getting the appreciation they deserve,” noted one diary, while another cheered “the scientists working overtime behind the scenes to develop vaccines and tests”.Names have been changed by request"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57c5ab54f859c50b2c4adc54094a0008521d8ee7/57_1188_4386_2632/master/4386.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22dfeee3aad73c58a351d13d7f6e48de","title":"olympic athletics hopeful eleanor davis puts tokyo ambition on hold to save lives","story":"The athlete intended to spend Sunday running the London Marathon but will be on a Covid-19 ward helping patientsEleanor Davis had intended to spend Sunday on a 42,000-step journey towards Team GB’s squad for the 2020 Olympics. Instead, at 8.55am, when the London Marathon elite women’s race was due to start, Davis will be on a Covid-19 ward saving lives. “It’s gutting that the race has been cancelled,” says Davis, a doctor at Stepping Hill hospital in Stockport. “But there are more important things going on.”In December, the 31-year-old put years of injury niggles behind her by running a 2hr 33min marathon in Valencia – putting her in the UK’s top 10 last year – and believed she was on course to go under 2:30 in London. That would have given her a live shot at securing one of the three places for Tokyo. But when the virus spread, she volunteered for extra shifts and put her ambitions on hold.“I’m working more hours than I normally would, mainly on the coronavirus wards,” she says. “It’s been difficult. I have seen some heartbreaking days, but there are also some uplifting moments as well. There are also some difficult phone calls you have to make. But for every difficult phone call there is a nice one when I am ringing to say the patient is getting better and we are hoping to discharge in a few days. I have also seen some care and compassion that I will take with me for the rest of my career, so it’s not all bad.”However, Davis feels she is likely to get the virus at some point, especially as her wife is also an A\u0026ampE consultant. “I am generally not fearful when I am in hospital,” she says. “I am fit and healthy, but I know it doesn’t always discriminate.“From personal experience there have been no problems with PPE but I guess each day I do wake up feeling quite lucky that I am still well considering I have had so much exposure. My wife is an A\u0026ampE consultant so our house is probably quite a hot spot. I worry a bit because it can be so harsh on the respiratory system and how I might recover to get back into running. I am kind of expecting to get it at some point.”After Davis finishes her shift, she will join other elite British women marathoners in running 2.6 miles as part of the 2.6 Challenge, which intends to get as many people as possible to dream up an activity based around the numbers 2.6 or 26 and to fundraise or donate to their chosen charity – via twopointsixchallenge – as part of efforts to save charities that risk going under during the lockdown.Davis, who is running for the mental health charity Mind, admits she has had a few low days herself recently. “But I don’t think there are many who won’t be struggling with their mental health through this. So it is a charity that a lot of people can relate to and might need help from in the future.”Last year, the London Marathon raised £66.4m for charity, making it Britain’s biggest single-day fundraising event. The race director, Hugh Brasher, is urging the public to join figures such as Gareth Bale, Sir Steve Redgrave and Jessica Ennis-Hill in order to help the £1.5m already raised grow rapidly.“We are trying to highlight a vitally important issue, that the charities that underpin our society are in dire straits and need our help,” Brasher says. “We have lots of sporting stars and celebrities on board and the hope is that lots of incredible and crazy activities will take place, under social distancing rules, of course, to raise money.”His son agrees. “Impossible wasn’t a word he accepted,” Hugh says, laughing. “If a door was shut he would bulldozer it down or try a different one.”The Covid-19 pandemic has brought a unique challenge to the organisers but Brasher Jr still hopes to hold the event as normal, in October, although he says they are planning 10 other options, including staging an elite-only race.Meanwhile, Davis says she is still running 90-100 miles a week, to and from hospital, which she finds therapeutic. She hopes when life resumes again, she will be in a position to fulfil her dream by running for Britain. “I’d like to get on the GB team,” she says. “I’ve made the first reserve for the world half, but I think I have definitely got more to give.”Few would doubt it. Although, as Davis’s patients would certainly testify, she has given plenty to the country already."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ec3d6aa3bd48142aae4b160f9dfa71d20234fe5/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da8a5cfe02ad8e91474e7f69f48ce853","title":"how coronavirus helped tiktok find its voice","story":"The video-sharing app’s blend of memes, jokes and skits have been a surprise lockdown hit – but teen users are worried it will lose its coolA person in a grass-covered suit lurks behind a wheelie bin before sprinting down a residential cul-de-sac. In a cramped bathroom, five housemates lip-sync in a limescale-stained bath. NHS staff dance on a deserted ward. A family of four performs a dance routine in a suburban garden. The father is out of time.These are the faces of the UK’s TikTok obsession. Across the country, in teenage bedrooms and house shares, Brits stuck at home by the coronavirus lockdown are firing up TikTok, propping their phones against walls and hitting record.Founded in 2012 by Chinese entrepreneur Zhang Yiming, TikTok is one of the most popular video-sharing apps in the world, downloaded more than 2bn times globally. Users create 15-second clips set to music or soundbites, which they can overlay with digital special effects.Before the coronavirus pandemic, TikTok was predominantly favoured by British teenagers, who posted prank videos or the latest trending dance routine on it. But since the lockdown, TikTok has become a seething leviathan of user-generated content, chewing down our boredom, our fatigue and our fear and spitting them back at us in 15-second chunks, to be digested ad infinitum.I keep asking 18-year-old Madeline Mai-Davies what it’s like to be an overnight TikTok celebrity, but all she can do is rattle off numbers for me. “So the bush-man video went viral on 16.5m views,” Mai-Davies says giddily, “and the video where I pretended to surprise my boyfriend naked, now that’s got 12.5m views.”After joining TikTok just six days ago, the unemployed waitress from Stevenage – like almost everyone else in the hospitality sector, coronavirus cost Mai-Davies her job – has 210,000 followers. In less time than it takes for a banana to go brown, she has accrued an online following double the circulation of some national newspapers. How does she feel? “To be fair, it has been a headfuck,” she responds, before reeling off more figures.Mai-Davies became a TikTok influencer after a video she posted of her boyfriend pretending to break the coronavirus lockdown – by creeping down their road in a grass-covered costume – went viral. (At the time of writing, it had 1.6m views.) Sudden fame has left Mai-Davies punch-drunk on her own celebrity. “This Morning got in contact with me,” she says breathlessly. “They want me to FaceTime Holly and Phil. We’ve been in hundreds of articles in 20 different counties.”Becoming a TikTok influencer is now a viable career. “I want to be a content creator and make people laugh,” says 24-year-old Akafi Ali, from London. Ali quit his job as a Sainsbury’s cashier to pursue his TikTok dream: his videos satirise Somali culture or feature Ali on caterwauling form. “Everyone is going to the supermarket to grab toilet rolls!” Ali says in one video. “Are you serious? Just wash your ass!”Ali says TikTok was already popular before coronavirus, but that the lockdown has supercharged it. “There are a lot more people jumping on,” he says. With this influx of new influencers comes competition. “Before, if you uploaded a video, you could easily get 100,000 views in the first hour,” says Ali. “But now you don’t get on the For You page as easily as before.” (For You is the landing page on TikTok, tailored to users’ interests.)Mai-Davies also plans to give the TikTok influencer thing a go and is posting daily videos. “When I go to bed, I think about ideas for tomorrow’s video,” she says. She tells me that some young girls have set up a fan page about her on Instagram. “They write, ‘I love her so much, she’s my Queen,’” she says. She sounds bemused. “This is so crazy. How have I got a fan page?”The most important thing to understand about TikTok is that it is anarchic: it has no internal logic or guiding principle. Many TikTok videos are absurdist jokes. People surprise family members, impersonate celebrities or set up elaborate punchlines. The platform frequently has the surreal quality of a fever dream: videos riff on arcane internet ephemera or make nonsensical jokes. Non-sequiturs are common. Creativity is paramount.“Surrealism is embedded into the DNA of the internet,” says Kenneth Goldsmith, author of Wasting Time on the Internet. He sees TikTok’s popularity as a natural reaction to the oppressive mania of a global lockdown – it is a pressure valve for people cooped up indoors. “The only response to an existential situation is absurdity and humour,” Goldsmith says. “It brings us back to the darker side of surrealism.”On Instagram, we are primped and preening, on Twitter, loudmouthed and strident, but on TikTok, we can just be weird. Which makes it the perfect platform to ride out a pandemic that has nearly one-third of the world’s population trapped at home. “It’s therapeutic,” Goldsmith explains. “If we look at Freud’s theorising of the joke, the joke is always about showing humour in the face of death.”“I’m sort of embarrassed by it,” says John Palmer of his TikTok account. The 17-year-old, from County Durham, specialises in the sort of hyper-surreal videos you’d expect to jump into through a chalk pavement drawing – if Mary Poppins used TikTok. Typically, Palmer’s videos refer to popular memes or obscure internet jokes.In one video, Palmer rips a much-memed Michelle Obama soundbite to make a joke about Prince William using coronavirus to leapfrog Charles in the line of succession. In another, he pretends to talk to the squadron of imaginary friends he’s made in self-isolation. “It’s sort of about finding the template, but pushing the meme as far as it will go, making it weirder and weirder, until it gets to a point where it doesn’t make sense unless you’ve seen everything else before,” Palmer says. “It spirals down into something else.”This is TikTok as pure subculture: in order to participate at Palmer’s level, you need to have swum through digital water since childhood, a graceful stroke through each platform – Facebook, Vine, Instagram – that is easy and assured. There is no need for gatekeepers: the price of admission to this subculture is simply understanding the joke. “I show it to my parents and they don’t get it,” Palmer explains. “It’s the meme culture of Gen Z. There’s so much background to memes. You need to have lived through them.”As a TikTok old timer, Palmer is mortified by the platform’s exploding popularity during the coronavirus pandemic. “I’m not looking forward to all of the adults discovering TikTok,” he says with a sigh.There’s a simple reason why people are flocking to TikTok: it’s a superb time waster. And in lieu of freedom or gainful employment, right now the only thing the British public has in abundance is time to burn.“People are just looking for ways to keep themselves occupied,” says TikTok creator Rachel Leary, 23, from Manchester. “Having TikTok on your phone is a really easy thing to do to pass the time. There’s nothing else to do.”TikTok is designed to be addictive: you can scroll its dashboard for hours without ever running out of content. Its algorithm uses artificial intelligence to observe your interests and deliver videos that fit. Palmer tells me that since downloading TikTok on his phone, his screen time has gone up from seven hours a day to 12.And when you finally tire of scrolling through TikTok’s neverending dashboard, you can start making videos. Palmer only started posting his own videos when the coronavirus lockdown started. “I was locked in the house and had nothing else to do,” he says. “I thought making a video might be something to do for a day to occupy myself.” He sounds surprised. “But then I continued with it.”TikTok is a curative to boredom: there is always a new challenge to try or dance routine to learn. “TikTok is a space for the familiar play we’ve seen on the internet for decades now,” says Ryan Milner of the College of Charleston. “Challenges that went around on YouTube or Facebook, like the ice-bucket challenge or the Kylie Jenner challenge, are now on TikTok.”And although many TikTok videos may appear inane on first viewing, making a successful TikTok video takes skill, care and creativity. “When you’re writing the caption on TikTok, it really has to flow well and have the right syntax,” Palmer says, “because if it’s too confusing people don’t like it or ignore it. It has to flow really well.”Leary reshot her most popular TikTok video – in which she pretends to DJ to the BBC News theme tune using household cleaning products – to improve her comic timing. “I didn’t instantly look at it and think, that’s so funny,” she explains. “So I refilmed it and the second time I took a swig of wine. That’s the part of the video that people have found the funniest and commented on.” Her instinct was correct: the video has received 151,000 likes and was played on the BBC.Another characteristic of TikTok that makes it well suited to the coronavirus lockdown: it is primarily an indoor platform. “TikTok has always been about being 15 and staying at home,” explains David Nichols of the University of Melbourne. “That’s the accepted backdrop. And now everyone has to stay at home! So TikTok was made for coronavirus. Not deliberately, but it was.”Unlike Instagram, where influencers swagger in front of a rotating backdrop of cocktail bars and tropical beaches, TikTokkers have always filmed themselves at home, in their bedrooms. “Instagram is more for like going out and getting drunk or going on holiday,” Palmer says. “Instagram is superficial. But TikTok is just people posting stupid things and it’s addictive, so you can keep going and going.”Many of the young people I speak to say a variant of the same thing: TikTok used to be uncool, until suddenly it wasn’t. Palmer tells me that his peers would often write “Here as a joke” on their TikTok bios, because they were embarrassed to be on the app. “If TikTok came up in conversation, everyone would say, ‘Urgh, no one goes on that,’” says 16-year-old Libby Atkinson, from Manchester.Coronavirus supercharged a process that was already taking place: the process of TikTok becoming cool. “All my friends are coming on it because they have nothing to do,” says Atkinson. As a result, more young people are jumping ship, from Instagram to TikTok. “Everyone is moving away from Instagram to TikTok,” says Ali. “It’s going to become the No 1 app that everyone is using.”This exodus of Gen Z from Instagram to TikTok mirrors the way millennials dumped Facebook in the 2010s. “Apps are generational in a half-decade sense,” says Milner. “It makes perfect sense that Gen Z would have their own platform and it would be TikTok. If you look at Instagram and everyone on it is aged 25 and older, you want to find your own place.”Even as we abscond from Instagram in droves, TikTok would not exist without it. Milner says: “Something unique about TikTok is how much it is centred on the image of the creator and their physical body… That wouldn’t have happened had Instagram not made us much more used to having our face and bodies being on camera.” Instagram sandblasted away our self-consciousness: it made us comfortable with being on camera.Where 16-year-olds go, adults follow. Celebrities including Lizzo, Britney Spears and Justin Bieber have posted TikTok videos during the lockdown. Non-celebrities are also flooding the app: Leary’s mum has become hooked on the platform. “She keeps telling me that she can’t stop scrolling,” Leary laughs. “TikTok has made it into the mainstream now,” says Nichols. “It’s part of popular culture. A year ago, I’d have to explain what TikTok was to adults.”As TikTok grows up, it loses its countercultural edge. “I discovered it through my daughter,” explains Wendy Paintain, a 54-year-old from Lichfield. “She was throwing herself around the living room, in front of her phone. I thought, what on earth is this rubbish? I downloaded it to have a look. And then I thought, actually, it’s quite entertaining.” She lets rip a loud laugh.Paintain is the creative brains behind the Grandad Joe TikTok account, which features lighthearted videos of her father, Joe, 87, who is self-isolating with her during the pandemic, dancing and making jokes. The Grandad Joe account blew up after Paintain posted a video of Joe looking forlorn in a ransacked supermarket. It went viral, amassing 42.5m views.Since then, Joe has been accepted into the TikTok top creators programme, been invited for TV appearances and has even started to make money from brand partnerships. “He’s grown really quickly,” says Paintain of her father’s TikTok account. “He got 1.6 million followers in nine weeks. He’s even got a blue tick!” (An indicator of a verified celebrity.) She takes me upstairs to speak to Joe, who is having a nap. “I can’t understand why it’s so popular, really,” Joe tells me. “I’m an old fossil. I guess I’m having my 15 minutes of fame. Did you know that I might be going on the telly?”Alongside these older content creators, official bodies have been using TikTok to publish public health information during the coronavirus pandemic. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has uploaded TikTok videos urging people to stay at home the World Health Organization has 1.4 million followers on the app. During the Easter bank holiday weekend, when many feared people may break lockdown rules, due to the warm weather, the UK government ran ads on TikTok, asking people to stay at home.Coronavirus trends float through the app, like driftwood. There’s the #iwillsurvivechallenge (where users wash their hands to the Gloria Gaynor anthem), and the #stayathomechallenge, where NHS workers and TikTok creators urge users to stay indoors, sharing exercise routines or cooking tips to pass the time. (The #stayathomechallenge has more than 2.6bn views.) Bored in the House, the song by Tyga and up-and-coming rapper Curtis Roach, has become TikTok’s unofficial coronavirus anthem: more than 2m videos have been created using the song, with more than 923 million views globally.Healthcare workers have also turned to the app. “Traditional TikTok was a dance platform,” says NHS doctor and former Love Island contestant Alex George. The 29-year-old has 104,000 followers on TikTok, where he posts videos explaining how coronavirus is transmitted or the correct way to wash your hands. “But that’s not true any more. People are engaging with health content.”Coronavirus has helped TikTok to grow up. What was once a platform for uninhibited free play, detached from the cares and concerns of the outside world, has become outward facing. Although this is not the first time that TikTokkers have been civic-minded – during the 2019 Australian bushfires, users ridiculed Australian prime minister Scott Morrison’s handling of the crisis and raised money for affected communities – coronavirus has pushed TikTok into a new prominence. TikTok itself has pledged €62m to support European healthcare workers and communities affected by the pandemic.George is hopeful that his videos will communicate key public health messages to a younger audience. “Young people don’t engage with traditional media forms,” he says, “but they might watch my TikTok videos and educate their grandparents about how to wash their hands properly.”Sorcha Mackenzie joined TikTok long before coronavirus. She did so for the same reason many other people will be downloading it right now: because she was lonely.“At the time, I was pretty socially isolated,” explains Mackenzie, a 28-year-old artist from Melbourne. “I was running this gallery across town, in the docklands, and it’s a pretty desolate area. Not many people come there. I would be there all day, until late at night, on my own every single day.” She was rapidly hooked. “It made the world feel like a very big place,” Mackenzie explains. “You feel interconnected.”Mackenzie believes the new TikTok users are reaching out for the same thing she craved during her days in that abandoned Melbourne dockyard: a sense of community. “It makes perfect sense to me why TikTok has boomed and so many people have downloaded it at the moment,” Mackenzie says. “It offers a salve to isolation.”As the British public hunkers down at home, alone, in some cases literally returning to the bedrooms of its youth, TikTok connects us to an online community of people who are also muddling along as best as they can. “It feels like a safe place,” says Atkinson. “You don’t feel like you’re being judged.”The sublime and the serious, the silly and the strange: TikTok is the perfect platform for these times. As the world changes, people who’d never have dreamed of posting videos of themselves dancing in their pyjamas online or lip-syncing in their kitchen, think: why not?“It feels like such an uncomfortable, incredibly bizarre moment,” says Mackenzie, “and there’s such a big shift in everything. People are forced to take stock of what is important. They lose that sense of ego or barrier of caring about what other people think about them.” TikTok allows us to see others and be seen ourselves. It brings levity to otherwise dark and anxiety-filled days. It lets the air in.Layer by layer, the coronavirus pandemic has peeled away our braggadocio and our hubristic plans for the future and returned all of us to a childlike state. We sit at home, like children, and wait to be told what to do. And while we wait, we play online."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d5e3e989e93c19b7f48f03f255c29a0f27e6a53/0_36_1440_864/master/1440.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26dfec83b1852fe57872f8f543800ef5","title":"show but dont tell why silent zooms are golden for focusing the mind","story":"As isolation stress sets in, many find that sharing quiet online spaces is the key to boosting brain powerThere are Zooms for pub quizzes, Zooms for dinner parties, Zooms for work meetings and now there is a Zoom for sitting together and not talking at all. Behold, the silent Zoom!On paper, the practice of logging on to a video-conferencing site to sit with strangers for an hour without communicating may hold limited appeal. In practice, silent Zooms have become a lifeline in lockdown for users trying to focus on writing, reading, meditation and more.Author Anne Penketh has been retreating to “a virtual monastic retreat” for an hour every day to work on her novel. Initially, she struggled to understand the concept: what would be the point of Zoom without conversation? Finding silence to write in was not a problem for her, so Penketh was sceptical about what would make silence so productive in a potentially awkward group setting. She became a convert from the very first session.Anecdotally, concentration seems more difficult to harness in corona times research shows that, during periods of stress, we see significant decline in our ability to hold information and focus. But having accountability partners is a proven way to boost success, be it in weight loss or curbing an alcohol addiction. The difference with silent Zooms is that the accountability partners are often strangers, and always silent.Penketh says: “As soon as I call up my Word document, it masks the other Zoomers, but I can look at them at any time, with their heads bowed over their laptops. Mercifully, there’s no sharing or reading aloud the results of our labour.”Silent Zooms have been booming with book-lovers for several weeks now: you join, say hello, mute yourself and get down to the business of quietly reading your books together, but alone.Njeri Damali Sojourner-Campbell, a Canadian YouTube bookworm, began hosting silent reading sessions on Zoom last month. She called the project Quarantined Pages and teamed up with six more BookTubers from the US, Trinidad, Nigeria and beyond, to make it a daily club they each host in turn.Sojourner-Campbell (@Onyxpages online) is a lawyer and self-confessed Afrofuturist literature nerd. The idea for Quarantined Pages came in response to the pandemic and her own inability to lose herself in books her attention  had fallen off a cliff. She knew she couldn’t be alone, and made a plan to support and encourage readers to get on the same page.“Reading has gotten many of us through some of the hardest and most uncertain times of our lives. This time will be no different,” she wrote. Now, once the trolls are booted out, up to 20 people regularly sign to join the group. Hosts, including Jessie (@Bowtiesandbooks) and Saajid (@Booksaremysociallife), are on hand to keep the session flowing. It’s a comforting support network, explains Sojourner-Campbell, particularly for those in isolation.Speaking to the Observer, she says: “After our silent reading hour is over, we check in with each other on how our reading is progressing. We share snapshots of each other’s lives.” The community behind the book club is a real motivator for her.“There is a simple pleasure in sitting down quietly and reading, knowing that a group of readers from around the world is doing exactly the same thing,” she says. “The simultaneity of it is magical and inspiring! And we need a little bit of that right now: magic and inspiration.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9268bbaf07368817b86df4c06e1ba2df4d045cd/1_0_2601_1562/master/2601..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e25184c2d9aaa983a5f5acd01cc4a4b8","title":"dont let a weak bladder stop you doing the things you love","story":"Avoiding playing vigorous sports? Sex life gone from G-spot to pee spot? The London Clinic’s Jane Simpson explains what we can do to tackle incontinence – including kegel exercises that you can do wherever you are As a continence nurse specialist, I’ve seen firsthand how overwhelming and upsetting incontinence can be. Patients visit me when things have gone too far – their behaviours change and they’re suddenly avoiding activities such as playing tennis, having sex or even going to the cinema because they’re worried about having to race to the toilet. When you start avoiding things you enjoy, it’s time to take action.Of course, leakage can be troubling at any moment, but during sex it’s particularly distressing (it tends to happen during an orgasm or because of the physical pressure). But the good news is, it doesn’t mean the end of your sex life. In fact, patients always say they wish they’d sought treatment sooner. Even if you don’t experience leakage, sexual sensation and satisfaction can be improved, too – and who wouldn’t want that? As well as increasing blood supply to the vagina and penis, pelvic floor muscle training (or “kegels”, as they’re also known), can improve muscle tone and maintain nerve activity, meaning better sex.When it comes to treatment for accidental leakage, it depends on the type of incontinence people are dealing with. “Stress incontinence” is when we suffer leakage while doing things such as sneezing, coughing or laughing, and it’s common for women to experience this after having a baby, when the pelvic floor is weakest. Leaking during sports or sex falls under this category, due to weakened pelvic floor muscles. The other common type is an overactive bladder, or “urge incontinence”, which feels like you have to urinate suddenly and often.Pelvic floor exercises can help in both instances, but it’s really important to make sure you’re doing them properly – speak to a women’s health physiotherapist or a continence specialist if unsure. They’re simple – just squeeze, lift and hold the anus and vagina, count to five and repeat five times. Improvement is fast – you’ll notice a change in six weeks if you do them regularly. There’s also a brilliant app called MyPFF, which reminds you to do your exercises.If an overactive bladder is the problem, lifestyle changes are key – symptoms can be worsened by too much caffeine, alcohol, fizzy drinks, spicy foods and stress, for example. Certain medications can also play a part, as well as conditions such as constipation, urinary tract infections and vaginal atrophy. Bladder retraining is great – when you have an urge to pee, you teach yourself to hang on, which slowly expands your bladder capacity. It might also be worth avoiding high-impact sports until your pelvic floor is stronger, since too much exercise can make things worse. Medication and surgery could be considered with a specialist, too.I definitely sense a change coming in the way we discuss women’s health issues and incontinence, and it’s great the conversation is becoming more open. There shouldn’t be any shame or stigma around it any more – this sort of condition affects so many of us. I hope people realise improvement is possible and that once the issue is tackled, it really can be life-changing. Recently, a woman visited me in my clinic and said that just having a treatment plan in place has made her feel better. It really is the very least we deserve.As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

It implies it’s a time of things “winding down”, “ending”, “drying up”.Well, most things. Because often, along with menopause, comes bladder weakness. And for many women that means that things get decidedly less dry.Unlike when a girl starts her period, which in many cultures is celebrated, and in the UK is now respected with a government campaign to provide sanitary products in schools, when a woman’s periods begin to end, it’s seen as a change towards old age, towards a body that’s “done”. And even for those going through menopause, it has often felt pretty taboo to talk about the daily problems – especially bladder weakness.“Don’t make me laugh, I’ll wet myself!” might seem like an age-old joke, but it’s one that’s true for menopausal women. And when it comes to our sex lives, it’s no laughing matter. There’s fear and shame and women shut down, choosing not to be intimate for fear of leaking urine during a passionate moment.After all, when do you slip “I’d love to have an early night but I’m worried I’ll wet the bed!” into the conversation, whether you’re with a long-term partner or someone new?The good news is this conversation is being reclaimed by women in the spotlight, who are starting to talk about the final menopause taboo of bladder weakness. Well, we talk so much about starting our periods – why would we not talk about stopping them, and how this affects your love life?It seems there has been a realisation that no matter whether you grace the red carpet and TV screens or you’re on the school run with grandchildren or off to the office, menopause will happen to every woman. Take Gwyneth Paltrow, for example, who released a video for her wellbeing site Goop, saying: “I think menopause gets a really bad rap, and needs a bit of rebranding.” Her video Madame Ovary spoke about mood swings and sweats, while British actress Emma Thompson has joked how hot sweats mean she’s not cold on the red carpet.OK, so the conversation is shifting – just like we can now see a tampon string in a TV ad (thanks to Sport England’s This Girl Can campaign), women are no longer sitting quietly while they deal with the side effects of menopause. But there is one subject that still has to work hard to find its way into our vocabulary – bladder weakness.We can talk hot flushes, night sweats, mood swings – all with increasing honesty. But then there’s Nadia Sawalha, who struggled with incontinence in silence. The usually outspoken TV presenter kept quiet about bladder weakness until she was forced to speak about it after having an accident on national TV.Why is it the one part of menopause women can’t talk about? Well, leaking during the day is one thing – the embarrassment of needing to find some alternative underwear, for example – but when it comes to sex, it’s a different matter altogether. Women who have bladder weakness and might have an accident during sex are likely to close off to their partner, so worried they’ll spoil the intimacy that they don’t have sex and even make up excuses, or “blame” menopause. Intimacy is not synonymous with leakage.After all, when you’re not sure whether you might lose control of your bladder, being intimate isn’t always top of the list. Talk about mixed messages! Women are encouraged to embrace their ageing, to love who they are and how they look – to go grey with glamour and grace, or to wear a bikini with pride. Just don’t mention the bladder weakness, right?!As periods end and change, we have to adjust. The problem is, the world doesn’t seem to adjust with us. And women are left in a strange quagmire of going through something so natural and even primal in silence and, often, shame.And with two-thirds of women over 40 affected with bladder weakness, and many revealing it has affected their mental health, it’s time we became more open and honest about how bladder weakness affects us.Meg Matthews, who has been campaigning about the menopause and runs megsmenopause, says: “Bladder weakness, also called bladder incontinence, is a very common consequence of menopause. It’s not easy to talk about this topic, and, because women don’t always feel confident talking about it, they can feel alone. We need to understand that having bladder weakness is OK. This is the message we need to spread.”But just like when we’re younger, confidence can come back when we use the right products. Once a girl knows she can use a tampon or pad, she’s less worried about her period affecting her day-to-day life. And for women with bladder issues, it’s about a pad that can help you forget there’s even a problem. Then you’ll feel freer to have those more difficult intimacy conversations that you’ve been putting off – and perhaps that early night …As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

The photographer, a Hungarian aristocrat who had given up a career as a diplomat to become a journalist, had based himself in the city after the war. Most often in this period – as a new book of his work, Paris, reveals – his camera dwelt on the lightness of the city as it reinvented itself: lovers dancing by the Seine, little visions of serendipitous comedy or grace in bars and cafes. The formal geometries of this photograph – which captures the Filles de la Charité of the order of St Vincent de Paul – is unusual in this work.Social distancing was, and is, a way of life for the nuns, popularly known as the “grey sisters”, who were required to take four annual vows of poverty, chastity and obedience in the service of the poor. The absence of shadow from the figures suggests that Almasy found his vantage to look into the courtyard at around noon, when the nuns were required to meditate and examine their consciences. The singular dress of the order, the white linen head-dress or cornette – prototype PPE – was established at the time of their foundation in the 17th century.In some ways, this photograph gave an indication of the future direction of Almasy’s work. Later that year, he became an official photographer for the United Nations, working in particular for the World Health Organization, for which over the following decades he produced hundreds of stories, capturing the success and failure of fighting disease across the globe. By the time of his death in 2003, aged 97, he had gathered an archive of 120,000 pictures, always using a diplomat’s discretion: “When I took photographs I never crouched down like a cat about to pounce on its prey,” he said. “I never attacked with my camera.” Paris by Paul Almasy is published in May (teNeues, £12.50)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8aa2d483b88d012cb741ec50b60ec8db989ca519/0_88_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa3ebad11486049f8f1f371b48bab5c5","title":"barefoot walking in canadian rockies banff national park","story":"On moving to the Canadian Rockies, the writer barely left home for fear of bears, but overcame it by feeling the Earth beneath her feetBefore I moved to Banff in 2014, I imagined life in the mountains of Banff national park would be idyllic. I’d work from home in the mornings and swim in icy lakes in the afternoons. Instead, I occupied the shadow side of mountain culture, one not portrayed in tourism brochures. What came next was internet addiction, isolation, social anxiety and insomnia, much of it fuelled by my crippling fear of bears.The one place where I felt safe to walk by myself was a small clearing in the woods on the edge of town. There were long sightlines between the conifers, so I could watch for approaching animals. Still, walking the same 500-metre route between a train track and a small cluster of hotels soon gets old. To mix things up – and because a glamorous early aviator named Beryl Markham used to do it – I began going barefoot.Of course, I felt like an idiot doing this. But I was far from bored. Not now I had to pay attention to rocks and roots. Now I could recognise the small joy of finding a dandelion stalk caught between the toes. It’s true I was missing out on epic things: on mountain climbs and swims. But as spring turned to summer, here were trees seeding clouds, a twig like a chicken foot, and birds singing “chubby cheeks” and “cheeseburger” as they flew away, startled. Here was more than enough.My fear of bear attacks has now faded, but I’ve continued with these barefoot walks, because now I think the joy of gripping rock and feeling sensation exists not just for skilled climbers picking their way through ice to a snowy summit. A softer version can occur while walking under a cleared line of pylons, on a short and familiar walk without needing to hit our body’s maximum rate of oxygen use during exercise, or VO2 max.If you read the hippie articles online, you’ll read that going barefoot is called “earthing” or “grounding.” You’ll read that negative ions from the Earth’s surface spill into a person’s feet as they come into contact with the ground’s electrical charge. These ions, apparently, can charge a person up like a depleted iPad. They can make a person feel happier, calmer, less anxious.Maybe this is true. But maybe scrambling at ground level, touching rocks and roots, just feels good. And we need all the help we can get to feel good right now.Ailsa Ross is the author of the illustrated children’s book The Woman Who Rode a Shark: And 50 More Wild Female Adventurers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f62f9ed605add7b0651115e17de2b0242c6a8772/0_204_5472_3285/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2cf177d897b2c6bf6dae1566d8ddea42","title":"how to visit amsterdam while stuck at home in lockdown rijksmuseum","story":"You can still explore this unique city’s culture from your laptop, says Hans Rooseboom, curator of photography at the RijksmuseumThe Rijksmuseum has been digitising for years. Hundreds of thousands of images from our collection are now available on Rijksstudio to view, download, print, turn into puzzles … Our best-known artwork is Rembrandt’s The Night Watch: catch up with the current restoration project at Operation Night Watch, or take a virtual tour of the museum with our free app.We have started doing some things specially for the lockdown, such as Masterpieces Up Close, an interactive platform exploring 18 paintings, including Vermeer’s The Milkmaid. We’re also producing three-minute video talks by curators – mine will be about 19th-century British amateur photographer Anna Atkins: the first person to come up with the idea of putting photographs in a book, she took striking cyanotype images of plants, which look like modern art, and it took her 10 years (1843-1853) to make her books by hand. The Van Gogh Museum has lots of ways to enjoy the museum at home, such as reading Vincent’s letters or using the Unravel Van Gogh app, for details you can’t see with the naked eye. At the Anne Frank House, virtual visitors can look around the Secret Annex online. The Stedelijk Museum of modern art is streaming live tours of its permanent collection and one of its temporary exhibitions, such as the new show by Korean video artist Nam June Paik, every Friday at 2pm the tours are then available on Facebook and YouTube.And outside of the city’s museums, sightseeing company Stromma is working on a virtual cruise along the city’s canals.A writer who gives a good introduction to the city is Nescio, pen name of Jan Hendrik Frederik Grönloh (1883-1961), who is famous in the Netherlands. He wrote novellas and short stories about penniless artists and poets, mostly before or during the first world war. His work wasn’t translated into English until 2012, and is published as Amsterdam Stories.I also recommend two photographers – some of their images are on the City Archives website. The first is George Hendrik Breitner (1857-1923), who walked the streets of Amsterdam for years, taking snapshots. His fascinating body of work is the best record we have of the city from that period. The second is Ed van der Elsken (1925-1990), a street photographer and film-maker. He is best-known for Love on the Leftbank, his photobook of Paris, but he also took great portraits of 1950s Amsterdam. Martin Parr is a big fan. Breitner and Elsken are the two best guides you could have to the streets of Amsterdam.My Rembrandt, a 2019 documentary by Oeke Hoogendijk, is a fascinating story about various people and their relationship with the artist. It is partly set in Amsterdam, and you can watch it online, for example on mubi. By contrast, The Hitman’s Bodyguard is a recent Amsterdam-based comedy-thriller starring Samuel L Jackson and Ryan Reynolds.Ramses Shaffy (1933-2009) was the country’s most famous singer and actor. He was born in France – his mother was a Polish-Russian countess, his father an Egyptian diplomat – and lived in Amsterdam for much of his life. Most of his songs are in Dutch, but they are still enjoyable for English speakers. He was a fan of French chanteurs, and that shows.And while live music is off the agenda, watch past performances of classical music on the Royal Concertgebouw’s websiteMy favourite Instagram account about Amsterdam is @streetartfrankey – it’s really funny and inventive. The same photos are published in the Amsterdam daily Het Parool.Food in Amsterdam is cosmopolitan these days. There is a traditional Dutch cuisine, but it isn’t too famous for a reason! One of the few traditional Dutch dishes we cook in my house is a kind of comfort food called stamppot. You boil potatoes with one or more other vegetables (carrots, ene, kale, onions), then drain, add hot milk and mash. We serve it with smoked sausage and pickles.We drink a lot of beer in the Netherlands, so visit virtually with a Dutch beer. Heineken is the most famous, but there are lots of small breweries in Amsterdam, such as Brouwerij ’t Ij. We also like making home brew – a good activity during lockdown. And jenever, Dutch gin, is having a revival among young people. They drink it neat, but it’s strong, so you should eat something with it! It goes well with beef sausages, cheese and mustard."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5036e24eb83d13d28a8f35d22f0279b498687369/0_468_4143_2485/master/4143.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21774ea353488836d5079458288b3fc2","title":"bbc race across the world","story":"BBC Race Across the World pairs are now on the home straight after a fraught journey from Mexico City to the tip of South AmericaIt has been quite a journey. And that’s just for viewers. Tonight sees the finale of Race Across the World, the BBC2 series in which five pairs of travellers competed to be the fastest getting from Mexico City to the most southerly city in the world, Ushuaia in Argentina.Covering 15,000 miles in two months and passing though 16 countries, with checkpoints in Honduras, Panama, Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, Brazil and Chile, the competitors had to complete their journeys without flying or using mobile phones, and with only £1,453 cash in their pockets at the beginning.Picking up jobs along the way, the five pairs became four when one couple had their money stolen and had to withdraw. Part of the route had to be redrawn when civil unrest erupted.The show’s popularity has grown as lockdown has dragged on, with audiences increasing week on week. It is set to become BBC Two’s most-popular programme this year, if 3.4 million watch tonight’s finale at 8pm.Part of the show’s appeal is the opportunity it has offered a nation under lockdown to travel vicariously. But it is the dynamics between the competitors – known only by their first names – that has delighted the show’s fans and prompted frenzied discussion on social media as to who the nation wants to win the £20,000 prize for coming first.Whoever wins, all involved said they had loved the experience – despite the many low points. And all said it had changed them.Twentysomething brother-and-sister duo Dom and Lizzie visibly matured as the show progressed. Both had problems with self-esteem but their attempts at hitchhiking earned them new confidence.After Dom, a teaching assistant, collapsed in Bolivia, prompting an intervention from the emergency medic who travels with the teams, it looked like the pair would not be able to finish.“I had never seen Dom like that before: I felt helpless,” said Lizzie, a chalet host. “It was a hard decision choosing to carry on so soon after, and we really struggled for that whole leg.”The pair say their decision to stay with the indigenous Bribri people in Costa Rica marked a turning point. “I think it was the first time Dom and I really reflected on our relationship,” Jen said. “Especially as they explained to us how important family is to them.”Husband-and-wife team Rob and Jen’s bickering has produced some of the show’s more comic moments, although their epic argument in La Paz, Bolivia pushed them to their limits.“We were at breaking point with struggling to communicate with each other, not eating, not sleeping, constantly on the go and making decisions without any information,” Rob said. “But then again, we needed it to happen. It was also the turning point for us as we were then able to rebuild the way we interact with each other.”Jen added: “I’m actually glad it happened. It was the blowout we needed.”Mother Jo, whose relationship with her permanently hungry son Sam has been one of the show’s highlights, fulfilled a lifelong dream on her journey.“Working on the gaucho ranch with the horses in Argentina had been on my bucket list for a long time – it was such a special moment,” she said.One episode in which Sam, who has ADHD, looked about to quit had viewers on tenterhooks. “It was really touch and go if I’d continue at that moment, but I managed to work through it and I think it gave me some confidence,” he said. One personal high was working on a family farm in Argentina, because it reminded him of his late grandfather. Another was surfing in Brazil.Uncle-and-nephew combination Emon and Jamiul were often the first to finish a stage. Emon said his favourite moment was trekking up Vinicunca, also known as Rainbow Mountain, in Peru.“My nephew struggled on the mountain with altitude and asthma, but with sheer determination we were able to make it to the peak. It was a sense of achievement for us both in our relationship and in the race.”Jamiul said the experience helped him discover an inner strength. “It taught me I can push myself and persevere in times of hardship and struggle.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7384f9f9e6e060d15b460d4bd4def3d9438481e/0_495_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3866028af5f2988fca455ba8d4b8a273","title":"the week in tv after life gangs of london emergence have i got news for you and more","story":"Ricky Gervais’s After Life struggles second time round, as 21st-century London’s answer to Peaky Blinders gets off to a violent start. And how long can live shows survive via video-call?Ricky Gervais is, take your pick, ever reinventive (a la Madonna, Lady Gaga, the royals) or ever mutating (the worst kind of spirally viruses, the royals). A year ago, in Tony Johnson, subject of his latest drama, After Life, he combined aspects of past characters: The Office’s gloriously unself-aware Brent the more savvy Andy Millman in Extras the saccharine platitudes that sat so ill in Derek alongside gags about mental health or other disabilities. After Life was a surprising runaway hit on Netflix, for an arguably slight comedy about a very singular, small-town man’s depression after the loss of his wife, and how an angry man learned to be kind again.I happen to like Gervais. Many don’t. I relish his takes on some complex aspects of life – freedom of speech, organised religion, disorganised religion of the variety that tends to revere big lumps of rock or small ones of crystal, people who describe themselves as “people people”. I like his loyalty to actors, although with such talents as Kerry Godliman and Ashley Jensen around it’s surely not hard. And Gervais, bless, has done it again – same local paper, staffed by the soft of brain and low of self-esteem, same gallery of township grotesques, same lonely flat occupied by lovely dog Brandy and many long nights of the soul, pills to hand and large glass of red and videos of his late Lisa.And I think I see what he’s trying to do with the formula. To show how every single one of life’s travails, when it angers one inordinately, can be surmounted, no matter one’s grief, by a half-sigh of tolerance, of kindness – as long as the sugar is intercut with Gervais showing how mean he, and life, can be.Part of the problem with this six-part second series is the scatological glee with which he hugs these acid segments. So it’s not enough to have a cartoonishly unempathetic therapist Paul Kaye has to make Chris Finch (The Office’s rampant misogynist) look achingly woke. Not enough to have am-dram spoiled by a fat kid farting – he has to soil himself on stage. And, no matter that the arc of this second series is ultimately rewarding, hugely if quietly aided by the likes of Penelope Wilton and Diana Morgan – I’m just not sure whether this second journey is worth the lack of laughs it takes to get there. Because it is, indeed, just less funny. And if the message is the only thing, never mind the laughs crude or otherwise, I’m not sure whether it’s worth the saying.In Gangs of London, which dropped a couple of nights ago with all the finesse of a torched body thudding from 80 storeys on to an orphans’ daisied picnic, there is, as normally there has to be in the way of such things, a sudden Vacuum at the Top. Patriarch Colm Meaney, decades building up his criminal empire, and consolidating it to involve and include the more mephitic likes of Albanians, Pakistanis, Italo-Iranians, whatever, in our capital’s melting pot, has been offed, in iffy circumstances, and by a couple of lowlife “pikeys” – their language, not mine. And thus the terrible hardscrabble for a new supremacy begins.It’s actually really good, despite my sell: relentlessly watchable. It probably features fewer C- and F-words than After Life, though that’s saying little, and a plot that, though notionally complex, hangs together when you think about it in hindsight, and a constant menacing air of waiting for the second shoe to drop. It features grand London settings from Fitzrovia to Brick Lane, and an undercover ex-squaddie supercop in the shape of Sope Dirisu. What it does not excel in so far is in being as good as Peaky Blinders: the fiefdom’s sons are too pasty-angry to be Tommy Shelby. Yet. What it does excel in is the violence. At once reekingly godawful and supremely credible, every blow will rattle your teeth: you have to admire the technical skill being put into what’s going on even while cringeing from what’s going on, like watching a country and western concert or The One Show.Emergence is the latest intriguer to come from Fox, and features a plane crash, a lost girl survivor, some sort of telekinesis, some sort of secret military station drone experiment, and so far so yadda yadda snore… but. It also has Allison Tolman, so outstanding in the first televised incarnation of Fargo, and an equally up-to-the-velvet supporting cast, and 13 episodes – always a good sign – and is not, so far, letting me go.How long can “live” shows, especially those allegedly based on wit, survive video-calling and self-isolation? Graham Norton seems to work, chiefly because he’s good, and talking one to one, with decent guests, and pauses before question and answer. Plus, he gets to mull on the concept of his own show, the big red chair being designed to let “ordinary” people tell their own “stories”: “That’s the concept anyway. In practice, it’s usually New Zealanders telling how they shat themselves.”For similar reasons The Mash Report is still working, although Nish Kumar is somewhat relentlessly partisan for some tastes.

They are found all over Africa and Asia, providing sustenance for hundreds of millions of people. The wet market in Wuhan believed to be the source of Covid-19 contained a number of wild animals, including foxes, rats, squirrels, wolf pups and salamanders.He told the : “The name of the game is reducing certain amounts of activity so the probability of that kind of leap becomes small enough that it’s inconsequential. The big difficulty is that if you just shut them down – which in many ways would be the ideal thing – they will be topped up with black markets, and that’s even harder to deal with because it’s clandestine.”The pandemic will cost the global economy $1tn this year, according to the World Economic Forum, with vulnerable communities impacted the most, and nearly half of all jobs in Africa could be lost. “This is not nature’s revenge, we did it to ourselves. The solution is to have a much more respectful approach to nature, which includes dealing with climate change and all the rest,” Lovejoy said.His comments echo those of a study published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B earlier this month that suggested the underlying cause of the present pandemic was likely to be increased human contact with wildlife.Experts are ided about how to regulate the vast trade in animals, with many concerned the poorest are most at risk from a crackdown. Urgent action on the wildlife trade is clearly needed, said Dr Amy Dickman, a conservation biologist from the University of Oxford, but she was “alarmed” by calls for indiscriminate bans on the wildlife trade.She is one of more than 250 signatories of an open letter to the World Health Organization and United Nations Environment Programme saying any transition must contribute to – and not detract from – the livelihoods of the world’s most vulnerable people, many of whom depend on wild resources for survival. Other signatories include representatives from the African Wildlife Foundation, the Frankfurt Zoological Society and IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature).The letter reads: “Covid-19 is inflicting unprecedented social and economic costs on countries and communities, with the poor and vulnerable hardest hit. The virus’s suspected links with a Chinese ‘wet market’ has led to calls to ban wet markets and restrict or end the trade, medicinal use and consumption of wildlife. However, indiscriminate bans and restrictions risk being inequitable and ineffective.”Scientists and NGOs are concerned that over-simplistic and indiscriminate restrictions will exacerbate poverty and inequality, resulting in an increase in criminality. This could accelerate the exploitation and extinction of species in the wild, authors of the letter warn. “People often seem more willing to point the finger at markets far away, as bans there will not affect their everyday lives – although they will often affect the rights of extremely vulnerable people,” said Dickman.There are also concerns about the impacts of an outright ban on a number of indigenous populations, such as tribes in Orinoquia and Amazonia, with representatives describing it as an “attack” on their livelihoods.Mama Mouamfon, who is based in Cameroon and directs an NGO called Fondation Camerounaise de la Terre Vivante (FCTV), said banning the trade would damage livelihoods: “Bush meat is very important for people in the forest because it’s one of the best ways to get animal protein. With this issue of poverty and people living in remote areas, it’s not easy for them to look for good meat,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/960c652e1798eb228615535fc838451a1eed2f2d/0_243_4320_2592/master/4320.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2f3b4aa65230457a71e09d77f133eb9","title":"outcry as rich saint tropez residents given coronavirus tests","story":"Neighbourhood of Les Parcs de Saint Tropez reportedly screened as local hospital staff do withoutOn the sunny Côte d’Azur, playground of the rich and famous, lockdown life in Les Parcs de Saint Tropez is good.The Mediterranean – accessed via a private beach – is a little cool this time of year, but the luxury mansions and château here on the Cap Saint Pierre have swimming pools and if the temperature drops below 70F, as it did briefly this week, there is always the tennis courts or vast landscaped gardens.There is no need to carry an authorisation letter to go jogging when the 270-acre gated and guarded domain is chez vous.Now local officials are investigating reports that super-wealthy residents of the complex overlooking the Bay de Canoubiers on the French Riviera also had access to private coronavirus tests at a time when even local hospital staff face a lack of screening.The local newspaper Var-Matin reported around 60 of Les Parcs’ residents and their friends had been offered Covid-19 tests at a private unit on the grounds staffed by a doctor and technician. This was carried out as part of a “totally private screening operation” allegedly organised by the president of Les Parcs Association, Jean-Louis Oger, a wealthy French pharmacist who has several clinics and laboratories in the south of France.Less fortunate neighbours reacted with anger. “Testing reserved for residents of Les Parcs and their friends under the noses of Tropéziens … a great example of solidarity,” one told Var-Matin.At the Saint-Tropez hospital, medical staff told the paper they were scandalised. “It’s not right that we don’t have a single test and it’s a nightmare to get hold of one,” a nurse said.Saint-Tropez’s mayor, Jean-Pierre Tuveri, attempted to defuse the row. He defended the tests, claiming the wealthy residents were willing participants in a clinical blood trial and accused social networks and the press of distorting the facts.In a statement published on the town hall website, he said the blood tests had been carried out on people “in a private domain and unpaid” as a sample to be analysed by certain, unnamed “laboratories”. And he insisted the operation was carried out “under the aegis of the Pasteur Institute” to whom the results would be sent.The test could not be used by local hospital staff because it had not been approved by the health authorities, he added.However, the Pasteur Institute in Paris, a national centre for developing and authorising tests, said it knew nothing about those carried out at Les Parcs.“This is a trial carried out by a private laboratory. The laboratory is doing its own thing in its own corner. We’re not advocating wildcat studies they need to be evaluated with the results of baseline tests,” it told French journalists.“He quotes us and links us to this when we were not at all aware of it,” the institute added.The regional health authority, ARS Paca, also said they had not heard of or approved the Les Parcs Covid-19 testing.“We don’t know anything about it and we’re going to conduct an investigation to get to the bottom of it,” an ARS spokesperson said.Sébastien Debeaumont, director of ARS Paca, confirmed this, adding that any Covid-19 centre had to be meet very specific regulation. “We knew nothing about this local initiative, having not been informed in advance, he said.The starting price for a basic 400 sqm house with a 5,000 sqm garden but no sea view in Le Parcs, first built in the 1950s, is around €5m, a price that doubles for sea view. Properties, some of which have tennis courts on the roof and swimming pools that cover to become terraces, rent for €200,000 a week, according to Capital magazine. Six heliports are authorised in the grounds as long as there are no more than two take-offs a day. Capital magazine reported that some residents are happy to pay €1,000 a month for 100 Mbits a second internet connections.France has more than 119,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 according to government figures. There have been 21,340 deaths reported in hospitals and care homes from the virus."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b16c43a3edc43b37ba71384b17178a9a146b342/0_0_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec07c654a201ea926b0bf2e6055d7f59","title":"paris banlieue virus amplifies inequality seine saint denis","story":"Seine-Saint-Denis has long been one of France’s poorest areas, but the pandemic has laid bare social rifts as never beforeIn his small apartment in Paris’s outer suburbs , the 85-year-old’s food cupboards were bare. When volunteers arrived, the man was down to a crust of old baguette and a few dry biscuits. Living alone and with no family, the pensioner, who had come from Morocco to France after the war to help rebuild the railways, was too afraid to leave his home.“He was trapped there with nothing to eat and hadn’t seen his doctor in weeks,” said Abdelaali El Badaoui, founder of charity Banlieues Santé.“He hadn’t eaten for days and was frightened and confused. We were able to give him supplies for a week and call his doctor to arrange a remote consultation. Since then we’ve been doing weekly follow-up visits and dropping off his medicine. He’s doing well.” France has now been in coronavirus lockdown for six weeks, and has seen more than 21,000 deaths from the virus. But social distancing in the neuf-trois, the deprived Seine-Saint-Denis département north of Paris, looks very different to that of Saint-Tropez, where billionaires in a gated compound were reported last week to be paying for private Covid-19 tests.“We are locked down in our inequality,” said the Seine-Saint-Denis MP Alexis Corbière. “The virus has just amplified the problems the banlieue has had for a long time. It has revealed how wide and deep the social fracture really is.” With 1.6 million inhabitants, making it one of France’s most densely populated departments, Seine-Saint-Denis has the lowest number of doctors per head, but the highest rates of obesity and diseases including cancer, diabetes and asthma.“Many arrive at hospital already in a critical condition because they tend not to have regular care or contact with the health system,” said Corbière, a member of the hard-left La France Insoumise. “And a lot of people here have jobs that can’t be done from home: underpaid frontline jobs like cleaners, builders, refuse collectors – people who have to use public transport and so are more exposed.”Mehdi Bigaderne, 37, co-founder of Aclefeu, a collective set up in 2005 after rioting in the mostly north African Clichy-sous-Bois neighbourhood, said problems had all been exacerbated by the virus.“It has exploded the myth that we are all equal because clearly we’re not. People are trying to respect the lockdown, but what do you do if you’re a family of five or more in a small apartment on the 15th floor? How do you keep children in? How do you feed them when the markets where you buy cheap fruit and vegetables have closed and you can’t afford supermarkets? How can families whose children normally eat in school canteens now make three meals a day?“It’s not new that Seine-Saint-Denis is a place of inequality, discrimination and social problems, but coronavirus has crystallised this.”As well as distributing “lockdown packages” of food, toiletries and a mask, Banlieues Santé has recruited doctors to make multilingual videos explaining how people can protect themselves and has translated the document that all French people needed to carry to leave their homes into around 20 languages.Among those it has helped is Yvette Maurice, 85, who lives alone in a 12-storey block. Suffering from diabetes and high blood pressure, she was worried about buying food. “I received food packages for the last three weeks and it was a huge relief as it meant I could stay at home,” said Maurice. Badaoui, a hospital cleaner who trained as a nurse, recalls a single mother of four who had symptoms of Covid-19 but was threatened with the sack if she didn’t turn up for her cleaning job: “We were able to advise her of her rights – that she could self-isolate at home without losing her job. In so many cases, social problems have to be resolved before medical issues.” Not all his stories have happy endings. On a visit to one housing estate, volunteers found an elderly Algerian man, a former caretaker who had lived in France since the 1940s, dead in his home.“It’s like nothing we have experienced,” Badaoui said. “We are the very last chance for many people. We act as a bridge between the health service and those most in need, some of whom are no longer in contact with health services or never were.”Seine-Saint-Denis saw clashes last week between youths and police, sparked by a motorcyclist hitting a police car and being thrown from his bike, suffering a broken leg. There were accusations of heavy-handed policing of the lockdown.“The banlieue is not aflame,” said Corbière. “We’re talking about a few fireworks, not riots. We’ve seen worse.”Bigaderne agreed: “Those involved in recent events are a very small minority and a lot of it is down to frustration.”The government and local authorities have pledged emergency payments to struggling families, but many in Seine-Saint-Denis will see little benefit .“Not everyone, including the homeless and those without official papers, has the same access to rights,” Bigaderne said. “If you don’t reduce the social inequalities in these areas, there will always be problems. We’ve been saying this for 15 years. We cannot keep putting plasters over serious wounds.”Corbière added that the crisis had also shown the depth of human solidarity within the banlieue’s many communities: “The virus has rocked society. Will it change things? We can but hope.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6a6edb85e1236c02a058fee6f84dcd6a7e97680/0_172_4958_2975/master/4958.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46d5a9fbbc4993b638333fd5358d1e72","title":"5g coronavirus and contagious superstition","story":"The attacks on phone masts and the spreading of anti-vaxx conspiracies are all part of the same strain of misinformation. But is evidence-based reality going to make a comeback?The most prominent American anti-vaxxer, Robert Kennedy Jr, meanwhile, amplified an unhinged conspiracy that believes Bill Gates is using the virus as part of a supposed plot to control the world’s population through immunisation.All pandemics trail a ready market in superstition, quackery and prejudice – a sense of powerlessness generates in some the need for catch-all theories, however deranged. At the time of the great plague in London, the spread of miracle cures and scapegoating prophecy was almost harder to contain than the infection itself. As part of its strategy the government was moved, Daniel Defoe reported in his A Journal of the Plague Year, to “suppress the printing of such Books and Pamphlets as terrify the People”. The efforts to prevent the spread of damaging conspiracies across our own media have shared a similar profile – and often a similar success rate – to the efforts to curb the disease.In this respect, the pandemic is something of a test case for the social media monopolies of Silicon Valley to deliver on their widely trumpeted commitment to slow the spread of dangerously false information. After being confronted with the evidence of manipulation in the elections of 2016, and the spread of such vile conspiracies as that which argued that the Sandy Hook massacre was a hoax, Facebook and Google and the rest have been forced to step up efforts to monitor and block extreme misinformation campaigns on their various platforms. Arguably, that effort is finally starting to show some effect.Counterintuitively, some evidence for that might be found in the response to the most pernicious of the current conspiracies which has, entirely without scientific foundation, sought to link the spread of coronavirus with the rollout of the 5G data network. The real-world effects have been the acts of vandalism and arson against mobile phone masts in the past weeks. Up to 50 such attacks have been reported, mostly on Merseyside and in the West Midlands, including the burning of the 5G mast adjacent to the new Nightingale hospital outside Birmingham. Thinking about contagious ideas now, I recall interviewing Daniel Dennett, the philosopher of evolution, back in 2006, just before the launch of Twitter. Dennett was talking excitedly of a word that he and Richard Dawkins had coined to describe how Darwinist idea-germs could be sent into battle against the politicised viruses of creationism. He called these idea-germs “memes”. Nah, I thought at the time it will never catch on.In the 14 years since, it has become second nature to trace the originators of particularly incendiary memes. A story in Wired magazine located the origin of the 5G conspiracy in an interview of 22 January in a Belgian newspaper with Kris Van Kerckhoven, a general practitioner from Putte, near Antwerp. He was quoted as saying that “5G is life-threatening”, but then added a speculative comment (“I have not done a fact-check”) that linked that falsehood to the virus then confined to China. The “link” became an ill-advised clickbait headline. (The piece, in Het Laatste Nieuws, was subsequently withdrawn.)If these words marked the moment when the 5G conspiracy established its RNA, however, the “wet market” for those ideas to jump species and spread human to human was a conference given on 11 March at the Health and Human Rights Summit, in Tucson, Arizona. The headline act was the original anti-vaxxer Andrew Wakefield, the discredited English doctor, who was struck off by the GMC after being shown to have deliberately falsified evidence to make bogus claims of a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. Wakefield was in this case upstaged by a Californian, Thomas Cowan, author of Cancer and the New Biology of Water, who is serving a five-year suspension from medical practice for prescribing unlicensed drugs to cancer patients. Cowan claimed, entirely falsely, that Covid-19 was caused by electromagnetic waves and, also incorrectly, that Wuhan, where it originated, had been the guinea-pig city for 5G.Videos of this talk were viewed 1.8 million times on YouTube and widely shared on Facebook before the sites moved to take the posts down.In their book A Lot of People Are Saying, their study of conspiracism in the Trump era, Russell Muirhead and Nancy Rosenblum classify people such as Cowan as “conspiracy entrepreneurs”. Once he had seeded his conspiracy virus, multiple other wilder mutations followed, some linking it to an Illuminati plot, others to the “blood sacrifice” of Kobe Bryant in a helicopter crash.In Britain, some of those contagious fantasies found a population in which they could move as easily as coronavirus among Cheltenham Festival racegoers. Their combination with media attention around the decision to allow Huawei to supply some of the UK’s 5G infrastructure, and the fact that telecoms engineers were designated key workers, appears to have ignited dangerous lockdown fears. Challenges were laid down in Facebook groups and Reddit threads for “firestarters” to “take the 5G out”.Social media platforms, fearing sanction, took long overdue action. Facebook has accepted a responsibility to remove false claims that 5G technology causes Covid-19, while promising a modification that will direct people who look for such content toward accurate information from the NHS and the WHO.Some of the belated efforts to police “alt-right” conspiracy content in the past couple of years are also helping to contain the spread of the madness. There has been no more virulent “conspiracy entrepreneur” than Alex Jones and his web channel, InfoWars. Jones has predictably loud-hailered the 5G and anti-vaxx lines: “This is the plan, folks,” he grunted at his viewers. “They plan – if they’ve fluoridated you and vaccinated you and stunned you and mesmerized you with the TV and put you in a trance – on killing you.” Meanwhile, “they” were determined “to make sure you don’t learn about the known antivirals”. Prominent among these, apparently, were Jones’s own “wellness” products: SuperSilver Whitening Toothpaste and ABL Nano Silver Gargle which, he claimed, “kills the sars-corona family at point-blank range”. (The only scientifically proven effect of the active ingredient in these products, colloidal silver, is that it turns your skin blue.)Up until last year Jones’s vicious untruths would have been spread by millions of followers on YouTube and Facebook and Twitter. However, with trials pending involving the bereaved Sandy Hook parents he repeatedly called “actors”, his platforms were finally shut down for “hate speech”.Having curtailed some of the spread of the most noxious threads, social media platforms apparently hope to rely, at least a little, on herd immunity to contain the conspiracy. When celebrity “super-spreaders” of the 5G claims have emerged in recent weeks – including the actor Woody Harrelson, the boxer Amir Khan and the breakfast show host Eamonn Holmes – they have the experienced the chill of immediate social media isolation and distancing.It is still early days in this ongoing battle between fact and fantasy, but perhaps the general global compliance with lockdown measures, and the increasing appetite for verifiable facts and figures, indicates that rational voices might yet be in the ascendancy.Even those on the frontline of protest against distancing measures in the southern American states have looked conspicuously conflicted. Several have marched under “coronahoax” banners while wearing face masks, hedging bets. Perhaps they have listened to the snake-oil “hunches” and tantrums of their president while the bodies pile up, and wondered. Perhaps they fear, privately, the tragic irony in the story of John McDaniel, 60, of Ohio, who spent March posting conspiracy – “Does Anybody Have The Guts to Say This Covid-19 is a Political Ploy? Asking For A Friend. Prove Me Wrong” – before, last week, becoming the first person in his county to die from the disease.History shows that pandemics change things in surprising ways. Much has been made of the superstition that has attended other epidemics, but they have also generated great advances in public health, including vaccination even the wildest conspiracy entrepreneur probably knows deep down that the only way out of the current tragedy is careful application of the scientific method.In the past few weeks we have been exposed to a reality that all human generations before ours – and many millions in our own times in less advantaged parts of the planet – have known as a fact of life: that we exist in a precarious world of rapidly transmitted infectious diseases without an obvious cure. Though the sight of mass graves being dug and economies floundering has caused some to double-down on their pet grievances, to set fire to phone masts and indulge their fantasies about the Illuminati, it may yet cause more to think about getting back in touch with reality."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04bae8e1d118a5a894f0932ed3cfc24dff6c3488/0_117_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9adcfacc263e1b1332fec9b7a7e8b619","title":"coronavirus face masks why covering up is becoming the new normal","story":"Even western countries are starting to accept that shielding our faces could save lives … whether you live in New York or BerlinWhen coronavirus emerged in China, people across much of the region were quick to start wearing some form of face mask when they went out in public. Memories of the Sars epidemic were still strong, and there is a cultural tradition of wearing masks to protect oneself and others.In the west, however, even though masks sold out as fast as hand sanitiser in chemists and online as people stockpiled supplies, initially there was widespread reluctance to wearing face coverings in public.The ide was so strong that, as racism against people of east Asian heritage rose sharply, some stopped wearing masks because face protection had become a focus for abuse, discrimination and stigma.A few weeks later, masks and improvised substitutes are rapidly becoming the new normal in cities from New York to Berlin, and those who go out without their nose and mouth covered risk censure or stronger penalties.Millions of people are even learning how to create their own as they wait for supplies to return to stores around the world.Take up has been slow because, for months, scientists and authorities were ided on whether they help slow the spread of the disease. The World Health Organization today still recommends their use by anyone coughing or sneezing, but says healthy people should use them only if taking care of someone infected with the coronavirus.It seems increasingly likely that where masks do provide a benefit outside a surgical setting, it is for society as a whole, not the inidual wearing it. Rather than preventing the wearer picking up an infection, they may be more likely to prevent carriers of the virus from passing it on, whether through coughs, sneezing, during conversation or even while yawning.There are concerns that masks may give a false sense of security, as they do not block all particles, and leave the eyes uncovered and open to infection.But as the coronavirus crisis drags on, and governments look for ways out of economically devastating lockdowns, they are unlikely to vanish any time soon. Here are how different countries have regulated mask supplies and mask-wearing as they battle coronavirus.The Czech Republic was the first country in Europe to make face covering mandatory in public, with a decree in mid-March. In an effort to set a public example, the prime minister, Andrej Babiš, and other politicians have addressed parliament and made television appearances wearing masks. The government claimed the policy helped slow the spread of the disease, and bring the outbreak under control with relatively low casualty numbers.Anticipating high demand, Taiwan started rationing masks in January, giving everyone a weekly allowance they could buy at designated pharmacies. The country also invested millions in creating new mask manufacturing capacity, expanding so much that there is a quota for Taiwanese living abroad, and started donating masks to some coronavirus hotspots.There is no legal obligation to wear a mask, but because of the experience of living through the Sars epidemic, people are used to wearing them in crowded places.On 15 April, Angela Merkel recommended people wear masks, and since then all 16 German states have made it mandatory on public transport and while shopping. Masks can also include any kind of face covering, such as scarves or bandanas. However, most cities have said they won’t actually enforce the rules or issue fines, because they don’t have enough staff.Masks are not required, but the government advises people to wear them on public transport and in situations where social distancing is difficult, and started handing them out when it loosened the restrictions on non-essential workers. There have also been problems with supply defective masks from a Chinese company have resulted in 1,000 health workers requiring isolation over fears they may have been infected with the virus.In early April, America’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reversed months of official insistence that healthy people did not need to wear masks, and recommended everyone wear non-medical face coverings in public. A national shortage of masks means it is almost impossible to buy them, and this has sparked an interest in sewing across the country as people try to make their own instead.President Donald Trump said the guidelines were voluntary, and he would not cover his face, although his wife Melania shared a photo of herself wearing a mask, and encouraged others to do so. Other officials have warned that the face coverings must not replace hand washing and social distancing.Mask-wearing is common in Japan, but as the country stepped up its battle against the pandemic, it announced early this month that it would supply every household with two washable, reusable masks at a cost to the nation of £350m. That effort has been marred by complaints about mould, insects and stains, with the government forced to replace some of the face coverings, Reuters reported. Electronics company Sharp has halted online sales of masks until further notice, after its website crashed due to overwhelming demand.Masks have been worn in public by the majority of the population in Hong Kong since the epidemic began. Their use has been supported, but not mandated, by the government. There have been some tensions over the reluctance of many in the city’s large expat community to cover their faces, and some health experts are now calling for covering up to be made compulsory.Despite efforts to tackle the virus, authorities have doubled down on an “anti-mask ban” brought in last year to try to halt the city’s months-long protest movement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59ecddc09e34c01a8e379b003155bc85963630d6/0_257_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2fd33912581e7d1fb7586aa3ca2e761b","title":"coronavirus french pm to set out road to normality restrictions ease in australia","story":"Western Australia and Queensland cautiously loosen social distancing rules, while Beijing bans ‘uncivilised’ behaviourThe French prime minister, Edouard Philippe, will present the national strategy for emerging from the coronavirus lockdown to the French parliament on Tuesday, his office has announced.The pandemic has killed 22,614 people in France since the start of March, with officials on Saturday reporting 369 new deaths in the previous 24 hours.

Philippe’s presentation to the National Assembly on Tuesday will be followed by a debate and a vote.France’s move comes as the World Health Organization has warned against “immunity passports” for recovered patients, seen as a possible tool for countries preparing to reopen their economies. “There is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from \u001dCovid-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection,” said a WHO statement.In Australia, some state governments have announced relaxation of social distancing. Western Australia said that from Monday, 10 people would be allowed to gather indoors, and resume “non-contact recreational activities” such as private picnics, fishing, boating, hiking and camping. The Queensland government said family picnics, non-essential shopping and trips of up to 50km from home would be allowed from next Saturday.Meanwhile Australia’s federal government cited preliminary findings that there is very little risk of transmission among schoolchildren, or from children to adults including teachers. The states are in charge of schools and the central government in Canberra has been pushing for them to reopen.In China, the city government of Beijing has banned “uncivilised” behaviour such as not covering the mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, in a new set of regulations to improve public hygiene. The laws aim to promote “civilised behaviour” to combat the pandemic that has infected more than 82,000 people in China alone.Rule-breakers will be slapped with fines for offences including not wearing a mask in public when ill, the municipal government said. The laws also require public places to set up one-metre distance markers and to provide communal chopsticks and serving spoons for shared meals.Citizens must also “dress neatly” in public and not go shirtless – an apparent reference to the so-called “Beijing bikini”, in which men roll T-shirts up to expose their stomachs in hot weather.Authorities reported no new deaths for the 10th straight day in China, where the virus originated. South Korea reported just 10 fresh cases, the eighth day in a row its daily increase was under 20. There were no new deaths for the second straight day.In the US, the states of Georgia, Oklahoma and Alaska started loosening restrictions on businesses despite warnings from experts that such steps might be premature. Donald Trump has said he will no longer give daily coronavirus briefings after he promoted the dangerous internal use of disinfectant as a possible treatment – the latest in a string of debunked, unproven or potentially lethal ideas he has mentioned at the press conferences.The UK’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, is expected to return to work on Monday and will face the dilemma of how and when to ease restrictions on British life.Other developments around the world:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/858becadc2ecc00c9384febb46418e15d9bbf274/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae7d12352281a1451e47f6a3e2bf1ad7","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:The number of confirmed deaths in the coronavirus pandemic increased to 202,846 on Saturday, according to Johns Hopkins University, with 2,898,703 confirmed cases.The prime minister of France, Edouard Philippe, will on Tuesday present a national strategy for emerging from the coronavirus lockdown to the National Assembly, his office told AFP.

The Wall Street Journal, which cited six people familiar with the discussions, said frustration with Azar was growing but the administration was reluctant to make big changes while the country was seeking to stop the virus, which has killed more than 53,000 people in the US. A White House spokesman told the newspaper that there was no plan to replace Azar.Mexico’s health ministry on Saturday reported 970 new cases of coronavirus infection and 84 additional fatalities, bringing the total in the country to 13,842 cases and 1,305 deaths. The government has said the real number of infected people is likely considerably higher than the confirmed cases.As rumours about the health of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un continue to circulate, including reports that he is sheltering from Covid-19, a US-based monitoring group released satellite images of what may have been his train parked at an exclusive resort town in the country’s east.A preliminary report, cited by Australia’s chief medical officer as the government advocates the reopening of the country’s schools, says children are unlikely to transmit Covid-19 between each other or to adults. The study, which is still be peer reviewed, was conducted by the Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance (NCIRS). It examined transmission of the virus in New South Wales schools and childcare centres between March and mid-April.State media in Saudi Arabia are reporting that the curfew will be partially lifted for all regions starting Sunday, but that a 24-hour curfew will be maintained in Mecca, according to Reuters. Some economic and commercial activities, including retail stores, will be reopened during Ramadan, from 29 April to 13 May.Australia’s coronavirus tracing app was set to launch on Sunday, despite lingering privacy concerns. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, confirmed downloading the app would not be mandatory, and instead has likened it to a civic duty, such as buying war bonds in the second world war. He also flagged it as a necessary step to relaxing restrictions.Boris Johnson will return to work on Monday and is “raring to go”, a Downing Street spokeswoman has confirmed. The prime minister has been recovering in his official country residence after spending three nights in intensive care in April.

Like millions of small businesses across the US, McKnight’s Stylist Lee Hair Studio in West Hollywood, California, had to close indefinitely in mid-March because of stay-at-home orders aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus.And like fellow entrepreneurs around the country, she is struggling to figure out how her salon will rebound from the crisis whenever she is able to reopen. The Small Business Administration loan programs established under the federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act were meant to provide a lifeline for businesses like McKnight’s. But the effort has been overwhelmed by the needs. The $350bn set aside for SBA Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans was exhausted before many small businesses were even able to get overwhelmed bank systems to accept their applications. And at least some of the loans went to businesses most would not consider “small”, including the restaurant chains Ruth’s Chris Steak House, Potbelly Sandwiches and Shake Shack multimillion-dollar publicly traded biotech companies coal producers and hedge funds.Small businesses on the west coast appear to have had a particularly hard time securing aid. According to two analyses of how SBA funds were allocated, California, Oregon and Washington received some of the smallest shares of aid compared with the eligible payroll in each state.Each of the country’s over 30 million small businesses has unique needs and challenges in the face of a common disaster. Five owners on the west coast told the  how they’re working to stay afloat.To McKnight, government aid has so far proved elusive: “I’m living off my savings,” she said.McKnight’s small studio, which specializes in natural hair and extensions, opened in 2014 and is largely a one-woman operation. She works with a remote assistant and an agency that helps book her clients, but she has been forced to pause those relationships.In normal times, her total costs per month, including rent, are roughly $7,000, and she typically makes between $3,000 and $4,000 a week. Her online leather business is on hold due to manufacturing shutdowns. That means her only continuing source of income is her online hair products store. She’s on track to lose roughly $5,000 a month. McKnight applied to the PPP loan and the EIDL advance but hasn’t yet had luck. She also applied for unemployment but has not been approved, and she hasn’t yet received her stimulus check. Even if the loans came through, she would suffer thousands of dollars of losses each month the lockdown continues.For now, McKnight is staying optimistic, noting that her clients are desperate to get back into the salon. “I promised myself I would not lose everything again,” she said.Guerrilla Tacos, too, overcame huge obstacles to open in 2018. Chef Wes Avila started Guerrilla as an unauthorized Los Angeles food cart that was repeatedly shut down by police. After officers threatened to confiscate his supplies, he turned the business into a truck, eventually transitioning to a brick-and-mortar location.It was a “miracle” that Guerrilla had thrived even this long, said Brittney Valles, managing partner who opened the restaurant with Avila. Valles fundraised for the taco joint when she was only 23 years old, and she is the first in her family to graduate college. “People took a chance on me.” The shutdowns have sent the owners scrambling: “We don’t operate with hundreds of thousands in our bank account. We don’t have this crazy backing of capital and tech to maintain a business in a pandemic.”Valles previously employed 58 people. Now, doing take-out and delivery only, the restaurant is down to seven employees (plus her boyfriend, who is working for free). She furloughed the rest of staff.Guerrilla’s rent is $25,000 a month. In February, pre-Covid, the restaurant made $400,000 in sales. That dipped to $150,000 in March, and she estimated April would bring in $60,000 or less. She successfully secured the disaster loan and was told she was approved for PPP, though that money hasn’t arrived yet.Ultimately, with an eviction moratorium in place, she held off paying rent to instead cover healthcare for her furloughed workers. While she may be in a better position than other taquerias, the long-term future is uncertain, especially if she has to operate with reduced tables or other restrictions.She did not plan for a pandemic when she negotiated rent, she said, and fears her landlord would quickly replace her with a more financially stable chain if she continues to be short.“It feels like my entire dream and all the people who work for me and alongside me are all just getting fucked. It’s so exhausting,” she said.For now, Guerrilla is offering “emergency taco kits” to go, which provide customers with ingredients to make their own tacos at home. One of the chefs is also offering a specialty dinner each week. First up was a nod to Ruth’s Chris, the American steakhouse corporation that received $20m in loans, and a lot of backlash.When a car careened into the front of her tiny Oakland, California, bakery in early 2019, Jen Angel thought she’d been through the worst of it as a small business owner. Angel established the business with a catering and events service and opened the first storefront in the spring of 2016. Almost exactly four years later, the parties, corporate events, weddings and other advance orders that make up the majority of her income dried up in mid-March. Sales dropped from an average of $18,000 a month to about $4,500 at the start of what is usually the busiest season for Angel Cakes.“Aside from Valentine’s Day, January and February are really slow, so we work hard in the spring and summer to make sure we have enough cash flow in the winter,” said Angel.Angel spoke while prepping in her small kitchen for the weekly orders that are still keeping the business afloat, clearing nearly all monthly rent, insurance and utility costs. It’s work she does entirely on her own now, having been forced to lay off five part-time employees not only because she couldn’t pay them, but because there’s no room for more than one person to work in the Angel Cakes kitchen at a time and stay at a safe distance from anyone else. Those workers are now receiving unemployment benefits, but Angel is drawing no personal income.“I have basically applied for every loan and every grant,” said Angel, from the US Chamber of Commerce (full) to a Facebook small business aid program (no response yet) to a City of Oakland grant for low-income business owners (rejected). “They said they had $5,000 to give to 90 businesses, and they received 1,200 applications. Every program is overwhelmed.”Angel did receive a $5,000 forgivable advance from the EIDL emergency grant, $1,000 for each employee – “The way I found out I got it was it just appeared in my bank account. There was no email, no letter, nothing.” But she hesitated to apply for the larger PPP loan.“What if the shelter in place order goes past June 30? What if some of my employees have different jobs? They might have moved, they might not be available. What if I can’t get back up to my previous payroll? As somebody who has no cushion, the idea of taking on debt with the chance it’s going to be forgiven, but might not, is just not an option,” said Angel.A $15,000 zero-interest loan from the not-for-profit Kiva will help cover what costs she can’t make in her weekly orders, but it’s still debt she’ll have to pay back once the business is truly up and running again – a timeline that remains vague at best.“As a small-business person, I always think: this is the year I’m going to get ahead and have some savings,” Angel said. “After having built the business for 10 years, it’s just such a disappointment that it’s still a struggle even though I’m doing everything else right.”Stacey Sampson started teaching body-positive yoga classes at a local community center in Spokane, Washington, a few years ago. The response was so enthusiastic, she said, she was soon looking for a space of her own. Sampson, 38, rented and renovated a studio and brought on two other yoga instructors to help her teach daily classes. Before coronavirus shut the studio last month, it had grown to about 100 members: not the biggest yoga studio in town, but one that offered “a niche that was not being met”.Since the shutdown, Sampson has continued paying her instructors to offer members or drop-in customers the same classes, now livestreamed. But attendance has dropped. “People have had to cancel memberships,” Sampson said. “It’s a luxury they can’t afford right now.”Shifting a yoga studio online “is a model that works in theory”, she said, but so far, the math isn’t adding up. The rent for her studio is still $1,100 a month, plus another $250 in utilities. Drop-in classes online are still $15 each. A year-long membership is $600.Sampson has applied for emergency assistance, including a normal Small Business Administration loan, and the EIDL emergency grant, which promised up to $10,000.“The application said that we would have funding within three days, and that didn’t happen,” Sampson said. A week later, she heard there had been problems with the system and that she should apply again, so she did. Once again, nothing. “I still haven’t seen a dime.”Because she runs a very small business, and one that works with independent contractors, not employees on payroll, the government relief programs aren’t really designed for her, Sampson said. She’s still waiting to see if she will get inidual pandemic unemployment support from Washington state.“Every road I’ve gone down has hit a dead end,” she said.Sampson has been told her landlord is willing to work with businesses to find a way through the crisis, but she is still waiting to hear more. Some of the studio’s supporters have stepped up with PayPal donations or early membership renewals, “which is amazing, but so far it’s not been enough”.Being a relatively new business is particularly challenging. “If you’re a more well-known business in the community, you’re more likely to get the help you need,” she said.And even if the shutdown ends soon, Sampson said, she will still face uncertainty: should she reopen the studio and risk the chance that an instructor or a customer might spread the infection? Will people still want to sweat together in a crowded room, even once legal restrictions are lifted?“We don’t know when people are going to feel safe to be in my type of space,” she said.Since it was founded in 1981, Jan’s Paperbacks has always been owned by women. Its romance novel section is 20ft long.Its owner, Lori Carroll, bought the bookstore in 2018 from a friend who had been struggling to find another buyer. “I just wanted to keep the store open,” Carroll said. “I want independent bookstores to survive.”Even before the pandemic, Carroll had been running the store, in Beaverton, Oregon, as a one-woman operation. In normal times, her sales barely covered her costs: $3,000 a month in rent and another $3,000 a month in other expenses, including paying off the loans she took out to buy the business and move it to a new location. She has done other work on the side, including editing and dog-walking, to support herself.During coronavirus shutdowns, Carroll has actually seen the bookstore’s sales go up, as she has shifted her business model to offer curbside pickups, books by mail, and very socially distanced browsing, with only one customer allowed inside the store at a time. (Anything a customer touches but does not buy must be put on a special table, to be disinfected later.)“I’ve gotten a ton of new customers,” she said. “They walk in and they just say: you need to stay open.” She’s been given a $20 tip on one order, a $60 tip on another. “Somebody mailed me a check for $100.”Carroll is now working seven days a week. With the growing sales, her expenses, too, have shot through the roof since many customers are now ordering new books, which Carroll has to pay to order herself, rather than the used books that are already in her inventory.Carroll said she received an EIDL emergency grant from the federal government in her bank account a few days ago, but it hasn’t helped much. After she applied for the grant on 31 March, she said, she was told the emergency fund would only offer $1,000 per employee. That meant, for her, exactly $1,000.“I find it humorous,” she said. “You said it was going to be $10,000 in three days, and it became $1,000 after three weeks.”She was told she had been approved for a normal SBA business loan of $25,000, but she is still waiting on paperwork to complete the loan.While access to government assistance has been frustrating, she said, small businesses in downtown Beaverton have stepped up to help each other. From her bookstore, she is selling cookies for a local bakery and skincare products for a boutique.On the day the federal government announced it had run out of emergency funding to help small businesses and was not accepting any more applications, Carroll tried to offer some consolation to her banker across the street. “I was like, here’s some cupcakes, enjoy,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d3ddfbf1a8bc684ea7f63aa1d94f24da411552e/0_320_3290_1974/master/3290.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73ed8e5565be50348826f34b6a47a603","title":"heads we win tails you lose how americas rich have turned pandemic into profit","story":"As 26 million Americans lose their jobs, the billionaire class has added $308bn to its wealthSome of the richest people in the US have been at the front of the queue as the government has handed out trillions of dollars to prop up an economy it shuttered amid the coronavirus pandemic. At the same time, the billionaire class has added $308bn to its wealth in four weeks - even as a record 26 million people lost their jobs.Eight of those billionaires have seen their net worth surge by over $1bn each, including the Amazon boss, Jeff Bezos, and his ex-wife MacKenzie Bezos Eric Yuan, founder of Zoom the former Microsoft chief Steve Ballmer and Elon Musk, the Tesla and SpaceX technocrat.The billionaire bonanza comes as a flotilla of big businesses, millionaires and billionaires sail through loopholes in a $349bn bailout meant to save hard-hit small businesses. About 150 public companies managed to bag more than $600m in forgivable loans before the funds ran out. Among them was Shake Shack, a company with 6,000 employees valued at $2bn. It has since given the cash back but others have not.Fisher Island, a members-only location off the coast of Miami where the average income of residents is $2.2m and the beaches are made from imported Bahamian sand, has received $2m in aid.The banks that were the largest recipients of bailout cash in the last recession have also done well, raking in $10bn in fees from the government loans, according to an analysis by National Public Radio.“Heads we win, tails you lose,” said Chuck Collins, director of the program on inequality and the common good at the Institute for Policy Studies and co-author of the new report.Collins said the pandemic had further exposed fault lines in the US body politic that have been widening the gap between the really rich and the rest over decades.“The rules of the economy have been tipped in favor of asset owners against everyone else,” said Collins.Nor did Americans earn more. Wage growth remained sluggish during the decade-long record-breaking growth in the jobs market that came after the last recession.For black and Latinx Americans, the situation is worse. The black-white wage gaps are larger today than they were in 1979.So when the pandemic struck, those at the apex of the wealth pyramid were better positioned than ever to take advantage of the chaos. The rest, not so much.Collins has been studying income inequality for 25 years and has seen the really rich win victory after victory. But even he was surprised by how quickly America’s billionaires have turned pandemic into profit. “I still get shocked,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7694dd29489c925e09005f0c295cacbe079ffeb/0_112_2786_1671/master/2786.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf1a217b979a2f437a4b488bc2d83f9f","title":"test test test can britain find a way out of lockdown","story":"As deaths pass 20,000, testing and tracing are finally back at the heart of government policy – but it’s taken too long and has been poorly planned. A series of delays and U-turns cost time – and the country could pay a price for months to come The pay-and-display sign still marks the entrance to the Milton Keynes coronavirus testing hub – a cluster of tents in a car park across from a shuttered Toys R Us shop – that is the heart of the UK’s drive to contain and control the disease.On Friday afternoon a queue of about 20 cars had formed up on the road outside, carrying key workers from schools, hospitals and care homes.Men in high-vis jackets working for the accountancy giant Deloitte, which runs the centre, patrolled the street and tried to clear it of anyone not coming to be tested, even though they admitted they had no legal authority to do so.Those who had arrived had been given the postcode to put into their satnavs but there were almost no signposts to the hub on nearby ring roads or streets, perhaps to keep it a secret from curious locals or passersby.Less than 24 hours earlier, the health secretary, Matt Hancock – desperate to “ramp up” testing (and then contact tracing) in the hope of getting somewhere near his target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of April – had announced that all key workers with symptoms could apply to be checked for coronavirus.Huge pent-up demand from people would defeat the system within hours of it going live. On Friday morning the testing website could not cope and it told applicants that there were no more tests available, an administrative hitch for which the government swiftly apologised.Those in the queue on the outskirts of Milton Keynes had, however, logged on before the crash. Several told the Observer they wanted tests as much for their patients, or the people they worked and lived with, as for themselves. Many had signed up in the small hours, including a school key worker who had gone online at 2am to register.“I work around Covid patients, although we wear full PPE,” said one nurse who asked not to be named. “This is the first opportunity we’ve had to get tested. It’s for my patients as well as myself, so I don’t risk infecting them.” She had travelled with her sister who works in care, and her parents who are isolating with them. Their father’s diabetes makes him a high risk if he contracts Covid-19.Once inside the car park the symptom carriers were directed into one of five bays, and greeted by a worker in full protective equipment, holding up a mobile phone number to ring from inside the car. The person on the phone explained how to take the test, and then provided a kit.“You had to get a swab and rub it along the back of your throat and tonsils, and then use the same swab up your nose,” said Charlie Dawkins, a pre-school worker who signed up for a test after coming down with a fever and sore chest. “I’m quite glad we got to do it ourselves, I feel that if someone else did it I would have been sick. We had to keep stopping.”Dawkins had driven for around half an hour with her mother, a key worker in a school who received an email saying she was eligible for tests the previous day. She too registered in the middle of the night.Dawkins said she found the experience as smooth as testing for a terrifying disease could be ever be. “The people were really nice, everyone was so friendly.” She has been told to expect results by text or email within 48 hours, linked to a QR code she was given on registration, and scanned when collecting the test kits.Across the country key workers and their families and friends, some who had worried about their exposure and health for weeks, were going through this extraordinary, novel and anxiety-inducing procedure.Nic Mitchell, a property and financial services adviser, began developing symptoms a few days ago, which forced her partner, the head engineer at a food processing factory, to go into isolation with her. She has a complex underlying medical condition. “A test would help me manage my other underlying conditions better,” she said. “The symptoms may be related to something else – this would help me rule it in or rule it out.” Mitchell’s partner is considered to be an essential worker, so they managed to book a test online.The nearest centre for her was in Worcester, 22 miles from her home in Cheltenham. Before attending, she said it would be “very scary” because she hadn’t left the house since 4 January when she got back from holiday incredibly ill. “Actually, going into the outside world is something that gives me a high level of anxiety, so going 22 miles makes it worse,” she added.When Mitchell arrived at the testing site at Worcester Warriors rugby club just before 3pm on Saturday, she was told that there would be a two and a half hour wait – but the centre would shut at 5pm regardless. The only option was to attempt to rebook. “They told me they couldn’t cope,” she said. “It was very disappointing.”The tents of the Milton Keynes test centre are visible from nearby roads, normally busy with shoppers and office workers, and now emptied by coronavirus. The silent streets, with the test queue the only sign of life, were a reminder of the abrupt distortion of normality.The UK government has expanded the criteria for who qualifies for a free test for coronavirus to all essential workers and their families in England – up to 10 million people. The list of essential workers is the same as the one used to allow the children of key workers to carry on going to school during the lockdown:Health and social careFrontline health and social care staff such as doctors, nurses, midwives, paramedics, as well as support and specialist staff in the health and social care sector. In addition it includes those working in supply chains including producers and distributors of medicines and personal protective equipment.Education and childcareNursery, teaching staff and social workers.Key public servicesThose required to run the justice system, religious staff, as well as those responsible for managing the deceased, and journalists providing public service broadcasting.Local and national governmentAdministrative occupations essential to the effective delivery of the Covid-19 response or delivering essential public services.Food and other necessary goodsThose involved in the production, processing, distribution, sale and delivery of food.Public safety and national securityPolice, support staff, Ministry of Defence civilian staff and armed forces personnel, fire and rescue staff, and those responsible for border security, prisons and probation.TransportThose who will keep air, water, road and rail passenger and freight transport modes operating.Utilities, communication and financial servicesStaff required to keep oil, gas, electricity, water and sewerage operations running. Staff in the civil nuclear, chemical and telecommunications sectors. Those in postal services and those working to provide essential financial services.The swabs are not tested on site, because they need sophisticated laboratory processing. Milton Keynes has one of the biggest labs in the country, based at the UK Biocentre, just a few miles from the car park test centre, which handles swabs sent from at least 20 testing centres across the country.The labs are largely manned by scientists who volunteered to step away from their usual research to carry out testing, which is labour-intensive work.At Milton Keynes, the scientists operate in pairs working 12-hour shifts, and together can handle around 400 to 500 swabs a day. The lab’s daily capacity, at full stretch, is around 8,000 tests.Inside the lab there are three work stations, the first of which is protected by a biosecurity hood, where samples are treated with a solution to kill everything inside. In the second, the virus’s genetic material (or the material of anything picked up by the sample) is extracted. In the third, that genetic material is put through a machine that multiplies it, so that there is enough for the test to detect, then checked for coronavirus. The biggest challenge, experts say, is not the science but the logistics of getting the tests in, then scaling up and bringing in robots.The Milton Keynes lab is part of a centralised approach to testing in the UK that has puzzled many scientists and may have been a key contributor to the slowincrease of testing capacity.Other countries that have rolled out more rapid testing programmes have relied at least in part on letting existing labs become testing centres with their own teams and equipment, who are able to start testing almost immediately on site.In the UK, by contrast, authorities have chosen to bring equipment and scientists together in government-established centres, which are slower to get going because logistics and supply issues need to be worked out.Prof Allyson Pollock, of Newcastle University, says one of the many reasons the UK’s reaction has been late and, until now at least, fairly ineffective is that it can no longer respond to local need, because of endless reorganisations and years of austerity. She also says the government is treating this pandemic as a national one, when actually it is a series of local ones, requiring dedicated local responses.But what angers scientists, health workers, experts and others more is why it was left until so recently – when Hancock was already admitting the peak was near – for this mass process of testing and contact tracing to be ordered across the country. And why has it all seemed so chaotic and poorly planned?The criticism of ministers and their advisers is all the greater because they know the UK started on the right road only to halt, change course, then resume when the virus had spread and all that could be achieved was damage limitation.Governments that have contained larger scale outbreaks once they are under way, perhaps most notably South Korea, which at one point was the worst affected country outside China, have done it through large-scale testing and rigorous tracing of the contacts of infected people.The fact that we did not carry on and expand testing and tracing to a scale similar to South Korea was unfortunate, says Prof James Naismith, of Edinburgh University. “We hit the iceberg without enough lifeboats and came to grief. We did not have the infrastructure in place to maintain a testing programme at that time. South Korea – and Germany – did. There is no doubt we have lagged behind them.” After the UK stopped its testing and contact tracing, the World Health Organization ordered all countries to “test, test, test”. But in a vital period last month, the UK resisted. Only recently, as pressure to limit the lockdown has grown from businesses, Conservative MPs and a frustrated public, and as Hancock’s testing target looked in danger, has the government completely changed course.There is dismay among health workers who see daily the effects of Covid-19, that early efforts to “ramp up” testing (before key workers were included from last Thursday) were suboptimal to say the least.Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents NHS trusts, said: “There has been a lot of zig-zagging and veering on what is the policy, who is responsible for mobilising it, what is the plan.” When Hancock first announced his target of 100,000 tests a day she says no one really knew how it would work. “In our view it was not clear. It was just a number that was put out there.” Cordery says it is not clear who the 100,000 should be initially, nor who would be involved in the testing. Should those to be tested include NHS staff, patients, who? “Only the US has a greater capacity to do testing,” said ProfGerome Breen, of King’s College London. “But the NHS has refused to reply to many offers of help from research centres to supply tests.” One of these offers came from Breen, a geneticist whose department already carries out PCR testing on a large scale. “A month ago we offered to turn our laboratory over to Covid-19 work and test medical staff at King’s College Hospital to find out who might have been infected with the virus. We could have started within a fortnight and would have been doing thousands of tests a day by now. We had a couple of emails from the department but heard nothing from them after that. It was intensely frustrating.”Prof Martin Marshall, the chairman of the Royal College of GPs, suggested GPs should have been able to play a bigger role in referring patients for testing and helping the testing process. This admittedly would have required them to have the correct PPE, which has proved another challenge altogether.“Have they been a bit slow in getting to general practice, understanding the needs of general practice, understanding the PPE needs, for example, which took a time, understanding the role of general practice in identifying vulnerable patients understanding the testing needs for general practice? I think all of that has been slower than we would have liked to see.”Asked if the government knew who it ought to be testing, he said: “I think the testing programme has been influenced more by the politics of the availability of testing than it has by the epidemiology of what’s required.“You can have a good policy on testing, but you can only deliver it if you’ve actually got the kit.”This weekend, with the UK passing 20,000 hospital deaths from Covid-19 , and the WHO insisting that testing and contact tracing is essential before life can go back to normal, both are suddenly back at the heart of government policy.But have the U-turns and the delays cost? And what if the lockdown has to continue for months more because effective testing and contact tracing has not been put in place?Already business leaders and Conservative MPs are beginning to warn that without an easing of the lockdown based on testing and contact tracing, the economy faces ruin. Last week, the crisis facing small businesses and the need for a balance to be struck between saving lives and saving the economy was raised in a heated, virtual meeting of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers.The former cabinet minister, David Davis, said: “There is deep concern among backbenchers about the fate of the vast numbers of small businesses, which will determine how fast we come out of this economic slump. Unless we are very quick and very effective at bringing as many as possible back into work in a few weeks’ time, the scars of this problem will go on for a decade.”Graham Brady, the chairman of the 1922 Committee, said: “All members of parliament must be receiving representations from businesses large and small needing further assistance or some sense of when they can start to plan for at least a partial release from these measures.”Charles Walker, the committee’s vice-chair, added: “Our inboxes are full of desperate people who own small businesses, some of which are their lives’ work, who now risk losing everything. We need to have a cabinet minister put in charge of small business.”World Health Organization (WHO) guidance on face masks has remained consistent during the coronavirus pandemic. It has stuck to the line that masks are for healthcare workers – not the public.\u0026nbsp“Wearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,” the WHO has stated.There is no robust scientific evidence – in the form of trials – that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them. There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.Also underlying the WHO’s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected. It is accepted that they can block transmission to other people. Given that many people with Covid-19 do not show any symptoms for the first days after they are infected, masks clearly have a potential role to play if everyone wears them.-\u0026nbspHow to make a non-medical coronavirus face mask – no sewing requiredFor some patients – for instance, those with life-threatening cancers – this is a very serious issue. “Patients are avoiding going to their GPs and GPs are making fewer hospital referrals. There are also 200,000 fewer cancer screenings taking place each week in the UK, due to the Covid-19 pandemic. That, in turn, means there are approximately 2,000 to 2,500 cancer diagnoses being missed each week.”Many scientists now believe reliable testing on a large scale really does offer the UK a route out of its Covid-19 crisis. However, merely reaching a figure of 100,000 tests a day on its own is not enough, warned Naismith.“It won’t matter if we can test numbers of that order if we cannot then rapidly trace the contacts of those who are found to be positive and then isolate them. Once a person is found to be positive we will have to trace their contacts very, very quickly – within a day – and then test them.”Such tracing will inevitably require technological aids – mainly by using mobile phones to track a person’s movements, said Naismith. “Inevitably, that will have privacy issues,” he added. “However, these will have to be dealt with because testing and tracing offers us the best chance we have for dealing with Covid-19 at the moment.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8974df9b047d6baa517f7a594a903a657e704b30/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb5c4091a80536cf32fe0361ed8216ad","title":"to tackle this virus local public health teams need to take back control","story":"A massive increase in testing and tracing should be the next phase, but decades of cuts and reorganisations have whittled away the necessary regional expertisePerhaps, the most surprising aspect of the British Covid-19 crisis is the extent to which the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish governments, and the English regions, have allowed strategy to be decided by Westminster.Health and social care are devolved, and this national epidemic is not homogenous. It is made up of hundreds, if not thousands, of outbreaks around the country, each at a different stage . England had its first confirmed case on 30 January, Wales on 28 February and Scotland on 1 March. Some areas – such as Rutland, Hartlepool, Blackpool, Isle of Wight, Tyneside, Durham, Orkney, Western Isles – had no reported cases until late March, and some even now have relatively few cases.Contact tracing and testing, case finding, isolation and quarantine are classic public health measures for controlling communicable diseases. They require local teams on the ground, meticulously tracking cases and contacts to eliminate the reservoirs of infection. This approach is recommended by the WHO at all stages of the epidemic. It was painstakingly adopted in China, Singapore and Taiwan, with a high percentage of close contacts identified and many housed in hotels. Germany has traced contacts throughout. The leaked UK national risk register proposes it.Yet Public Health England, the agency responsible for communicable disease control in England, stopped contact tracing on 12 March, having reportedly only contacted 3,500 people, of whom about 105 were found to be positive. It’s now about to resume. But why was it stopped, and how will it be resumed?We’ve not seen an official explanation for its stopping. But lack of both resources and effectiveness are usually mentioned. Resources are essential, just as they have been for increasing acute care capacity, and the potential pool of contact tracers is vast. There are thousands of environmental health officers in local authorities and other sectors who have the necessary skills and experience. Singapore used its army. Teachers and barristers have volunteered in Ireland. Centralising control and management of the pandemic through NHS 111 has also left 7,500 GP practices underused, and the potential for real-time knowledge of new cases, results of swab tests and insight into the geography of spread has been lost. Yes, it’s true that contact tracing is insufficient, but that’s not the same as ineffective. It should have been supplemented, not replaced. Look at Germany.We think there are more fundamental reasons. The system of local communicable disease control was established in the 19th century. After the NHS was set up in 1948, it was supported in England and Wales by national, regional and more than 40 local public health laboratories. But since local medical officers of health were abolished in 1974 – replaced by community physicians at different levels of the NHS – the system has been gradually but relentlessly eroded, fragmented and centralised.Communicable disease control was centralised in the Health Protection Agency in 2003, and local public health laboratories transferred to NHS hospitals. Public health was then carved out of the NHS in England in the 2012 Health and Social Care Act, which abolished local area health bodies, created Public Health England to fulfil the government’s duty to protect the public from disease and charged local authorities with improving public health – but with limited proactive scope for infectious disease control and woefully inadequate resources.With further waves of the epidemic likely, resumption of contact tracing is critical. Each of the four nations needs to institute scores of locally led, nationally coordinated and funded teams to trace, find and test contacts. Caernarfon isn’t Cardiff, Gairloch isn’t Glasgow, London isn’t Lulworth. Teams in England and Northern Ireland would be based in local authorities in Wales and Scotland they would be in local health boards. Their composition should be locally determined, drawing on a range of expertise, especially among directors of public health, field epidemiologists, environmental health officers, GPs, local NHS laboratories, NHS 111 and test centres, plus volunteers if required.Widely used apps with robust data protection could play a supportive, but not framing, role. In addition, the apparently strategy-free plans for 50 mass drive-in test centres need to be decisively directed to support local contact tracing, as well as strategically targeting the most at-risk groups.We would expect rigorous implementation of these measures now to make an overdue but significant contribution to controlling the epidemic. Restoring and updating local communicable disease control is an integral part of properly funded, publicly provided health and social care.Allyson M Pollock, professor of public health, Newcastle University, andbarrister Peter Roderick, principal research associate, Newcastle University"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8974df9b047d6baa517f7a594a903a657e704b30/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb5c4091a80536cf32fe0361ed8216ad","title":"trust wanes in uk ministers handling of coronavirus pandemic poll","story":"Doubts focus on failures over testing and whether government acted quickly enough at outsetThe public’s confidence in the government’s ability to handle the coronavirus crisis has fallen sharply in the past fortnight, with less than half of voters now having faith in decisions made by ministers, according to the latest Opinium poll for the Observer.With more doubts raised over the past week about ministers’ handling of the crisis, particularly in the early stages when other countries were introducing contact tracing and lockdowns while the UK adopted other approaches, those leading the government’s drive to contain the virus – Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, and Matt Hancock, health secretary – have both seen falls in public trust.While people are increasingly critical of the handling of inidual policy areas such as testing, however, a majority still say they “approve” of the way the crisis is being handled, suggesting that they want the government to succeed, and realise that the answers are far from easy to find. Opinium believes there is also a “rally round the flag factor” at play, and the government’s reputation benefits from being shielded from the normal hostile political attacks of opponents.When asked whether they thought the UK had reacted better or worse than other countries, people tended to cite Germany, Australia and South Korea as countries that had performed better than the UK, and the United States as the key example of a country that had done worse.With pressure mounting for ministers to announce plans to ease the lockdown, people believe that offices, essential shops and schools should be allowed to reopen first, provided that the proper safeguards have been put in place. Pubs, stadiums, cinemas and nightclubs are seen as the lowest priorities.Adam Drummond of Opinium said: “Governments across the democratic world saw a big boost in their approval ratings as publics rallied behind efforts to combat a common, and non-political, foe. Similarly, responses to the government’s announcements of economic relief efforts were extremely popular and helped relieve people’s concerns at the time.“However, now that we have been in lockdown for a few weeks and people are less scared of catching the virus themselves – though still worried about the situation – the focus of the news has started to include more specific aspects of the response, such as testing, where government failings have been put in the spotlight. Overall approval has fluctuated and ticked downwards but is still stronger than before the lockdown came into effect.“People don’t want the government to fail, which is why we see this gap between overall approval of their handling of the situation, which is still strong, and much lower approval on specific aspects of it, like testing or whether the government acted quickly enough.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4231405.1587117157!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"have howth s red squirrels succumbed to invasive greys","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe narrow entry corridor for grey squirrels at Sutton Cross offered hope for the reds at a crucial balance in their breeding.Where viruses came from, in all their erse billions in a teaspoonful of sea, a forkful of soil, is still mysterious, even to virologists.In one hypothesis, they mght have been archaic, free-living organisms that evolved into parasites in another, they started as fragmentary genetic elements that united to move between cells and invade them. Either way, they reproduce, spread, and evolve to do it more effectively.Why some viruses evolve to cause disease is another mystery. But infectious diseases can limit or reduce populations of humans or wildlife .Researching last week’s column, for example, innocently prompted by the chirping of sparrows, I was led to the latest scientific hypothesis on their modern city decline. It proposed infection by a parasite, found at high levels in the sparrows of suburban London and giving them avian malaria.Today’s column prompted by wondering about the last red squirrels of Dublin’s Howth Head. Have they finally succumbed, like so many in Leinster, to the advance of alien grey squirrels?Even a decade ago, the native reds had already disappeared from many Dublin parks. At the Phoenix Park, for example, the first grey was sighted in 1979 and the last red around 1987.On the Howth peninsula, the reds’ last stronghold in Dublin, the first greys were seen in 2007. In 2011, an assessment for Fingal County Council by ecologist Dr Wiliam Carr, estimated some 25 remaining in the woods.The narrow entry corridor for grey squirrels at Sutton Cross offered hope for the reds at a crucial balance in their breeding. Grey squirrels were regularly removed from the peninsula by Dr Carr, rising to 38 in a year. But his traps caught only two male reds. The Howth colony, he reported in 2017, “will not recover”.Grey squirrels have been commonly thought to oust the reds by competition for acorns and beech nuts. A more insidious reason, as seen in the UK, is cross-infection with the squirrel-pox virus, SPQV. The greys can carry this without much effect, but it’s fatal to the reds, afflicting them with something like the rabbit myxomatosis.Although the American greys were introduced to Ireland at Castleforbes, Co Longford, in 1911, SPQV was not discovered until 2011, found in two grey squirrel populations in Northern Ireland. At one location, 90 per cent of the reds were infected and lost.In 2012 came reports from Co Wicklow and Co Dublin. Testing levels of virus in greys from these areas, a team from UCD warned of “a wave-front of grey squirrel expansion from Wicklow” to threaten the surviving eastern reds.By 2012 just three reds – two males and one female – survived on south Dublin’s Killiney Hill. However, with greys removed by Dr Carr, that year saw reinforcement. Fifteen reds, brought from the Raven Point nature reserve in Wexford, were released in a move supported by the National Parks and Wildlife Service.Elsewhere in Ireland, and notably in the midlands, the resurgence of the pine marten, a native predator, has proved a potent ally in removing grey squirrels and allowing the smaller, more agile, reds to share the woods.But meanwhile, another wildlife virus has arrived in Ireland, threatening not only wild rabbits but also the Irish hare.This is RHDRHD2, joint acronyms for rabbit haemorrhagic disease, a horror like myxomatosis. The first form killed millions of farmed rabbits in China in 1984 and then spread globally. RHD2, a form killing rabbits even faster, emerged in France in 2010.RHD was found in domestic rabbits in Ireland in 2018 and in wild rabbits in July last year RHD2 killed a hare on the Wexford Slobs nature reserve in August and another 17 fatally infected hares were found in eight weeks after that. The disease has been confirmed from at least eight counties, from Cork to Leitrim.Apart from the trysts of mating, the Irish hares lead solitary lives. But rounded up in nets for coursing, contagion could be inevitable. The first deaths from RHD2 last summer brought an immediate ban on coursing from Minister for Heritage Josepha Madigan.By October, however, a deal was reached with the Irish Coursing Club. A ban remains on netting within a 25km radius of finding the disease in hares or rabbits. It was lifted for Kilkenny and for other clubs enlisted in a hare monitoring programme supervised by vets.Moving west 40-odd years ago brought me encounters with dying rabbits, blundering around my feet in the dunes. They were victims of myxomatosis, imported by Irish farming interests. Natural selection of survivors brought their species eventual genetic resistance, as it will beat the even deadlier numbers game of RHD2.There are vaccines against the virus for domestic rabbits, but these remain untested for wild rabbits or hares and netting them for injection is thought too risky. I watch their solitary scampers on the hillside – a sign of the wild I hope will never grow less."},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

He said he hoped the week beginning May 5th would be ‘a period of time in which we can explain to people how we would go about reopening our country’. File photograph: Leon FarrellPhotocall IrelandMinister for Health Simon Harris has said the week of May 5th will not be a “Big Bang moment” in terms of lifting social restrictions in place to limit the spread of coronavirus.“I’m being honest and blunt with people, I think the week beginning May 5th, is not going to be a Big Bang moment in terms of the lifting of restrictions,” he said.“But what I hope it is, is a period of time in which we can explain to people how we would go about reopening our country, how we would phase that, the issues we would consider and hopefully, but far from guaranteed, the easing of one or two restrictions.”Restrictions introduced last month to reduce the public’s exposure to the virus, also known as Covid-19, including a limit on travel beyond 2km of people’s homes, are due to expire on May 5th. Mr Harris was speaking at the Department of Health following a meeting with medical leaders via videolink on Saturday.He said he had spoken to the chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan on Saturday morning and that “if today was the date he was making the decision on what to do next, he would still be advising against changing the restrictions”.“That’s a sobering and a tough message I know because we’re all living in hope,” he added. Mr Harris said there are now 118 people in intensive care units with the virus, down from 160 last week.Mr Harris said the drop was “an encouraging sign” but that there is “a real recognition now that Covid-19 is going to be with us for a long period of time”. He said it was important now for discussions to happen with medical leaders about how care for those with the virus is provided alongside non-Covid care. Mr Harris said reopening the country would be “very complex” and that while Ireland could look at what other countries have done, “every country is a little bit different in terms of the scale of its pandemic”. Mr Harris said so far 120 HSE staff had volunteered to work in nursing homes. He said while it was a small number, it was “a significant increase” from 64 a number of days ago. He said there was the potential for some home help workers to be deployed to private nursing homes. “There’s a few issues that nursing home owners and the HSE need to iron out in relation to contracts and insurance and the likes but I expect that all to be bottomed out over this weekend,” he said. MeetingsThe Minister also said notes from meetings with the National Public Health Emergency Team and recommendations it had made to the department and HSE should and would be published. Mr Harris said the HSE’s chief executive Paul Reid would publish a plan in the coming days as to how it plans to ramp up testing to cover 100,000 people a week. He said to date there have been 127,319 tests processed. The Minister also said he was conscious it was “a tough time for people” but warned against complacency and increased movement. “One of the reasons why we’ve made huge progress in this country is thanks to people following the public health advice,” he said. “The more we begin to stretch that advice or decide that we’re going to interpret or reinterpret that advice in our lives, the more we increase movement in our country and the more we increase risk of making ourselves or other people sick and seeing deaths rise in our country.” He said next week’s meeting with medical leaders would focus on research and that it was important Ireland was “well positioned to benefit from any research and clinical trials in relation to Covid-19”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Paul Reid says longer-term model for health system was needed not just wartime responseMove is \u0026lsquosignificant in disrupting this supply and enabling us to keep people safe\u0026rsquo the Garda saysNiall Fitzpatrick (53) and Jerry O\u0026rsquoLeary (62) jailed over burglary at home of couple in their 80sPortugal forward edges Liverpool in tight contest in ePremier League InvitationalMay 5th not \u0026lsquobig bang moment\u0026rsquo on restrictions ending, says Minister for Health Simon HarrisSimon Harris sympathises with staff at St Mary\u0026rsquos Hospital in Phoenix Park during \u0026lsquotraumatic\u0026rsquo timeMinister says drop in number in ICU encouraging but virus \u0026lsquowill be with us for a long period\u0026rsquoAt least 36kg of narcotic netted by crime agency investigators and border force officers\u0026lsquoI wanted to raise money to help out hospital staff so I decided to cycle a marathon distance\u0026rsquoGroup working to raise insight about problem and treatment by the family law systemCentral Bank deputy governor says there is a huge level of \u0026lsquouncertainty\u0026rsquo in marketCoronavirus: Police in North have issued 358 fines for breaching social distancing\u0026lsquoEvery part of me hurt.

Photograph: Leon FarrellPhotocall IrelandPA WireThe HSE has expressed concern over the recent announcement that testing for Covid-19 is to be significantly expanded to cover 100,000 suspected cases a week.HSE chairman Ciarán Devane wrote to Minister for Health Simon Harris in recent days, it is understood, while HSE chief executive Paul Reid wrote to the department’s secretary general, Jim Breslin.On Friday last week the National Public Health Emergency Team, which is chaired by Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan, decided the level of testing for Covid-19 should be increased to assess 100,000 people a week, operating on a seven-day-a-week basis, for a minimum of six months.Within the HSE there is understood to have been worries about capacity and concern at the process that led to the announcement of the move, as well as what was seen as a lack of consultation.Both the HSE and the Department of Health declined to answer specific questions about the letters on Friday.Government sources said the Minister had received two letters from Mr Devane in April and that neither mentioned the commitment to increase testing for Covid-19.However, other highly placed sources said the concerns were about the process that led to the announcement of the 100,000 tests per week on Friday of last week.Labour leader Alan Kelly, who raised issues around accountability in the emergency team in the Dáil on Thursday, called for the letters to be released.“I asked the Taoiseach in the Dáil if there was any correspondence from the HSE to the Government regarding governance issues. Now we know that there are, and I am calling on the Taoiseach to publish these letters and address all the issues that arise as a result of them,” Mr Kelly said.Over 1,000 deathsSeparately, the Department of Health has been notified of a further 37 deaths of people diagnosed with Covid-19. The number of people who have died with confirmed or probable coronavirus in the State has exceeded 1,000.The number of additional confirmed cases of the virus is 577, bringing the total number of cases in the State to 18,184. Adjusted testing criteria, to be introduced early next week, will lead to increased referrals for testing from GPs. Dr Holohan said: “We think we should be able to do that within the existing capacity that the HSE has in place now, both in terms of the capacity to take the sample, and to test it in the laboratory.”Health officials also confirmed that five healthcare workers had died from the disease as of last Saturday evening. Some 3,830 healthcare workers had tested positive, 159 of whom had been hospitalised, and 24 were placed in intensive care.Dr Holohan reiterated concerns about complacency creeping in, and said that were the decision to be taken at the moment, “we would be sticking with the restrictions that are in place as they are”.However, Government officials are considering extending the 2km travel limit on households to 5km or possibly 10km as part of a potential future easing of restrictions. The State may also change its advice to over-70s who are “cocooning” at home so they can go outside for walks and possibly shop in supermarkets during restricted hours. They may be asked to wear masks outside their homes.Further relaxations being discussed include allowing older people to interact more with other family members.Outdoor, non-contact sports such as golf and tennis, which involve natural physical distancing, could also be permitted when restrictions start to lift.The partial reopening of primary schools with limits on class sizes and secondary schools only to Leaving Cert students ahead of exams starting on July 29th could also be permitted.

A Co Tipperary farmer has joined a class action lawsuit against the Austrian ski resort of Ischgl after he and four friends contracted Covid-19 during their week-long stay last month.At least 5,000 people, hailing from Iceland to Israel, have registered interest with an Austrian lawyer who suspects the village, local businesses and the region of Tyrol ignored health warnings about Ischgl being a Covid-19 hotspot.“This isn’t about monetary gain, someone has to be answerable because there was wrong done,” said Brendan Bourke (53), from Killea near Templemore.Mr Bourke and four friends flew out from Dublin on February 29th for a week’s holidays in Ischgl. They had four good days of skiing and spent their evenings in village bars, where there were occasional coronavirus jokes but no real concerns.He said the bars were “always jam-packed with people” and that “from a certain time of the evening staff have to blow whistles to get through with their glasses”.On March 6th, a day before they left, one of Mr Bourke’s group developed a cough just as they first heard about Covid-19 cases in Iceland among people returning from Ischgl.A day earlier Icelandic health officials warned their Austrian counterparts of 14 skiers having returned from the village with Covid-19. The Austrians suggested they could have picked up the virus on the plane back.Similar clusters were soon reported among Ischgl returnees in Sweden, Germany and Denmark. Norway believes 40 per cent of its Covid-19 cases can be traced to the Alpine village.Mr Bourke says he fell ill three days after returning, experiencing a cough, back and neck pain, shortness of breath and pressure in his chest.Between returning and falling ill, he attended two rugby events, visited a meat factory and at least one farm and did two school runs. He had tea with his neighbour but told his 91-year-old mother, who lives next door, to keep her distance.Super-spreaderOnce diagnosed, Mr Bourke self-isolated and neither his wife nor children have developed symptoms, nor have those with whom he had contact on his return.All four of his friends tested positive after returning and had mild symptoms one infected his wife and 10-month-old baby as well as four people in his office.While sick at home on around March 12th, Mr Bourke logged on to the Ischgl website and, via a webcam, was amazed to see skiers still on the slopes. Days later, Ischgl made world headlines as a super-spreader Covid-19 “catapult village”.Austrian lawyer Peter Kolba, organiser of the class action suit, says he is aware of 11 Covid-19 deaths to date of people with direct or indirect links to Ischgl.More than 500 people have already given him power of attorney in his suit, seeking answers on the eight-day gap between the Icelandic warning and the Ischgl shut-down.“Our main focus is on the authorities who, we suspect, acted too slowly with massive pressure from the tourism industry and powerful ski lift companies,” said Dr Kolba.Local mayor Werner Kurz has hit back at international criticism, saying the village acted in line with official advice as quickly as possible.“No one knew this virus, it was a new situation for all,” he said.Apart from a persistent cough, Mr Bourke says he has recovered from Covid-19 but has mixed feelings now.“There’s a sign in the main street in Ischgl, the first thing you see, that reads ‘Relax if you can’,” he said. “I can’t relax because of what happened there. I just hope there’s no longer-term health damage.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4231819.1587147602!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus brexit a key issue says us special envoy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUS special envoy for Northern Ireland Mick Mulvaney: “The president knew that Brexit is going to be a big deal.”  Photograph: Al DragoBloombergThe US special envoy for Northern Ireland, Mick Mulvaney, has said he intends to travel to Northern Ireland as soon as the coronavirus restrictions are lifted, as he prepares to assume his post.Mr Mulvaney said a key focus for him in the coming weeks is how the Covid-19 crisis will impact on Brexit. The British government’s plan to deal with legacy issues from the Troubles, announced on March 18th, also promises to be a focus when normal life resumes, he said. Mr Mulvaney, who was appointed by President Donald Trump in March, had been scheduled to make his first visit to Northern Ireland as US special envoy next month. But the coronavirus has put that plan on hold. “I have been using the time to familiarise myself with the issues. Obviously, Covid-19 is the focus of everyone’s attention right now. It’s a very fluid situation,” he said, speaking from his home in South Carolina, the state he represented in Congress before joining the Trump administration. Like millions of people across the United States, the former White House chief of staff has been working from home where he is based with his wife and three children, as states have imposed stay-at-home restrictions. He says he will visit Northern Ireland “as soon as the door opens”.Interest in positionThe Irish-American politician has been communicating with Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney, and Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis in the past few weeks.He has also spoken to previous holders of the post, such as Richard Haass, chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations, who was appointed by George W Bush. Mr Mulvaney (52), who reportedly had expressed a long-held interest in the position that had been vacant since the end of the Obama presidency, said his appointment was a measure of the Trump administration’s interest in Northern Ireland and Brexit in particular. He said Mr Trump views the post as akin to the role held by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who he appointed to manage the White House strategy on the Middle East. “The president knew that Brexit is going to be a big deal – it’s a big deal just generally, and in terms of North-South relations – so he said to me: ‘Jared is going to go and take care of the Palestinians and Israelis, you make sure things go smoothly over there,” says Mr Mulvaney. The husband of Mr Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, is widely viewed to have had minimal success with bringing peace to the Middle East. Trump and PompeoMr Mulvaney visited Northern Ireland in February ahead of his appointment, where he met with First Minister Arlene Foster, Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill and the new permanent secretary at the Northern Ireland Office, Madeline Alessandri. He also met Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and US ambassador Ed Crawford, a Trump appointee, at Farmleigh.The role of Northern Ireland envoy falls under the remit of the US state department, and Mr Mulvaney will report to Mr Trump and US secretary of state Mike Pompeo. Mr Mulvaney was replaced as Mr Trump’s chief of staff by congressman Mark Meadows last month. Like many in the administration, Mr Mulvaney played down the risk of coronavirus as recently as late February.Asked if he missed working at the White House, he replied: “I’m always happy to be home, but it’s kind of strange to be out of Washington at this time.” He says he still talks to the president and points out that Mr Meadows is a friend of his. Both were co-founders of the Freedom Caucus on Capitol Hill, a group of conservative, Republican lawmakers.

Photograph: Korean Central News Agency via The New York TimesNorth Korea is still sending letters and gifts to foreign leaders and domestic workers in the name of its leader, Kim Jong-un. Its news media brims, as usual, with panegyric propaganda extolling Kim’s leadership.South Korea reiterates that it has detected “nothing unusual” in the North. US president Donald Trump has called “incorrect” and “fake” a report that Kim was “in grave danger” after surgery.All this has done little to stop the rumour mill churning about Kim’s health and the fate of the nuclear state, for the simple reason that North Korea has not reported a public appearance by its leader for two weeks. Nor has it responded to lurid claims about his health.The lack of real information from the hermetic country is giving rise to rampant rumour mongering, leaving North Korean experts, foreign officials and intelligence agencies to parse through it all for signs of the truth.Depending on the news outlet or social media post, Kim, believed to be 36, is recuperating after a minor health issue like a sprained ankle, or he is “in grave danger” after a heart surgery. Or he has become “brain dead” or is in a “vegetative state” after a heart-valve surgery gone wrong at the hands of a nervous North Korean surgeon or one of the doctors China dispatched to treat him. Or Kim is grounded with Covid-19. Where did he get it? From one of those Chinese doctors.One rumour circulating in South Korean messaging apps claims that after French doctors could not wake Kim from his “coma,” Kim Pyong Il, a half brother of\u0026nbspKim’s late father, seized power with the help of pro-Chinese elites in Pyongyang, the North’s capital. It goes on to say that\u0026nbspKim’s powerful sister, Kim Yo-jong, has been detained while Beijing is secretly bargaining with Washington over the future of North Korea and its nuclear weapons.Seoul has questioned the accuracy of the unconfirmed reports, while the South Korean news media appears to dismiss most of them as rumours spreading through Chinese social media and beyond. But they cannot be completely ignored, since North Korea is so secretive that the world’s most powerful intelligence agencies have been unable to penetrate Kim’s inner circles.Public appearanceKim last appeared publicly April 11th, when he presided over a Politburo meeting. Speculations about his health began swirling after Kim missed state celebrations for his country’s biggest holiday, the April 14th birthday of his grandfather and founder of North Korea, Kim Il-sung.Rumours went into overdrive after Daily NK, a Seoul-based website relying on anonymous sources inside the North, reported Monday that Kim was recovering from heart surgery performed April 12th. The next day, CNN added to the frenzy, reporting that Washington was monitoring intelligence that\u0026nbspKim was “in grave danger”. On Saturday, TMZ, a celebrity-news website in the United States, blared: “N. Korea dictator Kim Jong-un reportedly dead after botched heart surgery.”More than once, Trump has wished Kim well if he indeed were ill.“North Korea’s secrecy and our lack of reliable information create a breeding ground for rumours,” said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul. “But his continued absence would be destabilising as more people in and outside the country wonder if he is incapacitated or dead.”In recent days, the South Koreans and their allies in Washington have scoured North Korea with the help of spy satellites and other resources for signs of Kim and preparations for missile launches. Their efforts led them to Wonsan, an east-coast town where Kim’s family has a seaside compound complete with yachts, jet skis, a horse track and a private train station. A train “probably belonging to”\u0026nbspKim has been parked there since at least Tuesday, 38 North, a Washington-based website specialising in North Korea, reported on Saturday, citing commercial satellite imagery.Wonsan is one of Kim’s favourite sites for missile tests. A South Korean news report said on Saturday that the United States had detected preparations for a missile test in Sondeok, farther up the east coast, where North Korea launched missiles in August last year and again in March in\u0026nbspKim’s presence.South Korean officials privately say that\u0026nbspKim’s presence at a missile test could be a strategic way to quiet the speculation. But North Korea has also used such preparations to keep its external foes guessing. There is a deep geopolitical fascination with North Korea, the world’s most isolated police state.The country has detonated six nuclear bombs in underground tests and claims to have built missiles powerful enough to deliver them to the continental United States. It is also run by a man who was dismissed as a figurehead when he took power in 2011 in his twenties.Kim has since established firm control, proving brutal enough to execute his own uncle, a potential threat to his power, and once calling\u0026nbspTrump a “mentally deranged US dotard”.Power vacuumKim’s sudden demise could create a power vacuum with far-reaching implications. Over the decades, US and South Korean officials have discussed top-secret contingency plans, including how to prevent the North’s nuclear weapons from falling into wrong hands and what to do if Beijing sends troops into the North to stabilize its neighbour, which has long served as a buffer between China and US forces based in South Korea.In this secretive society, any likely successor to Kim amounts to a guessing game, even for outside analysts who have spent their academic careers parsing the North. Will it be his only sister, Kim Yo-jong, who has recently expanded her role in his government? What about Kim Pyong-il, who returned home last year after serving for decades as North Korea’s low-key ambassador to eastern European countries? Some predict a collective leadership to be led by Choe Ryong-hae, the No\u0026nbsp2 in the government hierarchy. What if a yet-unknown but ambitious general engineered a putsch? How would North Koreans, who have been trained to worship the Kim family, respond?BlundersOfficials are careful not to quash the rumours on Kim’s health outright, in part because their past predictions on the North have sometimes proved wrong. Reporting on North Korea, too, has been strewn with blunders. Top officials reported to have been executed have often resurfaced. Some of the defectors, who feed information to the news media, have been accused of, or admitted to, embellishing their accounts.In 1986, a South Korean newspaper reported a “world scoop” claiming that Kim’s grandfather, then-president Kim Il-sung, died in an armed attack. A smiling Kim Il-sung resurfaced two days later. In 2014, Kim Jong-un disappeared for more than a month, prompting rumours that he might have been deposed in a coup. North Korean media later showed him walking with a cane after what South Korean intelligence called an ankle surgery.In 2015, a North Korean defector claimed that Kim ordered his own aunt to be killed with poison. But the aunt, Kim Kyong-hui, re-emerged in Pyongyang in January.The rumours can also turn out to be true. In 2008, Kim’s father and predecessor, Kim Jong-il, was absent from view for months. South Korean analysts and the news media speculated, correctly, that he had had a stroke. He died three years later.Joo Sung -ha, a North Korean defector-turned-journalist for the South Korean newspaper Dong-A Ilbo, said in a Facebook post that it was reasonable to believe that Kim had health problems. But he had zero trust in news reports detailing whether and why the North Korean leader faced a grave medical emergency.Such details about “the health of the Kim family is the secret among secrets,” he said, calling the people who claim to know “novelists”. – New York\u0026nbspTimesStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4237432.1587747479!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"barnier criticises uk over impasse in surreal brexit talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier in Brussels. An EU official said Mr Barnier was concerned about the prospect of not reaching agreement ahead of June extension deadline. Photograph: Olivier MatthysPoolAFP via Getty ImagesNo progress has been made in the areas of starkest disagreement between the European Union and the UK in week-long talks on the post-Brexit relationship, held over video conference due to the coronavirus pandemic.Lead EU negotiator Michel Barnier accused the British side of failing to engage seriously on some aspects, and said never before had such high-stakes talks had to take place under such time pressure, which was all the more difficult given the need to battle the pandemic and its severe economic fallout.“In this context, the negotiation that has occupied us this week may appear out of touch. It has even been qualified as surreal,” Mr Barnier said following the talks on Friday.Both EU and British sources said progress would have to seriously speed up in order for sufficient progress to be made, and an EU official said Mr Barnier was seriously worried about the prospect of not reaching an agreement.“They listen politely to us presenting our text, but they don’t engage in some of the areas where they don’t have an interest to reach an agreement,” a senior EU official said.“We don’t have much time, and we see that in some of the aspects that the British authorities know for us, the EU side, are indispensable to have an agreement in the end, they don’t want to move. This is why Michel Barnier is concerned.”It was the first of three rounds of talks scheduled to be held before June, when Britain will have its final chance to opt for more time to negotiate its future relationship with its biggest trading partner.British sources insisted that under no circumstances would they accept an extension of the transition period, which expires at the end of this year.If no deal can be agreed between the UK and the EU by then, they will automatically begin trading on default World Trade Organisation terms, which is forecast to deliver a deep blow to the British economy and to its nearest neighbours, particularly Ireland. Even if a deal is agreed, British negotiators say they are perusing an arrangement like those the EU has with Canada or Japan, which would entail significant barriers to trade.‘Level playing field’The four areas of greatest contention are on the so-called “level playing field”, on the governance of the deal, on police and judicial co-operation, and on fishing rights, an area on which Britain has yet to submit a legal text of its position for negotiation.The EU has said it will not grant tariff-free access to its single market unless Britain maintains labour and environmental standards and guarantees it will not intervene to give companies an unfair advantage. Britain has dismissed this as unacceptable.On governance, the EU wants a single overarching framework while the UK wants a series of separate arrangements. The EU insists that Britain should guarantee continued adherence to the European Convention on Human Rights, and that the European Court of Justice should be the final arbiter on disputes that touch on EU law. Britain rejects the jurisdiction of the ECJ entirely.“We will not make progress on the so called level playing field and the governance provisions until the EU drops its insistence on imposing conditions on the UK which are not found in the EU’s other trade agreements and which do not take account of the fact that we have left the EU as an independent state,” a British government spokesperson said.British sources said they had used the latest round of talks to challenge the EU’s argument that Britain’s size and proximity to the EU made level playing field commitments essential, and they defended British labour and environmental standards.They said there was no question of Britain continuing fishing quota agreements with other EU countries, which Brussels has proposed.The two sides meet for further rounds of talks starting on May 11th and June 1st ahead of a high-level meeting before the end of June which will make the final decision on extending the transition.Separately, the Specialised Committee on the Protocol on IrelandNorthern Ireland will meet next Thursday. The EU has emphasised that agreement of a deal depends on Britain demonstrating that it is enacting prior agreements, including on arrangements for trade between Britain and Northern Ireland, which the EU insists entails regulatory, sanitary and phytosanitary checks on goods entering the North from Britain.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Getty German police wearing riot gear and face masks tussled on Saturday with dozens of protesters demonstrating in central Berlin against the coronavirus lockdown on public life.Protesters shouted “I want my life back” and held up signs with slogans such as “Protect constitutional rights”, “Freedom isn’t everything but without freedom, everything is nothing”, and “Daddy, what is a kiss?”Police said they had arrested more than 100 people.Some protesters tried to keep a distance from each other, sitting on the ground and wearing masks but others clustered together.Like dozens of countries globally, Germany has put in place strict curbs on public activity to slow transmission of Covid-19 – imposing its lockdown on March 17th.The protesters handed out newspapers entitled Democratic Resistance that stated coronavirus is an attempt to seize power by spreading fear. The papers quoted 127 doctors worldwide who question the need for strict lockdowns.Police spokesman Thilo Cablitz said permission had been granted for a newspaper distribution campaign, but the health authorities had not granted permission for a public demonstration.“During coronavirus times and according to containment regulations, we are obliged to prevent a gathering,” said Mr Cablitz. He added that 180 police officers were on duty.Germany’s Constitutional Court ruled earlier this month that people have the right to hold protests if they adhere to social distancing rules. The ruling came after pro-democracy activists argued that the lockdown breaches freedom of assembly.On Saturday, some protesters sat peacefully on the ground at a distance from each other, holding white roses in reference to the White Rose resistance movement against the Nazis.Why has Germany a low fatality rate?“We are here today . . . to stand up for our opinion. For the protection of constitutional rights, freedom and above all freedom of speech,” said a woman holding a rose who gave her name only as Sandra.Germany has the fifth-highest Covid-19 case total behind the United States, Spain, Italy and France. However it has kept fatalities relatively low after early and extensive testing.Encouraged by lower infection figures, the government allowed smaller stores to reopen on Monday, along with car and bicycle dealers and bookstores, but social distancing rules remain in place until May 3rd.The country’s confirmed cases increased by 2,055 to 152,438 and the death toll rose by 179 to 5,500, data from the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases showed on Saturday – a second day of deceleration in both cases and deaths. – ReutersEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4238274.1587885052!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus americans flock to beaches as some states seek to reopen","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tHuntington Beach, California on April 25th, 2020. Photograph: Apu GomesAFP via Getty ImagesMany Americans flocked to beaches on Saturday as one Florida county expanded access and California experienced a heatwave, even as new coronavirus cases hit a record high in the United States.Hair salons and other shops in Georgia, Oklahoma and some other states opened for a second day as pockets of the country sought to restart their economies following a month of government-ordered lockdowns.The tentative steps toward restarting life run against the warnings of many public health experts, who say the increased human interaction could spark a new wave of coronavirus cases.The US on Friday reported 36,491 new cases, a record daily high, according to a Reuters tally. Global deaths linked to the virus, also known as Covid-19, passed 200,000 on Saturday, with more than a quarter of them in the US, the tally shows.Restart dateNew York governor Andrew Cuomo repeated his warning on Saturday that reopening businesses too soon was risky, while Rhode Island governor Gina Raimondo pushed back against a protest at the State House in Providence as short-sighted, arguing it could force her to delay her restart date.“At this point to violate social distancing rules, it’s just selfish,” Ms Raimondo told a briefing, referring to the protest against a lockdown in effect until at least May 8th. “If everybody today went out and violated the rules I will definitely have to push back the date at which we can reopen the economy.”Volusia County, home to the famed Daytona Beach, opened lots at its coastal parks on Saturday to disabled visitors, one step in a phased reopening that has so far limited its beaches to those seeking to walk, surf, cycle or swim.In a briefing on Friday, county manager George Recktenwald portrayed the relaxed parking provision as an incremental step and warned against gathering in groups, although residents said many beachgoers were not following the rules.“I know they have rules and restrictions, but people aren’t listening,” said John Overchuck (45), a lawyer who lives in a beachfront home with his wife and toddler daughter just south of Daytona Beach. “I walked on the beach 10 minutes ago and it’s packed. That wasn’t supposed to happen.”Large crowdsA heat wave brought thousands of Californians to the open beaches in Newport Beach and Huntington Beach on Saturday despite stay-at-home orders for people across the state, after similarly large crowds visited the beaches on Friday. California governor Gavin Newsom has pleaded for those who visit the shore to practice social distancing.Mr Cuomo said on Saturday that his state began conducting antibody tests of nurses, doctors, police officers, grocery clerks and other essential workers while also allowing local pharmacies to collect samples for diagnostic tests.The focus on testing comes as the crisis appears to be subsiding in New York, the epicentre of the pandemic in the US, with hospitalisations falling to their lowest level in three weeks.“Twenty one days of hell, and now we are back to where we were 21 days ago,” Mr Cuomo told a daily briefing. “Testing is what we are compulsively or obsessively focused on now.”Yet New York also reported an additional 437 coronavirus-linked deaths, up from 422 a day earlier and the first rise in four days. New Jersey, its neighbour to the south, reported 249 more deaths. Together the two states account for about half of the nearly 53,000 fatalities in the US.The top US infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci agreed that testing was key to getting back to normal by identifying carriers, isolating them and tracing their contacts with others.“Right now we’re doing 1.5 million to 2 million (tests) per week. We probably should get up to twice that as we get into the next several weeks, and I think we will,” Mr Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in a webcast of the National Academy of Sciences’ annual meeting.CautionNew Jersey governor Phil Murphy said that while his curve of cases was “undeniably flattening” he would not yet open parks or beaches and suggested he would move cautiously with broad parameters of the state’s reopening plan to be disclosed as soon as Monday.“We need to see more progress and more slowing before we can begin implementing any effort to get ourselves on the road to the new normal that awaits our state on the other side of this pandemic,” Mr Murphy told a daily briefing.US president Donald Trump did not hold his regular briefing after causing an uproar two days earlier by suggesting scientists explore whether the internal use of disinfectants such as bleach could treat coronavirus. He later said he was being sarcastic.“What is the purpose of having White House News Conferences when the Lamestream Media asks nothing but hostile questions, \u0026amp then refuses to report the truth or facts accurately,” Mr Trump wrote on Twitter on Saturday.In contrast, barbers, nail salons and other sectors of Georgia’s economy were open for a second day, although many business owners took precautions to limit customers and many decided not to open at all.Theo Walker, owner of Golden Anchor Tattoo in Atlanta, said he opened his doors for a second day after putting the question of whether to reopen to his artists and they voted yes.“In an ideal world we would have loved to just wait at home until it’s all over, but unfortunately we all have bills that are waiting, and I did not want my artists to suffer anymore,” he said. “We all decided it was time to get back to work.” - ReutersEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons april 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Can I drive during the lockdown?

Reuters was unable to immediately determine what the trip by the Chinese team signalled in terms of Mr Kim\u0027s health.A delegation led by a senior member of the Chinese Communist Party\u0027s International Liaison Department left Beijing for North Korea on Thursday, two of the people said. The department is the main Chinese body dealing with neighbouring North Korea.The sources declined to be identified, given the sensitivity of the matter.The Liaison Department could not be reached by Reuters for comment late on Friday. China\u0027s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment late on Friday.Daily NK, a Seoul-based website, reported earlier this week that Mr Kim was recovering after undergoing a cardiovascular procedure on April 12. It cited one unnamed source in North Korea.South Korean government officials and a Chinese official with the Liaison Department challenged subsequent reports suggesting that Mr Kim was in grave danger after surgery. South Korean officials said they had detected no signs of unusual activity in North Korea.On Thursday, US President Donald Trump also downplayed earlier reports that Mr Kim was gravely ill. I think the report was incorrect, Mr Trump told reporters, but he declined to say if he had been in touch with North Korean officials.On Friday, a South Korean source told Reuters their intelligence was that Mr Kim was alive and would likely make an appearance soon. The person said he did not have any comment on Mr Kim\u0027s current condition or any Chinese involvement.An official familiar with US intelligence said that Mr Kim was known to have health problems but they had no reason to conclude he was seriously ill or unable eventually to reappear in public.A US State department spokeswoman had no comment. US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, when asked about Mr Kim\u0027s health on Fox News after Mr Trump spoke said: I don’t have anything I can share with you tonight, but the American people should know we\u0027re watching the situation very keenly.North Korea is one of the world\u0027s most isolated and secretive countries, and the health of its leaders is treated as a matter of state security. Reuters has not been able to independently confirm any details on Mr Kim\u0027s whereabouts or condition.North Korea\u0027s state media last reported on Mr Kim\u0027s whereabouts when he presided over a meeting on April 11. State media did not report that he was in attendance at an event to mark the birthday of his grandfather, Kim Il Sung, on April 15, an important anniversary in North Korea.Mr Kim, believed to be 36, has disappeared from coverage in North Korean state media before. In 2014, he vanished for more than a month and North Korean state TV later showed him walking with a limp. Speculation about his health has been fanned by his heavy smoking, apparent weight gain since taking power and family history of cardiovascular problems.When Kim Jong Un\u0027s father, Kim Jong Il, suffered a stroke in 2008, South Korean media reported at the time that Chinese doctors were involved in his treatment along with French physicians.Last year, Chinese President Xi Jinping made the first state visit in 14 years by a Chinese leader to North Korea, an impoverished state that depends on Beijing for economic and diplomatic support.China is North Korea\u0027s chief ally and the economic lifeline for a country hard-hit by UN sanctions, and has a keen interest in the stability of the country with which it shares a long, porous border.Mr Kim is a third-generation hereditary leader who came to power after his father Kim Jong Il died in 2011 from a heart attack. He has visited China four times since 2018.Mr Trump held unprecedented summits with Mr Kim in 2018 and 2019 as part of a bid to persuade him to give up North Korea’s nuclear arsenal.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus test anyone traced known carrier","story":"Everyone who comes into contact with a potential Covid-19 sufferer will be able to order home swab testing kits via a new NHS app as the Government eases lockdown, The  understands.The technology should eventually allow symptomless workers to return to their jobs quicker because they will be able to identify whether the virus is present within days of being identified as a risk by contact tracing.Advanced testing is being carried out on the NHS CV19 app, which works by using Bluetooth signals to log when smartphone owners are close to each other, at a Royal Air Force base in North Yorkshire.The technology, which is being overseen in part by Dr Simon Eccles, chief clinical information officer at NHS Digital, will be of particular help to employers when Covid-19 cases drop to manageable levels.Initially, only those with symptoms will be able to use the app to request a test. Eventually, once a member of the public is contacted by the tracing app as near a potential sufferer, the user will immediately be able to apply for a swab to be sent out in the post. The result of the test will then be known within days.Sources confirmed the existence of the plan after a letter sent out by Public Health England to specialists referring to the swabs was seen by the The .The NHS CV19 app is an automated system for rapid symptom reporting, ordering of swab tests, and sending tailored and targeted alerts to other app users who have had close contact, the letter sent out by Richard Gleave, Deputy Chief Executive at Public Health England, said.The Government hopes the app - which could be released by the middle of May - will provide a permanent route out of lockdown.Once a member of the public installs the app, it will start logging the distance between their phone and other phones nearby that also have the app installed using Bluetooth Low Energy, Mr Gleave adds.In the letter to public health agencies and local authorities, he says the app will work in unison with a call-based system for those without the technology.He also refers to the Government\u0027s huge recruitment drive to carry out the extra testing. There will be a national-level recruitment initially of around 18,000 staff (around 3,000 qualified public health and clinical professionals and around 15,000 call handlers) to undertake the phone based contact tracing with both the cases and the contacts, he adds.The app and call centres will work in unison with a government website test site which was booked up within an hour of opening Saturday in England and Wales, even though it is currently only available for UK key workers. The site had to close to new applicants within hours of launching on Friday, after 46,000 people tried to access it. Some 16,000 bookings were made.The wider contact tracing strategy led by Government has led to calls for from both local authorities and public health experts for more powers for councils to conduct detailed analysis on the ground. In developing contact tracing, the Government hopes it can emulate the likes of South Korea and Singapore in rolling out a mass programme within weeks.The theory is that since lockdown measures have reduced the infection rate, it will be easier to keep track of emerging cases.However, Ian Hudspeth, chairman of the Local Government Association’s Community Wellbeing Board, suggested more money will be needed on top of the £3.2billion already sent to local authorities.“Councils want to play their full part in the national effort to defeat this disease, he said. Directors of Public Health working in councils, alongside a range of other local services such as environmental health, public health including sexual health services and infection control nurses already have the experience of testing and contact tracing in their communities.They have the necessary skills to work with government on this, to scale up the system at pace and shape this at a local level. For key workers in England and Scotland with symptoms of the virus, No 10 has said appointments for tests at drive-through centres and home testing kits would become available each day from 8am.Prof Stephen Powis, medical director of NHS England, has said the current testing capacity is at more than 50,000 daily tests, and that reaching 100,000 a day by Thursday remains the aim.Matt Hancock, the health secretary, had previously said a “large-scale” operation will be up and running within weeks to identify people who are newly infected and rapidly warn those they have come into contact with that they could be at risk. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"key workers must get masks public should cover faces says bma","story":"He added: Common sense tells you that a barrier between people must offer a level of protection, however small.“The Government must pursue all avenues of reducing the spread of infection.

While the government signals that any talk of unwinding the lockdown would send the wrong messages to the public the debate has already moved on.The British people, the vast majority of whom have behaved with remarkable patience and restraint, know that the current situation will not be open-ended and are looking for some hope and optimism to sustain them. The big question facing the government is how to get the economy moving again with minimal threat to public health. It is a difficult ethical question but then governments are elected to take the decisions that most people would rather not have to.In other words, early lockdown slowed the progression of the epidemic (‘the flattened curve’) but over time outcomes were relatively similar until roughly comparable levels of population immunity had been achieved. In short, until a vaccine is available there is a limit to what we can achieve by social restrictions.Lockdown, of course, is not without its own health and social costs. There is huge disruption to normal health services including delayed elective surgery with reduced treatment and screening of diseases such as cancer. This will have an impact further down the line, including on death rates. The mental and social costs of isolation and the tensions created by prolonged family confinement also have to be factored in. It is clear that the NHS has been able to deal with the surge in demand and that some of the projected modelling for mortality rates were enormously overestimated.Covid-19 deaths in and out of hospitalOf course, there will be risks to unwinding the lockdown, especially if it occurs too quickly. The same American research showed that those cities with low initial peak death rates had a greater risk of a large second wave and that they were likely to experience this after a shorter time interval. No cities in the study had a second wave while the restrictions were still in place, only after they were relaxed.A second wave is something that neither government nor public health officials will want to see. No one will wish to test the public’s tolerance of a second lockdown, still less the extended economic costs or the political blame game that would inevitably ensue. This almost certainly means that any unwinding of the lockdown will occur in an incremental and phased way.We can follow the German example of allowing small shops to open first and the restricted access to supermarkets, that we have become accustomed to, could form the model for the opening of larger stores. For larger value items, such as cars or furniture, an appointment system could be introduced to control the flow of customers. New sectors could be opened up completely. For example garden centres were not deemed to be “essential services” yet they have a hugely seasonal element to their financial viability and if hardware stores can be made to operate safely why should the same not be true for facilities that give such satisfaction in the relative safety of people’s own gardens.Only time will tell if our global response to Covid 19 has been proportionate or not. Every human death is a unique tragedy for loved ones but the collapse of the global economy would have profound and potentially catastrophic implications for millions in the developing world in particular.As our leaders take the difficult health, economic and ethical decisions in our name the whole country must be aware that all choices have consequences.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

There has been no shortage of the former recently from Ministers keen to come up with big ideas to tackle Covid-19. But the delivery of the vision has been uneven. What we need is for the coronavirus crisis to be a reset moment when we leave behind anything that stops public services delivering as well as they should.First, the successes. Much of the NHS has changed its ways of working in a way that would have been unimaginable three months ago. At the end of last year, 90 per cent of GP consultations were held face-to-face. Faced with the outbreak, GPs switched to online and telephone consultations overnight. General practice has opened its eyes to the technology that the rest of us take for granted and it will never go back.Hospitals have been just as innovative. Outpatient appointments have become virtual. There has been a bonfire of red tape. Staff have been allowed to re-train in new disciplines in a way that traditional professional guidance would not have allowed.The relationship of the NHS with the private health sector has also changed for the better. At the beginning of the crisis, a deal to give the NHS access to every private hospital in the country took less than a week to complete. The number of ventilators has increased, partly due to new partnerships with industry. Some hospitals, such as the Warrington NHS Foundation Trust, have pioneered alternatives to ventilators.But there are other less successful areas. Health authorities set up a new regional infrastructure to supply PPE which turned out to be unreliable. The Government has now enlisted eBay to allow NHS workers to personally order PPE – a fantastic idea, but one that should have happened weeks ago.   Testing has also been slow to get going. The UK did not prioritise testing and contact-tracing in the way that Asian countries did. The first efforts to provide testing facilities for NHS staff required them to use private transport and to drive long distances, making it impossible for some to get tested. Public health authorities have been slow to embrace technology which can trace people who have come into contact with coronavirus carriers, so allowing the lifting of a blanket lockdown. GPs have shown what can be achieved when public authorities are willing to be flexible and embrace new ways of working. It is an example that needs to be followed more widely, especially as future developments in healthcare, as well as in other areas of the public sector, are likely to be driven by technology, such as the power of big data and 5G networks.It matters that ministers such as Matt Hancock are authorising public services to change wherever they need to.

PHE\u0027s time would have been better spent, he said, ensuring testing facilities were up to scratch throughout the country.It\u0027s been inadequate and they have failed to catch up with themselves even when it was shown to be inadequate, he told The .We\u0027ve known that influenza has had the potential to do this, especially a mutant virus of the kind we\u0027ve seen. We\u0027ve known this is something that is possible to happen and they should have been on top of all the way through.The  disclosed four weeks ago how ministers were informed three years ago that Britain would be quickly overwhelmed by a pandemic amid a shortage of critical care beds, morgue capacity and personal protective equipment (PPE).Codenamed Exercise Cygnus, the three-day dry run for a pandemic carried out in October 2016 tested how NHS hospitals and other services would cope in the event of a major flu outbreak with a similar mortality rate to Covid-19. Dr Ashton said the ongoing failure to prepare was totally negligent.The actual preparedness side is being neglected and then the failure to follow through with this big exercise is totally negligent, he said. They didn\u0027t follow through on that.Ashton, who was a key whistleblower after the Hillsborough tragedy, also expressed disappointment at the make up of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), the key Government advisory group. There’s not a single director of public health or experienced public health practitioner on Sage, he said. I can’t imagine that the steering group for HS2 wouldn\u0027t include any real engineers.Despite the failings exposed by Cygnus, the government never changed its strategic roadmap for a future pandemic, with the last update carried out in 2014.Dr Ashton added: Public Health England have been doing a lot of international work, and really it was the work of Dfid. Given they\u0027ve had such a reduction in their budget and resources, they should have been focusing on the core function of what Public Health England was set up to do, which is national, regional and local.On the one hand, they\u0027ve taken their eye of the ball and been doing more international work, and on the other hand, they\u0027ve neglected the regions and local public health teams. That\u0027s shown with this because they\u0027ve been depending on Colendale labs for the testing and they weren\u0027t able to rope in the other labs, which seem to have been deprived of resources. Some of them seem to have been run down.In response, Duncan Selbie, PHE’s Chief Executive said: “This is wrong in so many ways. There will be a right time to reflect on who did what or should have done but that time is not now. Right now PHE is focused solely on the job of responding to Covid-19 and I am proud of our people and their many contributions and the Secretary of State has publicly recognised this.“On testing specifically, PHE have not tried to hold this in house or manage it nationally. We were one of the first agencies in the world to develop a sensitive test for COVID-19 and worked at pace to roll this out to a wider network of PHE and over 40 NHS labs. We have supported work to implement testing in a further network of testing centres and sites across the country as soon as it was safe and possible to do so. We have not stopped anyone doing anything. The Government’s testing strategy makes this clear.”Criticism from health bosses has centred on PHE\u0027s ability to ramp up testing, compared to the likes of Germany, which has so far maintained a far lower death rate.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"vaccine results could set back successful lockdown professor","story":"Results from trials for a Covid-19 vaccine could be delayed due to the success of the lockdown in preventing the spread of coronavirus, the director of the Oxford Vaccine Group has said.Speaking shortly after the first volunteers were injected as part of human trials, Professor Andrew Pollard warned how a drop in the infection rate could hamper their research. More than 800 people aged 18 to 55 have been recruited for the Oxford University study, with one half being given the vaccine while the other receives a placebo. Because volunteers cannot be exposed directly to Covid-19 due to the obvious health risks of administering a virus that has no cure they instead simply return to normal life.Consequently, it is feared getting results could be held up if transmission of the virus among the population continues to fall. Although scientists have tried to recruit frontline health workers because they are more likely to come into contact with coronavirus, many of the volunteers are general members of the public who are required to observe the lockdown.For researchers to prove the vaccine is effective they have to show that those given it have had fewer or no coronavirus cases compared to those administered the placebo.Prof Pollard said: “It’s absolutely the case that you can only know whether a vaccine works if there is some transmission of the virus, and the vaccine is able to prevent some people getting infected. “So, we do need to have some virus transmission, and of course the lockdown is very successful which may delay our ability to get a result from the trials.“It’s an incredibly complex issue, in that if we could guarantee that there would be plenty of transmission we would know an answer within a few months. “Because we can’t guarantee that we don’t know exactly what will happen, so it makes it almost impossible to give a definite prediction about when we would have an answer.”The trials are being carried by teams of scientists in Oxfords, Southampton, London and Bristol.  Those taking part are required to keep a diary to see whether they experience any side effects.Blood samples will be taken to assess their immune response to the vaccine. They are given a telephone number manned 24-hours-a-day by members of the clinical team in case they develop Covid-19 symptoms.If they become very unwell local hospital staff would be alerted.   The volunteers will not know whether they have been given the vaccine or the placebo until the end of the study. If successful, a larger trial of about 5,0000 British volunteers will be recruited. The Oxford team has announced it is now working with scientists in Kenya about a possible vaccine trial there because the rate of transmission is growing from a lower base.Meanwhile, other locations around the UK where transmission is expected to increase are being considered for further tests.Prof Pollard said he remains optimistic the latest round of research will produce results.  “I suspect over time we will get an answer,” he added. “It’s just if we are too good at social distancing while it could be a great thing for reducing disease and protecting the NHS it will mean it will take much longer to get an answer.”He added that he believes the battle against coronavirus requires more than one vaccine to be created to provide an adequate supply of such drugs to meet worldwide demand.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"wasnt ambitious one fugitive mastermind behind worlds biggest","story":"It was one of the biggest art scams in modern American history. It saw some of the world’s experts fooled into helping sell $80million (£65m) of fake Pollocks and Rothkos to unsuspecting buyers.At the centre of it all was a couple dubbed Bonnie and Clyde.Until now, “Clyde” - José Carlos Bergantiños Diaz - had remained mum, refusing to reveal the story behind the audacious fraud.Now he has broken his silence in an interview from his native Spain, where he has been living as a fugitive, to put the blame on his sidekick and former girlfriend, art dealer Glafira Rosales.“I was never ambitious Glafira was the ambitious one,” Mr Bergantiños Diaz, 64, said in an interview for filmmaker Barry Avrich’s documentary “Made You Look,” which aired this week on Canadian TV. “She loved fancy clothes and fancy parties.”Mr Bergantiños Díaz was accused by federal prosecutors of taking part in the multi-million dollar forgery scheme, which involved dozens of masterworks, many of which were sold through Knoedler \u0026amp Company, once New York’s oldest gallery.He was subject to a criminal case and also private lawsuits brought by several collectors who had spent considerable sums on the phony works, dating back to the mid-1990s.However, prosecutors have been unable to extradite him from Spain, where he fled soon after the charges were brought.The fake art was created by Pei-Shen Qian, a Chinese immigrant who admitted he made more than 60 forgeries in the basement of his home in Queens for Ms Rosales, who sold them to Knoedler Gallery. Mr Qian’s paintings, which were mostly copied from Modernist artists, were so convincing that acknowledged experts and sophisticated collectors did not identify them as frauds.Ms Rosales, 63, pleaded guilty to nine counts of conspiracy, fraud and other crimes in 2013, telling the authorities that Mr Bergantiños Diaz used threats and abuse to coerce her into continuing with the scheme.She was ordered to give back the $33.2 million she made from the scam, but avoided a prison sentence after judges agreed Mr Bergantiños Diaz was the mastermind.But Mr Bergantiños Díaz tells a different story, claiming Ms Rosales had the most contact with Mr Qian and that it was her who had the business relationship with Knoedler.“I didn’t know everything she was selling or buying because we were distanced from each other and I have my own networks,” he said, speaking sometimes through a translator.He claimed that he was not aware that Ms Rosales was selling work made by Mr Qian as the real thing.He also said she was lying when she told police he mistreated her. “I forgive her and she is the mother of my daughter and I wish her the best,” he told the filmmaker.Knoedler \u0026amp Co shut down in the wake of the controversy, Mr Qian escaped to China, while Ms Rosales was working until recently as a waitress in a Brooklyn diner.“I think the only people that weren’t humiliated were Carlos Bergantiños, Glafira Rosales and Pei-Shen Qian,” filmmaker Mr Avrich, who spent years tracking them all down, told the New York Times. “I think everybody else was humiliated.”Bryan Skarlatos, Ms Rosales’s solicitor, declined to comment on her behalf.“However,” he said. “I believe that she may be willing to speak in the coming months and, if so, what she says will be very different from Mr Diaz’s story.”Mr Avrich said he had no doubt that, as the federal authorities have charged, the pair worked closely together in the scam.“They were the Bonnie and Clyde of the art world after all,” Mr Avrich said.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/04/05/TELEMMGLPICT000229094849_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqOj5_Rmr3MNcQcsRkzAbTbSpPmN5eNR6pQVArxqnJGCI.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"dreary modern culture great british eccentric vanishing breed","story":" Society must treasure its eccentrics like the late Marquis of Bath. We may not see their like again.The Reverend David Johnson, who died last week, was a member of a vanishingly rare breed, the English eccentric. I met the Vicar at university, and have many vivid recollections of him, most unrepeatable. Johnson, a parish priest, became the unofficial chaplain to the Oxford Union and Conservative association, attending our events and making raucous speeches.He offered glimpses of a louche, bohemian world – one of wild pranks and madcap schemes – aeons away from the worthy conformity pervading modern student life. Though an exceptional speaker and fearsome wit, the Vicar’s vices prevented him from realising his potential as a clergyman. Often roaring drunk throughout the day, he once began a funeral he was officiating with the opening lines of the wedding service. He possessed a unique gift for rubbing people up the wrong way. Yet his life was tinged with brilliance.Johnson was serving as Cambridge Union president when Benazir Bhutto, his opposite number at Oxford, challenged him to a cricket match. Having coaxed a cadre of blues onside, Bhutto felt assured of victory, until it became clear that Johnson had persuaded half the Australian cricket team, then on a winter tour of England, to play.He and a friend once shot out the windows of a love rival’s rooms, only to find they had the wrong man. Friendly with Princess Margaret, he claimed the pair had been enjoying a crafty indoor cigarette at Buckingham Palace one Christmas, when the Queen walked in. Margaret quickly threw her cigarette into a nearby nativity scene, where her sister found it, smouldering in the crib.The Vicar was best known as co-author of a series of hoax letters, written under the nom-de-plume Francis Wagstaffe, purely for the fun of teasing Church of England bishops and other Establishment figures. (One begins: “Dear Bishop, Like you, I am a man of little education.”) He later documented his correspondence, including their earnest and sometimes furious replies, in a book. As an Oxford tour guide, he enjoyed fabricating stories for American visitors, explaining that a statue of Queen Caroline of Ansbach was actually Margaret Thatcher.Eccentrics may lead more erratic lives than most, but they add greatly to the gaiety of nations. Yet our culture provides terrible conditions for these qualities to thrive. True, money is often an ingredient hence the tradition of quirky aristocrats such as the Duke of Portland, a Victorian recluse who built a network of subterranean mazes under his estate to avoid human contact, or the delightfully dotty late Marquis of Bath. (The Vicar himself lived in a rough part of Oxford, in a terraced house he nicknamed “Seaview Cottage”).But what really drives eccentricity is not wealth, but disdain for public opinion. Today’s dreary PC culture, and the self-obsessions induced by social media, have left this devil-may-care attitude a depressing rarity.When we come to commemorate Johnson in proper style, it will feel as if we’re burying not just a friend, but one of a dying breed. Society must treasure its eccentrics. We may not see their like again.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

And exponentially so every day. Businesses are going bankrupt jobs are being lost the national debt is piling up.Undoubtedly, saving lives must be the Government’s first priority. But it is increasingly alarming that after more than a month, it is still not able to articulate how and when restrictions can start to be lifted. So, though the Government’s mantra, ‘Stay at Home Protect the NHS Save Lives’ was right at the time, we must remember that we also need to ‘Get Back to Work Protect the Economy Save Livelihoods’ for all our sakes - and the sake of our children and grandchildren who will be repaying the debts run up during this crisis.The Centre for Policy Studies, a think tank that I chair, forecasts that state borrowing will this year soar to £300 billion, twice the entire budget of the NHS. Our nation will take many, many years to repay this.It is important to recognise that a shattered economy will have an enormous human toll as well, creating unemployment, poverty, and stress which will have a direct impact on people’s mental and physical health. So far, the Government’s lockdown has acted like a sledgehammer against the enormous health crisis that is COVID-19. But just as medical knowledge has evolved, so must our response to the virus which should now become more targeted and nuanced.It is clear for example that the risk to millions of people who are young and have no co-morbidity issues is small. They could be allowed to return to a more normal work routine, while those more at risk should remain in some proportionate degree of isolation.In the meantime, businesses need clarity. Many corporate leaders I know are struggling not just with the shutdown itself but also with the lack of any guidance about how long this will last and how and when and how restrictions will be lifted. It makes it impossible to forecast or take proper action. Wait and see is not a business strategy – or indeed a recipe for running a nation. The Government needs to give all of us some route map out of this, even if it is broad principles, milestones or the stages with which lockdown will be lifted.The coronavirus outbreak around the world, in picturesThis should be the Prime Minister’s absolute priority when he hopefully returns to work at Number 10 tomorrow, an event we should all be profoundly grateful for.At the same time people need to know they will have businesses – and jobs – to return to when the lockdown ends. And on this score, it appears that CBILS, the Government’s COVID-19 corporate lending scheme, has been falling short. The idea behind the scheme was masterful and all credit to Rishi Sunak as Chancellor. But the implementation has so far been poor, mired in bureaucracy between the British Business Bank that oversees it and the banks themselves who are foot dragging on providing the actual loans, so that by the end of last week less than 17,000 loans had been approved.Given that Britain has more than 6 million private businesses and that 300,000 of them are said to have looked for support, this is a shockingly low figure and only a fraction of the 76,000 businesses that received support from a similar scheme in Switzerland in its first week.Finally, investors and entrepreneurs like me also have a duty to lead Britain out of this dark time. We know there are many good businesses that have been laid low and we have the resources to back some of them. One of our nation’s great strengths is the NHS undoubtedly, and it is being tested to its limit right now. But another is our sense of entrepreneurialism and commercial acumen. Soon it will be the turn of the business leaders to provide the funds, offer the knowhow and encouragement, protect the jobs and play our role in the rebuilding of the economy.

The firm should work with the customer to resolve these difficulties in advance of payments being missed, the FCA said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But the company has now paused the availability of that and some other categories as it deals with false stories around the pandemic.Other topics including conspiracy theory appear to have disappeared from the list, and a Facebook spokesperson confirmed to Reuters that other categories were being hidden as it evaluates the different audience categories.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe removal came after a report that demonstrated it was possible to pick people interested in pseudoscience for targeting with particular posts, presumably allowing them to be targeted with false or misleading information.Such people would not necessarily know they were thought to be interested in such a topic, and would not have given any explicit indication that they were. Instead, the tag was probably added by automated systems based on the kinds of content they engage with.The Markup demonstrated that Facebook was allowing such ads after saying it would police COVID-19 misinformation on its platform. More than 78 million Facebook users were interested in pseudoscience, it said, citing Facebook\u0027s ad portal.Misinformation about the pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus, from bogus cures to wide-ranging conspiracy theories, has also spread on rival social media platforms such Twitter Inc and YouTube, the video service of Alphabet Inc\u0027s Google.Advocacy group Avaaz reported last week that a sample of 104 coronavirus-related pieces of misinformation content on Facebook analyzed by the group had reached over 117 million estimated views.Data gathered by ProPublica in 2016 shows that Facebook assigned pseudoscience to users at that time, suggesting the category has been available for several years.The Facebook spokeswoman said in her email that the pseudoscience category should have been removed in a previous review.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

After the government was heavily criticised for its failure to provide equipment to medical staff, Sarah says she\u0027s never had to enter a Covid-19 ward without PPE, but has “probably worn about five to six different types of gowns and visors and masks, depending on the stock and the flow and the amount of different stuff available at different sites.”You can read about the interview here.You can subscribe to the series on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Acast or wherever you listen.

The firm should work with the customer to resolve these difficulties in advance of payments being missed, the FCA said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A further 19 per cent did not rule it out.5G conspiracy theory most common fake news story about coronavirusMuslims targeted with ‘dangerous’ conspiracy theories during lockdown5G was also the theory that had been seen by the largest group of people (37 per cent), followed by claims that coronavirus was developed by China as a biological weapon (35 per cent) and that it was “intentionally released as part of a depopulation plan by the UN or New World Order (21 per cent).The findings came after counterterror police warned that conspiracy theories were being used “as a hook” by extremists to draw in new recruits.Officials are concerned that lockdown conditions mean that people are spending more time alone online, while experiencing fear and distress that makes them less able to spot and reject misinformation.Chief Superintendent Nik Adams, national coordinator of the Prevent programme, told The Independent false claims linking 5G technology to the spread of coronavirus were being “monitored very closely”.“It’s being pushed out by extreme right-wing groups as a hook to get people onto chat forums, where they can then talk about other hate-related conspiracy theories and draw people into their narratives,” he added.“From that, they can pick up those iniduals who are must vulnerable to encourage them, radicalise them and take them towards terrorism.”Separate research said “dangerous” conspiracy theories blaming Muslims for the spread of coronavirus were gaining traction, after police were forced to debunk several fake videos being used to claim that mosques remained open.Hope Not Hate said that “anti-Islam sentiment was high” across different questions in the poll, with 28 per cent of people believing the Muslim population is growing faster than non-Muslim and the same proportion thinking Islam seeks to replace British law with Sharia.It also found that 13 per cent of the population believed the antisemitic trope that Jewish people have “undue control of the banking system”.Warning over coronavirus disinformation as extremists exploit crisisThe majority of conspiracy theorists voted Leave, while most of those broadly against the theories voted Remain in the EU referendum.Mr Hermansson said the strongest believers were generally lower earners with a lower level of education, and were less likely to have voted in the most recent general election or supported a political party.“Conspiracy theories are a symptom of a larger issue where people don’t trust politics and feel left behind,” he added.“That lack of trust can make people prone to conspiracy theories, then they add to those feelings and make them worse.”Mr Hermansson said the nature of the coronavirus outbreak was also making the theories more attractive, amid rapidly changing medical advice and vastly different approaches around the world.He added: “When big world-changing events happen we want them to have a meaning … we try to find an explanation for it and even intent. The idea that something like this could happen randomly is just not enough for many people.”The report was based on three polls conducted by Focaldata between February and April 2020, which used a weighted sample of between 2,000 and 3,000 adults each from across Britain.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

New applicants are required to\u0026nbspwait about\u0026nbspfive weeks\u0026nbspfor the funds to start being paid.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhile claimants can apply for an advance loan to help them through this period with no income, many choose not to do this because it places them in debt to the government and means money will be deducted off future payments – and instead need to appeal to food banks for support.How to support our campaignThe Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign has been highlighting how you can help the vulnerable who are struggling to get food by volunteering, giving cash or buying produce.Robin Burgess, who runs the Hope Centre in Northampton, told The independent that where previously the charity was seeing about 150-160 people per week, the figure now stood at around 420.“The numbers have tripled.\u0026nbspA good chunk of these are people who have been laid off because their work has collapsed, and a lot of them are awaiting their universal credit payments. They’re the new poor,” he said.Mr Burgess explained\u0026nbspthat while people have the option to apply for advance loans from the\u0026nbspDepartment for Work and Pensions (DWP), many refrain from doing so because they want to avoid getting into debt.\u0026nbsp“If you’re on a low income you don’t want a debt built into that,” he said.He warned that even when new claimants do eventually receive their universal credit payment, it may not be enough to meet their needs.“The fact is that universal credit doesn’t pay sufficiently to cope\u0026nbspwith\u0026nbsppeople’s needs financially. It’s never been enough. That’s why food banks exist.\u0026nbspWe’ve been saying this for years and nothing’s changed, and now the number of people on benefits has suddenly massively increased because of this,” he said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Food banks are now part of the welfare state. We’re being abandoned to do this as a sector.”Daphine Aikens, founder and chief executive of the Trussell Trust-affiliated Hammersmith and Fulham Foodbank, said that while the charity had previously provided food to around 250 people per week, now it was distributing more than 350\u0026nbspeach day – and that demand was continuing to rise.Food banks begin home deliveries amid struggle to keep doors openFood banks in crisis as coronvirus panic buying leaves families hungryFears of universal credit delays and mistakes as claims spikeShe said most of the new beneficiaries were people who had lost their jobs and didn’t benefit from any of the government schemes, with many waiting on universal credit payments.“It’s making it very real for people who didn’t know about universal credit and how long the waiting time is,” Ms Aikens\u0026nbspadded.Sabine Goodwin, coordinator for the Independent Food Aid Network, said food banks in the network were reporting as much as a 300 per cent increase in need\u0026nbspcompared with last year.She added: “Predominantly our members are supporting newly unemployed people waiting for universal credit, people who were already living in poverty before coronavirus, families affected by school closures and unable to access vouchers, and people with no recourse to public funds.“While the government seems to think that relying on charitable food aid providers is a workable option, the poverty behind food bank use is spiralling out of control.”It comes after analysis by Action for Children revealed more than 8.5 million children live in households with savings valued at less than the average monthly income before the crisis hit.Frank Field, former chair of the Work and Pensions Committee, cautioned\u0026nbsplast week that many of those who have claimed universal credit during the coronavirus pandemic were likely to face delays in their first payment.He said existing problems with the flagship benefit –\u0026nbspsuch as delays in payment\u0026nbspand cuts to support –\u0026nbspwould become acutely apparent during the pandemic as many\u0026nbspmore people are forced to apply.A DWP spokesperson said:\u0026nbsp“Universal credit is providing a vital safety net to those affected by the pandemic and we’ve taken action by injecting over £6.5bn to support people on the welfare system.“No one has to wait five weeks for their money as urgent advances are available – and more than half a million people have requested and received one since 16 March.“Advance repayments are made gradually over 12 months, and deductions are capped at 30 per cent\u0026nbspof claimants’ standard allowance. For claimants who find themselves in unexpected hardship, advance repayments can be deferred for up to three months in certain cases.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But a drop-off in older volunteers meant the food aid operation had to switch gears.“We adjusted so we can still make a difference to people going through a tough time,” said trustee Mansukh Morjaria. “We want to help as many as we possibly can. Our ethos is to feed people from all backgrounds –\u0026nbspand it means people of all backgrounds working together for the greater good.”How to support our campaignMr Morjaria, who picks up around 50 crates of produce from the food surplus charity twice a week, added: “We’re so grateful to The Felix Project – we depend up on them, and the supply of food has been a lifesaver for a lot of people.”The Harvest Church in Wembley is another of almost 300 charities, food banks and local projects across London that The Felix Project is currently supplying with fresh fruit, vegetables and non-perishable produce it rescues from restaurants, retailers and wholesalers.The evangelical church was forced to close its food bank because of an initial drop-off in older volunteers. The remaining team adapted by dropping off food packages at the homes of dozens of people in the local area, and putting together meals for around 100 people at a south London homeless shelter in need of regular food.“The deliveries have been really important to people,” said coordinator Hilda Darko. “We have been in touch with families struggling to get to supermarkets because they’re self-isolating or having serious money problems.”She added: “The extra need will be there for a while to come so we’ll trying to help everyone we can.

The group of Muslim volunteers feeds between 50 and 60 people at the “soup and smiles” project on a Wednesday evening – while carefully observing social distancing rules.“We decided to carry on doing the work because there are people still sleeping rough,” said project leader Adeel Mahmood. “Some others are still struggling to get food, even if they’re in hostels or put up in hotels temporarily. These are some of the most vulnerable in society, so it’s important to carry on meeting the need.”The Myriad Foundation has also responded to the crisis by getting food packages out to around 170 vulnerable people on a near-daily basis – including many in dire financial hardship because of job losses and struggles to access universal credit quickly.“We had an inidual contact us who hadn’t eaten for two days,” said Mr Mahmood. “Things can get desperate quite quickly. From an Islamic perspective, there’s a big emphasis on giving to the whole community. So anyone who gets in touch, we will try to help them.”Olivia Colman joins our Help The Hungry campaignThe Midland\u0026nbspLangar\u0026nbspSeva\u0026nbspSociety, a Birmingham-based Sikh charity, has been delivering food packages filled with £30 worth of groceries to hundreds of people each week\u0026nbspwho are self-isolating or struggling financially.It has also been delivering lunches to several hospitals across the Midlands three or four times a week, and offering hot meals to around 200 people in central Birmingham every evening, seven days a week.“The reaction from local restaurants and supermarkets and members of the public helping supply us with food has been amazing,” said coordinator\u0026nbspRandhir\u0026nbspSingh\u0026nbspHeer.“Our principle is to serve the whole community with compassion.

As far back as 2007 the World Health Organisation warned that infectious diseases were emerging at a rate that had not been seen before.The spread of the viruses is put down to a deadly combination of wildlife trafficking and consumption, increasing human encroachment into wildlife habitats as more people live in densely populated areas – and air travel, which enables pathogens to take hold globally.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThree years ago, an article\u0026nbsppublished by the US National Centre for Biotechnology Information stated, presciently: “The Aids and influenza pandemics have claimed and will continue to claim millions of lives. The recent Sars and Ebola epidemics have threatened populations across borders. The emergence of Mers may well be warning signals of a nascent pandemic threat.”Zoonotic diseases are complex, and it’s sometimes impossible to say a virus has disappeared, because it might have many different strains, and might mutate and lie dormant. This is a timeline of the main zoonotic diseases to have hit us since the start of the 20th century:How to help the elderly and vulnerable during the coronavirusHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusHow to be productive when working from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your handsThe 1918 flu pandemic: This was the most severe pandemic in modern times, killing at least 50 million people in two years. It is widely believed that the virus originated in birds because it shared genetic mutations with the bird flu virus later found in Asia, and could have transferred to horses in the trenches of the first world war before spreading to humans. This is disputed, with one study suggesting it came from mammals.Asian flu, 1957:\u0026nbspIn February 1957, a new influenza virus, known as H2N2 emerged in east Asia, which spread into a pandemic. It originated from an avian influenza virus, causing an estimated 1.1 million deaths worldwide.HIV: First identified in 1981, the disease is thought to have been acquired by people in central Africa hunting chimpanzees and coming into contact with their infected blood. However, studies show that HIV may have jumped from apes to humans as far back as the late 1800s, and it has existed in the West since at least the mid to late 1970s. HIV has killed about 35 million people to date, according to the World Health Organisation.Wildlife trade continues in Asia amid calls for restrictions China tries to shut down wildlife trade but markets remain openBlack-market trade ‘may undermine Vietnam ban on disease-rife markets’Stray dogs eating bat meat ‘could have sparked coronavirus pandemic’Sars:\u0026nbspSevere acute respiratory syndrome is another type of coronavirus, which killed at least 770 people globally in an epidemic in 2002-3. Most victims were in southern China, Vietnam and Singapore. Scientists are not certain of its origins but like Covid-19 it’s thought it could have come from bats and spread to other animals such as civet cats, which are commonly sold in squalid conditions in street markets. The epidemic resulted in more than 8,000 cases, in 26 countries. Of those, 774 died.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The H1N1 virus killed nearly tens of thousands of people in a global pandemic that spread to 214 countries in less than a year. However, overall the outbreak was not as serious as originally predicted, largely because many older people were already immune to it. And the NHS says it now circulates each year and is considered a normal seasonal flu strain, which is covered by the annual seasonal flu vaccine. A study in 2013 suggested between 123,000 and 200,000 people globally may have died as a result of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.Mers:\u0026nbspFirst identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome is also a coronavirus whose symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. With an estimated death rate of 35 per cent, the disease has killed 858 people, according to the WHO. Again, scientists think it spread to humans from bats, this time via camels.Exterminating bats blamed for Covid-19 ‘would increase disease risk’Ebola: A 2014–2016 outbreak in West Africa was the largest and most complex Ebola outbreak since the virus was first discovered in 1976, killing 11,300 people. Scientists say it began with a child in Guinea who came into contact with infected bats, but it has since been widely linked to the killing and butchering of bush meat, including monkeys, chimps, antelopes, fruit bats, porcupines and rats.Zika: First identified in Uganda in 1947 in monkeys, the mosquito-borne virus caused alarm in 2015, when it was thought to be the cause of thousands of cases of microcephaly – a shorter-than-normal head – in babies in Brazil. Outbreaks soon appeared throughout the Americas, Africa and other regions. It was thought to have killed 29 babies.Bird flu: Avian influenza, also called avian flu or bird flu, has many different strains but one of those, H7N9, has caused 1,568 cases in humans and 616 deaths worldwide since 2013, according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations.Another strain of the virus, H5N1, first identified in 1997, spread across east and southeast Asia, killing six people in Hong Kong and leading to vast swathes of chickens and turkeys – from Hong Kong to Britain – having to be culled early after contracting the disease. To date 861 cases of human H5N1 infection and 455 deaths have been reported.\u0026nbspThe highest number of infections and deaths were in Indonesia, Vietnam and Thailand. The H5N1 virus, which has a 60 per cent mortality rate among infected humans, according to WHO, has not gone away, but is thought to have mutated.Bird flu has been linked to rapid intensification of the poultry industry, with thousands of birds crowded together indoors and with compromised immune systems.The Independent is campaigning against the wildlife trade at the core of the Covid-19 pandemic.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

A new study finds that it may, although not enough to wipe out the pathogen or keep the pandemic from resurging in autumn.The study, done by ecological modellers at the University of Connecticut, understands the main natural weapon against the novel germ to be ultraviolet light — an invisible but energetic part of the sun’s electromagnetic spectrum that’s well-known for damaging DNA, killing viruses and turning healthy human skin cells into cancerous ones.“We found that ultraviolet light was most strongly associated with lower Covid-19 growth rates,” the scientists wrote in a publication that has not yet been peer-reviewed and that went online late Wednesday. Projections of the overall effects, they continued, suggest that the disease “will decrease temporarily during summer, rebound by autumn, and peak next winter”. But they cautioned that uncertainty about the study’s projected outcomes “remains high”.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIndeed, though the pandemic’s spread has varied widely among countries, it was spreading swiftly in some experiencing hot weather, including Australia and parts of Iran.The new ecological analysis suggests that balmy days might aid — though not by themselves accomplish — the goal of social-distancing measures advised by public health officials.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastOther groups have sought to see if seasonal change would affect the virus that has spawned a pandemic, infecting more than 2 million people worldwide. Early this month, a committee of the National Academy of Sciences looked exclusively at humidity and temperature and found that they would have a minimal impact on the virus. The panel’s assessment contradicted popular accounts.At the White House coronavirus task force briefing Thursday evening, President Donald Trump highlighted research at the Department of Homeland Security that found that sunlight and disinfectants — including bleach and alcohol — can kill the coronavirus on surfaces in as little as 30 seconds.“Supposing we hit the body with a tremendous — whether it’s ultraviolet or just very powerful light,” Trump said, speculating on a possible means to fight the virus.While such an idea is currently far from the realm of a safe treatment, life scientists have long been aware that the sun threatens the viability of many microorganisms.“Sunlight kills most pathogenic microbes quite rapidly,” John Postgate, a British microbiologist, wrote two decades ago in the popular book Microbes and Man, published by Cambridge University Press. The lethality, he continued, is principally the result of “the ultraviolet component of solar radiation. Ultraviolet lamps can be used indoors to sterilise the air in operating theatres and pharmaceutical and microbiological laboratories. Even in diffuse daylight there is an appreciable amount of light of the effective wavelength”.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailDuring the pandemic, because of the shortage of protective equipment, some medical centres have been using ultraviolet light to decontaminate masks so they could be reused. A small industry that sells ultraviolet lamps as a germicide has arisen, but experts warn of their potential dangers for humans.Many nonscientists — including Trump — have noted the seasonality of colds and flu and hoped the novel coronavirus would act likewise. Dr\u0026nbspRobert R\u0026nbspRedfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told National Public Radio last month that he, too, expected an ebb and flow of disease.“Most respiratory viruses have a seasonality to them,” he said. “It’s reasonable to hypothesise — we’ll have to wait and see — but I think many of us believe as we’re moving into the late spring, early summer season, you’re going to see the transmission decrease.”But he also pointed to the likelihood that the coronavirus would continue to be a problem in the fall, when it would coincide with the start of a new flu season.Comparative studies of viruses suggest that, as a class, coronaviruses are especially vulnerable to ultraviolet light because of their relatively large genetic codes.“The more target molecules,” one study noted, “the more likely the genome will be damaged.”Even so, other aspects of sunlight’s effects may also play important roles in whether viruses can easily infect humans — a main one being its promotion of the synthesis of vitamin D, a nutrient that can strengthen the immune system and lower the risk of certain illnesses.The Connecticut scientists, Cory Merow and Mark C. Urban,\u0026nbsptitled their paper “Seasonality and Uncertainty in Covid-19 Growth Rates”. It was posted on Wednesday on medRxiv, a preprint website for health scientists run by Yale University, the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island, and the company that publishes the British Medical Journal. The site notes that its preprints have not undergone peer review for accuracy and thus “should not be used to guide clinical practice.”Mr Merow said that although the lethal effects of ultraviolet light on viruses are well known, he and his colleague were surprised to find a seasonal drop evident on a global scale.Mr Merow said he and his colleague had mined existing studies on how environmental and ecological factors correlate with virus infection rates and used them in ecological modelling of the global repercussions. Global data on temperatures, humidity, the penetration through the atmosphere of sunlight’s ultraviolet rays, population ages and densities, and Covid-19 infection counts were combined into a computer model that mapped out the seasonal trends, he said.Spacecraft to examine the Sun sends back its first findingsMr Merow noted that the study’s range of uncertainty was considerable, such that, depending on the location within the United States, the chance of seeing no viral slowdown in the summer ranged from 20\u0026nbspto 40 per cent.“There’s a lot of uncertainty,” he said of the reported seasonality.Even if coronavirus cases decline in the summer as his model projects, Mr Merow said, social distancing and other health public measures would still be necessary.In some circumstances, Mr Merow noted, summer days would offer no protection at all. For instance, window glass blocks ultraviolet rays.“If everybody sits next to one another on the bus and coughs,” he said, “ultraviolet light is not going to protect you.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The government will continue to challenge these views and to help communities unite.”Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

It is a charity that has adapted with incredible speed to the crisis to help the most vulnerable in our community. In just five weeks, they have responded to the increased demand for food by quadrupling their output. We hope that our donation, coupled with the campaigning power of The Independent, will help the project grow and reach as many as possible of the one in five Londoners at risk of food poverty.”Another substantial contribution came in yesterday from the Julia and Hans Rausing Trust, which has assigned £16.5m\u0026nbspto charities at the forefront of the coronavirus pandemic and has donated £50,000 to our appeal.How to support our campaignJulia and Hans Rausing,\u0026nbspheirs of food packing giant Tetra Pak, said: “We have been impressed not only by the speed of The Felix Project’s response to the crisis, but the way in which they have managed to get a number of organisations working together to help people across the capital. Efforts like this support communities across London at this time of need, and we are glad to support their inspiring work.”We launched our appeal, in association with the Evening Standard, on Friday 27 March\u0026nbspand have reached £3m\u0026nbspthanks to the generous backing of dozens of London foundations, philanthropists and corporations, including Garfield Weston Foundation, Lansdowne Partners, the Westminster Foundation, Sir Peter Blake, Burberry, Eranda Rothschild Foundation, Citibank and investment holding company Temasek.More than 1,170 members of the public have contributed, donating £103,837 on our Virgin Money Giving page.But there is a sense that we are still in the foothills of the economic crisis, with experts warning the government that food poverty is about to get far worse. The Food Foundation has reported that eight million people in Britain face food insecurity and that three million have been missing meals since lockdown. The Institute for Social and Economic Research at University of Essex estimates that 6.5 million jobs could be lost in the coming months, causing a huge rise in demand for free food.As the biggest supplier of free food in London, The Felix Project has been operating 12 hours a day, six days a week, distributing surplus food to giant community hubs, including Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in Haringey, as well as to 80 charities and schools across the capital.The Independent\u0026nbspis encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry across the country – find out how you can help\u0026nbsphere.

But as the country fights its greatest health crisis in a century, it also has an estimated three million people going hungry during the lockdown. The coronavirus pandemic has shown why the National Health Service is of such immense importance. What if there could be a National Food Service too?There is in fact a project bearing that very name. The National Food Service is a network of initiatives committed to tackling food insecurity, social isolation and food waste. It is currently made up of 13 branches stretching from Glasgow to Falmouth and over the last few weeks it has begun to forge new links all over the country. It will not stop there. “We think there should be a National Food Service in every city of the country. That’s the aim,” says Selina Treuherz, one of the activists behind the service.That may sound incredibly ambitious but Treuherz argues that the foundations of what the NFS is attempting to create already exist. Thousands of local groups have led the fight against hunger in their communities for the best part of a decade or more. “What we’re saying is we don’t need the state to come in and build a National Food Service,” she explains. “It’s just about working together to make it stronger and to strengthen the communities in the areas that need it most.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesA fully realised NFS would not be government-run like its health equivalent. Each existing branch in the network is autonomous. They share values, resources and the same overarching goal – to ensure that nobody goes hungry – but they operate independently and in different ways to each other. This means there is “not a single point of weakness”, Treuherz says, such as an over-reliance on central funding. The NFS is only beholden to the people it helps feed. “We’re built by each community for the community.”But the pandemic presents new challenges. An organisation designed to bring people together through food is now having to focus on merely feeding them and support is needed. NFS branches are still operating, making around 3,000 meals since the lockdown began and delivering food parcels to communities in need, but they have found that they are often required to step in where the response from local government is falling short.“If I’m honest, I’ve been on the helpline quite a lot and the government response is pretty shocking,” says Treuherz. “We’re getting a lot of people ringing up saying they’ve had one parcel and been told that’s their lot, and they’re on their own in the house.” The parcels supplied by councils have often been low on food. Even when the boxes are full, they can be of little nutritional value.Food waste has also increased following the wave of stockpiling at the beginning of the crisis. The branch at which Treuherz volunteers in Sheffield used surplus stock from supermarkets to help feed those in need but they are currently struggling to meet demand.\u0026nbsp“We actually can’t get enough food to feed enough people,” she says. “It’s really sad. You run out of food at the end of the day and you just can’t help everyone.”How to help the elderly and vulnerable during the coronavirusHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusHow to be productive when working from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your handsTo help voluntary groups provide emergency food for those in need during the crisis, the NFS has petitioned the government with three demands: to offer more support for organisations tackling food insecurity to reduce barriers to immediate food access to protect community spaces and increase access to kitchen facilities. “It’s given about £3.25m to food waste groups which just is not nearly enough for a national effort,” explains Treuherz.But even in a pandemic, there are positives to be found. “Community groups are coming together, there’s this whole idea of mutual aid and food is playing an essential role in that,” she adds. “It’s really important that we build on this for the future and this doesn’t end at the end of Covid-19 because this is such an opportunity for change both within our food system and the rest of society,” she adds.Britain will look radically different after this crisis has passed. A national food service may need to be part of its landscape.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There are no mixed messages.

CNN then produced a report, citing US administration sources, that surgery had indeed taken place and Kim’s condition remained critical.According to some officials in South Korea and China\u0026nbsphowever, the rumours of Kim’s near death were much exaggerated. They had no information about a hospital stay, and,\u0026nbspclaimed that\u0026nbsphe was not in the mountains of Myohyang at all, but most likely at Wonsan, beside the sea. One official said that “nothing unusual” has been seen in the activities of the leader.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe last assertion can be questioned.\u0026nbspFor the first time as the head of state – the title of Chairman of State Affairs Commission – Kim had failed to take part in the annual flower laying ceremony on 15\u0026nbspApril to commemorate the birthday of his grandfather and the dynasty’s founder, Kim Il-sung, at the Kumsusan Palace, one of the most auspicious dates in the state’s official calendar.Kim Il-sung had died from a heart attack as had his son and heir Kim Jong-il. Heart conditions can be hereditary and Kim Jong-un is said to weigh around 136kg (300 lbs) at 5ft 7ins and is a chain smoker. No\u0026nbspSouth Korean or Chinese officials, it should be noted,\u0026nbsphave actually denied that he has had a heart attack. What they say is that they have no evidence\u0026nbspthat his life is in danger.Created with Sketch.North Korea\u0027s pervasive leaders: the Kim portraits Show all 16Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In the Democratic People\u0027s Republic of North Korea, portraits of former supreme leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il are required by law to be hung in the home, the classroom, the factory and all manner of other private and public placesIn the classroomIn the living roomIn the maternity ward of the hospitalOn board the ship At the ballot boxIn the officeOn the bridegroomOn the Pyongyang subwayIn the teacher training facilityIn Kim Il Sung square in PyongyangIn the homeAt the military paradeIn the hallAt the Chinese borderIn the Democratic People\u0027s Republic of North Korea, portraits of former supreme leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il are required by law to be hung in the home, the classroom, the factory and all manner of other private and public placesIn the classroomIn the living roomIn the maternity ward of the hospitalOn board the ship At the ballot boxIn the officeOn the bridegroomOn the Pyongyang subwayIn the teacher training facilityIn Kim Il Sung square in PyongyangIn the homeAt the military paradeIn the hallAt the Chinese borderThe last supposed public appearance of the leader was on 11\u0026nbspApril when he took part in a meeting of the extended politburo of the Central Committee of the Workers party of Korea, in Pyongyang.\u0026nbsp This would indicate that there was a sharp deterioration of health for the operation to have been carried out the following day.Kim has not appeared in public since and the scenario has echoes of 2008 when there were also reports of a serious health issue. He appeared unwell when he eventually surfaced, and evidence emerged later to indicate that he had suffered a stroke. In 2014\u0026nbspthe leader dropped out of sight for six weeks before emerging with a cane. South Korea’s intelligence agency said he had an operation to remove a cyst from his ankle.Pictures from the politburo meeting showed hundreds of members sitting in close proximity, leading to claims that Kim Jong-un had suffered not a heart attack, but\u0026nbspcoronavirus. North Korea has said it has\u0026nbsptested 700 people for the disease and put more than 500 in quarantine. But, it has insisted to the World Health Organisation (WHO) that it has\u0026nbspno cases of infection.What happened at the politburo has\u0026nbspadded to the political speculation around Kim’s supposed ill health. The leader used the meeting to carry out a reshuffle of the State Affairs Commission, replacing five of its 13 members. Among those to lose their posts were two influential figures, former foreign minister Ri Su Yong and diplomat Ri Yong Ho. The former army commander and new foreign minister, Ri Son Gwon, was brought into the committee.There is also a lot of\u0026nbspconjecture about the role of Kim Yo-jong, the leader’s sister. She would be the obvious stand-in if he were to be incapacitated for a period. Not only is she from the “Paektu blood line”\u0026nbspof the Kim dynasty she has emerged as the most important member of the regime after him.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This was an important comeback for her after her star had temporarily fallen due to Kim Jong-un being unsatisfied with what was gained\u0026nbspfrom the summits with Donald Trump. Yo-jong is said to have helped persuade him to pursue detente after the two leaders had spent months hurling insults at each other and accompanied him to the meetings in Singapore and Hanoi.Yo-jong has also been reconfirmed in her post of first vice-director of the Propaganda and Agitation Department. Last month she made well publicised incursions back into public life, praising Trump for sending Kim a letter pledging to maintain bilateral relations and offering any help needed with coronavirus. She also attacked South Korea as a “frightened dog barking” after Seoul complained about the North resuming missile testing.Last December Yo-jong issued her first military order, sent to the army’s all-female units. There have been a spate of photographs showing brother and sister inspecting institutions and factories together and riding white horses at Mount Paektu, the sacred birthplace of the nation.The US Treasury placed Yo-jong under sanctions\u0026nbspthree years ago “in response to the regime’s ongoing and serious human rights abuses and censorship activities”. Western intelligence agencies also claim that she is a senior member of a government department which overseas illicit activities to raise foreign reserves including counterfeiting, cybertheft, drugs and arms sales.However, if Kim Jong-un’s health problems do turn out to be true, then it is Kim Yo-jong who emerges, for the time being at least, the custodian of power in North Korea. But fathoming just when this takes place, and for how long, will remain difficult to ascertain in a state which goes to such lengths to shut itself off from the outside world.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Speculation began about Reports from South Korean outlets suggested Kim underwent heart surgery on April  and was seriously ill.It is suggested a procedure to insert a stent had gone wrong because the surgeon’s hands were shaking too much.Last month Kims sister made her first public statement, condemning South Korea as a “frightened dog barking” after Seoul protested about the North’s recent live-fire military exercise.She also publicly praised US President Donald Trump for sending Kim a letter in which he said he hoped to maintain good bilateral relations and offered help in dealing with the coronavirus pandemic.Youngshik Bong, a research fellow at Yonsei University’s Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul, told : “It is revealing that Kim Jong-un permitted her to write and announce a scathing statement about South Korea in such a personal tone.“He is clearly ready to allow his sister to become his alter ego.”Yo-jong has a high profile within the regime both at home and abroad.Internationally, she has had a high presence during the diplomatic process with both Washington and Seoul and is seen as the “propagandist-in-chief” at home, trying to shine Kim’s reputation as the current head of the dynasty that has ruled the country for three generations.Leonid Petrov, a North Korea specialist and senior lecturer at the International College of Management in Sydney said: “She has direct access to and strong influence on Kim Jong-un.“She is not associated with his purges or military brinkmanship, but knows all about them.“She is a trusted political figure who helps Kim maintain a positive public image when he is dealing with foreigners or South Koreans.”Yo-jong, was rarely seen in public until , when she was photographed attending a party conference.But was soon seen as a regular presence in her father Kim Jong-il’s entourage, and was seen mourning after his death in late .According to Bong though her closeness to her brother started in the late s when she attended primary school in Berne, Switzerland at the same time as Kim Jong-un.The pair are said to have lived in a private home, attended to by staff and watched over by bodyguards, according to North Korea Leadership Watch.“They were virtually in exile together, both knowing what the future had in store for them,” Bong said. “They must have gained a tremendous sense of having a common fate. As a result, she has her brother’s unconditional trust.”But little is still known about Yo-jong’s le, especially the period from when she graduated from Kim Il-sung University in Pyongyang with a computer science degree in  and when she started to play a role in the ruling party.She has been credited with arranging her brother’s succession as supreme leader of the country after Kim Jong-il suffered two strokes in  but was first mentioned by the country’s state media in March , when she accompanied her brother during elections for the Supreme People’s Assembly.Le-Eric Easley, associate professor of international studies at Ewha University in Seoul said: “The North Korean regime is a family business, and Kim Jong-un appears to place trust in his sister.“She has demonstrated skills at modernising the brand of the regime, and has some sway over state propaganda. Her most importantis probably as a confidante to her brother.“But she also has a signalling role because messages from Kim Yo-jong carry more weight than those of an imminently replaceable North Korean official.”Petrov said: “She plays a pivotal role in North Korean domestic and foreign policy campaigns because she is one of the main stakeholders in the regime’s survival.”But, according to Petrov, she is unlikely to adopt the mantle of leader should anything happen to her brother.He said: “Kim Yo-jong knows how to smooth Kim Jong-un’s initiatives and strengthen his soft power… but she won’t replace the primary decision-maker. North Korea is a Confucian country where seniority and masculinity are respected. She is Kim’s most trusted ally, but no more than that.”"},{"url":null,"title":"homes amazon boss jeff bezos","story":"In recent weeks, the Amazon boss – who is worth a staggering £billion– has been on a spending spree, adding a £million New York flat and the most expensive house in Los Angeles, at £million, to his empire.He also owns a sprawling ranch in Texas, a converted museum in Washington DC, and two mansions in Seattle.The -year-old, who started Amazon from his Seattle basement in , split with MacKenzie, his we of  years, last year, making her the third richest woman in the world.Since then, the American billionaire has seen the coronavirus line his pocket even more, with stocks in the company soaring to £billion .From the condos in New York to the home of a former Warner Bros mogul, we look inside the luxury houses of the richest man alive.In June , two months after announcing his orce, Bezos reportedly splashed out £million on three apartments, over three adjacent floors, in New York.Last weekend, he added a fourth floor to his apartment living space at a further £million.The four condos at Fth Avenue, close to Broadway, the theatre district, boast a combined floor space of , feet.Comprising the Penthouse flat and three floors below, the city dwelling boasts  bedrooms,  bathrooms, lined with Italian marble, and huge expanses of open plan living areas.The building comes with a cinema room, games room, fully equipped gym and a golf simulator as well as a -hour concierge service.The Fth Avenue apartments are not the only property Bezos owns in the Big Apple.In , he bought three condos in an art deco Manhattan building, overlooking Central Park, for £.million.In December , Amazon announced plans to open a new ,-employee office in New York City, less than a year after scrapping its plans to build its second headquarters in the city.In February this year, Bezos shelled out a massive £million on a palatial mansion in Los Angeles, belonging to movie mogul David Geffen.The deal, brokered on Geffen’s yacht The Rising Sun, was the biggest real estate in Calornia’s history, according to the Wall Street Journal.The property, spread over eight acres, has a ,-square-foot mansion, two guesthouses, a pool, includes a nine-hole golf course and a tennis court.It also features a European garden, a rock-lagoon-like pool spa and waterfalls.The mansion was built in  for Jack Warner, the founder of Warner Bros.

At its best, the monarchy shines light on dark places, telling stories that would otherwise go untold and standing up for what’s right.It has been said that the Royal Family’s first obligation is to give back to the British people who fund them. I agree wholeheartedly. It is gravely concerning that these former royals, over many years, have sought to insulate themselves from taking accountability for what they say or do — even when they know it to be distorted,  and completely tone-deaf.When power is enjoyed without responsibility, the trust we all place in these very privileged people is degraded.It is a really hypocritical way of doing business and, quite frankly, it bores every corner of society.I have watched the Duke and Duchess of Sussex ditch crown and country at a time of need, by private jet, to make millions in Hollywood — for no good reason other than the fact they simply cannot bear the fair and honest reporting a free Press brings.With that said, please note I will not be engaging with Harry and Meghan’s PR spin. There will be no corroboration and zero engagement.This policy is also being instated for their long-suffering communications team. My heart truly goes out to their lone UK staffer James Holt, although I have far less sympathy for the dodgy practices offered by Hollywood PR company Sunshine Sachs— a side of the industry relating to celebrities readers never see.This policy is not about avoiding criticising Harry and Meghan.I’ll always be honest. It’s not about shutting down public conversation or censoring accurate reporting.The media have every right to report on — and indeed, have an opinion on — the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, good or bad. But it can’t be based on their lies.I also want to be very clear: This is not in any way a blanket policy for all royals .I’m looking forward to working with other dukes and duchesses all over the country, engaging with members of the Royal Family senior and junior and young up-and-coming royalsto spotlight issues and causes that desperately need acknowledging.And I look forward to doing whatever I can to help further opportunities for more under-represented royals, who are needed now more than ever .What I won’t do is offer myself up to the constant spin, fact-twisting and putdowns of their family members I’ve had to put up with from Harry and Meghan’s long-suffering staff for the past two years.I’m that encouraged this new approach will be heard and respected.Sun readers deserve to know what’s REALLY going on.NETFLIX managed to achieve the impossible this week with sex-obsessed new reality show Too Hot To Handle.They found a cast of millennials more backstabbing, vain, stupid and horny than ITV have ever managed with Love Island, which looks totally tame in comparison.It’s the biggest mind-numbing abomination I’ve seen on television in a very long time.But can I be totally honest with you – I absolutely loved every minute. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-BBC--.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RB-DAN-WOOTTON-DOWN-R-KELLY-.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The new forecasts are cataclysmically worse than anything yet predicted.Despite the best efforts of Chancellor Rishi Sunak and his bailouts, the collapse in our growth and the scale of job losses are starting to look apocalyptic.Previous talk of a speedy recovery once the lockdown lts has been worryingly complacent.For many it will come too late.The damage will be permanent.One top economist says it “has pushed the economy into a recession of unprecedented speed and depth”.Another says business activity has collapsed “at a rate vastly exceeding the global financial crisis, confirming fears that GDP will slump to a degree thought unimaginable”.Remember where Britain was three months ago before Covid blindsided us.We were a powerhouse with minimal unemployment, jobs at historic highs, inflation low and pay rising healthily.We are now in deep trouble, like never before,we cannot get back to work.The Sun still backs the lockdown, while there remain so many deaths and the risk of a second, bigger wave of infections which could yet overwhelm the NHS.But it is vital the Government, despite its admirable determination to save lives, maintains focus on the immense harm being done to the country’s future.It needs an urgent strategy to mitigate that, alongside one to emerge from the lockdown as fast and safely as possible.Neither HS, at £billion, or our £billion foreign aid budget can surely now be sustainable.Tax cuts look crucial to fuel a spending and jobs revival.Meanwhile the public, admirably doing its bit by staying home, must also be alive to this economic meltdown.We must follow the social-distancing rules and wear masks where needed.But we should also be clamouring to get back to our jobs before they cease to exist.CAN you imagine what we’ll look like after six months without a decent haircut When the salons reopen there will be a stampede. Hairdressers will be instantly elevated to key worker status.We’ll bang pots and pans for them in the street every Thursday at pm.Before that we’re all going to have to learn to use scissors and clippers fast.If it goes wrong at least we’ll have masks to hide behind.IT’S not often we congratulate employment tribunals for their common sense.But one saw right through tech exec Rachel Power’s claim that she was sexually discriminated against by a boss who told her: “You got balls.”Everyone  knows it’s harmless slang for having guts.As for bringing a case over it . . . that really is a load of balls.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Will. Never. Happen.I adore the show and am glad it is on track toas usual later this year.But I know I would be very, very bad – and not in a funny Ed Ballsy way.I’d just be embarrassingly woeful. At the age of , I don’t want to be dragged around the dancefloor by the long-suffering Anton du Beck, showing off my knickers like Ann Widdecombe.I reckon the idea I might be involved in Strictly all started because of the ­glorious pro dancer Luba Mushtuk, who was paired with Olympic rower James Cracknell, last year and exited far too soon.We met each other at the Jason Vale health retreat, below, in February, where people go to recharge their batteries.It feels like a letime ago that we were all enjoying long walks, yoga and exercise classes, making new friends along the way.Luba very kindly gave us all a Strictly masterclass. I’ll never forget the hilarious lessons out in the sunshine – with a view of the lakes and hearing everyone’s laughter.Although I really enjoyed myself, it made me realise I could never, ever be a contestant on Strictly.My role is to watch the show from the comfort of my sofa with a large glass of wine and a jumbo bag of Revels.It is easy to criticise the ministers and health experts fighting Covid-.They must make le-or-death decisions with the information available and haven’t always got it right.But they are also human beings.This week England’s Deputy Chief Medical Officer, Dr Jenny Harries, told me she had been struck down by the virus, probably the day after Prime Minister Boris Johnson tested positive, and it left her feeling frail.With classic understatement, she called it an “unpleasant” experience.She was looked after by her children, one of whom is a junior doctor, and had to stay off work for ten days.This will have given her even greater insight into the disease and empathy with patients and their families.But it also makes us realise that behind the daily pm briefings are real people just trying to do their best.I’M still baffled by what to do when it comes to wearing a face mask.EvenI could get one, I don’t want to deprive a worker in the NHS, a care home or public transport, as these grafters are the priorities.We are told by some thatwe stay at home, and social-distance when we go out to the shops or for a bit of exercise, we don’t need to wear a mask.But that can feel problematicyou’re out shopping or on a bus or train.I will be making my own mask from the simple DIY instructions printed in The Sun earlier this week – it will be much better than nothing.But right now, there’s confusion and doubt, and it must be cleared up fast.NO ONE wants to put extra pressure on the NHS, and figures show we haven’t been going to AE or phoning ambulances unless we’re severely ill, which is laudable.But you can go too far.I would urge anyone who happens upon a lump or something suspicious to get help right away.Cancer specialists report a drastic fall in the number of people seeking help and fear a huge increase in cancer cases.So don’t think you are being a nuisance.A drastic, unexplained weight loss, a lump or change in a breast, or anything amiss with the testicles, must NEVER be ignored.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In Sweden, they say that everyone should rub up against one another when shopping, while in France they are ­ordering everyone to stay inside for another three weeks. Some boffins say that testing is the answer to Covid-. Some say it isn’t.Some say  is the age where you most need to worry. Some say it’s .Some say the virus will be wiped out by summer weather. Others say it won’t.And meanwhile, everyone is sitting at home thinking, “Can you lot make up your bloody minds.”But that’s the point of science. There should never be a ­consensus.Everything should constantly move as new discoveries are made. Emc until someone proves that it doesn’t.My colleague Rod Liddle explained last weekend that when the first atom bomb was about to be tested, none of the utterly brilliant men who’d designed it could agree on what would happen.Some said the explosion would be small. Some said it would be massive.One thought it might set the ­atmosphere on fire. One said it wouldn’t work at all.Today, we are told that all of science is agreed on global warming.We hear it IS happening and it IS our fault. No argument is allowed.History has taught us that this is ­dangerous.A hundred years ago, someone came up with a new idea called eugenics.The idea was that the human race was doomed because too many black and ­stupid people were having babies.We can see now that this is lazy, racist nonsense but back then it was a ­dferent story.Boffins at all the most prestigious ­institutions in America were captivated by it.They worked on it at Yale and ­Hard. Millions was spent on research.The greatest minds were taken in, Nobel Prize winners among them.HG Wells supported it and so did George Bernard Shaw and Alexander ­Graham Bell.Legislation was passed to promote it.Winston Churchill believed in it, as did US presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow ­Wilson.So just like global warming, we had an idea backed by leading politicians and many top celebrities.And anyone who said it was stupid was told to shut up.“We have science on our side” they screamed.Yeah, but they also had Hitler on their side.He believed so ­passionately in eugenics, he came up with the Aryan Nation, built concentration camps and murdered six ­million Jews.Be glad then that scientists can’t agree on what to do about Covid-.It shows they are ­thinking. When they say they all agree, it shows they’re not.EVERY European country has dferent ideas about which businesses can re-open next week and which ones cannot.But they’d all really like to give the green light to one thing: Hairdressers.I realise, of course, that everyone has now reverted to their original hair colour and that in Scotland it’s easy to spot the ginger roots of recession.But I just can’t see why this matters so much. And then I saw that picture of Pierce Brosnan . . .TO mark something called Earth Day , Prince Charles has said that in future we should put the “people and the planet” first.Hmmm. Not sure that’s going to work. Because what the planet wants and what people want are two very dferent things.What people want is to be warm and comfortable. We also want to be happy, which means we want a new sofa from DFS, a nice car, a couple of holidays every year and a fridge full of ice-cold beer.Charles would probably argue that the “people” he’s talking about are those who live in mud huts in Africa and Asia and bits of South America.Right. So what do they want  Well, I’m fairly sure thatyou asked them, they’d say they’d like a new sofa, a nice car, a holiday or two and a fridge full of ice-cool beer.That means we must build power stations and roads for them.We must dam their rivers and pull down their jungles to make way for sewerage and water pipes and factories and hospitals and shopping centres.I’m fairly confident then thatwe put people first, the planet is going to feel like we’ve trodden on its toe.I WAS out on my tractor this week, doing a safe and steady mph on a narrow country lane, when I noticed in one of the seven rear view mirrors that behind me, there was a small army of cyclists who couldn’t get past.Ooh, I was happy.I was so happy in fact, that when I got home, I drove right past the drive so that I could keep them all behind me a little bit longer.Payback.It’s so, so sweet.COUNCIL chiefs in Manchester say that the city has been so lovely and quiet these past few weeks that they are thinking of banning cars for ever.Really  You want to stop all those Cheshire boys coming into the city centre on a Friday night with their Ferraris and Bentleys Good luck with that.THIS week, we read about a builder who’d kept his we happy by turning his dumper truck into a luxury bath.He’d even used a drill attachment to create bubbles.Very clever but I knew a man in Doncaster back in the day who made his kids a swimming pool out of a skip.He tilted it so there was a deep end and even put a brazier underneath, so it was fully heated.WHETHER you’re doing a house-party or video conferencing with colleagues, it’s critically important you get the background correct.Tory MPs using Skype to do interviews on the evening news usually put themselves in front of a book case.This tells us they are wise and well read.Celebrities usually make sure there’s a bit of zebra skin in the shot and a pickled shark or two on the wall.This week, my friend Trinny Woodall hosted a live online make-up tutorial from her bathroom.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Doubtless she made sure the background was spick and span.

It is simply ludicrous to have a ­London test centre not working to capacity and tests potentially being delayed because they are being sent to Belfast.“This is symptomatic of the ­Government’s slow and chaotic response.“The public deserve answers, not least why testing in the UK is so low compared to some countries.“These revelations strengthen the case for an independent inquiry, once we are through this crisis, to officially review the Government’s actions.”Health Secretary Matt Hancock has admitted hitting his target of , tests a day by Thursday will be challenging.Soon after he set it, pictures appeared from around the country of near-empty test centres, including stadium sites in Twickenham, Coventry and Brighton.To add to the problems, until last week, key workers who wanted to be tested had to approach their employers.They then arranged the test through crisis planning bodies called local resilience forums — set up in  to help co-ordinate responses to emergencies such as pandemics, flooding and terrorism.The Government published a list of the forums but there is no ­mention of Covid- on many of the forums’ web pages.And last week, it emerged that consultants Deloitte — who played a key role in setting up the drive-through centres — were being criticised after test results of NHS staff were lost or sent to the wrong people.Frontline NHS staff showing symptoms were first tested at the end of last month, followed by other healthcare workers including GPs and paramedics.Those that tested negative were allowed toto work.Last week, the programme was widened to allow all key workers who suspect they or their families may have Covid- to be tested. Under the new system, employers and staff can apply online for a test directly.However, Downing Street has admitted that there is no way of checking whether those applying for a test are genuinely eligible.Yesterday, long queues built up at some drive-through sites after , people tried to book tests.Home-testing kits became unavailable yesterday, with , allocated within two minutes.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Dr Simon Eccles, the Chief Clinical Information Officer for Health and Care and the Deputy CEO of NHSX, tweeted: “Home kits all booked by :!“I know it’s frustrating but we’re developing more lab, supply and logistics capacity every day.“If we’d waited until we had the full k, to launch, no one would have had a test today.“More home kits again tomorrow, even more next week.”Figures from the Department of Health showed there were , daily tests carried out for coronavirus on , people.

Is raising taxes the wrong approach or the Governments only option One surprise of this crisis has been how easily Britons have accepted the lockdown . Some people seem to positively enjoy it.To some it brings back the spirit of the Blitz a feeling of solidarity. To others fewer cars and planes are an indication of the more green lestyle we ought to be living.Its good that people have managed to cope with these restrictions. But when polls indicate that many people would be prepared to put up with a y extension of the lockdown I begin to worry.An economic interruption of this kind carries massive costs and can only be borne for a limited period. Any extension will become extremely dficult for the economy to bear.The OBR, the Governments independent forecaster, floated the possibility of a fall in output of the economy of  per cent for the period April to June.That is beyond anything that has previously been imagined. It wasn’t a definite forecast butit happened the effects on jobs and living standards would be more than devastating.Some describe this economic crisis as the worst in modern times. It may be the worst ever. That doesn’t mean we cant recover. We can and we certainly will.But its important to be patient. Commentators talk about the economy bouncing back, a so called V shaped recovery.This seems unlikely The economy may bounce back but only up to a certain point not necessarily the same point as before. Some firms will have gone out of business, others will have run up debts, some have missed orders that aren’t repeated.How long all these problems last depends on the lockdown. The longer the lockdown, the deeper the downturn. So it is vitally urgent that the Government relax the lockdown as soon as the scientists feel that the peak of the epidemic has been flattened and that it is appropriate.This isn’t about choosing the economy or lives. A flattened economy costs lives too. Even when we relax the lockdown many will still be nervous and may not want to go out to spend money.The continuing need for social distancing will pose problems for hospitality and other businesses and hold back a full recovery. Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor has been bold, promising to do “whatever it takes” to steer the economy through these perilous waters.His scheme for furloughing jobs with the Government paying up to £ a month of peoples wages has helped to prevent firms getting rid of people that they could not afford But it is eye wateringly expensive with costs estimated at up to £billion.Clearly it cannot continue indefinitely. Ironically the generosity of the scheme may have anaesthetised the public to the scale of the crisis we are facing.Butthe Government lts some of the restrictions soon and the economy starts to recover , what should the Chancellor do in his Budget in November  Of course we don’t know exactly what the figures will look like and we must wait to see before final judgements.Almost certainly he will be confronting a massively reduced economy, groaning under skyscraping debt, higher unemployment and only a gradual recovery.Horric as the borrowing figures will be it would be a mistake to move quickly to reduce the debt before the recovery is firmly established.He should let borrowing take the strain in the short term. Any measures to rein in the deficit should be for later. In order to boost jobs he might cut National Insurance or make a temporary cut in VAT designed to bring forward spending.Keir Starmer gave a menacing hint of his approach when he said there would have to be “a day of reckoning” and hinted at tax increases on the better off as though they were to blame.That would be precisely the wrong approach. As the economy gets back to maybe  per cent of where it was before the Chancellor needs to do all he can to support business.He has recently given some generous help to new high tech start ups. Well and good, but it will be important to continue to support existing businesses.It should never be forgotten that firms that have failed in this crisis have not failed though any fault of their own. This down turn is not a normal recession caused by market forces, a rise in interest rates or overheating.No this recession and the bankruptcies have been caused by the Government’s measures rightly introduced to contain the virus. So the Government should not feel embarrassed about continuing some of their schemes to support inidual businesses and indeed they have a duty to do so.The Chancellor sets the framework but ultimately growth does not come from Governments, it comes from iniduals and firms. The way to growth and recovery is to give them the freedom and the incentives and the rest will follow.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.

No matter how little you can spare, please donate today here: www.thesun whocareswinsappeal.Raising taxes in the current climate is not something the Government is likely to want to do.But the scale of the economic crisis now gripping the UK means they may end up feeling they have little option.So far the Chancellor has done what he had to do to protect businesses and workers from enforced shutdowns. The cost will have to come from somewhere.It is estimated the furloughing scheme alone will cost at least £billion. At the same time, tax receipts have noseed as earnings have decreased and fewer people are spending in the shops.As a result, the Office for Budget Responsibility estimates that public- sector borrowing will increase by an eye-watering £billion above the earlier forecast.The black hole in the country’s finances left by Covid- means that at some point, the Chancellor is going to have to face the uncomfortable issue of whether taxes will go up.Any rises must be set against the need to ensure nothing chokes the ­economic recovery, which will be vital.We must also guard against hitting the most hard-up in society. And ­crucially, we need to ensure we don’t make it unprofitable for dynamic small companies to operate.One option for the Chancellor is to target the big multi-nationals and billionaires who use tax havens to avoid paying their fair share.Yet we will also need to have big business on our side as we try to recover, so it is a delicate balancing act.Our priority right now still has to be protecting the vulnerable and health workers from another Covid- outbreak.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.But it is time too for the Government to think seriously about how to restart the economy as quickly as possible.Two days ago came news that Jaguar and Aston Martin will restart production in May.

The inspirational Army veteran, who has raised almost £million for NHS charities, has also been sent at least , presents in anticipation of his th birthday this week. Speaking exclusively to the Sunday People, Tom’s eldest daughter Lucy Teixeira said: “At last count my dad has had around , cards and a thousand gts of everything from chocolate and flowers. “He is absolutely blown away and humbled by the support. “I’m going to be singing Happy Birthday to him on BBC Breakfast on Thursday, so I’m looking forward to doing that. And he will have cake – he loves cake.” Tom, who first aimed to raise only £, by completing  laps of his garden before his th birthday on Thursday, has also become the oldest person to top the UK singles charts. His version of You’ll Never Walk Alone, recorded with Michael Ball and the NHS Voices of Care Choir, has helped raise even more for the NHS Charities Together fund. And next month ITV are to screen a special documentary in which Tom recalls his wartime experiences in the brutal Burma campaign, known as the Forgotten War. Lucy, , of Reading, said: “It’s ­amazing. I mean what a journey in less than two weeks – incredible. “It was such a simple thing to do. We as a family thought £, was perfectly reasonable. “To watch it all unfold has been thrilling. We are incredibly proud.”  Earlier this week Pride Of Britain host Carol Vorderman presented Tom with a surprise Pride Of Britain award via video link-up on ITV’s Good Morning Britain. Royalty and stars also lined up to pay ­tribute to his efforts in a special montage video, including the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, ­actors Dame Julie Walters, and Michael Sheen and sporting heroes Anthony Joshua, Harry Kane and Joe Root. Actor Sir David Jason, , said: “In the s, you and your mates stepped up to help the country out and here you are again, you are a hero. And I salute you.” Lucy said: “My ­father has been inspiring all his le. I’ve watched him be determined, I’ve watched him carry things out. His Yorkshire grit and British determination is stamped through him, as many people now see.  “He said that a Yorkshireman’s word is his bond –he says he is going to do something, then he is going to do it. I would say that is his motto.” Lucy opened her ­family photo album as she chatted proudly about her dad, who walked her up the aisle when she ­married her husband, also Tom, in . She recalled: “My father walking me up the aisle  years ago was very special. He was very proud. In the car on the way to church, sitting with him, he turned the smile on.  “It felt quite emotional so I said, ‘Tell me a boring story.’ “So he told me an Army story and it calmed my nerves.” Tom was born and brought up in Keighley, West Yorks, and completed an ­apprenticeship as a civil ­engineer, before joining the Army as a -year-old at the start of the Second World War. Tom served in India and then fought in bloody battles against invading Japanese forces in Burma. He met we Pamela when he was  and working as a salesman.  Lucy said: “My dad has had a very busy le. When he was in his s he had a young ­family. As I grew up, it never occurred to me that he was older than most parents. He behaved like a young man. We were always busy, always doing lots of things. “When I was in junior school, he was head of the parent-teacher association. He cut oil barrels in half and made a huge barbecue and that year they raised the most money they ever raised for the PTA fund.” She went on: “If I ever needed something I’d phone my dad and he’d go into action like it was his mission. He was full of energy.  “He was very adventurous. We went camping a lot and would go on holidays to France and to Italy – we would always drive. “He loved driving – he was a ­really good driver and has taken part in motorcycle competitions for most of his le. “He was a salesman and he went all over the UK. He had company cars but he had to have one each year because he wore them out. “He also ran the reunion every year for his Army regiment for  years.” Two years ago Tom was treated in hospital for a broken hip after a fall. Lucy says the care he received has been the motivation for his staggering fund-raising.  She said: “Visiting him in ­hospital, I really thought it was his last day on this planet. That was so hard. “And look what he has done. Through grit and ­determination, he has slowly got himself into a position where he can walk.  “The help he got from the NHS at the time was his driving force behind him wanting to give back.” Tom, who lives with his other daughter Hannah near Bedford, shows no signs of slowing down as he approaches his th birthday this week.

He accused UK ministers of being nervous about being drawn into a similar conversation for fear of undermining the message to stay at home. Mr Drakeford said: The UK Governmentaposs position does seem to be that having announced a further three weeks of lockdown then the public wonapost be hearing from them again until very close to the end of that time period. Now I understand that they are nervous to be entering into this conversation publicly in case it dilutes the core message that we are still in lockdown, and they are nervous of moving into a dferent situation in case it undercuts that message. But in Wales, which is a much smaller place, we are always in conversations with one another, I have taken the view that it is more important to share our thinking with the Welsh public and for them to be part of that conversation.” Insisting Cardf had “worked closely with the rest of the UK throughout the pandemic”, he said: “Publishing the framework is part of our contribution to that work.” It came  hours after Scottish counterpart Nicola Sturgeon said lting restrictions north of the border would be phased.

The tests come following a breakthrough by scientists at the University of Oxford, who are working for the Government-backed Rapid Testing Consortium and believe the test is % effective, Mail Online reports. However, the World Health Organisation warned only yesterday that there is no evidence people who develop antibodies after recovering from Covid- are immune to a second infection, casting doubts over a lockdown exit strategy which relies on the tests. The pinprick tests are expected to cost £ and could be rolled out as soon as June. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here They work by taking a small sample of blood for analysis and can provide results in as soon as  minutes. Similarly to a pregnancy test,two lines appear, users will know they have antibodies which may be able to help to fight off the killer bug. If one line appears, it means a person either does not have antibodies produced in response to coronavirus or that the test has not worked. Speaking to Mail Online, a Government source said: This could be the game changer – a breakthrough moment to help us turn the tide on the virus. The lateral flow test has been designed by analysing the blood of patients who have been infected with Covid- but have displayed few or no symptoms. The Rapid Testing Consortium believes it could deliver up to  million tests a week by the summer, meaning a total of  million by next year. Its leader, Jonathan Allis, said: We are close to picking up % of all cases where people have antibodies. Now it is just a question of scaling up the manufacturing process. Health Minister Lord Bethell said: This is a great story of how our manufacturers are stepping up to the challenge of Covid, and I am hopeful that their product will make an impact in our battle against this terrible disease.  It is understood that key workers would be first in line to be eligible for the new tests. However, WHO has warned governments against issuing immunity passports or risk-free certicates to people who have survived Covid- as their accuracy cannot be guaranteed. The UN body says the practice could actually increase the risks of continued spread, as people who have recovered may ignore advice about taking standard precautions against the virus. A spokesman said: Some governments have suggested that the detection of antibodies to the SARS-CoV-, the virus that causes COVID-, could serve as the basis for an aposimmunity passportapos or aposrisk-free certicateapos that would enable iniduals to travel or toto work assuming that they are protected against re-infection. There is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from COVID- and have antibodies are protected from a second infection. The WHO said they are continuing to review the evidence on antibody responses to the coronavirus - adding that most studies show that people who have recovered from the infection have antibodies "},{"url":null,"title":"schools cant open until june","story":"NewsWhy schools cant open until June  - and they will have to look very dferentSchools were closed to help stop the spread of the disease but with parents having to care for children at home is putting a big strain on the economy.

And the question of when and how they can open is one that will not go away.When will schools reopen There has not yet been a decision - but most agree that it canapost be before the end of May.Most in the sector agree that what is best is for pupils to be in school - but only when it’s safe for them to do so.Some in the sector are concerned that even speculating about their reopening could be a bad thing.The National Education Union have warned that “loose talks costs lives”.General Secretary Dr Mary Bousted said that the speculation “deeply concerns our members, who would be at immediate riskGovernment was too hasty in relaxing lockdown measures.”The earliest realistic point at which schools in England could start re-opening would be  June, head teachersapos leader Geoff Barton has said.We cannot see any realistic way that schools could be re-opened to more pupils before the second half of the summer term, said the ASCL leader.But even the  June date is viewed as optimistic because, in order to meet that target,Mr Barton says planning would need to begin very soon.Will they be safe This is the overriding concern of everyone involved in the decision from government to unions to school leaders and parents.  Before schools were shut last month, many were running with a skeleton staff with teachers and others off sick.While many parents kept children at home believing it was the safety place for them to be. More than , people have now signed a petition set up by the National Education Union which asks the government not to reopen them before itaposs safe and to commit to testing and tracing to help that.The new general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women TeachersDr Patrick Roach, warned that staff concerns must be fully addressed before teachers would be willing to come back.In a letter to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson earlier this week, Dr Roach demanded personal protective equipmentfor all staff, anti-viral cleaning measures and guidelines on how social distancing would be enforced in schools. Will they look dferent when they     On Thursday Nicola Sturgeon talked about “rearranging classrooms” so that the m distancing could be observed.The First Minister said alternating weeks for pupils was the type of option her government is considering whenever lockdown is eased. She also raised the prospect of redesigning classrooms as a way of enforcing social distancing. She has consistently been more open with the public about measures to deal with coronavirus suggesting the Westminster government will be having similar discussions.Sturgeon said of schools: “I think some countries have perhaps had some children in school go back.“There has been some talk, and it is certainly an option that has to be considered, although we might not do it, some kids go one week, other kids go the next week, so that there’s the ability to have smaller classes. “These are the kind of options we are dealing with.” The Welsh First Minister has also stipulated that the m rule must be observed in schools currently and in the future.For many schools that may inevitably mean a new layout for classroom and for teachers to handle fewer pupils at a time.The details have not yet been decided but they are part of the discussion which will have to happen before schools .    They want to - or certainly their unions want them to have that option.The unions representing support staff have banded together to demand their members have the right equipment before theyto work.The GMB, Unison and Unite have issued a joint statement asking the government to engage with them ahead of anyto school. They say their members need proper equipment and that staff are currently very worried. At the moment PPE provision is patchy.One school told the Mirror they have equipment to be worn when dealing with an ill child but not for other situations.But with many children potentially posing as carriers rather than suffering from the virus there are concerns that staff could be more at risk than the children they care for.Andy Prendergast, Senior Organiser for the GMB, told the Mirror: “There’s a huge number of hurdles we need to get over before schools can be open across the board. There’s the problems with PPE which are problems everywhere and at the moment we can’t get enough into hospitals and care homes so the idea that there’s tonnes of it waiting for schools is quite simply not the case.  “The relatively small number of schools that are open are struggling to get PPE, but the idea that we can open all the schools in the country and have them work safely just doesn’t work.“One of the big issues that they’ve got is lack of hand sanitiser and some of the advice being given is that people can go and wash their hands. The obvious problem with that isyou’re in a class with a load of kids and you have to go and wash your hands. That involves you having to go somewhere, having to touch numerous doors, wash your hands, go all the way back and what do the kids do in the meantime “What we’re saying very clearly is we need to have adequate risk assessments and there needs to be adequate stocks of PPE to protect the members as we move forward on that.“While there are national shortages of PPE we can’t see that happening any time soon but obviously we want to get people back to usual but to do that we need to be satisfied that members - and also the kids and their families - are going to be protected.”“We’ve had at least one member who works in a school who has died of covid- and, while we can’t say for absolute certain how they got the virus, we are extremely concerned that that may have been spread through the school. At the moment the they’re not being forced back to work and the government lockdown continues for the next few weeks but the concern is what happens after that.Will teachers be tested  If they show symptoms anyone who works in a school will be eligible for a test as a key worker as part of the announcement by Health Secretary Matt Hancock of the extension of the governmentaposs testing programme. They need to sign up or be referred by their manager on gov.ukThe newly-unveiled system has suffered teething problems as the government struggled to cope with demand. Some , of the test at home kits were ordered within two minutes of an online portal opening for million key workers and their families. A further , testing slots at drive-through testing sites were taken on Friday - forcing the government to close the entire self-testing website for the day.But it is expected to be back up and running from am on Saturday.

Our dad also did all sorts of dferent sketches, so we were immersed in performing from a young age. We were able to attend a local dance school in Yorkshire and from there we worked on ious ITV dramas. Emily was in Annie on tour when she was six, and we worked on Chitty Chitty Bang Bang together. Mum would take us on the train to London, but in terms of stage schools, there wasn’t anything outside of London for us. Even when my sister and I played the Dolly sisters in Mr Selfridge as teenagers – our last acting job – we went back and forth all the time from Yorkshire to London. We both ended up going to uni, but decided to run a drama workshop for kids during the summer holidays while back home with mum. We put a call out for children aged -, sayingthey wanted the opportunity to work with people in the industry they could come along, and we got an overwhelming response.  It was a one-off workshop that covered all theatre skills and both us and the kids loved it. That got us thinking. There were stage schools that had opened up north, but we wanted to do something unique, inclusive and affordable. We decided to try and get our idea, Stagebox, started once we’d finished university. We literally put our own money into a small studio. It was important to us that we were self-starters. Our dad, who passed away last year, was a businessman, and he taught us to have a strong work ethic, so we were inspired to do it all ourselves. We wanted to run short, intensive courses and to create the industry experience that we knew kids got in London. Entry into Stagebox is by audition-only as opposed to paid-for enrolment. It’s what sets us apart. That’s really just to assess their love for it. We saw , children last year, and we have  places per ision, so it’s competitive.  This year we have some exciting celebrity guests, but at first we had local theatre show directors to help us out. We’re looking for potential. Some children have never done a class in their le, but they may have natural star quality. I can spot it by the way some kids act in the queue. It’s just a sparkle that lights up a room. The audition day mirrors our curriculum. If they’re offered a place, the four weeks is a mixture of musical theatre, television and film training, with some video shoots and audition preparation weeks. A lot of people associate child stars with pushy parents, but this isn’t the case. Both the parents and children need to be resilient, and as the industry can seem quite closed, we’re conscious to make it all feel friendly and relaxed. Our experience of being child actors obviously helps us. We definitely had nerves at auditions when we were growing up, but it’s the people in the room who put you at ease.  We always say to the kids to be their best, because their best is good enough for us. They will probably remember their first audition for the rest of their lives, so we have to make it positive. For many, it has been. We’re so proud of our success stories and love seeing our kids do well. When we met Matthew Illesley, now , he had come along from Gloucester with his siblings, who were actually the ones auditioning. But we saw him in the queue and said he had that natural star quality. Two years later he landed Rocket Man, where he played a young Elton John. One of our girls, Isobel Khan, gave us such a proud moment with her role as Annie in the West End. She came to Stagebox with no previous experience, very young, and she had an amazing voice, but again she took many years to achieve what she did. She ended up going to Toronto on tour with the show, and was the first mixed race Annie. To have ersity on stage is so important. At one point we had all three Annies in the West End, sharing the leading role at the same time.  One of our students, Millie Kiss, has a story that’s without doubt the saddest moment for Stagebox. She lost her mum in the Manchester bomb attacks. We all knew and loved Michelle, and I think she would be so proud of what Millie has achieved, and her resilience. She went to France, out of that tragedy, and she’s now shooting a feature film, and she’s away, independent and hard-working. That is what makes her a true star, she hasn’t let what happened define her. We’re so passionate about children from all backgrounds being able to access training and opportunities. We’re actually just about to launch a government-funded scheme to help with this. To add to that, we do a monthly membership plan, which meanspeople can’t afford it, we break down the costs. It depends on the location, but we have an extensive scheme of scholarships and bursaries. We fund them ourselves from our savings, so where children are on scholarships from low-income backgrounds, we also pay for their travel, their lunch and unorm and other things, to make sure everyone is treated the same.  The children are all professionally chaperoned to auditions, and sometimes the parents are allowed to go with them when they film. They’re looked after very well by the production teams. In the last five years, we’ve been doing such extensive casting processes that we were approached to cast children ourselves, which is where our second company, Keston  Keston, was formed.

You can unsubscribe at any time.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailMany of us have given our homes a spring clean in recent weeks, purged our sock ­drawers and spice racks – but the medicine cabinet ­rarely gets a look-in. Most of us only ever think about it when we’ve sliced open a finger or our head is ­pounding but it’s ­important to declutter medical supplies each year. An annual ­review of ­prescriptions, over-the-counter ­medicines and bits and pieces such as plasters will make sure you’re fully equipped – and could even save your le. Using an old product won’t necessarily land you in hospital, but it won’t work effectively, either. Where you keep your pills and potions matters, too. Here, Sultan “Sid” Dajani, community ­pharmacist and former treasurer of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, reveals what you need at home and how to store it safely. First aid Everyone needs a decent first aid kit, separate from the medicine cabinet. It should include plasters, bandages, antiseptic wipes to clean wounds and eye wash solution to remove dirt or grit. It needs sterile dressings for when you need to sort a wound at home or on the way to hospital, as well as medical tape to help hold it in place. A thermometer and tweezers for splinters are also a wise choice.  If you use anything, replace it as soon as possible to keep your kit well-stocked. It is also a good idea to have a separate, smaller, first-aid kit in your car for any emergencies as well. Always keep your medication in its packet. The box will feature the directions for use, exactly what is inside and the expiry dates. Sometimes, blister packs are too small for expiration dates, making the packets vital for safety. Medications that are not stored properly or safely will go out of date faster soyou are in any doubt, put it in a pile – somewhere safe, where children cannot get hold of it – to take to the pharmacy, where it can be safely binned. Location Where you keep your cabinet or box is crucial – and bathrooms are not the smartest choice. If it is too warm or humid, then you’ve got a problem. Kitchen cupboards, a utility room with a tumble dryer, on top of the fridge or in direct sunlight are also no-nos. Steam and hot water can get through plastic, even in a packet or box, and medication affected by humidity or heat can become useless. Either that or it can turn more potent and even toxic. It can also put the lives of your family at risk for instance, asthma or epilepsy medication that no longer works or slow-release medication that speeds up and gives you an overdose.  The best place to keep your medication is actually on top of a bedroom wardrobe or shelf in the lounge – preferably in a locked box, out of reach from children. Tell-tale signs your medicine has been affected include capsules sticking together orthey look dferent from each other because colours have run. Checktablets have gone sticky and slimy, or powdery. Also look for any liquids that have leaked. These items should be disposed of. Good to know: Out-of-date aspirin smells like vinegar. Basics If the rush for paracetamol and Calpol has taught us anything, it is to stock up on the basics. These include over-the-counter painkillers for adults and kids, plasters, antihistamine tablets and creams – great for allergies, hay fever, insect bites and nettle stings – medication for heartburn and anti-diarrhoea and rehydration salts.  You never plan to have food poisoning from a dodgy takeaway and you do not want to be caught short. But having too much of any medication is a waste of money as it will probably go off before you can use it all. It is wise to have ViraSoothe or anaesthetic creams as they work faster on stings and bites compared to antihistamine tablets. The cream is good for cuts before you dress them. Some people keep sleeping tablets on standby too, but they may leave you feeling drowsy the next day. Dragonfly CBD oil is non-drowsy and effective. Use-by dates Check every item’s expiry date once a year and remove anything that is out of date as it may not work. It is also important to dispose of any medication that is not in its original packet. While you may know what they are, others might not and take the wrong thing – or wrong dose – by mistake. DONaposT throw these products in the bin, wash them down the sink or flush them away as they can get in to the water supply.  Take them to a pharmacy in a sealed bag to dispose of responsibly. Or, while sticking to social-distancing rules, package old medicines into small bags and post them through the pharmacy’s letter box with a note attached on each that says it is old medication. Get Organised Keep your medicine cabinet well organised so you can easily see any important  over-the-counter or prescription drugs you will soon need more of.

The Hong Kong TV news channel HKSTVaposs vice director Qing Feng has claimed that according to a very solid source, the ruler is dead. Meanwhile Shukan Gendai, a Japanese magazine, says he is in a vegetative state after heart surgery which went wrong earlier this month. It was also claimed last night that China, the countryaposs closest ally, deployed medics to North Korea to advise on the -year-old ruler. But with North Korea being one of worldaposs most secretive states, the Supreme Leaderaposs condition remains shrouded in mystery and is as yet unveried. If he has died, it is likely that an official statement will be issued on Monday . The last time North Korean state media announced the death of their leader - that of Kim Jong-il, Kim Jong-unaposs father - it came more than  hours after the event. Kim Jong-ilaposs passing in , after he suffered a fatal heart attack, could provide some clues as to how North Korea would announce the death of another leader.  His death, on December , , was reported by North Korean state TV news on December . The presenter Ri Chun-hee announced that the ruler had died at .am after a heart attack, while travelling by train to an area outside Pyongyang, the countryaposs capital. North Korea watchers worldwide will be keen to seeshe presents tomorrow morningaposs bulletin dressed in black, which would be a telltale sign. Kim Jong-ilaposs funeral was held nine days after his death on December , followed by a period of mourning until the following day. This means Kim Jong-unaposs funeral could be held on May ,he had indeed past away. It was announced that Kim Jong-un would take over as The Great Successor during the same broadcast. This suggests we might not need to wait long to find out who will take over this time. It is reported that Kimaposs sister, Kim Yo Jang, is being lined up to take over as Supreme Leaderhe does die from the mystery illness. If so, she would continue the family’s unbroken grip on the country, started by Kim Il-sung in .

She was one of four neighbours from Cumbria who scooped a share of £k playing People’s Postcode Lottery. And the surprise windfall, delivered on the  March, came on the very day she was due to welcome her two new bundles of joy into the world. Thrilled Caroline said: This year, we’ve been very lucky, it’s amazing. It’s also quite weird how our prize arrived on our twins’ original due date. I think we’ll use the money first to go on holiday, maybe two, somewhere like the Canaries so not too far for the kids.  I’m so happy we started playing People’s Postcode Lottery a few years ago. It’s a mix of a feel-good factor knowing you’re helping charities by playing and that there’s a chance of winning yourself – it’s double awesome! Caroline’s partner, Paul, added: It doesn’t seem real, but it is. It does mean a lot of arguing about who gets to spend the money though! We’ve only been in this home for six months and the cellar needs dug out and the outbuilding is needing done up. This will help us a lot to get that going.” People’s Postcode Lottery ambassador, Judie McCourt, visited Caroline and Paul to give them their prize in person.

You can unsubscribe at any time.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailWe all felt a swelling of British pride this week, when some of our great national figures proved we’re in this together, by claiming millions of pounds off the rest of us. For example, Victoria Beckham claimed money to furlough her staff, boosting spirits by showing she’s proud of our Welfare State. Because her family’s £million of assets includes essentials such as an Estonian sauna and steam room. And it was in the founding document of the plans for social security, that “from this day, no family shall be so poor it cannot reasonably enjoy an Estonian steam room. If a family should fall on such hard times that it can only afford lesser-quality Norwegian steam in its steam room, this would bring shame upon us all as a society”. Richard Branson did even better, asking for five hundred million quid to bail out his airline. One of the great qualities of our most brilliant minds is to stand apart from the crowd. So it’s with typical drive and imagination, that while the rest of the country is stuck in the old-fashioned notion of “let’s applaud health workers and raise whatever we can for them”, Branson thinks outside the box with a dferent demand: “Give us  million quid, this lockdown has left me a bit short.” If he hadn’t lost the rail franchise, he could have stood in one of his own carriages begging for cash. He’d say: “Hello ladies and gentlemen, sorry to bother you. My name’s Richard, I lost my job as a balloonist and spaceman, and now I just need five hundred million quid to keep my aeroplanes. Anything you give will be greatly appreciated, even a small amount such as  million will help.”  Indeed, when he had his rail franchise, a peak-timefrom London to Manchester was a hundred million quid, sohe’d sold five tickets he’d have cracked it. Branson offered his Caribbean island as security for the bailout. This is more than can be said for jobless cleaners, who claim benefits without even offering a palm tree. So for Branson to claim state aid, is the sort of act that would have left our grandparents overjoyed during the early days of the Welfare State. “At last,” they’d have cried, “We have a safety net to protect us. In the old dayswe were down to our last three billion pounds and our airline went bust, we had to pawn our aeroplanes. It was heartbreaking, we put them in on Monday and didn’t see them again until Friday.

As the death toll among NHS staff and private care employees soared to  tonight, it brought home the appalling dangers these heroes face daily. And that is why today the Sunday Mirror is launching a campaign for a scheme to be launched to reward them now – the same way in which our brave troops are paid more for risking death in combat.We are calling for a special daily allowance to be paid immediately to nurses, doctors, support staff and care workers who are putting their lives on the line to get us through the coronavirus crisis.Our campaign will be taken up in Parliament on Monday in a Commons motion tabled by senior Labour MP Jon Trickett. He said: “Health workers are our first defence in the fight against this disease. They need better help now.” Mr Trickett, a former Shadow Cabinet minister, said: “Next week is May Day. “What better way to celebrate the new month and the internationally recognised workers’ day than by supporting this excellent initiative by the Sunday Mirror ” And Fire Brigades Union leader Matt Wrack added: “Clapping is great, but clapping is not enough.” Delivering the special supplement would be based on the extra tax-free daily operational allowance given to our Armed Forces in war zones. Acting Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey said: “I fully support the Sunday Mirror’s campaign to recognise the bravery of ­Britain’s health and care workers. “ The GMB union, which represents more than , workers in the NHS and care sector, also backed us. National Secretary Rehana Azam said: “If we are really serious about valuing these workers they absolutely need a service allowance now.”Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said: “Healthcare staff are giving everything in the fight against the virus. The public will expect them to be properly rewarded for their remarkable efforts.” The calls for more cash came as tributes were paid to two of the latest health heroes to give their lives.Married dad Larni Zuniga, , who was a senior nurse at a care home, died at St Thomas’ Hospital in London, where PM Boris Johnson was treated.Larni, of Godalming, Surrey, was hailed by his NHS theatre nurse cousin Christian as “a true professional who touched the lives of many”.His we Edith said he was now “enjoying Heaven” while daughter Mutya said: “I can’t stop crying. It’s too painful.” Meanwhile it emerged that the most recent victims had included a nurse who had kept bravely working at . Mahadaye Jagroop, who was known as Mary, died at Birmingham’s Heartlands Hospital, where she had cared “relentlessly” for corona patients. Former colleague Thalia Zong wrote in a tribute to her: “The memory of you and your beautul smile, which has always inspired me, will continue to do so through these tough times.”While it is now widely acknowledged that all frontline workers deserve a better deal pay reviews would take time to be introduced. This way those most at risk in caring for corona victims would get extra cash in their pockets now. There is precedent for finding money immediately. When banks faced collapse during the financial crash of October  they got an instant £billion in bailouts.And with , nursing jobs unfilled, frontline medical staff were already overstretched even before the corona crisis began. Our nurses on £. an hour get less than in other countries. In Germany, for example, they get £. an hour. Australia pays nurses £. an hour, Italy £., Norway £. and Sweden £. – almost twice what ours get. Hospital support staff are on pitully poor earnings with porters, healthcare assistants and cleaners getting around just £, a year. Living Wage Foundation director Katherine Chapman said: “Care work is a huge industry with around a million workers supporting some of the most vulnerable people in society, often for incredibly low pay. Now there is a real opportunity to create lasting change in the sector.” Many carers are paid what the Government calls its National Living Wage – the legal minimum for workers aged  and over – of £. an hour.

Keisha Chase, , was informed her “integrity” had been called into question after she raised fears about the makesht PPE with her family. She claimed bosses at Belsfield Care, in her hometown Blackpool, introduced re-usable J Cloths – which are normally used in household cleaning – to be worn as face masks. Keisha said: “I care about my health and I care about the health of the residents. “We are risking our lives and we should be wearing the right PPE.” Keisha claimed she became so worried about her health and safety her mother gave her a visor and mask to use at work, but bosses told her she was not allowed to wear them.She lost her job after her mum posted her concerns on Facebook.When nursing home staff became aware of the online comments, the teenager was carpeted by managers. Within hours she received a letter telling her she had been sacked for a “breach of confidentiality” and “gross misconduct”. And she was informed she would not be paid any notice or wages.  The letter stated: “Further to our discussion th April  to discuss the issue of Facebook messages being published by your family members, based on the information you had given them, and admitted to giving them, I am of the opinion this is a breach of confidentiality and against the terms of your employment with Belsfield Care. “I consider your actions of discussing matters relating to the care home where you work, outside of the care home, to be gross misconduct, resulting in the company losing faith in your integrity in your role of carer. “As you are within your six month probationary period I have decided to summarily dismiss you without notice of pay, from today’s date. “You have the right to appeal against your dismissal.” "},{"url":null,"title":"loyal dogs comfort each after","story":"NewsLoyal dogs comfort each other after tattoo artist owner dies trying to protect themPit bulls Tonka and Little P were found next to the body of devoted owner Kris Busching, , after a freak hiking accident in Colorado, US - the doggy brothers were also injured and are now being showered with loveShareCommentsByAmber Hicks:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video loyal-dogs-pictured-comforting-each-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news us-news loyal-dogs-comfort-each-after-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Tonka and Little P were hiking and exploring in Colorado, in the US, with their devoted dad Kris Busching when they all got lost and spent three days without food or drink. Kris spotted a creek with water in a canyon below, but during the descent lost his footing and plummeted to the bottom as he tried to pull his precious pit bulls to safety. Tragically the -year-old died upon impact, while Tonka suffered a broken leg and Little P sustained a broken jaw. The pooches refused to leave Krisapos body and were found a day later by search and rescue helicopters.  They were taken to Kris’ devastated family in Long Island, New York, where nonprofit animal shelter organisation Mr. Bones  Co. stepped in and rushed the pups to an emergency vet.It was here where the doggy brothers “who lost their world suddenly” were photographed comforting each other and sweetly touching noses as they deal with the pain of their injuries and their grief.  The animal charity shared the photo with the caption: The level of loyalty and love that radiated from these two as big brother Tonka was admitted to our emergency animal hospital so that his leg could be saved needs no further caption. His bond with Little P is forever. The dogs have undergone numerous treatments, been given lots of TLC and are now on the path to recovery. But the pair have a gaping hole in their lives as they come to terms with never seeing their adored owner again.  Kris, a talented tattoo artist, took them on amazing adventures and gave them an incredible le. His brother Dave paid tribute and said: “We are all devastated, and really can’t describe the void and pain that we all feel. “He was a talented human, with huge hopes and dreams. He lived an extreme lestyle, and like most in my family, loved the outdoors. He was where he loved to be when he passed.  Dave added: Nothing, no one prepares you for something like this.” The animal charity has vowed to find the pair a new home together so they are not separated as Krisapos family heartbreakingly cannot look after them. They are currently at two dferent foster homes as they recover. Tonka has undergone several surgeries to his legs with the care team going out of their way to make sure he feels the love during this very confusing time for him.  The animal shelter organisation added: He’s been able to hang out with the doctors and nurses behind the scenes and soak up a ton of TLC. He’s eating well and coping with his splints politely. His temperament is beautul and soulful, a testimony to level of love his dad gave him for almost ten years before he passed. To honor Tonka’s dad and his remarkable artistic talent, the in-house team of bandage artists made sure Tonka had some apostattoosapos of his own and it made our day, so we wanted to share these photos with all of you.  Tonka has since been discharged from the hospital. In an update on Little P, they said: His surgery to wire and splint his broken jaw was successful and he’s looking forward to leaving the hospital today with his foster mama! After an almost immediate attempt to play and get rowdy, our decision to not foster them together was further reinforced. Now that Little P also has a strict recovery period he needs to get through, it is imperative that both dogs continue to temporarily foster separately. This brief separation will be a blip on the radar when they are recovered and have found their new home together!  They continued: For Little P to have suffered such a severe break, whatever his head hit on the fall down the canyon hit with such force that he had little chance of surviving, and yet, he did. As long as this fighter keeps everything except kibble out of his mouth for six weeks he will heal and undergo one more outpatient surgery to remove the splint and wiring and our silly little ping pong ball will be back at play!A fundraising page has also been set up to help Krisapos family financially and has raised more than ,."},{"url":null,"title":"most popular baby names 2020","story":"NewsMost popular baby names of  so far - with a new clear winner for the boysParenting website Nameberry has shared the most popular names from  so far - and there are some lovely newcomers on the listShareCommentsByZoe ForseyLestyle Editor:,  APR Updated:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video most-popular-baby-names-over-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news weird-news most-popular-baby-names--\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

He was born in Ceres Hospital, around  miles northwest of the city of Santa Fe in central-eastern Argentina on Wednesday. The move has upset workers at the Ceres Hospital, who originally thought it was a joke. One worker told local paper El Litoral: “I’m saddened this has happened, especially at our hospital. “I think it’s a total lack of respect for the people who have died from this virus. “At first I thought it was a joke but when I saw it had been certied by the hospital I realised it was true. “It’s pretty off. Sadly this is going to be world news and the Ceres Hospital stamp is going to be on it.” But hospital director Silvana Torres said the name was the parents’ decision and not something she was questioning. The baby’s grandmother Alicia Jauregui said the name came out of a conversation between his parents saying their child was going to be famous because he arrived at a dficult time and that was going to make him a “strong little man.” The baby was born by C-section weighing just over lbs. Alicia told a local journalist: “I’m so happy, he’s my th grandchild. “It was beautul to see him for the first time.

The unproven claims were made by Professor Isaac Ben-Israel, who is the head of the security studies programme at Tel Aviv University. He said that all efforts to stop the spread will lead to the same result because the virus is “self-limiting”, and peaks at  days before rapidly declining. His calculations claim to show the pattern of daily new infections as a percentage of accumulated number of infections. They start at around  per cent, but decrease to  per cent after six weeks, and ultimately reached a level of less than five per cent a week later. In his own article he wrote: “Our analysis shows that this is a constant pattern across countries. Surprisingly, this pattern is common to countries that have taken a severe lockdown, including the paralysis of the economy, as well as to countries that implemented a far more lenient policy and have continued in ordinary le. However no countries have implemented exactly the same social distancing measures against the virus so it is dficult to compare them. There is also no country which can used as a baseline.For example, even though Sweden has imposed the fewest restrictions it has still implemented some measures against the virus. When The Times of Israel asked him how the virus would die without any intervention, he said: I have no explanation. There are all kinds of speculations. Maybe it’s related to climate, or the virus has a le-span of its own. In a television debate on Monday, Professor Gabi Barbash, a hospital director and the former Health Ministry director general, said that death tolls would have been far higherIsrael and other countries had not taken the steps against the virus.  The Daily aposs own analysis across  countries found the peak appeared to be closer to  days instead of . In response to the claims, Professor Babak Javid, a consultant in infectious diseases at Cambridge University Hospitals told the publication: To suggest that mitigation measures are irrelevant to the trajectory of the spread of the virus doesnapost take into account the fundamental concept of the dynamics of transmission of an infectious disease within infectious, susceptible and immune iniduals in a population.” He saidexponential growth is unchecked it will decline but that is only the casea majority of the population are infected. He added: “It is not truemitigation efforts have reduced the base number of people infected.”  Britain’s Chief Medical Officer Chris Witty said the only “exit” from lockdown will be a vaccine. He said: “In the long run, the exit from this is going to one be one of two things... One of which is a highly effective vaccine. And or highly effective drugs so that people stop dying of this disease eventhey catch it, or which can prevent this disease in vulnerable people.

The disaster is directly responsible for  people but many hundreds,not thousands, more became seriously ill and lost their lives in the aftermath. The explosion was caused by what should have been a routine test - but its impact was immediate and the aftermath has stretched over the following decades. The  disaster saw huge plumes of radiative smoke threaten to cover the whole of Europe and beyond. The impact of those coming into direct contact with the radiation was instant and horric. People living in Pripyat were initially kept in the dark about what had happened - but when they started falling ill with severe headaches, vomiting and uncontrollable fits of coughing, the authorities finally took action. A day after the explosion the first buses arrived to get people to safety. Lives are still being lost due to the devastating effects of that day on April , . Dozens of heroic men and women sacriced their own lives in a desperate bid to make the ruin reactor safe and put out the flames following the explosion. Tonne up tonne of sand was dumped on the structure and courageous staff worked around the clock to make the site as safe as possible. Coal miners were drafted in from across the Soviet Union to dig under the reactoraposs core to creat a huge pool of liquid nitrogen to cool the nuclear fuel within. Finally, when the fires were out of the radiative contained as well as it could be, a huge concrete structure was built over the site. It took  days to build the first sarcophagus, using , cubic metres of concrete and , tonnes of metal framework. Yaroslav Melnik, the leader of a group of firefighters brought in from the town of Ivano Frankivsk, remembered: “We worked in three shts, but only for five to seven minutes at a time because of the danger. “After finishing, weaposd throw our clothes in the garbage.” Later named the aposliquidatorsapos, thousands of these men and women are reported to have died during their work, or suffered long-term illnesses from acute radiation exposure. It had been hoped it would contain the deadly radiation leaking from the nuclear plant - but dangerous levels were still escaping every day. And this huge structure was only designed to be temporary -  years after the explosion, things had become critical once again. Now, after the best minds in the world came up with a solution a huge steel sarcophagus covers the ruined reactor, which itaposs hoped will keep it safe for decades to come. However, the surrounding area is still unihabitable, with those who had called Pripyat their home before the disaster now relocated. It was  hours after the disaster before the evacuation started and many of those who were livng in Pripyat have suffered devastating consequences. Whataposs left behind is an eerie and abandoned ghost town with chillig reminders of the ordinary, family le that one existed there the only things left behind. TVs stand unwatched, cots lie empty and kitchens and living rooms that were once filled with love and laughter are now silent and have been reclaimed by nature. Classrooms where pupils used to sit at the rows of desks are covered in cobweb and dust as sunlight streams in through the broken windows. Pripyat had been a busy and bustling town, built in the shadow of the Chernobyl nuclear power station. With work for thousands of people it was prosperous and fairgrounds, shopping malls, restaurants and bars all sprung up to provide those living there with entertainment. These now lie abandoned with trees, vines and creepers sprawling across rollercoasters. Apartment blocks are now scarred by the weather after remaining unlived in for the last  years. Photojournalist and tourist guide Anton Petrus has visited Pripyat several times in recent years. He said: Pripyat is the worst place Iaposve ever been. I first visited five years ago and the first thing I thought was aposthis place looks like our planet after humanity disappearsapos. Hospital are especially haunting in the town which was once home to , people.

His parents showered him with gts and toys while normal North Korean children had nothing, adult servants were forced to tend to his every need, and he was shipped off to an exclusive school in Switzerland to study. Very little changed when he became an adult and later succeeded his father in , and now there are unveried claims that the dictatoraposs reign has come to an end. Speculation over Kimaposs health has been re since he missed a celebration of the birthday of his late grandfather - North Koreaaposs founder Kim Il-sung - on April .Seoul-based website DailyNK, run mostly by North Korean defectors, then reported that Kim had undergone heart surgery, citing an unnamed source inside the country.Since then, reports about Kimaposs health have ied widely and each one is incredibly dficult to very given North Koreaaposs secrecy and isolation. There have been claims that Kim is dead, in a vegetative state or coma, is gravely ill, or is stable and recovering at a countryside villa. The Hong Kong TV network HKSTV has claimed he has died, according to a very solid source, while a Japanese magazine reports that he is in a vegetative state after undergoing heart surgery. It was also revealed yesterday that China, the countryaposs chief ally, deployed medics to North Korea to advise on the ruler.Three anonymous sources told Reuters that a team of doctors and officials left Beijing on Thursday, although the agency was unable to very what the mission signals in terms of Kimaposs health.North Korea is one of the world’s most secretive countries, and the health of its leaders is a matter of state security.  According to The Great Successor, a book chronicling Kimaposs le by Washington Post journalist Anna Field, his every move is calculated to ensure he stays in power. Under his rule, the country carried out its first successful hydrogen bomb test in , and has developed a new generation of cyber hackers. Field believes that Kim is very consciously trying to look like his grandfather, who is still revered in North Korea. Kimaposs ruthlessness has not seen members of his immediate family spared.  Half-brother Kim Jong-nam died after being attacked with a nerve agent at Kuala Lumpar International Airport in Malasia in . While his death is regarded officially as an assassination, it is thought of by many as a public execution. Although it has never been proved, Kim is believed to have ordered the killing, believing his half-brother was a threat. Four North Korean suspects left the airport shortly after the assassination and left Korea without being arrested.  And his uncle Jang Song Thaek - described in North Korean media as despicable human scum, worse than a dog - was reportedly fed to  hungry dogs in . As a child, the gardens of his home were filled with cages containing monkeys and bears for his entertainment. Huge playrooms boasted more toys than any European store and the gardens inside the walled compounds where he was raised were so large that many called theme parks. A personal chef was hired to be the future North Korean dictatoraposs friend - and the young Kim would don military gear to boss adults around. Contact with other children was scarce, Field writes, with his eighth birthday party attended by high-ranking adults instead of other children. Even when North Koreans were plunged into famine, Kim was probably unaware of the horric conditions they were enduring, she believes.In an interview with Vox, Field said: He was brought up to believe that he was a demigod from the age of three or four, probably as long as he can remember. The author said he was close to his mother, Ko Yong Hui, from who he got the belief that he was a military genius, as well as a love of basketball. Her influence was seen everywhere from the cartoons of her that suddenly started appearing on TV to the way her sons were promoted and moved up the ranks, Field says. In the s Kim was sent to live and study at the International School of Bern in Switzerland under a  identity. This was done in the hope that exposure to the West would turn him into a reformer - but the author said the opposite was true.

A Japanese weekly magazine, Shukan Gendai, now reports that the leader is in a vegetative state after a botched stent procedure. Kim, who is believed to be , has not been seen in public since April , when he led a Politburo meeting. Citing a Chinese medic who is understood to have been sent to Pyongyang to treat the ruler, the magazine suggests a delay to the procedure left him in a grave condition. But according to other reports, attributed to senior Communist party sources in Beijing, the team was dispatched after the failed heart surgery but arrived too late to save him. One version claims that a simple procedure to insert a stent went wrong because a North Korean doctoraposs hands were shaking. It is reported that Kim was taken to hospital in early April, after he fell down and clutched his chest while on a visit to the countryside.Speculation about his health has been fanned by his heavy smoking, apparent weight gain since taking power and family history of cardiovascular problems. Kim came to power after his father Kim Jong Il died in  from a heart attack. However, the reports y widely and are dficult to very because of North Koreaaposs secrecy and isolation, and the way in which it treats the health of its leaders as a matter of state security. It was revealed yesterday that China, the countryaposs chief ally, deployed medics to North Korea to advise on the ruler. Three anonymous sources told Reuters that a team of doctors and officials left Beijing on Thursday, although the agency was unable to very what the mission signals in terms of Kimaposs health. Seoul-based website DailyNK, run mostly by North Korean defectors, has also reported that Kim has undergone heart surgery, citing an unnamed source inside the country. Both South Korean and Chinese officials have challenged suggestions that the ruler is gravely ill.

John-Paul Drike, the director of Drakes Supermarkets in Adelaide, Australia, says he responded simply by giving the alleged hoarder the middle finger. In a stunning YouTube video, the supermarket boss has vented his anger at those who have taken advantage of the desperate rush for basic household supplies amid the coronavirus pandemic. He claimed that one unidentied customer had been audacious enough to purchase  -roll packets of loo roll and  units of one-litre sanitiser from his shop - and then later ask for a refund. Follow the latest coronavirus updates here “I had my first customer yesterday who said he wanted to get a refund on  packets of -pack toilet paper and  units of one-litre sanitiser, Mr Drake says in his video on April . Flipping his middle finger at the screen, he added: “I told him that.  Branding those who have been panic-buying supplies such as toilet paper absolutely ridiculous, he continued: That is the sort of person that is causing the problem in the whole country. Speaking to News, he said the man wanted to get rid of the items because he was no longer able to sell them on eBay after his site was shut down. He claimed that he had as many as  people working with him to buy up the highly-sought after commodities. Australiaaposs Home Affairs Minister, Peter Dutton, has said that the government will come down like a ton of bricks on supermarket hoarders who have been clearing shelves of basic supplies. Speaking last month, he said that that anyone caught profiteering from buying up essential groceries such as food and toilet paper will be prosecuted. In the UK, police officers have taken to standing guard at supermarkets to halt coronavirus panic-buying and enforce the Governmentaposs social distancing orders.

We felt very hard done by.“The boys who were kept on were feeling really fortunate because they were still getting paid.“I don’t knowit was the plan from the bosses to pick a team that could compete but we ended up with a really good team with some good youngsters left behind.“There was real quality and we said ‘let’s have a go’.”Despite being left with a threadbare squad, former club skipper Smith had some real talent to choose from that season with a good mix of youth and experience.The older heads included former Scotland internationals Rab Douglas and Neil McCann as well as experienced campaigners like Rhys Weston and Matt Lockwood while the younger ones included future Scotland star Leigh Grfiths, Dens hero Gary Harkins and defender Craig Forsyth among others.Called up from the youth team was also striker McIntosh, who hit a purple patch of goals at a critical point in the season – an equaliser against Stirling Albion followed by a double at Morton # before the Dark Blues went north to Dingwall.The match that clinched their unlikely survival turned out to be his final one of the season, however.McIntosh said: “When the match started I actually felt my hamstring go because of the demand of all the games before Ross County.“I think I actually tore the muscle and it was only about  minutes in. I knew the gaffer could tell something was wrong but, being young and naïve, I played through it.“It got worse and worse but it got to the point where I forgot all about it and then got the goal after half-time.“I was always motivated to chase down long balls and this time the goalkeeper took his time.“I nicked it from him and I don’t think I even considered anything about what to do next, it was natural. It was a great feeling despite the pain in my hamstring.“It was a really nice day up there I remember and the supporters were there in their numbers, it was an electric atmosphere.“I scored right in front of them and it was like an explosion.“There won’t be any other games with that kind of circumstance I don’t think, it was unique.“I remember the celebrations on the pitch – it was like we’d won the league. Everyone was ecstatic and it was just pure relief.“I don’t think I realised at the time how signicant it was. My focus was only on playing well and trying to make it as a first-team player.“It was a massive game looking back.“I still get Dundee fans coming up to me in the street to say they were there.”On the game itself, McIntosh’s then team-mate Irvine admits it was all a bit of a blur looking back.He added: “I remember Leighton’s goal, he was one of the really good young boys who did just as much as the older experienced lads.“It was the only goal of the game and, at the end, it felt like we had won the league. The feeling and the celebrations afterwards for what we achieved were amazing.“I’ve always said nothing comes close to that season. I’ve won three league titles and won Challenge Cups where you get a medal at the end for your hard work – there was no medal at the end of that one but I still class saving Dundee and keeping them in the league as my best achievement.”Irvine went on to spend six years at Dens Park as a player before ing as a coach where he took the U  side before the coronavirus shutdown.McIntosh, meanwhile, has had spells at Montrose, Peterhead, Icelandic side UMF Selfoss, Arbroath and Airdrie before signing for National League side Wrexham.Following the departure of manager Bryan Hughes, the now--year-old joined Lee Clark’s Blyth Spartans on loan until the pandemic hit.Despite his contract in Wales running down this summer, McIntosh is sanguine about his future.He added: “I took the opportunity to go down south and I’ve enjoyed it. It’s very competitive and the full-time setup was a big plus for me, too.“Everything is up in the air right now and I’ll have to wait and see what pre-season brings, whenever it starts.“I am out of contract this summer but I understand the furlough scheme will cover out-of-contract players for a time so I’m not overly concerned.“It is what it is, everyone is in the same boat.”🔵 In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to get out for their paper, we are pledging to help readers by providing a FREE digital edition of the Eveningfor three months.

I wasn’t there at the time but nobody really remembers the Roma European Cup semi-final too fondly but they’ll always recall Barcelona and Monchengladbach.“Getting into the final was a massive thing for the city and the club but at the time, as players, nothing was really a surprise for us.“We were expecting to get there so when we did it was great to do, don’t get me wrong, but it wasn’t as much of a surprise to us as it was outsiders.“At that time there was the European Cup, Cup Winners’ Cup and the other teams went into the Uefa Cup.“When you think about that in recent terms, Liverpool didn’t win the league last season but they won the Champions League.“That was the sort of level we were up against. It was a huge achievement.”Bowman recalls United going into the second leg riled up after witnessing some premature celebrations from the Monchengladbach players after a stalemate in Dundee.The -year-old also remembers a rare occasion where legendary boss Jim McLean inidually congratulated his players after the final whistle.Bowman, who made  appearances in tangerine, added: “Under wee Jim we were always taught, unless it was the second leg and you had to win at home, as long as you didn’t lose a goal it was OK.“That was the biggest thing, from our point of view, we didn’t get beat and we weren’t up against it.“I remember they were celebrating after the first leg and that probably gave us a bit of impetus to go on and beat them.“They were high-fiving each other because they got a - and thought the tie was over so that annoyed us a bit.“It made such a dference for us going there at - and Iain getting the goal just before half time.“They had to really come at us because they needed to score two.“Going into half time it was a massive advantage but I can’t really remember us being under that much pressure.“We knew they had to score two which was a tough ask against our defence. It was quite comfortable.“They didn’t have a lot of chances. Big Thommohad some great games and made some big saves that season but I can’t really remember him having to be brilliant.“Heggiesaid to me after it, ‘You should take this all in,’ and I was probably very naïve and just thought this happens every year, we’ll do it again next year.“I probably didn’t appreciate it as much as what I probably should have. It’s only when you look back.“It’s probably one of the only times I can recall Jim coming round and shaking everybody’s hand in the dressing-room after the game.“He really pushed us to our limits and got the best out of everybody. If he could see you had something he would get it out of you, how he did it was irrelevant.“He was very guarded towards us but he went round and congratulated everyone inidually.”United went on to lose the final - over two legs against IFK Gothenburg, with a - Scottish Cup Final defeat to St Mirren sandwiched in between.Bowman believes had they beaten the Buddies they might’ve gone on to secure the Uefa Cup, too.He continued: “It shows how much the SFA helped us at the time! We played the Scottish Cup Final on the Saturday and the second leg of the Uefa Cup Final on the Wednesday.“It was for the good of Scottish football we were trying to win it as well. I thinkwe’d beaten St Mirren, we would’ve had a lot better chance.“There’s no way of saying we’d have definitely beat Gothenburg because they were a decent team but the St Mirren loss was the first down we’d had that season.“Everything was on the up all the time, even with the amount of games we’d played that year.“It was the first time the press had questioned our fitness because we’d played that many games.“You’re never tired when you’re winning but as soon as you get beat that can quickly change.“Personally, all the finals don’t mean anythingyou don’t win. You want to have success by winning and savouring that.”🔵 In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to get out for their paper, we are pledging to help readers by providing a FREE digital edition of the Eveningfor three months.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg. After our meal the sky cleared and it became a beautul sunny day, and everything we had was up on deck drying off or airing. The owner of Rose came alongside and for a good time tried to get us to persuade him to go north against his better judgement, but when we heard he had the lady member of his crew of three sick in her bunk our advice was that he go south and that immediately and reluctantly he was forced to agree and half an hour later he sailed. Hervor also went out about the same time and she turned north and we were to meet her later in Iona."},{"url":null,"title":"worldwide ceilidh community sign up for tunes in the hoose","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCapercaillie founder Martin MacLeod, originally from Oban, and his son, also Martin, have came up with an innovative way to connect musicians from all over the world and allow them to play together for the enjoyment of others.#Tunes in the Hoose# was inspired by Scottish musician, and family friend of the MacLeods, Peter Wood, who was posting videos of himself playing tunes in his home during self-isolation.Having saw the footage Martin senior, called his filmmaker son to askhe had the technology and know-how to put a video together of him playing along to Peter’s video.#I run my own production company based out of Glasgow, so it’s relatively straight forward work for me ,# said Martin Junior.#From that first successful attempt, our new idea was to create an online community for all Scottish musicians to help them connect and continue to play together during these uncertain times.#Housed in Facebook, Tunes in the Hoose amassed over  followers last week with ,+ views worldwide.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

It was a big adjustment from that freedom I had, and having gone from earning quite a healthy wage working at sea, then going to seminary in a foreign country ndash it was quite a challenge.\"There was a period where I did have to really, seriously, pray about it and think about what I was being called to do.\"I think everybody goes through it, and I think its a good thing that everybody goes through because ultimately thats what seminary is about.,params: .push\"Seven years isnt a number plucked out of mid-air, its a period where youre doing a lot of study but youre also doing a lot of work to understand what it is youre being called to do, andits being called to priesthood because its not a light undertaking, its quite a serious undertaking ndash but a good one, and a positive one.\"And the problems facing Bobby and his fellow seminarians have only grown since the COVID- lockdown.He added: \"From about six weeks ago being in Rome and studying in the university with my class of about  other guys, Im now sitting in a dining room in a Catholic church house in Galashiels studying on my own.\"So things have changed quite a bit.

We felt there must be another way to help high risk groups.\"Equally, local businesses were worried about the virus affecting their trade. In order to help sustain all aspects of our community, wersquove tried to take a broad approach.One solution was the creation of the first Newstead Village Newsletter ndash a simple, four-page leaflet which included useful information and several helpline numbers. ldquoMelrose shops offering home deliveries were also included in the newsletter, says Lisa. ldquoWe put the information online but that excluded those without internet access.

The burst of le and colour with the longevenings resurrects my mood, enlivens my nature-loving soul. It makes our days feel longer while also giving us the extra energy to enjoy them.How can we not be uplted by the sight of a tree in full blossom bathed in sparkling sunshine, or a carpet of wild flowers especially after months of winter when the land sleeps, and the sun seems to have forgotten us But these are not normal times of course and the ability to roam in nature and soak in its wonder has been temporarily restricted. In fact for many of us our normal le routine has been totally suspended.While we are in lockdown, nature is enjoying the opposite itrsquos flourishing with new le and beauty. And while itrsquos frustrating that we cannot venture out in ways we might be used to, I have been able to listen more closely to the stories that nature is telling on my doorstep.Over the last few years I have deliberately lsquore-wildedrsquo my small garden which I am so lucky to have. By that I mean I have allowed nature to do its thing, and nature has accepted the invitation. Elder, rowan, silver birch and cherry trees now enclose my wee patch of the world. Wild flowers such as dandelion and forget-me-nots have sprung up and last year I had foxglove, so Irsquom waiting to see what this summer will bring.A strange effect of all this has been the enlarging of my garden. Not literally, but in the power of its presence. Irsquove noticed how a space full of nature feels bigger than one thatrsquos bare, lsquoneatrsquo and manicured.I like to call it the forest horizon effect. Compare standing in the middle of a wide open treeless park with standing in the middle of a wood surrounded by trees and humming le. The area of the wood may be much smaller than the park, but its impact on our senses is much greater. We are embraced by nature, not just physically but also,we feel the connection, emotionally and spiritually. The space actually feels larger than it is because there is more in it.I am missing this embrace so much right now because of the inability to visit my favourite woods. But the lockdown has compelled me to spend more time in the natural world on my back doorstep.And within the embrace of my gardenrsquos re-wilded forest horizon, although only a space of around  metres by , I have discovered the truth contained in the wonderful book by Scott Sampson How to Raise a Wild Child.In his book, Scott states: ldquoWhen I began on this book, I had a certain sense of self-satisfaction, convinced that a letime of outdoor play, hiking and campinghellip had forged within me a deep bond with naturehellip Instead, I found that, like most of us, I was oblivious to most of the natural goings-on around me.He explains how he then spent time with his daughter absorbing the sounds and sights of nature on his doorstep, which fostered their lsquointernal wildnessrsquo more than any trip to a remote wilderness. They listened to birdsong and sat quietly as small creatures played out their lersquos dramas under the shadow of their house. ldquoWildness just outside the front door, Scott writes, ldquowas helping us deepen our bond with nature. Such interactions, I have come to realise, are essential to nature connection.Reading this has given new meaning to the confinement imposed by the lockdown. Never before have I had such time to simply sit and absorb the tiny goings on in the garden, embraced by my own mini forest horizon.A garden is a privilege, of course, and I understand many donrsquot have one. But wildness can also be found on our walk to the shops, on verges and public green spaces, with trees, bushes and wild flowers that grow in our urban spaces. The trick is to pause and absorb the wonder of it, listen and look for the wee miracles that we usually donrsquot notice and walk by. Itrsquos easier now, even on a normally busy street, with so much reduced traffic noise and absence of bustle.On my exercise walk yesterday I did just this and was overwhelmed by the beauty of renewed le. It occurred to me that this precious one-walk-a-day has intensied the connection it gives me to local nature.And never have I enjoyed the privilege of having a re-wilded garden so much. On Easter Monday I sat in it with my five-year-old son. His attention span can be short but I explained what we were doing and he stayed with me for  minutes. The first thing I noticed was the absence of normal background noise, which heightened the volume of naturersquos spring melody.Our garden attracts many birds which sit on the branches and sing their hearts out. I know they donrsquot sing for us, but my young son thought they were doing just that. In just  minutes we heard or saw coal tits, wrens, wood pigeons, willow warblers, magpies and a robin. Irsquod never have previously known what some of these birds were, but now we are in a mindset to get to know who is inhabiting our lsquodoorstep wildnessrsquo.We also watched a peacock butterfly explore our garden as it fluttered and paused in equal measure. The sound of bumblebees arrived and we saw them hover over the dandelions. Then a small honey bee made an entrance, likewise visiting the dandelions. As we sat quietly, the sound of honking above us raised our heads and we saw two V formations of geese heading north.When my boy got restless, I suggested we crawl like explorers in the grass to see what we could find. We spotted an incredible sight: young garden spiders emerging from their egg sack which was half hidden under a curve in a plant pot. My sonrsquos fascination at this was matched by my own! It was early for this to happen, and we found many other egg sacks where still unhatched.Within these  minutes there was so much le and wonder so many stories to discover. Where did the small birds come from, where were the geese going, why do bees suddenly appear and what did they do during the winter  Why are dandelions so popular with the bees, what is so special about them  Why do the birds sing dferently, are they speaking to each otherso, what are they saying How did the peacock butterfly get its name and where did it hibernate, was it in our garden shed  What was it looking for  Were the hatching spiders emerging early because their mother deliberately chose a warm corner in the garden to lay her eggs  Why do some spiders live in the garden, while others like hiding under your bed  Do you know how to spot the dference, and do they spin their webs dferently These were just some of the stories my son and I wondered about after our  minutes together in our garden wilderness. But such drama happens all around us. Little patches of mini wilderness are everywhere,we hone our senses to notice and appreciate them.I realise now the lockdown, although stressful, has created the conditions for the discovery of so many new things, with so many new nature stories to learn tales of survival and adventure, of lersquos drama happening on our doorstep and in our street.And the biggest story of all is that everything around us is ultimately related. We are part of naturersquos story because we are part of nature. We share a common ancestor with every creature and plant yes, even with the trees.So while I, like us all, yearn for the end of the lockdown for many reasons, I am also going to try to make the best of it by being more aware of naturersquos wonders that are literally outside my window, while I stay at home to help keep others safe."},{"url":null,"title":"uk-economy-braces-biggest-recession-300-years-due-lockdown---likely-recover","story":"While adjusting to le in isolation has been dficult, businesses have been hit particularly hard by the restrictions, with the budget watchdog now warning the country could suffer its biggest recession in  yearslockdown continues into the summer.The Office for Budget Responsibility has said the economy could shrink by  per cent this spring, with unemployment levels reaching . million over the coming months - its highest level since the s.The struggling economy has sparked comparisons to the financial crash in , and the Great Depression of the s, but experts are now predicting the outcome will be much worse.Experts now believe the UK is headed for its biggest economic slump since , when the country was hit by a deep freeze that spread across Europe.Temperatures plummeted on January , bringing with it the worst winter in  years and freezing over several countries, including France, England and Russia.The lsquoGreat Frostrsquo, as it came to be known, lasted for three months and sparked food shortages, thousands of deaths in France, and a huge deficit to the economy.The coronavirus pandemic could see the economy shrink by a record  per cent by June, the Office for Budget Responsibilityhas warned.A drop this big would mark the largest decline ldquoin living memory, Robert Chote, chairman of the OBR has said.However, Chancellor Rishi Sunak stressed that this forecast is just one possible scenario, and it merely suggests the scale of what the country is currently facing will have ldquoserious implications for our economy.He said: ldquoWe came into this crisis with a fundamentally sound economy, powered by the hard work and ingenuity of the British people and British businesses.ldquoOur planned economic response is protecting millions of jobs, businesses, self-employed people, charities and households.ldquoOur plan is the right plan.Mr Sunak assured that the government would not stand by and will act to support the economy, adding that the OBR expects the economic impact of the pandemic to be temporary.Despite being forecast for a signicant decline, the UK is expected toto its pre-coronavirus economic growth by the end of this year, with the OBR stating this amount will depend on how long the lockdown lasts.The OBR predicts that any drop in growth will be reversed in the three months to September, as the economy starts to recover.However, it warned that the pandemic may have a more lasting impact on unemployment, which is estimated to rise to . million by the end of June.Unemployment levels are currently . million, marking a rise from . per cent to  per cent.Unemployment rates are expected to remain high until , before dropping back to four per cent, according to the OBRrsquos forecast."},{"url":null,"title":"11-year-olds-thank-letter-delights-ambulance-staff","story":"Sarah Brady, , a primary seven pupil at Wallyford Primary School, was taking part in the first lsquoClap for our Carersrsquo event on March  with mum Samantha.She noticed the ambulance sitting at the end of her street so quickly drafted a letter and ran over with a rose and gave it to them.The letter read: ldquoThanks for everything yoursquore doing for the world, love Sarah Brady.Samantha said: ldquoThe clap was amazing.ldquoA few days later the ambulance had to come back to my house for my partner.ldquoThe ambulance lady said that two men were in Wallyford recently and someone gave them a letter and that they were really overwhelmed.

Taking the best from history and finding a way to interpret it thatrsquos interesting or unexpected.All their spirits are made by hand in small batches of less than  bottles, with a direct-fired copper pot still, and aged on-site.Since launching in , they have released three distinctive gins starting with their London Dry. Believing that classics shouldnrsquot be messed with, they have stayed true to style by creating a punchy juniper-led spirit, easing into warming spices on the palate and a bone-dry finish.This was followed by their New Tom - a modern take on the ldquoOld Tom style favoured by Illicit distillers prior to London Dry. New Tom is sweeter in character: distilled with pink peppercorns, rosehips, and tonka beans, and sweetened post-distillation with bee pollen and honey.Finally, in late , Blacklist gin was released. Setting out to create a gin with the rich smouldering character of some of their favourite whiskies - bringing together Scotlands two great spirits - they smoked juniper berries over Scottish peat to impart a deep smoky flavour to the spirit.Complimented by the addition of black cardamom, lapsang souchong tea, black peppercorns, and finally infused with activated charcoal to anchor and enhance the flavour, the result is an unconventional gin - jet black in colour - and with a heady undercurrent of smouldering peat and warming spices.All three products are currently available to via their websitewith free UK delivery during the lockdown period.See illicitspirits shop------------------------------------------------------NUDIE SNACKSNudie Snacks are a local based healthy Snacking Company headquartered in Ayrshire.

In the case of CGI members, it provides the opportunity for parents to teach their children about the industries that CGI operate in.The programme has been born from the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathscamps that CGI has been running for the past year in UK schools and communities to encourage students to think about a STEM career. These have been so well received that when the coronavirus lockdown was announced, Kittow had a packed diary of events which had to be postponed.It was then decided to try and recreate the camps online and, incredibly, the technological experts at CGI managed to have STEM from Home up and running within two days.It was trialled internally but went down so well that, after just the first week, staff asked to share it with family, friends and clients.As the demand was there, CGI decided to make it accessible online for anyone to use, with new content released every Wednesday to keep youngsters engaged.ldquoThe STEM camps are the flagship programme of the CGI corporate social responsibility programme and we thought it was important to continue to inspire the next generation, said Kittow.ldquoThe key aspect of the online programme is that the activities can all be completed from home, everyone can get involved and parents donrsquot have to go out and buy resources. It aims to spark interest in the topics for children, allowing them to realise the effects on their own lives and maybe consider careers in the respective industries.Topics covered so far include robotics, coding, helping the environment, sport and healthy living, with engineering, space and more still to come.The programme will remain on the CGI website post lockdown, allowing parents to continue to help build the next generation of STEM talent from home.CGIrsquos Philippa Green said the online programme was reaching a wider and more ied audience than the companyrsquos STEM camps.ldquoWith the camps we are trying to target iniduals that are under-represented in the industry like females and people from disadvantaged areas but this is reaching further and anyone can be involved, she said.ldquoAlthough it is aimed at six to -year-olds, all students can take activities as far as they like. Wersquove had competition entries from four-year-olds up to -year-olds so we are engaging most age groups.Green added: ldquoThe camps came to a prompt halt because of Covid- but we did not want to disappoint people and wanted to continue the momentum we had started so it made sense to take it online. We also wanted to support our members with children who are working at home and give them something dferent to do.She said they had been ldquopleasantly surprised at the reaction to the programme which has now been picked up by CGIrsquos offices in Australia, India, Canada and Belgium.ldquoPeople just wondered what on earth they were going to do with their children and this is a simple way to keep them occupied, said Green.TASK THREE: ENVIRONMENTTIME:Each activity should take approx one hourResources required:PC with internetPens and paperRecycled items for craft and physical activities. All items can be found in the home.THE third pack in the series focuses on the environment, looking at the key issues facing the planet and ways in which people can help to secure a sustainable future for the next generations.It points out that some of the most signicant environmental issues today include pollution, climate change and natural resources running low.The first activity is to design an Eco School for the future. Children are asked to consider their own schools and whether they would keep any of the existing facilities or whether it should be a completely new creation, bearing in mind it has to benefit the environment as much as possible.The bonus activity is to create an environment magazine. In this project, the students learn how to use HTML and CSS to create a multi-page magazine website with a two page layout, revisiting HTML and CSS techniques from the previous weekrsquos activities in the process.The magazine should give the general public tips and advice on how they can help to save the environment and the children are asked to include at least five top tips and graphics where possible.The physical activity involves incorporating a nature hunt into the childrenrsquos daily exercise routine, searching for nominated items such as trees and birds as they keep active whilst exploring their local environment.The activity can be completed in the garden or on a short walk under the Governmentrsquos lockdown guidelines.There is a checklist provided so that items can be marked off as they are spotted.----------------------------------------------------------TASK FOUR: HEALTH AND FITNESSTIME:Each activity should take approx one hourResources required:PC with internetPens and paperRecycled items for craft and physical activities. All items can be found in the home.THE fourth pack in the series focuses on sport and healthy living and aims to encourage everyone to enjoy sport and live a healthy lestyle, especially during these challenging times.Children are asked to code their own sports games, create a healthy living poster for children and develop their own home exercise routine.The first activity involves creating a skiing game in which the player has to avoid randomly appearing obstacles to scorepoints.In this activity, the children learn how to control sprites using a keyboard, how to draw a background and how to animate a sprite.They are also asked to create a healthy living poster for children, giving information on how to live a healthy lestyle. It can be drawn by hand or produced digitally.The physical activity focuses on exercise, with children challenged to create an exercise routine for them and their families that can be completed either indoors or in the garden.They are asked to include a iety of exercises that will increase the heart rate and include as many dferent body parts as possible, with stretches before and afterwards to avoid any injuries.Bonus activities in the pack include learning how to use App Inventor to make a quiz app, making a game in which players have to save the earth from space monsters, creating an animated sunrise, creating a webpage to tell a story, joke or poem and making a paint programme."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11298928.jpg?type=article-full","title":"mandatory-climate-change-classes-plan-scottish-leaders","story":"The studies would help arm them with facts and knowledge to make urgent changes to society as it emerges from COVID- lockdown. The Scottish Government has already committed to enrolling at least  senior officials to the Climate Solutions course.The news comes just days before Tuesdayrsquos one-year anniversary of Scotlandrsquos First Minister Nicola Sturgeon declaring a climate emergency.The course was devised by experts at the Perth-based Royal Scottish Geographical Society in partnership with the Institute of Directors, Stirling Universityrsquos Business School and the University of Edinburghrsquos Centre for Carbon Innovation.Among the main areas the course looks at are issues around transport, energy use, supply chains, social behaviours, mitigation and planning for the future.Former UN executive secretary on climate change Christiana Figueres who brokered the Paris Agreement, former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney who is now UN special envoy on climate action and finance and ex Irish President Mary Robinson who set up a climate justice foundation, are among heavyweight names lending their support.The man behind the idea, RSGS chief executive Mike Robinson, said a number of business leaders have already committed to undertake the course along with the Scottish Government, with further discussions to ensure new university students and MSPs can take part well-underway.The studies are aimed at filling the gaps in knowledge, on a scientic and factual basis, with a focus on developing a structured plan. Online modules are live now, with the first planned workshop to be held in June.He insists business leaders ndash and the farming community in particular ndash will play a key role in deciding future outcomes.Mr Robinson, said: ldquoWhat wersquore really hoping is we can make it universal.ldquoThe conversations Irsquove had are with six universities is about making it mandatory for students as a matriculation course. Stirling and Edinburgh universities are already further down the line on that than others.ldquoIrsquom also talking to others about making it as mandatory as we can in all other sectors - including business - because we need everybody to wake up a bit to their responsibilities.ldquoThe Scottish Government are already committed through their programme of government to put through  senior staff on it.Scotland has some of the most ambitious climate targets in the world, setting a legally binding pledge to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by  at the latest ndash five years ahead of the date set for the UK as a whole.The nationrsquos emissions cuts in March stood at around  per cent since  baseline levels, but achieving  per cent is expected to take a lot more work across every sector of the community.Speaking during Climate Solutions Week, Mr Robinson added: Targets, particularly on climate change, relate to the whole of our society and not just government, and you need businesses, you need local authorities, you need inidual actors to pick up the baton and play their role.ldquoUntil you all have the same thing you are working too, then the danger is you are actually pulling apart instead of pulling in the same direction and thatrsquos actually the single biggest risk.ldquoThere is a willingness, but not necessarily clarity.ldquoSo, herersquos a way thatrsquos credible, reliable, makes sense to business and helps them implement stuff - becauseyou donrsquot know this stuff how are you going to run a business in ten years time.Anticipating hundreds of people to enrol in the first year, he hopes the course can help reduce the impact of the pause.He said: ldquoItrsquos very solutions focussed, its imbued with optimism which I think is essential from a mental health point of view. Irsquom not into scaring people witless about this, we want to enable them.ldquoWhat wersquore trying to do is make it easy as possible for people to work out the answers quickly, and the need to take action quickly.ldquoEvenyou canrsquot necessary impact a solution directly by introducing it in your business or in your own le then what you can do is recognise the need for that change and allow it to happen."},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-kevin-mckenna-coronavirus-aftermath-makes-independence-vital-ever","story":"Certainly, it would be foolish not to follow a plan simply because you donrsquot fancy the look of its authors. But when the UK Governmentrsquos response and strategy for containing coronavirus have been found to be deficient then surely a devolved administration has a duty to seek a dferent way within its jurisdictional competence.:UK Govt virus decision-making called into question after it emerges Dominic Cummings attended SAGE meetingsThe Scottish Government, having adhered to Westminsterrsquos plan for the first five weeks of this crisis, is now facing valid questions about the wisdom of sticking to the Johnson roadmap so uncritically. The UK is on course for one of the biggest death tolls in Europe following a haphazard and complacent approach by Westminster. This resulted in three lost weeks prior to the March  lockdown during which the Prime Minister genuinely didnrsquot seem to grasp the gravity of the situation. Scotland has thus fared less well than other similar-sized jurisdictions, most notably Ireland.Mr Johnsonrsquos ministers, standing in for him during his rural confinement, have probably done more damage to the reputation of English public schools than Messrs Philby, Burgess and MacLean. None of them look as though they know whatrsquos going on either as they lurch from one hapless plan to the next. They are also a daily advert for Scottish independence and Ms Sturgeon must now begin the process of decoupling from this train-wreck.How much of this informed Ms Sturgeonrsquos decision yesterday to depart slightly from the UKrsquos direction of travel is open to conjecture. It was the right thing to do though. She seems to be acutely aware that some of our communities and some sections of the population have less of what is needed to deal with the pressures of confinement than others.For every household which will come to view this period as a curious interlude in their comfortable existences there are several who have nothing with which to ease the sense of isolation and helplessness. They donrsquot have gardens sufficiently large and handsome to fix a barbecue or a batch gin-tasting before posting it on social media with a witty apercu.Having emerged from a decade of economic lockout consisting of austerity healthcare cuts and long-term unemployment they are now being told to deal with a lockdown by playing parlour games on Zoom and touching their toes with Joe.We are plainly not all in this together and to suggest otherwise is naiumlve and ignorant. In no country does a one-size-fits-all approach to government work, and certainly not in Scotland. Here there are several regional statelets, distinct from each other in history, culture, faith and geography, which rub along edgily with each other.:Marches in support of Scottish independence postponed to next year amid pandemicItrsquos inconceivable that those who were already struggling before this pandemic will adhere to this universal curfew for longer than another few weeks. Something will have to give lest the country is soon to face outbreaks of serious civil disorder. Ms Sturgeon seems to have sensed this and has moved to offer hope and a little compassion.Lest anyone in the Scottish Government be tempted to promote the advantages of being independent during a global health crisis a few familiar trumpets from the sprawling right-wing commentariat in Scotland have been quick to advise them of the folly of such a position. Why, independence would be unthinkable in these circumstances how could Scotland put together an economic aid package similar to that announced by the UK government to help businesses Presumably, the UK Government simply borrowed like everyone  faced with this situation. What will define the quality of the UK Government isnrsquot how quickly they requisitioned the cash for their bailout package but how they choose to spread the burden of its impact afterwards.Nothing, we are told, will ever be normal again after this. The effects of coronavirus will persist for a generation. Change isnrsquot merely advisable itrsquos necessary. Having walked in the shoes of the poor for a little while we will be compelled to do without in other ways. Andwersquore talking about change then we need also to talk about changing the way we do politics how we make legislation and where we spend money. This is exactly the right time for the wider Scottish independence movement to discuss ways of pressing home the advantage of compassion.The attitude of every Westminster administration since the global banking crisis of  does not engender any confidence that one headed by Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings will act in the interests of the many rather than the few. A decade or so of marginalising communities, intimidating minorities and assuaging the malfeasance of the finance sector ensured that those least able to bear the burden of  footed a disproportionate share of the bill.Boris Johnson, Dominic Cummings and Michael Gove have already signalled their intent to endanger the UKrsquos coronavirus recovery by insisting that Brexit remains on track. We are fond of mocking President Trump for his increasingly unhinged pronouncements but nothing he has said is as reckless as this. It reinforces the idea that the Johnson government, whose weaknesses have been ruthlessly exposed by coronavirus, is still refusing to take the threat seriously enough.This week, Pope Francis said: ldquoWe were not shaken awake by wars or injustice across the world, nor did we listen to the cry of the poor or of our ailing planet. We carried on regardless, thinking we would stay healthy in a world that was sick.The aftermath of coronavirus will expose the true nature of governments. It will lay bare the soul of the cult currently running the UK. Scotland faces a moral choice and one which will define the immediate future of most of her people: to permit our most vulnerable to be prey to the whims of Mr Johnson or to embrace independence as a means of giving them a chance in the economic storm that will follow.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Her proximity to him during those summits led many outsiders to believe she is essentially North Korearsquos No. official.ldquoI think the basic assumption would be that maybe it would be someone in the family to replace Kim Jong Un, US national security adviser Robert OrsquoBrien told reporters on Tuesday.ldquoBut again, itrsquos too early to talk about that because we just donrsquot know, you know, what condition Chairman Kim is in and wersquoll have to see how it plays out.ldquoNorth Korean politics and the three hereditary power transfers have been male-centred.

With lockdown people are finding themselves in the unusual position of being at home for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and it could be a time to experiment and push the boat out.\"I think people have a new appreciation of the craft of making things like a loaf of bread. It can take  hours to make a loaf and a couple of days to make a sourdough,\" said Giovanna. \"I tried to buy yeast in the shop this week and they had run out so it shows more people are maybe making their own.\"This week has been a special celebration in the Eusebi household as her daughter Sophia turned  and Giovanna has been providing meals for Glasgow Kindness charity which is helping to feed homeless people on the street.Her mouthwatering recipes exclusively revealed for the first time today, with stunning photos by Gerardo Jaconelli, could be the perfect treat for the family and encourage people to try something new.Giovanna added: \"Now that people are time-rich I think the focus falls on our homes. We are all eating together and it is a chance to try something new.\"I have created a fresh burrata salad this week as a special starter. And for a showstopper I have created a salt-baked fish. It is something that looks really good and is a bit of a spectacle when you crack into it.\"You cant really go wrong with it or overcook it as the salt protects it. I think people should give these things a go as they have nothing to lose.\"For a little sweet treat, Giovanna has created an Italian favourite ndash tiramisu.She added: \"I thought this menu was something that people could try at home and was maybe a special Friday night dress up meal.\"With the good weather this week Giovannas bin barbecue has been put to good use, but it was a marshmallow treat that went down well with the family.BURRATA : Fennel and anchovy saladThis is a very quick and easy starter to put together. Donrsquot be afraid to substitute any ingredients. Its important to cut the creaminess of the cheese with acidity form the orange. Salmoriglio is an easy dressing that is great for using up herbs past their best. It is also excellent on steamed greens or to marinade fish. The colours are striking and flavours inspired by Sicily.Serves Ingredients burrata or buffalo mozzarellafrac bulb of fennel or celery, sliced finely blood orange, segmented anchovy filletsMixed salad leavesCrushed pistachio to garnishSalmoriglio dressingg of fresh herbs Clove of garlicZest and juice of  lemonml of the best olive oil you haveMake the dressing: Blend all the ingredients in a food processor.To assemble: Place all ingredients except the burrata in a bowl. Season to taste. Add two-thirds of dressing. Arrange on a plate. Partially tear the burrata and place on top. Scatter over pistachios and remainder of dressing. Serve.Salt Baked FishThis is a simple, stress free way to cook fish which is a showstopper. The crust acts like an oven, sealing in the moisture, allowing the fish to cook in its on juices. Evenyou overcook it by  mins it would still be moist. This will be the tastiest fish you have ever eaten.Serves Cooking time guide: min per g whole fish approx g ndash Bass, bream, trout, turbot Salt CrustApprox - kilo of coarse saltWaterAromatics to stuff fish thick slices lemon, whole herbs Preheat oven to C F gas .Trim off fins, remove any guts of fish, you can leave scales, tail and head on.Line a baking tray with parchment.In a large bowl mix salt with water. There are no exact quantities. You are looking for a coarse wet sand texture. Imagine you are on the sea shore making sand castles!Stuff the cavity of the fish. Overlap lemon slices and pack with herbs. Experiment with herbs, its just important to fill it with something to maintain its shape and perfume the fish flesh.Use one third of the mixture for the base. Pat out into an even half inch layer. Place the fish on the bed of salt. Cover it with the remaining salt. Pat gently down until it covers the fish, like an envelope. Make sure there are no cracks.Bake for approx mins. If you have a thermometer insert it into the thickest part, it should be C, or a kne inserted into the thickest part should come away easily. Another way to test is is to remove the first spine closest to the head. If it comes out with ease then itrsquos ready. Let the fish rest for  mins. Cut round the circumference of the salt casing. You should be able to lt it off. Discard. Brush away any excess salt.To serve run your kne down the spine of the fish between the two fillets and gently lt off. Serve with wedge of lemon and drizzle over your best olive oil.Tip: If the fish is slightly undercooked, donrsquot worry just pop it back into the oven for a few more minutes .Eusebi TiramisuAn iconic, classic Italian dessert to \"pick us up\" in lockdown.

Instead, the site suggests mixing it with green tea as a natural toner.Should you be missing the skin-smoothing effect of an eye-watering beauty salon chemical peel, you may want to follow the online sitersquos alternative: granulated sugar, mixed with olive oil then a right good rub.For those who can spare some beer, its yeast content will help fight excessive sebum production and the bacteria that causes acne.Mix with egg whites and mashed strawberries then use as a face pack ndash or just pretend itrsquos a beery kind of meringue and eat it.While the websitersquos store cupboard treatments may seem a shade desperate, according to Claire Gray of Glasgow-based skincare specialist Ermana, there is real merit in seeking out a more natural approach to our skincare regimes.ldquoAt the moment, most of us are focused on shopping for essentials such as food and medicine, and skincare is often viewed as a luxury product, she says.ldquoBut all this time indoors and washing our hands is having an impact on our skin.For eyes strained from peering too long at Tiger King on Netflix, she has an age-old remedy: ldquoThe tannins in tea can help reduce puffiness and get rid of dark circles. Simply soak a tea bag in warm water and place on your eyes for  minutes.ldquoFor an astringent or toner, wipe a teabag over your face to tighten skin and then blot with a towel.With coffee shops closed and our espresso fix now confined to home, there is a use for all those spent coffee grounds. ldquoSimply add some coffee grounds to coconut oil to make your own at-home scrub, she says.ldquoThe coffee grains help remove dirt and dead skin cells and promote overall skin health, and the scrubbing action stimulates blood flow and can help to reduce cellulite.ldquoThe caffeine in coffee grounds has potent antioxidant properties that can help protect the skin from sun damage.While honeyrsquos antibacterial, anti-fungal and antiseptic properties mean it makes a handy face mask, so too do the fats, minerals and vitamins in mashed avocado.Pineapple is almost a skincare superfood: vitamin C, bromelain and antioxidants can help prevent and treat acne, fine lines, sun damage and uneven tone. Rub it on, leave for a few minutes and rinse off.Gray suggests therersquos even a skincare use for that bottle of apple cider vinegar lurking at the back of the cupboard. ldquoThe main ingredient in apple cider vinegar is acetic acid but it also contains lots of other natural alpha-hydroxy acids, she says.ldquoThese work together to gently exfoliate the skin by dissolving dead skin cells. Applying apple cider vinegar to the skin also delivers beneficial enzymes, proteins and good bacteria.With hand-washing a national hobby, she suggests taking particular care when choosing which soaps to buy.ldquoHandwashes contain water and any product with water has preservatives to stop it degrading. Andit says lsquoparfumrsquo on the bottle, itrsquoll have a multitude of sins.ldquoItrsquos much better to choose a natural soap, such as one made with olive oil.Helen Atherton of Edinburgh-based soap specialist, Dook, agrees that while washing hands with soap is a proven virus-killer, many harsh supermarket soaps will also wreck our hands.ldquoThe dference between a bar of handmade soap and a manufactured one is huge, she says. ldquoIn handmade soaps, the natural glycerine thatrsquos squeezed out in the industrial process is retained. So handmade soap is much kinder but will still destroy viruses.She uses coconut oil, shea butter, essential oils and Himalayan salt to make her organic soap, but strongly advises against attempting to break out the saucepans to rustle up your own bar.ldquoIf yoursquore not careful, homemade soap can go a bit rubbish ndash therersquos chemistry involved, caustic soda.

Therersquos something for everyone as tribute acts strut their stuff on the group, from Alan Walker performing as George Michael to Chloe Barry doing her stint as Adele.However, while one aim of the group is to provide some light-hearted entertainment, another aim behind it is to reach out to people to raise awareness about mental health issues and to put people in touch with someone who could help.Mr Yuill said: ldquoThe news was looming of a lockdown and isolation was looking more and more likely. My we is involved in health, welfare and wellbeing for a charity, Turning Point Scotland, and has a particular passion for promoting and supporting good mental health. I lost a family member to a mental health illness, so I too have a desire to help where I can.ldquoWe were extremely concerned that people who may suffer from low mood or stress and anxiety may struggle with isolation. In a crisis such as this, we all need support. Those who are vulnerable may require further support than they did previously. Mental health can be a dficult topic, with people either shying away from communicating, or worried about the stigma involved.ldquoWe therefore wanted a fun, light-hearted approach to opening a support network, where people could participate from home.With people finding themselves in unusual situations or furloughed from work, Mrs Yuill felt there might be some people who could fall through the net and wanted a way to reach out.She added: ldquoWe created the page with the premise that we could attract people with fun and laughter, but have links and resources that would be beneficial. We have further recruited a personal trainer and a yoga instructor who are providing their services for free.ldquoIt is crucial that we also think about and include children. They too can be vulnerable to poor mental health. We have included them in our exercise routines, we have encouraged their videos and we have provided entertainment especially for them including Disney Hour.ldquoWe raised awareness and acceptance during World Autism Awareness Day by inviting our members who are on the spectrum to showcase their talents. They received wonderful, positive feedback that will help them grow in confidence and money cannot buy that.The small admin team which consists of the Yuills and Mr Kennedy has had some lovely messages of support. Mrs Yuill added: ldquoWe receive personal messages from people on a daily basis, thanking us for assisting them during this awful time.ldquo I have also received messages for people who are struggling and take the time to respond and afterwards I check in with them.ldquoWhen we allto normal le, we will do all we can to keep the page thriving as a network for anyone to feel safe, accepted and most of all a sense of belonging.ldquoDiscussing mental health needs to become normalised.ldquoWe would love to reach out to even more iniduals and you could offer the most amazing  to do so.And while there seems to be no end to the talent out there, Mr Yuill suggested that neednrsquot put off even established singers.ldquoWellLewis Capaldi or Marti Pellow want to do a wee live gig for us we would be delighted.ldquoAll they need to do is get in touch, added Mr Yuill.For information please go to www.facebook groups   Read more: Coronavirus in Scotland: Graduate doctors ready to join NHS in Covid- fightRead more: Coronavirus in Scotland: Praise and thanks for volunteers hailed as lelines during lockdownNews from trusted and credible sources is essential at all times, but especially now as the coronavirus pandemic impacts on all aspects of our lives.

There is no other artist who documented Glasgow so extraordinarily during that period. Itrsquos not enough for Scottish art and big institutions like Kelvingrove to be limited to the most popular names like the Glasgow Boys, Jack Vettriano or Charles Rennie Mackintosh.ldquoPeople are very familiar with the work of the Glasgow Boys. But Glasgow has other painters. Therersquos a Glasgow Girl. Shersquos not even Scottish but came here and fell in love with the city to such an extent that she painted it throughout her short le. Eardley is a hugely important British artist and she should have a major exhibition in a British institution of note, like the Tate.Eardley was born on May , , on a dairy farm in Warnham, Sussex. Her family later moved to London and then, in , amid the growing threat of war, to Bearsden.The following year, she began her studies at Glasgow School of Art and proved fearless in her pursuit of subjects to paint. Her wanderings brought her to impoverished Townhead in the northeast of the city, where she established a studio. The paintings Eardley did there ndash particularly her famous portraits of the Samson children ndash are considered landmarks of th-century art.For her niece Anne Morrison, a Bearsden-based ceramicist, Eardleyrsquos relationship with an urban district which was facing the demolition ball is an example of just how daring and exceptional she was.ldquoTownhead was just not the area that you would go to ndash I was kept well away from it, she said. ldquoEven my brother, who was a couple of years older, said he had never been up there either. It was not the place to be. It was just the poverty and seeing what that part of Glasgow looked like. Middle-class kids just did not get taken there.ldquoShe actually caught something that was disappearing at the time, as the buildings were getting knocked down and people were getting moved where. It captured something of the city and the children there. Itrsquos not glorying it but itrsquos capturing it in a very human way.Morrison suggested that the lack of a major event to mark the centenary of Eardleyrsquos birth could have something to do with the Scottishness of her work.ldquoIt does seem right to have a celebration of her work but it does not seem to be happening, she added. ldquoHer name gets forgotten. She has not had the recognition at a UK level that she should. Thatrsquos the trouble. Shersquos a Scottish artist and she gets put aside because her subjects were Scottish as well.Laura Cumming, art critic for The Observer, described Eardley as ldquoone of the deepest landscape artists who ever lived, and among the most humanitarian painters of men, women and especially children.She added: ldquoEvery opportunity to see her work is precious ndash anywhere at all.ldquoThere have been shows in Scotland, the last that I remember was in . She deserves many more, and so the ideal would be a touring show that took in London, presenting her work throughout the United Kingdom to a new generation. Next year must not be allowed to slip by without a full-scale retrospective of her powerfully stirring and beautul work.Arts journalist Jan Patience said: ldquoThe National Galleries of Scotland in Edinburgh has done a power of work to cement her reputation with two major shows in the last  years, but there has been no major Eardley show for years in Glasgow, the city she called home. I believe the last one was in what was then called The Third Eye Centre in the s.ldquoAn Eardley show in Glasgow would attract visitors in their thousands and a no-show in her centenary year shows a real lack of vision.Local authorities in Scotlandrsquos largest cities said events were being organised or considered to mark the anniversary.A spokeswoman for Glasgow Le said: ldquoAs one of Scotlandrsquos most popular th-century artists we anticipate a small programme of events to mark Joan Eardleyrsquos centenary.ldquoWe are pleased to have a small number of her drawings and paintings in our collection, which includes the much-loved oil Glasgow Kids, a Saturday Matineacutee Picture Queue, on show in Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum. However, we do not hold the breadth of works required to stage a standalone exhibition.An Aberdeen City Council spokeswoman said: ldquoEardleyrsquos work is showcased as one of the Our Collection highlights in Gallery  ndash Collecting Art and her work can be seen throughout the collections galleries. A number of the oils we own are on display, including a powerful seascape painted at Catterline.ldquoThe  centenary of Joan Eardleyrsquos birth presents a welcome opportunity for us to celebrate the artistrsquos strong connection with the northeast of Scotland in a number of ways.A spokesman for Leisure and Culture Dundee, which runs the McManus Gallery and Museum, said: ldquoWe have no current plans to mark the Joan Eardley centenary next year.A spokesman for the National Galleries of Scotland said: ldquoThe National Galleries celebrated the le and work of Joan Eardley in a comprehensive exhibition just three years ago, and the exhibitionrsquos curator Patrick Elliott, a leading expert on Eardley, is writing a book on Eardley and Catterline as part of the centenary celebrations. All future plans, including publication of this book and our exhibition schedule, are subject to review due to the ongoing health crisis. However, we do intend on marking Eardleyrsquos centenary next summer, in one form or another.The Tate galleries declined to comment."},{"url":null,"title":"picts-really-mythical-ancestors","story":"WE think of the Picts as an almost mythological people ndash mystical, mysterious, barbarian and pagan ndash lost to us in the mists of time.But nothing could be further from the truth. Before the coronavirus lockdown began, archaeologists were making rapid advances in our understanding of these ancient ancestors. A standing stone carved by Pictish hands some , years ago was recently discovered near Dingwall, shedding new light on their art and culture. A ,-year-old Pictish cemetery was located on the Black Isle, giving us an insight into their religious beliefs and social rituals.In recent years, scholars have been revolutionising how history views the Picts ndash a people who, until the s, were seen as a subject too fancul for serious academic study.So who really were the Picts  The broad answer is that they were the inhabitants of Scotland long before the idea of Scotland even existed. They withstood the Roman occupation of Britain, maintaining their own distinct culture while other cultures were subsumed by the Empire. By the Dark Ages, the Picts emerged as a culture just as sophisticated as any other on the British isles at the time. The Picts helped shape modern Britain ndash and without them Scotland wouldnrsquot exist. Nor were they stubbornly pagan ndash they embraced Christianity.The recent th anniversary of the Declaration of Arbroath should have been a time for Scotland to reassess our understanding of the Picts. The  document, written by Scottish nobles asserting the nationrsquos independence from England, states, in one digression, that ancient Scots ldquocompletely destroyed the Picts.That claim is historical nonsense ndash therersquos not a word of truth in it ndash but itrsquos set the tone for much of the publicrsquos understanding, or rather misunderstanding, of the Picts ever since. That erroneous, and ghoulishly gloating, claim is just one of the myriad myths that have grown up around the Pictish past. Addressing the hoods perpetuated in the Declaration of Arbroath would have been a perfect way to start a new national conversation about these most misunderstood, and intriguing, ancestors of ours.So what do we know about them Origin storyThe ancestors of the Picts were the tribes who lived in the north of Scotland, beyond the River Tay. In the first century AD, the Romans called these people Britanni, today we think of them as the Caledonii or Caledonians. These Caledonians defended their land with guerrilla attacks against the legions of Rome. Roman chroniclers such as Tacitus tell us that these tribes forged alliances against Rome ndash and finally took on the might of the Empire in a huge set piece battle at Mons Graupius in AD. The exact location of the battle is unknown but it was probably in Aberdeenshire and gave rise to the name of the Grampian Mountains.The battle was a defeat for the Caledonians but at least two-thirds of their army survived. Resistance, weather, and landscape all made it impossible for Rome to complete its conquest of the entire island of Britain. The north remained free, and the Caledonian ancestors of the Picts continued their hit-and-run campaign against Roman forces.As the writer Tim Clarkson notes in his seminal book The Picts: ldquoThe early years of the second century saw the northern barbarians launch a series of attacks on Roman Britain hellip The situation became so serious that the emperor Hadrian ordered his soldiers to build a mighty wall of stone along the Tyne-Solway frontier.Clarkson explains how the Caledonians morphed into the Picts: ldquoCaledonians of the second and third centuries were an amalgamation of tribes, each of whom joined ndash or were forced to join ndash a larger political entity or confederacy ... By the end of the third century these confederates had acquired or adopted a new name for themselves, of which the Latin term Picti was a Roman iant or equivalent.The word \"Pict\" first appears in Roman writings in  when the Hiberni ndash or Irish ndash are noted along with the \"Picti\" as enemies of Rome. Therersquos long been speculation that the name \"Pict\" is derived from Roman military slang \"Picti\" for Painted People ndash a reference to the tattoos on the bodies of Pictish fighters. Or the word Pict could be a corruption of Pritani, a term used to describe the inhabitants of these islands, and perhaps the source of the word Britain itself.One of the greatest mysteries of history, though, is what the Picts of this time called themselves. That knowledge is lost to us forever. However, places in Scotland today which begin with \"Pit\" are almost certainly the sites of ancient Pictish settlements ndash Pittodrie, Pitlochry, Pittenweem. ldquoFrom Fe to the Isle of Skye, and from Shetland to the Tay, the native inhabitants were almost certainly part of the Pictish nation, says Clarkson.Linguistically, itrsquos thought that the Picts spoke a Celtic language ndash but one that is closer to todayrsquos Breton, Welsh and Cornish than Irish or Scots Gaelic.The Picts were mysterious even in their own era. Chroniclers believed they originated in Scythia ndash an ancient land that was part of whatrsquos now the Russian steppe. Legend had it that exploring Picts were blown off course, arrived in Ireland and were assisted by Irish princes. The princes gave the Picts wives ndash infor a promise that any kings would come from the female line of a royal family ndash and told them to settle across the sea in Scotland.The legend could have its roots in the fact that the Picts are believed to have practised matrilineal succession to the throne ndash in other words a man became kingthrough his motherrsquos bloodline not his fathers. This made the Picts almost unique among all the civilisations of Europe at the time.The Picts were also connected to the wider world, and making treaties and pacts with other tribes across Europe. In , Picts were an integral part of the so-called Barbarian Conspiracy when the Hibernians, Saxons, Franks and Picts launched a coordinated attack on Roman Britain. Although the assault failed, the audacity of the strike signalled Romersquos decline. Finally, in , Roman rule in Britain ended as the empire began to implode. It was now that the Picts could come into their own.The Dark AgesAfter the end of Roman occupation, the Picts found themselves facing British tribes to the south in the Lothians and Clyde Valley ndash the kingdoms of Alt Clut and Gododdin ndash and a powerful Irish nation across the sea. Pictland or Pictavia was in the process of becoming a patchwork of mini-kingdoms ruled by an overking.In terms of how the Picts lived, Clarkson says that society in ldquoearly historic Europe had long since discarded any lingering egalitarian traits and was heavily stratied in terms of wealth and status, with the bulk of the population living as peasants on agricultural land ruled by lords who in turn constituted a sophisticated aristocracy.Although St Patrick viewed the Picts as savages, other early Christian missionaries saw them as worthy of salvation. It was an Irish abbess, Darlugdach, who was one of the first to preach to the pagan Picts, and built a church in Abernethy. She died around . Fillan, an Irish monk, also helped bring Christianity to the Picts. Hersquos likely to have stayed at a hillfort near St Fillans, which may have been home to Pictish aristocrats. It was the Briton St Ninian and Irelandrsquos St Columba, however, who led the most successful missionary work among the Picts, and brought the wholesale adoption of Christianity among the Pictish population.Columba became the stuff of legend ndash battling wizards, performing miracles which cowed the heathens, and even having a brush with the Loch Ness Monster. However, Columbarsquos work may not have been all that dficult in reality.ldquoIn every corner of the British isles, says Clarkson, ldquopaganism was retreating in the face of a sophisticated international religion whose leaders were rapidly gaining influence at the centre of political power hellip To a wise and ambitious [Pictish] king hellip the eventual triumph of Christianity may have seemed inevitable.Around the time of Columba, the Picts went to war with the Scots. Confusingly, these Scots ndash or Scotti ndash seem to have been originally from Ireland. They had colonised Argyll, eventually setting up the kingdom known as Dalriada which would stretch from northern Ireland to the Hebrides. This ancient ancestral quirk probably explains why Scottish and Irish Gaelic are so similar.Clarkson says: ldquoThe harsh geography of the highlands lay between [the Picts and the Scots] to keep them apart, ensuring that they shared few cultural traits and did not even speak the same language.Dalriadarsquos rulers were in an expansionist frame of mind by the mid-s but were put in their place by a show of force from the Picts known as \"The Flight of the Scots\".The history of the Picts now descends into a series of battles and diplomatic alliances. Sometimes the battles were between Pictish warlords for the overkingship of the realm, at other times the fight was with enemies to the south, mostly the Anglo-Saxons in the area which became Northumbria. Sometimes the Picts were defeated, sometimes their opponents. This was a time of almost permanent conflict, and peace was fleeting.Glory daysThe last half of the s saw Northumbrian Anglo-Saxons hold dominance over the Picts, Dalriada and the Britons of southern and central Scotland. Picts began to rebel, though, as Northumbrian rule weakened thanks to feuds with their Anglo-Saxon rivals further south in England. The Picts, led by King Brude , eventually crushed the Northumbrians at the Battle of Dunnichen in , killing their king Ecgfrith and most of his army.As the Anglo-Saxon writer Bede said: ldquoFrom this time, the hopes and strength of the English kingdom began to ebb and fall away. The Picts were free again. With no more tributes being paid to Northumbria, the foundations were laid, says Clarkson, for ldquothe great kingdom that would eventually rise to power the following century.After a mini version of the War of the Roses among Pictish aristocrats, one contender emerged victorious. Oengus became the new overking in  and stepped forward as one of the greatest rulers in Pictish history.Oengus took on the Scots of Dalriada and beat them ndash but his son was taken hostage in revenge. As a result, Oengus, to put it mildly, went crazy. He invaded Dalriada, ritually drowned a prince and eventually, as Clarkson says, put the Scots of Dalriada ldquounder a yoke of subjection. His campaign became known as the Percutio Dalriatai ndash \"The Smiting of Dalriada\".Thanks to war, trade, Christianity and treaties, both Anglo-Saxon and Gaelic culture were already influencing and enriching Pictish le considerably. However, after Oengusrsquos death in , the Picts descended once again into dynastic in-fighting. Soon, though, there were bigger threats to worry about: the Vikings were about to arrive and change everything.Dalriada was the site of the some of the worst Viking atrocities ndash acts which would start to bring the Scots and Picts together in self-defence. Eventually Constantine, king of the Picts, installed his son Domnall as king of the Scots in Dalriada. Clarkson says this ldquowas a big step towards unying the two peoples as a single nation.Gaelic influence from the Scots of Dalriada on Pictish culture was much stronger, however, than Pictish influence on Gaelic culture, probably due to the strength of the Irish church. Clarkson says this ldquoled to the slow erosion of Pictish culture and its replacement by a Gaelic counterpart.In , the united Picts and Scots faced down the Vikings ndash but were annihilated. Some call it \"The Disaster of \". From the chaos, however, emerged one of the Scotlandrsquos most renowned figures, Cinaed mac Ailpin ndash Kenneth MacAlpin.The twilight of the PictsItrsquos unclear whether MacAlpin was a Pict or a Scot ndash perhaps he was both, a Picto-Scot. Either way, hersquos the king credited with turning Scotland into a unied nation. He was king in Dalriada for two years before becoming king of the Picts in . His reign began the process of \"language death\" which saw the Pictish tongue disappear and be replaced by Gaelic.One legend associated with MacAlpin is \"The Treachery of Scone\" where the Scots, led by McAlpine, invited Pictish nobles to a feast at Scone and murdered them. The story was the inspiration for the \"Red Wedding\" in Game Of Thrones. In reality, however, MacAlpin, says Clarkson, embarked ldquoon a process of political change that would eventually turn his kingdom into Alba, the precursor of medieval Scotland.Clarkson deems this period \"the twilight of the Picts\". The last mention of the Picts came in , when they are referred to as part of an army battling Vikings at Strathern under the leadership of Constantine II, MacAlpins grandson.Soon Alba would become known as Scotia, and the Picts would fade into myth. Though, as Clarkson says: ldquoThe Picts did not vanish in any literal or physical sense. Their disappearance was entirely political ndash they merged with the Scots to eventually become the lsquoScottishrsquo nation.To assuage any doubt that the Picts are still very much with us in modern Scotland, just check your DNA. Testing in the heartland of what was once Pictavia ndash Tayside, Perthshire, Fe and Angus ndash shows that around one-fth of us still carry the genes of our Pictish ancestors."},{"url":null,"title":"ally-mclaws-lockdown-diary-religion-not-yet---chemo-immunotherapy-trust","story":"Yet, even as I prepared to go on to the surgical table to have my left lung removed along with the malignant tumour growing inside it, I didnrsquot think to say a prayer.The operation didnrsquot prove as successful as my surgeon and oncologist had hoped and the cancer remains.

Rats have taken the blame for spreading it, but just as Jimmy Cagney never actually said ldquoyou dirty rat, it may be that the rodent has been given a bad rep and it was more likely passed on by travellers like Hodgson.In disease-ravaged Britain, there are accounts of parents who abandoned their children once they realised they were ill. The tell-tale sign was the appearance on the skin of ldquoGodrsquos tokens ndash the red rings which were a sign that the blood vessels were leaking blood into tissue.In Italy, in The Decameron, Giovanni Boccaccio wrote of Florence at the time: ldquoMany died by day or by night in the public streets the departure of many others, who died at home, was hardly observed by their neighbours until the stench of their putrefying bodies carried the tidings and what with their corpses and the corpses of others who died on every hand, the whole place was a sepulchre.rsquoThe way to have stopped the spread would have been what we are doing today, or trying to, had they then known, although that is not to say it would have been successful ndash a long quarantine, wearing of masks and contact tracing, which we may even get round to shortly. Instead there was what amounted to medieval herd immunity. It took its course to exhaustion.The weak and frail may have perished through natural selection but for the survivors the plague modied their genes and made them more resistant to disease, so that this generation and succeeding ones lived longer.There were several by-products. The perfume industry was created because, while doctors then believed the plane was caused by poisonous vapours, aromatic herbs were used to pury the air, and to cover body odour. Hospitals became, not places for the doomed, stricken, it was believed, because they had sinned, but places where doctors and nurses, rather than monks and nuns, tried to heal people.And, of course, sex comedies emerged, like The Decameron, together with the rise of English as the predominant language, as well as the end of feudalism, because there were simply so few left to till and labour that they could demand, and receive, higher wages and fairer conditions.When David Home was born on this day, April , , in a tenement in Edinburghrsquos Lawnmarket, Scotland was in an abject state. The Darien Disaster, less than two decades previously, had effectively beggared the country, with approximately % of all the money circulating in Scotland lost. It bequeathed what Burns called the parcel of rogues, who forged the Act of Union and which dissolved a Scottish Parliament for three centuries.Home changed his name to Hume when he was  because his surname, pronounced Hume in Scotland, was understood as the place where you lived, or as the prefix to counties.By then he had gone to the University of Edinburgh at , or possibly , failing to graduate because he had no respect for his professors and believed that all he needed to learn he could acquire from books.From the age of  and for more than  years he did just that, read, until he became so ill and depressed his doctors prescribed ldquoa course of bitters and anti-hysteric pills, whatever they were. And a pint of claret each day, so it had its compensations.At the age of , his literary debut, the seminal A Treatise Of Human Nature, was published and Hume was on his way. A job as a librarian at Edinburgh University provided access to research material and to The History Of England, which was published in six volumes between  and .England at the time had around five times the population and almost  times the wealth, but Scotland had a network of parish schools and four universities to Englandrsquos two.Hume, the philosopher, joined with a wealth of other eminent scholars, mathematicians, scientists, thinkers and poets in what has become known as the Scottish Enlightenment. In , Adam Smith published The Wealth Of Nations, the bedrock of modern economics.Pandemics are dotted throughout our history. In , what is now called the Spanish Flu infected around  million worldwide, killing upwards of  million, although the exact figure is something of a guesstimate as proper medical records were not kept.One thing we do know is the flu did not originate in Spain, although coverage of it did. Spain had been neutral in the Great War whereas bad news, like this outbreak, was covered up by the allies to preserve morale. It spread fast because there were no effective vaccines or antivirals, like today with Covid-, and the first effective one wasnrsquot produced until the s.By summer , the flu pandemic came to an end, the unwitting herd approach had triumphed, as those who were infected either died or developed immunity. It was almost  years later, in , that researchers discovered what made the  flu so deadly ndash a group of three genes enabled the virus to weaken a victimrsquos bronchial tubes and lungs and clear the way for bacterial pneumonia. Not a lot dferent to coronavirus.Its long-term effects were brutal. Children born or conceived then achieved lower educational attainment, experienced increased rates of physical disability, enjoyed lower letime income and a lower socioeconomic status than those born immediately before and after it. A decade later, after the economic carnage of the war and the pandemic, the Great Depression ravaged Western economies.Another, and even more serious, effect of the First World War, the harsh measures imposed on Germany, incubated widespread grievance and hostility, breeding the conditions for Hitler and the Nazi party which led to the Second World War. Around  million people died,  million of them combatants, more than  million more soldiers and civilians in the Soviet Union, the remainder the collateral damage through genocide, bombings, massacres, disease and starvation.The most positive outcome, for this country at least, was the creation of the welfare state and the National Health Service we honour, and not just once a week on our doorsteps.

Challenges in navigating the uncertainties that the virus has created, as well as rebuilding our economy and public services.But we can go further than rebuilding, and look seriously at social and economic reform.Before this crisis, we were focused on our mission of making Scotland a greener, fairer and more prosperous country. That has not changed. But the place from where we are starting has.I have spoken before about the fundamental conversations we should be having in our society. What do we value in the communities that we live in, and what kind of country, and what kind of society do we really want to be  We have talked about the importance of promoting wellbeing. Those considerations seem ever more important now.We must focus on how we support our people to adapt to this new world. We will have to be honest about the traumatic effect this pandemic has had on our society, and how we must all confront its impact, the anguish and loss it has caused.Our support must also be practical, such as giving people the skills to respond to the inevitable changes in the labour market.It means helping businesses deal with the transition out of this crisis by aiding their efforts to change their business models and practices, with an eye to the markets that will grow in the future.Our public services will also have to change.They will need to help families and communities recover from the disorientating shock of these times, as well as harnessing the kindness and compassion that has poured from people up and down the country.Even as Scotland begins to plan a managed transition away from current restrictions, we must still adhere to the advice ndash stay at homeyou have the symptoms, keep physically distanced, and maintain hand and cough hygiene.As and when we lt restrictions, we will need to put in place public health measures to stop an uncontrolled peak of cases that would require ato lockdown.We must also still protect the most vulnerable sections of society. Perhaps we can look at how some people could meet in small groups, in defined lsquobubblesrsquo of contact.We can also consider how we can re-open schools, most likely in a very gradual and phased way we will need to consider how we can do this while maintaining physical distancing.While we think about these ideas, our plans to recover must take account of the possibility of re-imposing restrictions, and recognise the possibility that they could be re-imposed quickly.The pandemic has changed the way societies and economies across the world operate, and Scotland is no dferent.I am confident we can start to begin considering our futures with optimism because this crisis has taught us how we can achieve rapid results under the most demanding circumstances. We have seen our NHS respond with radical action, and a new medical facility built in Glasgow with speed, skill and expertise.This crisis has also prompted us to drive change that otherwise may not have been so urgent ndash such as the increased use of online tools to reduce travel and work from home.We have also seen the great capacity of our society to work together in a common purpose.We must now take these lessons into the planning of how we recover from this crisis, and how we will live our lives in the \"new normal\" that awaits us all."},{"url":null,"title":"can-build-bridge-ireland-firms-plan-eco-link-across-irish-sea","story":"THE Scottish Government has been formally approached by Swedish architects proposing that a bridge to Northern Ireland can be built ... and combined with  wind turbines to power hundreds of thousands of homes.In September last year, it was revealed that Boris Johnson asked his officials to draw up costings of building a bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland.This led to Scottish Secretary Alister Jack stating he backed a link between the two countries, saying he was ldquoon exactly the same page as the Prime Minister, despite favouring a tunnel.Jack claimed the connection could be built by  and would boost the economy of both Scotland and Northern Ireland.The pound billion project would need to be at least  miles into connect the two countries between Portpatrick and Larne in Northern Ireland.Transport is devolved to both the Scottish Government and the Northern Ireland Executive.The speculation has led a Swedish firm, which claims it is ldquoknown for its innovative solutions to erse tasks in infrastructure, to submit its eco-friendly plans to the First Minister.In the letter, sent directly to Nicola Sturgeon, the firm whose name has been redacted by Scottish Government officials, submitted its proposals for ldquothe exciting power bridge.It adds: ldquoOur concept is to combine a complete transportation infrastructure with a wind turbine farm.ldquoThe foundations of the bridge are extended upwards into pylons each supporting a .MW wind turbine.

In it, the local authority claims that it was told by Scottish Government officials in  that a connection was ldquoan important element of your ongoing review into transport infrastructure.The letter adds: ldquoWith regard to the possibility of a bridge, you advised that this would be a complex task and that it would be premature to speculate on options, but that Transport Scotland officials had been instructed to initiate discussions around exploring connectivity issues between Scotland and Northern Ireland.But Matheson and his Northern Ireland counterpart Nichola Mallon have written to the UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, telling him the link is not a priority ldquofor either government and stressed that the UKrsquos lack of dialogue with the Scottish and Northern Irish administrations over the project ldquodoes not respect devolution.In his letter to Shapps, Matheson blamed ldquobudget constraints from successive UK Governments for a lack of transport investment having ldquoheld back progress for our communities.Matheson bluntly said he ldquolooks forward to hearing from you in the availability of the pound billion to us rather than ldquowaste signicant money and resource that could be put to better use on practical, deliverable projects.He added: ldquoI strongly believe thatpound billion is available for investment in infrastructure in Scotland and Northern Ireland that rather than indulging the Prime Minister with this vanity project, such funding should be made available to our respective governments so it could be better spent on meeting the priorities of the people we represent.The bridge proposals hit a major stumbling block when bomb-disposal experts warned it would be too dangerous to build a bridge due to more than one million tonnes of unexploded munitions thought to be stashed in the -mile-long Beaufortrsquos Dyke ndash which lies on the most direct route for a connection.The plans were subject to a scathing assessment by leading economic think tank, the Fraser of Allander Institute . The FAI said the concept would clash with climate emergency aims and suggested the money could be spent on better things.In a resounding opposition to the plan, the FAI said: ldquoIt wonrsquot deliver the economic boost some claim, it isnrsquot a priority, it would go to the wrong location, it wouldnrsquot be consistent with climate change objectives, and the money could be better spent on other things.ldquoApart from that, itrsquos a cracking idea.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoThe Scottish Government has not investigated or undertaken any feasibility for a fixed link between Scotland and Northern Ireland and has no current plans to do so.ldquoInfrastructure investment should focus on projects that improve lives, support communities boost, our economy and work towards net zero. That is how we are planning Scotlandrsquos future infrastructure investment.Westminster is standing by its ambition for the connection.A UK Government spokesperson said: ldquoWe are committed to ambitious improvements to infrastructure.ldquoWe are looking at a wide range of schemes to improve connectivity and drive economic growth for all parts of the UK, using the power of the union."},{"url":null,"title":"new-normal-first-minister-calls-united-effort-build-better-scotland","story":"Nicola Sturgeon has called on the people of Scotland to work together to create a new, better nation our of the devastation caused by the coronavirus.The First Minister said the virus had shaken Scots lives to their core but that \"there is an opportunity to see them put back together dferently, and see a new way of doing things\".But rather than just restoring what had been wrecked, Sturgeon said the crisis had presented the chance to \"think together, and work together, to decide the kind of Scotland we want\".Writing exclusively in The Herald on Sunday, she said: \"We can go further than rebuilding, and look seriously at social and economic reform.\"Before this crisis, we were focused on our mission of making Scotland a greener, fairer and more prosperous country. That has not changed. But the place from where we are starting has.\"What do we value in the communities that we live in, and what kind of country, and what kind of society do we really want to be  We have talked about the importance of promoting wellbeing. Those considerations seem ever more important now.\"The First Minister believes Scotlands response to the crisis has shown that dramatic change is possible.\"I am confident we can start to begin considering our futures with optimism because this crisis has taught us how we can achieve rapid results under the most demanding circumstances,\" she said.\"This crisis has prompted us to drive change that otherwise may not have been so urgent. We have seen the great capacity of our society to work together in a common purpose.\"Sturgeon this week became the first UK leader to discuss how le will look after the crisis has passed.UK Ministers have been reluctant to talk publicly about an exit strategy, arguing that it risks undermining the message that people should stay at home in order to curb the spread of the disease.However, there are signs that they are now looking at ways in which restrictions could be eased without risking another flare-up of the virus.One option could see people allowed to socialise with up to  of their closest family and friends, with small groups of households allowed to \"cluster\" together.This could enable family members to meet for meals or friends to share childcare. It could also allow couples who do not live together to see each other.Meanwhile, Chancellor Rishi Sunak is drawing up measures to enable businesses to reopen in a \"safe and practical way\".Provisions are said to include putting up signs telling workers to stay two metres apart and to go homethey have coronavirus symptoms.Communal areas such as canteens would be closed unless people could maintain social distancing, and firms would have to ensure there are widespread hand-washing facilities and hand gel.Former chancellor Philip Hammond said it is essential that businesses are told now what requirements they will have to fulfil when the time comes to reopen so they can begin preparing.\"If we are all going to have to wear face masks travelling on public transport, businesses need to know that now so that businesses that have the capacity to manufacture products like that can start planning to do so,\" he said.\"If restaurants, when they eventually reopen, are going to have to operate with many fewer tables, they need to start thinking about how they adapt their business model to be able to do that.\"At the moment, for too many businesses, they just dont know what the requirements imposed on them are going to look like and therefore what kind of preparations they need to make.\"Hospitals, businesses and schools in Scotland are all expecting a dferent landscape under the \"new normal\", post-lockdown le.Simon Barker, a paediatric orthopaedic surgeon in Aberdeen and former chair of BMA Scolands consultants committee, said there are still a lot of unknowns about how and when normality will be restored to services.Barker stressed that some delayed patients would have to wait until  for surgery.\"Its very heartening to have people clapping for the NHS on a Thursday but were going to need those same people to have a measure of understanding when this ends and they want their hip replacement done, and unfortunately we do not have the capacity to do everybody within a week. Its going to take months to catch up.\"New guidance unveiled from the British Retail Consortium suggests non-food retailers could introduce similar measures to supermarkets to enable shoppers toto safely browsing stores for clothes, household furnishings and beauty items, and garden centres for plants.Like supermarkets, the strategy ndash which is supported by the consortiumrsquos Scottish counterpart ndash would see only limited numbers of shoppers allowed inside shops at any one time.There will also be flexi-plastic barriers at till points, floor markings to keep shoppers separated by two metres and changing rooms and in-store cafes almost certainly closed.David Lonsdale, director of the Scottish Retail Consortium, said: ldquoOur members in pharmacy, grocery and the retailing of pet food have shown during this crisis that it is possible to operate safely and responsibly in this new environment.\"With any reopening of shops in Scotland likely to be undertaken on a phased basis, once government permits trading, this new guide will assist retailers to operate safely and help get the economy moving again.ldquoIt will help customers understand changes to their usual shopping routine and indeed what is expected of them too.Pubs and restaurants are expected to be among the last businesses allowed to re-open and they will have drastically fewer customers when they do trade again.Paul Waterson, spokesman for the Scottish Licensed Trade Association, said: ldquoSocial distancing will probably mean tables being spread out, some places may have bar service only with people queuing responsibly to be served, or waiter service only.ldquoIt will be very dficult some smaller premises with a capacity of just  or  people. For them, social distancing may mean they can only have  or  people in at a time. They will have to decideitrsquos worthwhile opening.According to Ryan James, chairman of the Glasgow Restaurant Association and owner of Two Fat Ladies, some restaurants may choose to follow the lead of some European restaurants and fit plastic shields around tables.ldquoWe anticipate being in the last tranche of places that are able to open, he said. ldquoWe expect tables to have to be moved so they are two metres apart ndash in some places that could mean restaurants losing up to % of their business.ldquoI think the days of entire families of groups of  people at a time dining out are gone for the moment.Schools are already having discussions behind the scenes to lay the foundation for ato school.Larry Flanagan, general secretary of the EIS, said: \"We could be looking at smaller class sizes or perhaps children attending in either the morning or afternoon.ldquoI think reopening is likely to involve some prioritisation of certain learning groups or part-time education in some instances to ensure that physical buildings can comply with social distancing and avoid pupils congregating while still accessing all the hand-washing and practical things we need."},{"url":null,"title":"world-view-sweden-tackling-coronavirus","story":"Once upon a very long time ago I lived in Sweden. It wasnrsquot an especially y stay, probably a little over a year or so. I had gone there with my then partner who was Swedish and whom I had met while working as a correspondent in Jerusalem, where she too was based for a time.Living as we did in the Swedish capital Stockholm, the contrast with our time in the Middle East could not have been starker.In the beginning I never warmed to Stockholm. I found it lacking in the spontaneity and colour I had so much enjoyed while in Jerusalem. Somehow it seemed tame, quiet and conservative even, despite the countryrsquos liberal reputation.As time when on, however, and I became accustomed to Swedish ways, the place grew on me. Today Stockholm has become a city I love and is home to one of my closest friends with whom on occasion I continue to work alongside overseas when not having regular online chats.These days almost iniably much of our conversation revolves around comparing notes on the coronavirus and our respective experience of lockdown.Even from the start of the pandemicrsquos impact in Europe, what my friend told me about Swedenrsquos way of tacking the virus made me sit up and take notice.Irsquom not alone in this reaction given that Sweden now has one of the worldsrsquo most closely watched and controversial coronavirus response strategies.Itrsquos a strategy that has been met with both some confusion by ordinary Swedes as well as criticism from within certain sections of the countryrsquos scientic, political and media community. So, just what is it that Sweden is doing dferently and what has the reaction been at home and away At first glance there might not seem many dferences compared to other countries responses. In Sweden as where people are encouraged to practice social distancing, work from homepossible, and avoid non-essential travel as well as visits to elderly relatives or hospitals.In fact, a survey from Swedish pollsters Kantar So carried out for the countryrsquos Civil Contingencies Agencyshowed that around % of people in Sweden say they have reduced their participation in social activities to stop the spread of the infection.But where Sweden has dfered in achieving its aims in response to the virus is that the government has relied on voluntary measures, urging citizens to act responsibly and adhere to these guidelines rather than enforcing a lockdown.All of this has given the country an air of remaining open for business, evenitrsquos not exactly business as usual. Primary schools, cafes, gyms, bars and restaurants, and most businesses have continued tothroughout the spread of the pandemic.Some critics of the policy, both domestic and international, have been alarmed to say the least, but there remains little evidence that Swedes are underplaying the enormity of the disease rampaging across the globe.The architect of the controversial policy the country has adopted, and hero or villain of the piece depending on the Swedes you talk to, is Anders Tegnell, state epidemiologist at Folkhaumllsomyndigheten, Swedenrsquos public health authority.The -year-old has become a household name in Sweden, appearing across the media and holding daily briefings outlining the progression of the outbreak with a precise, quiet demeanour.Asked last week at a press conference as to why the government had chosen not to lock down the country, Tegnell reiterated its position.ldquoBasically because we think we can achieve the same results with voluntary measures, and I think that to a great extent we have shown that we can do that, came Tegnellrsquos characteristically frank reply.This candour has been a hallmark of the countryrsquos approach to tackling the pandemic in its midst.ldquoWersquore trying this strategy out. We donrsquot knowit will work or not. If it doesnrsquot, wersquoll revisit it, Tegnell openly admitted few weeks ago.To date hersquos stuck to his guns, but not everyone in Sweden agrees or approves, pointing to the fact that more people so far have died in Sweden compared to its Nordic neighbours.At the time of writing, Sweden has , confirmed Covid- cases and , people have died. According to figures from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Sweden at face value is not doing well.By April , its mortality rates from Covid- were the tenth highest in the world, with . deaths per ,. By comparison, its neighbours Denmark, Norway and Finland ranked th, nd and st, with ., . and . deaths per ,.More than half of Swedenrsquos deaths have so far occurred in Stockholm ndash , as of April  ndash yet only % of the population lives there. Bad as all this is, itrsquos still a far cry from those European countries worst hit.Currently a lot of the anger in Sweden over its case and fatality figures has come from a perceived lack of shielding of older people. More than one-third of fatalities have been the elderly living in care homes.Just a few weeks ago in light of this death toll, Swedenrsquos prime minister Stefan Lofven suggested the government might need to review its approach amid the prospect of many more fatalities.He accepted too that the failure to protect people in nursing homes stood out as a clear weakness of the governmentrsquos strategy, contributing to higher death rates than in neighbouring Scandinavian countries.ldquoThe protection for people in elderly care should have been better, Lofven admitted last week. ldquoWe need to look closer at what has gone wrong.Some Swedes have suggested that their country is deviating from most other nationsrsquo response in order to hasten herd immunity, and in doing so risking lives unnecessarily. The public health authority denies this.Inevitably, as in countries where facing the threat from the virus, this has resulted in some confusion and a polarisation of opinion.ldquoThe mixed messages are plentul, and they seem to make people want to pick sides, dig their heels in, argue that in Sweden we have a system and it works or no, Swedes always think they know best but they donrsquot, observed journalist Emma Lofgren, writing in the Swedish edition of the online newspaper The Local.Some, however, are adamant over the stance they take. Lena Einhorn, a virologist who has been one of the leading domestic critics of Swedenrsquos coronavirus policy, recently told The Observer newspaper that the government and the health authority were still resisting the most obvious explanations for many of the deaths from the virus.She argues that the reason why there has been such a high number of deaths in care homes is not because of the homes themselves, but because of Swedenrsquos decision not to close down other public facilities and amenities.Einhorn is one of  doctors, virologists and researchers who recently criticised the health authority in an op-ed published by Swedenrsquos Dagens Nyheter newspaper.It called on politicians to break with the countryrsquos tradition of entrusting policy to its expert agencies, and to seize control of Swedenrsquos coronavirus strategy from the health authority.ldquoThe approach must be changed radically and quickly, the group wrote. ldquoAs the virus spreads, it is necessary to increase social distance. Close schools and restaurants. Everyone who works with the elderly must wear adequate protective equipment. Quarantine the whole familyone member is ill or tests positive. Elected representatives must intervene, there is no other choice, the signatories to the newspaper article implored.But despite such criticisms recent polling suggests that overall prime minister Lofvenrsquos strategy continues to have the support of Swedes. His personal popularity has soared, as has that of Anders Tegnell.In accounting for this robust public display of confidence, experts point to a number of underlying factors, not least of which is the collective trust that Swedenrsquos citizens are recognised for having in their government and officials.The country has long benefited from a politically and socially stable democracy, with a well-institutionalised rule of law, transparency, and accountability.This is a nation too with a constitution that doesnrsquot allow for a state of emergency during peacetime.In other countries where such a measure exists it allows their governments to impose tougher restrictions during times of crises, something many of them have done in their efforts to combat the pandemic.According to historian Lars Tragardh, of Ersta Skoumlndal University College in Stockholm, a strict law in Swedenrsquos constitution prohibits the government from meddling in the affairs of the administrative authorities, such as the public health agency.ldquoTherefore, you donrsquot need to micromanage or control behaviour at a detailed level through prohibitions or threat of sanctions or fines or imprisonment, Tragardh told the New York Times recently. ldquoThat is how Sweden stands apart, even from Denmark and Norway.Social solidarity among citizens is also a feature in this manestation of trust.ldquoIn Sweden, the path chosen may be less draconian but it is possibly more demanding, since it shts the burden from laws and policing to self-regulation, explained Tragardh in a recent article inexamining this trust between citizens and the state and among citizens themselves.Culture matters too in how any country reacts to a crisis such as the coronavirus ndash and Sweden is no exception.In an essay written for the New York Review of Books a few years ago examining why Sweden as a country so often evokes such a strong reaction, author Paul Rapacioli talked of the social precept in Nordic countries called Jantelagen, the law of Jante, a code of conduct which is said to restrain outward displays of success or excessive inidualism.ldquoIt is a reminder that you are no better than your neighbour. This may place an obligation of modesty on Swedes, but for Sweden itself dferent rules evidently apply, observed Rapacioli.ldquoIn ranking after ranking, whether the metric is social justice, democracy, press freedom, gender equality, rule of law, innovation, or sustainable development, the country consistently places in the top , and often in the top three, added Rapacioli, reinforcing Swedenrsquos reputation for often doing things dferently and well.Amid the seriousness of the situation, however, Swedes, like others where in the world faced with the coronavirus threat, have also responded with their own brand of humour.Currently the internet is awash with jokes about how naturally social distancing comes to the countryrsquos citizens and the many years in which they have been in training for just such a scenario.ldquoSwedes, especially of the older generation, have a genetic disposition to social distancing anyway, quipped former prime minister Carl Bildt recently, echoing the other widely held view that Sweden is,not coronavirus-proof, certainly naturally coronavirus-resistant.But all joking aside, while the country to date has stood out for its relaxed approach to fighting the pandemic, on Friday there were signs the government may adopt a tougher approach in enforcing social distancing guidelines after throngs of people headed for parks, bars and restaurants to make the most of the warm weather.Interior minister Mikael Damberg was at pains to urge Swedes not to let down their guard.ldquoIn some places and in some situations, the recommendations arenrsquot being followed, warned Damberg, while stressing that most people in Stockholm are acting responsibly.As many bars, restaurants and businesses this weekend remain open, le in the city, as my friend in Stockholm told me last week, ldquofeels strangely normal.For now, the Swedish government has held fast to its almost unique approach in tackling the virus, intoning repeatedly that it is acting according to scientic advice and data and not, it implies, according to the political considerations that are motivating some of Swedenrsquos neighbours and other countries.For the moment the countryrsquos ldquonew normal in the face of the coronavirus pandemic looks remarkably like the ldquoold normal.In tackling the pandemic on its doorstep, Sweden has certainly done things dferently.Whether it has done things effectively and well, time is yet to tell."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-missed-six-coronavirus-cobra-meetings-virus-spread-scotland","story":"The Sunday Mail revealed the First Minister skipped the crucial UK Government meetings and did not attend her first until March  -

The yoga postures we’ll be doing in the sessions bring some easy, relaxing movements for the body. Mindfulness allows us to be in the present moment rather than worrying about the past or future which can make it easier to accept change and to make the adjustments necessary to feel well.”Angela Mitchell, national director of Diabetes Scotland, said: “We are proud to have over  local groups serving communities across Scotland. Of course, not everyone can attend a group, especially now when we’re advised against all but essential trips out of our homes.“We had already planned to introduce digital peer support groups this year but due to social distancing measures we brought our launch forward.  Many people at home are feeling isolated and,you’re also managing a long-term condition like diabetes, it can be even more challenging. We want to support people with diabetes in any way that we can at this time. As well as online peer support groups, yoga and mindfulness, we also have a helpline, online forum and the Diabetes Scotland team can be reached as we continue to work from home.”Groups meet in private sessions over Zoom. Peer support group times are still flexible while a schedule is created to meet demand. Mindfulness and yoga will run on Wednesdays at pm and Fridays at pm for the next four weeks.Anyone who is interested in joining either peer support or mindfulness and yoga should email scotland@diabetes.org.uk to be invited to a group and given instructions on how to access Zoom .Guidance regarding diabetes and coronavirus can be found at www.diabetes.org.uk coronavirus or by calling the Diabetes Scotland helpline on    or emailing helpline@diabetes.org.ukcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This might included certain businesses being allowed to reopen where customers can safely stay at a two metre distance, and the reformatting of classrooms before pupils canto schools.The First Minister has advised that restrictions are likely to continue in some form for at least the rest of this year, and possibly beyond that.She added that the Scottish Government would be relying on the latest data to inform it of what the best approach for Scotland will be and explained that work to expand the nations testing capacity was ongoing. When asked about whether certain regions of Scotland might undergo a more localised approach, the First Minister said she wasn#t ruling out anything that might help us deal with the virus.#Today I am seeking to start a grown up conversation with the public about the complex decisions that lie ahead of us as we look beyond lockdown,# she said.“As we have done all along, we will seek to inform the public with the best scientic advice possible, but the science will never be exact and we are in uncharted territory so we also need to make careful judgements and be prepared to adapt and change course as we go.“We want to ease restrictions, but we cannot rule out having to reapply them should the virus run out of control.#Nicola Sturgeon said she and her colleagues would be relying on the latest data to inform them of what the best approach for Scotland will be and explained that work to expand the nations testing capacity was ongoing.“Every day we see evidence that this virus causes real harm, but so too do the lockdown measures we are taking to contain it,# she continued.#This is causing harm to the economy and living standards, to children’s education and to mental health and wellbeing.“That is why we need to try to find a better balance than the one we have now, but as we do so we cannot take our eye off the need to suppress the virus and minimise the damage it does.“It is only when we are sure the virus is under control that we can even start to ease any of the restrictions because the virus will not have gone away.#Nicola Sturgeon has advised everyone to take part in the conversation about how we might leave lockdown.

Until late last year, a suitable vessel proved dficult to source, said the council.It then became known that the Nordic Sea, which operated on a number of passenger routes in the far north of Norway, had become available.Following visits and sea trials involving Orkney Marine Services and Orkney Ferries staff, the vessel was considered as a suitable replacement for the Golden Mariana.As the Nordic Sea was operating under a Norwegian Passenger Certicate, it was known that a number of requirements would have to be met before she was considered ready for a UK passenger certicate.With surveys now completed and a works list developed, the decision to complete the purchase was made and the vessel departed Bergen for Orkney yesterday morning, Thursday.On arrival, the vessel was handed over to Orkney Islands Council, but due to Covid- restrictions and the need for some works to be carried out to bring her up to the full UK Classication and Certication, it will be a while yet before the residents of Papa Westray are able to benefit from their new passenger ferry.The purchase of the new vessel was part funded by the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland.More details in The Orcadian Marine Scene section next week.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

For urban wildle, which includes mammals and birds living alongside people in towns, this will affect levels of disturbance from humans and food availability.In recent weeks there have already been reports of animals adapting to the reduced human activity including Kashmiri goats roaming around Llandudno, North Wales, troops of monkeys in Singapore, wild boars in cities across Europe and Coyotes wandering streets during daylight hours in the US.Lead researcher Professor Dawn Scott, an expert in Mammal Ecology and Conservation, will use this unprecedented time to try to collect information and answer the study’s overarching question # How have urban animals responded to changes in human activity during the COVID- lockdown The research will collect records on any observations of unusual animal behaviour during the lockdown, determine the effects of reduction in human activity in city and town centres on urban wildle, and the effects increased human activity in gardens and outdoors space is having. The data from the survey will then be combined with other data from media searches to produce a report on the response of urban animals to lockdown across the globe.Professor Scott, head of the School of Le Sciences at Keele University, said: “Urban animals have been able to adapt to our landscape and live alongside towns, cities and suburbs so we know they are already highly adaptable. This flexibility in behaviour means they can usually quickly respond to changing conditions, including the absence of humans, which is happening during the lockdown.“Across the world we have seen reports of animals roaming cities and in locations that they wouldn’t normally be seen during the day. Social isolation is an opportunity for many to learn more about nature and how we can support it. We’re asking people to take part in our study and help us discover how urban animals are responding due to our change in behaviour.”To find out more and take part in the study visit: www.keele.ac.uk wildlestudycopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Considering his past record as a caring inidual, including his efforts to help the homeless, that was not really surprising.But apart from manager Daniel Stendl, who waived his salary, others at the Edinburgh club appeared reluctant to follow Naismith’s example. Reports later suggested that no other Hearts player would be asked to take more than a  per cent reduction.Also last week it was claimed that Scotland manager Steve Clarke had accepted a  per cent cut, simply meaning his salary would go down from £, to £,.In England the men’s and women’s international bosses Gareth Southgate and Phil Neville apparently agreed to take  per cent less. In the former’s case he would still be pocketing £. million while Neville would get £,.At club level south of the border the situation is very inconsistent. Some managers, such as David Moyes, Eddie Howe and Graham Potter have volunteered to take a cut while Pep Guardiola donated a million euros to help fight the outbreak in Spain. There was a terrible poignancy to Guardiola’s generosity a few days later when it was reported that his -year-old mother had died as a result of the virus in Barcelona.But while most Premiership clubs have placed most non-playing staff on some kind of temporary leave, some receiving  per cent of their salary through the government’s job retention scheme, the situation with the majority of players is still unclear.This is a dficult situation and UK health minister Matt Hancock ruffled some feathers when he suggested that well-off footballers should consider doing more to help.Some journalists have even criticised Hancock, saying he was completely out of touch with what was actually happening. That was unfair. The minister was not speaking about the game in general, where players at lower-level clubs are paid a pittance compared with those at the top. He was merely highlighting the fact that many could easily survive with no pay at all for the foreseeable future.To put this in perspective, most players at Premiership level are earning several million a year, an increase of roughly two and a half times what they took home six years ago. A high proportion are on more than £, a week.At the top of the tree are Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea and Man City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, who are on over £ million and £ million respectively.Even a player I confess to never having heard of, Tanguy Ndombele of Tottenham Hotspur, is reportedly bagging £. million a year.In the Championship the average annual pay is considerably less, around £, a year or £, a week. And in the lower League Two it drops to £ or £ weekly, not all that much above the national average.During the current situation all these figures need to be taken into consideration. We should have no issue with lower-paid players still getting  per cent of their wages for doing nothing. They, like everyone , still have bills to pay.But for the multi-millionaires to grumble about being hit is about as hard to take as the coronavirus pandemic itself.: : : : : : : :No decision has yet been made about whether the football leagues in the UK will be completed, whenever the action begins again.In Scotland it has been proposed in some quarters that the title should just be handed to Celtic, as the Glasgow side had an almost unassailable lead when play stopped.Now a director of the other half of the Old Firm has suggested thatthat happened, their rivals would only be able to claim “eight and a half” in a rowthey were crowned champions.Personally I feel that this season’s scheduled fixtures should be played out, however long it takes. Only then should the - action start, evenit means a shortened campaign.: : : : : : : :There are currently eight premier ision football clubs in Shetland, all of which have been in existence for dferent s of time.Scalloway are the oldest, dating back to , with Lerwick sides Celtic and Thistle being able to trace their beginnings back to the early part of the th century.Spurs and Ness United both emerged during the s, with Whitedale, Whalsay and Delting joining the senior league more recently.Someone suggested to me that a best XI from each could be selected, to give players and supporters something to ponder over during the current period of uncertainty.There will no doubt be controversy over this, but that’s what opinion is all about. If anyone would like to submit their thoughts, or their own ideas of what their respective best sides would be, feel free to send them in.Next time I will give you the line-ups, in alphabetical order, from the past  years.

It is expected to be pressed into service as soon as possible.Health board chairman said demand for testing on the Scottish mainland had seen tests take up to five days for processing.But having the kit on-island, he said, would see results turned round in a matter of hours.Mr Robinson said he recognised there had been a #hiatus# after initial testing coronavirus had stopped.#We recognised in NHS Shetland that capacity for testing was going to be an issue. Testing in Glasgow was going from  hours to five days.#I think we recognised there was a need to get something locally.# raquoNHS Shetland, like many other essential service providers, employs people whose parents and grandparents did now grow up in Shetland, or even in the UK. Let#s allow them, women and man alike, to be fully welcomed as valued members of our communities, with equal status.Let#s make the changes needed to fully include them and their families and so appreciate the strength in ersity that is their much appreciated contribution to modern Shetland, modern Scotland and modern Britain.Peter#s choice of poetry is particularly relevant during a week when British farmers chartered planes to collect  farm workers from Romania.The manager of the airline says he has already put in a bid for the next six flights.These Romanians form the first link in a long chain that magically re-stocks our supermarket shelves while we lie sleeping in our beds every night.For those with an apatite for further contemplation, I would recommend the following article:Thanks for the helpful and interesting link Malcolm. It almost makes a case for education in the humanities to be compulsory into adulthood!Reading it helped me to reflect on how dangerous it is for us to accept a narrow and rigid definition of what makes for a permissible #Shetlander#,and how important it is to reject the idea that some are entitled to more of a voice in that discussion than others.Those wishing to contest the need for such points to be made should first read Malcolm#s recommended article and then reflect on how recently a SMUHA squad featured a black-faced member of the NHS.As the article points out there is a prospect that this visus will not lead to more harmonious societies.The price of the peaceful cooperation we should wish for with all our neighboursis vigilance against those who would needlessly turn us against each other.Ilove how Peter and Malcolm appear to be so in veneration of each other, just a tad too preachy for me. As for #an education in the humanities to be compulsory into adulthood!# I would respectfully suggest a basis eduction in the STEM subjects would be of far more value to humankind. That way most would understand what a virus is, how a vaccine works. The sort of simple science stuff that lives depend on.Humanities educated, Like Boris Johson and Rees Mogg. Go for it, Peter!One hesitates to perturb so a warm a socialist embrace. However, re the linked article, any author who discusses Nazism and bigotry in one breath and then Trump, Bolsonaro and Modi in the next while omitting to mention China’s Xi Jinping or the North Korean monster, Kim Jong-un, is clearly peddling a dishonest agenda.It#s a wonder people #educated in the humanities# didn#t see that. Interesting.Having installed himself as president for le, Xi is reportedly responsible for the most appalling, vicious repression and imprisonment of a million Uighur people and the relentless destruction of their culture in China’s Xinjiang province. The “ View” is clear: “Speak out or be complicit.”“Without sustained pressure, the grotesque human rights abuses seen in Xinjiang will not just continue but intensy. The time to speak up arrived long ago. Countries should be shouting about this from the rooftops.”If you want a chilling reminder of Nazism, guys, look no further.Does anyone want to remind John the NHS is socialist in intent and inception Did he learnall this from the wonderful British Empire ,I wonder, so ,he is a poor apprentice.John Tulloch#s unwillingness to engage with the main points previously made is unsurprising.Have I missed something here  An article about testing equipment arriving in Shetland allowing results to be available in hours rather than days has very quickly turned into a debate about immigrants, racism, humanities -v- STEM Education and extreme left right wing politics. It’s not always necessary to find something to disagree about.@Stephen Johnston, I agree. That#s precisely why I hadn’t commented on any coronavirus item, here or where, until my above post. The coronavirus pandemic is a rapidly unfolding tragedy, a national and global emergency. Using it as a political football is completely inappropriate.However, there comes a point when people pompously touting their supposedly superior educations to bolster bogus arguments, endlessly stirring the pot of social ision and bitterness, must be challenged. Ideally, we would support those faced with tackling the crisis # at all levels # and keep our criticisms constructive. Or keep quiet and let them get on with it. Lessons can be learned later, with the benefit of hindsight, once all the facts are knownAs they say, # you won#t help, at least, get out of the way.#JT, straight from the right wing playbook# Tell them to be quiet. It#s an effective way to silence people # who could disagree that the coronavirus is a terrible tragedy after all  But#JT, How is the racism suffered every day for thousands of NHS staff not up for discussion  Why do you wish to silence that discussion Why don#t you deal with issue, rather than making a series of accusations and personal attacks What facts about racism faced by NHS staff are not known  Maybe not known to you, but lived by the people in the poem. Maybe for you racism and anti-immigrant sentiment is a political football to be put away until you see fit. But for the people who have lived with it through their lives, suffered because of it, it is a matter of day to day struggle. And yes, a political issue.When John declared that “People pompously touting their supposedly superior educations to bolster bogus arguments, must be challenged” I assumed that he was going to say something about Dr Mr Lt.Cdr Tinkler.For what it’s worth John, my own qualications are an HGV and PSV licence sothat’s what you regard as a superior education, you must have the mother of all inferiority complexes.Whenever anyone tries to bring up subjects like racism or social exclusion on this forum, the same few iniduals fly into an apoplectic rage and you, John, are always one of them.As someone once said:“If you won’t help, at least, get out of the way.”Malcolm Henry Johnson, O dear me, that chip on the shoulder. It was actually Surgeon Lieutenant Commander with  years training in Nuclear, Biological and ChemicalWarfare including triage and casualty care. I rejoice I never had time to waste on the humanities, more important work to do, like keeping people breathing.I know, tell me about it Ian. I for one would be fine without HGV drivers. In fact, I have been training our blessed grandson on how to handle a mule and cart . On a side note, I was exposed to radiation as a child in the s. The triage nurse was excellent and the radiation never did me any harm. So what I am saying is you are both valued by old John Thomas.I’ve often pondered the nature of predictability and wondered: What came first, the Surgeon Lieutenant Commander or the wind-up, clockwork toy To Peter Hamilton and John Thomas I say, thank you, for exemplying my point about using the coronavirus tragedy as a political football. Perfect.I hadn#t commented about NHS or care home staff. However, relatives of mine are currently benefitting from their work and their courage and conviction is truly admirable. Whatever their race or nationality, I heartily applaud it.Call me what you like. I won#t be drawn into an unseemly, polemic#Punch and Judy# food fight over the crisis by personal attacks. I invite readers to check my above points and judge for themselves.Have a nice day, boys.JT:#I won’t be drawn into an unseemly, polemic “Punch and Judy” food fight over the crisis by personal attacks. ##pompously touting their supposedly superior educations to bolster bogus arguments,#Pot meet kettle.

When the tide was out, it was a grey-sanded, multi-rockpooled, playground.The entire village could be found there on a summer’s weekendwhen it appeared that everything celestial had aligned just perfectly.Hang on, rose-tinted glasses being fetched.We changed into our trunks behind towels held up by impatient fathers, determined themselves to let the sun shine, however briefly, on pale skin that hid, perennially, under jumpers and boiler-suits, the unorm of the tweed-mill and croft.Our young horizons were beginning to broaden and, like every islander before us, the sea needed to be properly introduced.These were the halcyon, formative, summer days of my youth and I was a veritable Jacques Cousteau in black, knee-, wellies.We overturned large pebbles and boulders in the pools, discovering quickly the habits of their occupants and that the miniature world, whilst of huge interest and education, was but a microcosm of what lay beyond the surf crashing not too far away with its warning roar.It was a gentle build up to boldness.We were relatively safe and required little, or no, supervision: the worst that could happen to us was a graze from a slip on the rocks, or a nip from a, larger than was wise to attempt to corner, portainn .We learned which fish were ‘horned’ or awkward to handle and delighted ourselves when we managed to capture one in our hands.Everything was done with your pals.Some of us were more adept than others at this new ‘sport’ a lack of fear, and possibly consequences, proving hugely advantageous when it came to the ‘hunt’.We broke open winkles and limpets on the rocks and threw them, defenceless, into the bigger pools and waited and watched.We experimented and we learned.We filled jars and tin cans, wandered home with our capture, and learned the dference between salt and seawater when it came to aquatic le.Usually several days later from the smell in the shed.At the time it seemed like simply harmless fun, but it was just what generations previous had done before us, and it was preparing us for the serious business ahead.The menfolk of the village all had a bamboo pole which they used to fish ‘properly’ with. The trick was to keep it wet so it wouldn’t get brittle and crack, hence the best place for hiding, and protecting, it was usually in the waterone.You might have had some guttering, we had several waterones.The post office at Knock was the place from which to procure such an item and, yes, they did them in miniature sizes too.I watched in awe as my father rigged my first ‘bamboo’.Half-way up the pole he tightly bound one end of theof tarred sisal twine that he had precisely cut just below a protruding culm .The twine was then wound around the narrowing bamboo to the fragile tip.The tip needed to be light and flexible, for casting and for ‘feel’, but strong enough not to break under the weight of anything with scales or fins.He then expertly tied off a secure fastening at this apex, leaving a working portion of twine which was brought back down the pole and loosely bound.We were, I was told in Gaelic, ‘good to go’.‘Look after it !’, I was warned.Of course we weren’t allowed, immediately, to go to ‘the rocks’ on our own: there had to be some kind of schooling before we were let loose where the big fish swam andyou fell in you’d almost certainly drown.These were the early seventies in Lewis, and the only things that knew how to swim were the creatures that you so desperately wanted to catch.We were taken, yet again, to Shinigeadh where, when the tide was full, we had our very own ‘training pond’, full of cuddies, desperate to hit the frying pan.The bodach had attached a hook to the end of the twine with about a yard of monofilament and had spent low tide filling a bag with some bàirnich , which I’m pretty sure we referred to as maoraich .The walk down to the geo, proudly behind my father and uncle , rod over my shoulder, made me proud as punch.In hindsight, yes it was a graduation.Naturally it was a beautul summer’s evening , the sun was behind us and, despite the bay being filled with grey sand, the sea seemed blue-transparent and I swear I can remember seeing the fish shoaling and darting about, ready to tease us with nibbles and tugs, each one magnied to the size of something huge.Possibly a mackerel Plucking a limpet from the bag, my father swtly extracted it from the shell with a squeeze of the thumb.He tore off the working anatomy, the gastronomic bits of the gastropoda, and popped the rest into his mouth and chewed.Not for long just enough to soften the muscular foot of the newly despatched mollusc so that it could easily be stuck onto the end of my waiting hook.It was the one ‘trick’ that I was never to repeat.I was told about the dangers of fishing too close together , the dangers of standing too close together , the dangers of waving a rod around , the dangers of getting too close to the sea .There were dangers from wet rocks , danger from extracting a fish, no matter the size, from a hook when it was thrashing around, determined toto terra-fliuch , and danger, generally, from not paying full attention, at all times, to what was going on around me.Maybe not all at the same time, but, as the night progressed, and my schoolboy enthusiasm spectacularly combined with my schoolboy errors to make repetition often and necessary, I quickly realised that to mistake ‘playing’ with ‘fishing’ could have serious consequences indeed.I was, however, undoubtedly ’hooked’.From the moment that first vibration was transmitted from fish to fingers.I’ve often wondered about heredity and whether or not certain traits get handed down from previous generations.I’m certain that in many cases they do.But we all, certainly most boys of my generation, grew up with the hand-me-down skills of our fathers and grandfathers.I never met my father’s father, the original ‘Tomsh’.He died before I was born.As a long-line fisherman working out of Portnaguran, his was very definitely not the easiest of lives.The photographer James McGeogh, a former Glasgow policeman, married the daughter of his next-door-neighbour.He is well known for his stunning photographs of the guga hunters of Ness.He found time as well to capture many other images of ‘s Lewis, including one of my grandfather in his working gear.‘Tomsh’ here was the same age in it as I am now.Check out the missing digits on his left hand.Not that I would have ever dared to answer my father back, or not pay attention to his instructions at the rocks: but looking at that picture of his father, I’m pretty sure I know why the message stuck.We all had to start somewhere.I think I managed around a half-dozen cuddies that night.Though I had to get someone more experiencedto get these huge fish off my hook.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may

years ago on a beautul clear morning we were walking to the monastery on Eilean Chaluim Chille in the drained loch in front of Whitewave in Kilmuir.High up a plane flew over leaving a thick, white vapour trail, soon to be followed by another and another. I started counting them and by the time we reached the island, over  planes had flown across, each leaving a mark in the sky.The clear blue became hazy, and the afternoon never ed to the clarity of when we began our walk.These days in lockdown, as we experience this incredible weather we have the clarity which was lost that day.With few or no airliners flying over, the atmosphere seems sharper, brighter, and maybe pollution from industrial parts spreads worldwide and in the past, found its way over to us via jet streams and high air currents.This pollution seems now much reduced.The talk now is of exit strategies and how we end this lockdown. The term “other side” has been coined and was even used in last week’s very moving front page editorial.What will the other side look like There will be many in tough situations during lock down, and for many more the future will be uncertain, and much of the stress from that uncertainty will probably revolve around financial security.A new normal will have to emerge, and we might hope that it will be more sustainable, on all fronts, both locally and globally.Some say that it was Steve Jobs of Apple computers who turned wants into needs, and empires have been built in our commercial world by making desires into needs.There seem to be business models which require constant expansion or ‘biggering’, to use a phrase from the well-known Dr Suess’ children’s book ‘The Lorax’, which is warning of the consequence of continual industrial growth.It is always worth looking at nature, even when thinking of economy and industry.Diversity is healthy in the natural world, a healthy ecosystem has an element of sustainability, but within that system, things grow and die, and more importantly are eaten, nothing is wasted.Businesses will come and go, but the reliance on a single sector for a whole community could never be healthy.The tourists are unlikely to visit Skye in the numbers they have in the last few years, and perhaps never will again.There will be no ‘go’ button pressed after lock-down, and even next season is likely to be considerably quieter. We will have to learn to exist with the reduced numbers.There is risk in business, such is the way of it, and I suspect there was a perception that investing in tourism on Skye was a fairly reliable bet.Investing to meet the seemingly never-ending demand was something even banks might have been comfortable with. Looking back at the tourist season last year, maybe it just could not have continued growing and growing.Something had to give, it is just that nobody could have envisaged such a collapse, and for such a reason.Many of us are guilty of chasing the dollar, but is it for the dollars sake, is it for needs or wants, and what do we lose in the quest I used to joke about retiring to the city “where the pace of le is slower”. The cliché of getting a work le balance sorted is never more relevant.On my few travels into Portree, I have seen parents playing football with their children in their gardens. I have seen family groups taking their daily exercise, one group having a picnic on a small cnoc above the road, being together, enjoying time together.I have seen on social media, electricians proudly showing off their first loaf of bread, and a joiner with his first batch of home brew bottled. Is this reluctantly filling in time before we go back to normal, or is it learning new behaviours, new ways of being.Of course, we need the security of paying the mortgage, feeding our families, paying bills, but what are our real needs, and what have we been coerced into thinking we need During this lockdown, whilst we might have no income, many of us have been gted that incredibly precious commodity # time.As the air gets clearer, I would hope that as iniduals, communities and a wider society, we can take this opportunity to re-evaluate what is essential, what it is we need.We should look at our lives with the polished unpolluted lens of this lockdown period at what our values and real requirements are and decide what should be on the other side.I have sat on those planes that fly over, but the stars last night were simply stunning after the evening light had turned from orange to deep, deep blue.I think we need clarity on the other sideThe West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3087644.jpg--.jpg?1587546744000\n","title":"council takes lead on dog licence renewals with new text service","story":" Mid and East Antrim Borough Council has begun to send Dog Licence reminders directly to residents via mobile phone text alerts in a move that will provide dog owners with the opportunity to renew their licence directly online and that will see cost-savings being made in the process.The first reminder texts were issued to some dog owners whose licences were due for renewal in February.Council has traditionally issued First and Second reminder letters to almost , dog owners across the borough.

It was warm, dry and there was lots of chocolate.The lack of normality he now faces at home is a bit strange, Kit explained.You go away and you come back with all these grand plans to go travelling or something... he said.And then I found myself in a not too dissimilar situation than I was in Antarctica.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseKit Adams FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappKit AdamsBut he certainly sounds happy enough.It#s really not that bad, Kit said. You can still get outside, you can go for a run, you can do ious forms of exercise that I just couldn#t do in Antarctica so in many ways it#s easier.When we were in Antarctica it was  days before two of us left the island for the first time.He added: There are more opportunities here at home - you can go for a run or a cycle. I suppose it#s what you make of it, really.Although Kit, who has a Master#s degree in polar and alpine change, initially said it would be tough to single out the best bit of his Antarctic adventure, he subsequently revealed one special memory which will be hard to surpass.We got to kayak around the island on Christmas Day which was pretty special, he said.It meant that we could see the island from a dferent perspective.Recalling a December  like no other during his stint at the UK Antarctic Heritage Trust#s post office, Kit said he did not even miss not getting the usual turkey dinner.There was a little bit of snow on Christmas morning, then it cleared and it was a real blue sky day, he said. We started cooking the Christmas dinner and we had an offer to borrow kayaks from a ship that was in the area so we borrowed those, put the Christmas cooking on hold, left it on the hob and went kayaking around the island.Not many people ever get up close and personal to the penguin population, but Kit can now be counted among their number.The chicks are inquisitive and would go into buildingsyou left doors open too long, he said.Some of the adults are a bit less friendly, and more protective. But they#re fantastically funny to watch I don#t think you could ever get bored watching them and we were literally surrounded by them the whole time.Four months in one of the world#s most remote locations must be hard to follow. Asked what#s next on the agenda, Kit replied: I really don#t know.You can have all these grand plans and ideas and then a virus throws a spanner in the works.I wanted to see some places that I#d never been before. Now I#m sorting through photographs from being away.Kit said he would love to go back to what must be one of the coolest destinations he has ever visited.We#ll see how thing span out for next November, he mused.The trust has said they#ll be choosing people who#ve been before to go back ... so I#ll possibly throw my hat into the ring.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Bronagh O#Connell was speaking after the death of her parents Ignatiusand Mary .Mr O#Connell passed away on April , before his we died at their Strathmore Park home in north Belfast on April .They were laid to rest together on Monday in the village of Carrigart in Co Donegal, where they enjoyed many summers together.Mrs O#Connell was head of art at Dominican College, Fortwilliam, while her husband was principal of St Augustine#s secondary school on the Ravenhill Road before moving to St Joseph#s teacher training college.The couple would have been married  years this August, having met in the s while teaching in Ballycastle. They have two daughters, Bronagh and Aine.Speaking to the Belfast , Bronagh said that losing her parents in such a short period of time has left an indescribable void.We have a very small family and to lose an entire generation in one fell swoop is just overwhelming, she said.Bronagh explained that when the coronavirus outbreak began she brought both her parents to stay at her Randalstown home so they had less chance of catching it.However her father, who suffered from Alzheimer#s, began to develop symptoms of a chest infection and was prescribed an antibiotic by a GP.They were warned thatit had no effect within  hours then they must contact their GP again.Praising the GPs in Salisbury Medical Centre and the Covid- team from Grove Wellbeing Centre, Bronagh said they had gone above and beyond the call of duty.The GP said to get them back to their home in Belfast and they would take things from there after the antibiotic didn#t work, Bronagh added. They askedwe wanted to nurse them at home. My daddy had Alzheimer#s andthey both went to hospital we wouldn#t have been able to nurse them or visit them, and they would have died on their own.After arriving at their home in Belfast Mrs O#Connell developed the same symptoms her husband had just three days later, but she was in a much worse condition.Following the death of her father Bronagh was advised to be tested for Covid- and the result came back positive.Thankfully the community midwe is making a full recovery at home. Due to the current restrictions at funerals, only a few family members were able to take the long drive to Donegal, but with the roads being deserted Bronagh felt it was like the path was open for her parents to go to Heaven.I don#t think we have grieved at all yet, she added.You just do the al things, but mummy and daddy are constantly in our minds.There was a Mass but nobody was allowed to attend and the coffins weren#t allowed in the chapel at all.The priest told me that it was the first time in his professional le that he buried a husband and we together.Urging Stormont not to lt the lockdown too soon, Bronagh used her own family#s loss as an example of what can happen.We have no mummy and daddy and granny and grandad anymore, she said.I know people are restricted being in lockdown, but when I look at my mummy and daddy, they got sick and they went nowhere.I think when the lockdown is lted we will see a rise in deaths as people will go crazy.People aren#t abiding to the regulations as well as they should. If the lockdown is lted too soon we will have a pandemic.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Picture: Presseye FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappCemeteries start to reopen in Northern Ireland. Picture: PresseyeDavid YoungApril   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailPolitical leaders have welcomed the Executive#s decision to reopen cemeteries and burial grounds on a controlled basis so grieving families can visit the graves of their loved ones. The policy change was announced by First Minister Arlene Foster at a Stormont press conference on Friday.Graveyards were closed in March when coronavirus lockdown measures were first announced. Read More Church leaders say cemetery policy sht #the compassionate thing to do#Ulster Unionist leader Steve Aiken, whose party holds the Health Ministry in the Executive, said: I welcome this decision by the Executive to support the Health Minister Robin Swann in allowing what is a humanitarian act and a decision which will be welcomed by many bereaved and grieving people. It is of course vital that everyone continues to implement social distancing and stay safe.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood also endorsed the decision: The trauma of losing a loved one has been made more dficult by the lockdown restrictions that seek to prevent the transmission of Covid-. The suspension of our traditional way of marking a passing and processing grief has been very hard for many people to bear. I#m glad that the latest medical and scientic advice offers some relief for those seeking to visit loved ones and that we can permit the opening of cemeteries and graveyards with controls on social distancing. It#s a matter of regret that parties publicly moved to dferent positions this week before hearing the advice necessary to make a determination on this issue. This has caused signicant upset for many people. The Foyle MP said that it was important that people continued to follow the lockdown guidance. This is not a broad lting of the restrictions. We need to keep our guard up or more people will lose their lives unnecessarily.Read More Coronavirus: Timeline on graveyards controversyThe Executive made the change after Sinn Fein ended its opposition to the reopening of graveyards and burial grounds.Mrs Foster said: This is about balancing public health concerns with the basic human need for people to visit their loved ones# graves.But she warned: In lting this restriction, it is vital that members of the public heed the advice around going out in public when they are in a cemetery, respecting the two-metre social distancing rule, limiting their interaction with others, and of course washing their hands thoroughly after they have been in public. Mrs Foster said that following advice on social distancing and public hygiene had made a signicant contribution to reducing the peak of the pandemic.We#ve flattened the curve, but now is not the time to be careless, we are not out of the woods, she added.Glancing across to the Deputy First Minister, Mrs Foster continued: We both know that a lot is being asked of the bereaved at this time. But we would not be asking you to respect these restrictions were it not quite literally a matter of le and death.Sinn Fein had been opposed to reopening cemeteries, but faced intensying pressure this week from unionists, from grieving families who wanted to visit loved ones# graves, and from Church leaders.Deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill defended her party#s change of position, saying ministers had listened carefully to the distress of families.I understand there#s a fine balance and making sure that people do not face additional burdens in terms of their mental health and wellbeing and our role in making sure that people are not put at further risk from the transmission of coronavirus, she said. We recognised the comfort of visiting the grave of a loved one, and what that means to so many people. That#s why we had committed to keeping this issue of graveyards under review.We#ve listened very carefully to the genuine distress of families who have not been able to visit the grave of a loved one.The opening up of graveyards will be permitted where there are those in charge of burial grounds who can ensure we have compliance with the regulations on appropriate social distancing. The news came as it was learned that the Public Health Agency has recorded a further  Covid- deaths in past  hours here, bringing the total to , with , cases.It#s understood some Belfast cemeteries are to reopen from Sunday.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Lisburn woman Suzie Arbuthnothas been hosting weekly virtual cook-alongs on her Instagram page and YouTube channel alongside Belfast-based artist Aly Harte, BBC presenter Holly Hamilton, Cool FM breakfast show host Pete Snodden, motorbike star Jonathan Rea and recently retired Irish rugby captain Rory Best.The videos have been filmed in their own home kitchens and recipes featured to date have included #hidden# vegetable lasagne, chocolate sandwich cream, potato farls and Japanese pan-fried dumplings.Since being crowned the  champion of the primetime show back in February, Suzie has become a well-known local face.Beating fellow finalists Sarah Woods and Georgia Salamat to the title of Best Home Cook, she dazzled Michelin-starred chef Angela Hartnett and produce expert Chris Bavin with Mary Berry#s ultimate three-course dinner party.Her cooking skills were described as absolutely tremendous - and she now has plenty of spare time on her hands to share her secrets with fans.The self-employed accountant is currently in lockdown at her home outside Lisburn with her husband Steven , an A-level psychology teacher at Omagh Academy, and their two children, Odeliaand five-year-old Zander.As someone who is normally always on the go, whether it#s to the gym, hockey practice or choir rehearsals, Suzie admits that after four weeks of lockdown she is going stir crazy.I#m not used to being stuck at home and it has been quite hard to adjust, she said.I#m fortunate that my husband is still teaching [from home] and bringing in an income but my job has stopped as I can#t get out to see clients.

Four fellas landed and they were painting the living room and bedrooms. “One fella, who I had never met in my le, rang me and said ‘I’m here whenever you need’ so I told him to come on ahead. He landed with dust sheets, rollers, paint brushes and all the rest.  “Bradley’s furniture landed out with a lorry-load of furniture and kitted the whole thing out with brand new mattresses, beds, bedside lockers and all. “The smaller stuff was all made up from donations that people had given. Cloverhill Oil landed with  litres of heating oil and a local fella wired up the TV aerial free of charge.” Cllr Totten hailed the effort as a fine example of community cohesion and said the positivity had helped create a space for the healthcare staff to rest from the harrowing reality of Covid-.

The annual event was due to take place in venues across the city area next month but was cancelled due to COVID-. However, Council have instead put together a digital programme that will be broadcast as a live event on the City of Derry Jazz Festival Facebook each day from Thursday May th to Sunday May th - called the Virtual Jazz Festival…Sofa Sessions. People will be able to see and hear from their favourite bands and artists, as well as taking part in some jazz dance classes. googletag.cmd.push Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council Michaela Boyle said the online festival will help lt spirits. There is always such a buzz around Derry and the whole district when the Jazz Festival rolls around every year and while we will unfortunately have to miss out on that this time, I think this is a brilliant way of recreating a bit of that excitement and atmosphere in our own homes. Theres nothing quite like a bit of toe-tapping and catchy music to lt your spirits and ease les anxieties, and this revised online programme gives us all something to look forward to – which is exactly what we all need right now – and with over  artists and bands taking part there will be something for everyone to enjoy. googletag.cmd.push I want to thank Councils Culture Department for their hard work in putting this programme together. Im certainly looking forward to a bit of jiving and singing! Jacqueline Whoriskey, Councils Festival  Events Manager, said they felt it was hugely important to keep the festival going, albeit in a dferent capacity. The Virtual Jazz Festival… Sofa Sessions is an opportunity to celebrate artists from our own district and from all over the world, and we felt that now, more than ever, it was imperative that we find a way to do that. In putting together the programme we have made sure that local artists are well represented in line with the ethos of the festival. Its a really tough time for them, and for all of the artists and bands involved, given the financial hit that they have had to endure in the past few months. This is the th year of the festival, and although it will certainly be much dferent to any that we have had before, we were determined that it would go ahead in some form, and we hope tobigger and better than ever on our th anniversary next year.

Council members and senior management have been meeting regularly to review impacts on Council services, with daily updates on the changing response to the COVID- situation. It was decided that given the ongoing situation and all the guidance from health authorities regarding public safety and the restrictions regarding public gatherings it would be prudent to cancel at this stage.Announcing the decision, Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Councillor Michaela Boyle, said it was necessary to look ahead and be realistic about what events can safely be delivered over the coming months. I know this will be disappointing as these are both popular events and ones which positively promote health, wellbeing and fitness, she declared.But these are exceptional times and dficult decisions must be made for the greater good.Local people have been responding well to the social distancing advice and I know people will understand that under the current government guidelines regarding public gatherings, it would not be possible to host these events without making major changes to their format that would have a detrimental impact.By making these decisions at an early stage, we can avoid accumulating unnecessary costs and resourcing in terms of planning, and we will continue to review other major Council-led events over the coming weeks.We do however want to send out a strong message regarding exercise and its importance to both mental and physical health at this time. Council is promoting smaller exercise challenges – such as the Family Home k Run Walk on May  – and the online Friday Fitness Challenge, which people can do at home, in their garden or near their home. We will continue to explore other activities and programmes in the coming weeks which will enhance health and wellbeing and offer people the chance to exercise in a safe and fun way.Please take the opportunity to get together as a family and enjoy games and activities, and the extra time we are getting to spend with loved ones.The decision was taken by members during a virtual meeting this week where they were reminded that regulations set out by the Department of Health in their Coronavirus Legislation which came into operation on March  were still in place.The announcement follows on from the decision to cancel the City of Derry Jazz Festival and St Patricks Day programme in recent weeks. Council will continue to adhere to the requirements to keep premises and businesses closed, including burial grounds and cemeteries, and to adhere to the restrictions on movement and gatherings. However, it continues to explore alternative options for the public including the launch this week of an online Jazz Festival. The Virtual Jazz Festival… Sofa Sessions will be broadcast as a live event on the City of Derry Jazz Festival Facebook each day from Thursday May thto Sunday May th- called the Virtual Jazz Festival…Sofa Sessions.For more information on all the impacts on Council services in relation to COVID- please go to www derrystrabane  coronavirus googletag.cmd.push  googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Fireside selectors picking teams is one of Ireland’s national past times. This selection is based on players who took part in county senior, intermediate and junior finals -. It is based on the grade they were playing at that time. Five from each is selected. Just like putting five litres into a one litre jar. Here goes...  - Antoacutein McMullan For years it was the ‘big boot’ in defence who would do the kicking out. Distance was important. Now it has developed into an art form with the qualities being, a cool head, the ability to kick the ball through basketball hoop at a distance of  metres, safe hands and cat like reflexesrequired. Antoacutein has all the credentials. googletag.cmd.push  - Oisin Duffy A good defender is one that the forward hates playing against and the energetic Duffy was one of those prize assets. Firm in the tackle, virtually impossible to stop on the run and full of scores from his defensive position. His display in the Ulster Intermediate championship against Magheracloone, where he scored - from play, was exceptional.  - Brendan Rogers No player can change gear as quickly as the tall Brendan when he motors out of defence. He would excel in any sport and could play anywhere on the football field. A brilliant hurler as well. Seeing a forward chasing him with tongue hanging out is something were are used to. A real pleasure to watch. googletag.cmd.push  - Karl McKaigueThere is a famous film called the Quiet Man. Karl could be titled the quiet marker in defence. He has snuffed out some of the best forwards in the game and still manages to slip forward and get a point or two. Tackles the ball and not the man, so he rarely gives away frees. His anticipation of where the ball is going to drop is exceptional.  - Niall KeenanA neat and tidy footballer. His build would suggest corner forward material but he is actually a quality defender. Came through the minor and U ranks showing class all the way. His display at Croke Park in the  minor semi-final for Derry marked him as a player with a great future and he has lived up to that billing.  - Joe Gray Play anywhere Joewas the heart beat of Faughanvale teams for the most of two decades. He led a young team from the junior ranks to a solid intermediate outfit. Played and managed at dferent times and had a few games with Derry in the s. Has all the skills and a read dead eye free taker.  - Jimmy O’Connor Jimmy was ‘spotted’ by an Derry U scout when he was closer to  than . Now, nearer  than , he keeps up an amazing standard of fitness. Normally listed as a corner forward he is let loose to conduce the orchestra. Not the biggest but he makes light of that with his wide range of skills.  - Enda Muldoon Could have played on any team, in any era. Great hands and a master of the ever accurate foot pass. Always made the game look easy since he broke into a Derry minor team in . Now a qualied coach, passing on his skills to the next generation the youngsters could not have had a better tutor. A gentleman on and off the field.  - Mark Lynch From enthralling Croke Park in the  All-Ireland minor final, at the age of , Mark has continued to show quality. Stepped down two years ago after a long inter county career. Still the heart and soul of Banagher teams. He was exceptional in their senior championship run last year and the intermediate title a year previous. In his all round skills is the mastery of free taking.  - Michael McNaughtGrandson of the great Mickey McNaught who was on the Derry  National League winning team. His accurate left foot is one of the reasons why the Waterside men have become a solid force in Derry football. Can play midfield or half forward and seldom is below par. A very accurate free taker.  - Richard KingRichard broke into the Wolfhound’s senior team at the age of  as a corner forward. Now a commanding figure in the half forward line and an excellent free taker. Was a key figure in the treble winning junior team of . His rather harsh sending off against Red Hugh’s almost certainly cost Limavady the Ulster title. At  there is a lot more to come from this excellent footballer  - Enda Lynn Good enough to captain his county for two seasons. This man is a virtual scoring machine. Such is his dedication that he has been known to train on Christmas Day. His pace and tireless running makes him nearly impossible to mark. Missed a lot of action last season with an injury. Greenlough and Derry will be glad to see him back againthe action ever resumes.  - Paudie O’Neill Probably the best club footballer in Derry never to get a county call. Time after time, he would win games on his own for the Henry Joys. His scoring tallies were mind boggling but like a lot of good footballer had ongoing injury problems. A loyal club player he often played through the pain barrier.  - Kevin O’ConnorEvery year he postpones his retirement is another good year for Foreglen. From being an excellent half forward he now brings his deadly accuracy to the role of target man. A quite superb free taker who is always calm and measured. Played a leading role in their intermediate championship win last season.  - Conleith Gilligan Has to be one of the highest ever scorers in Derry club football. From his teenage years to his mid-s his quality never dimmed. Be it from frees or open play, he seldom missed the target. His pace and ability to be in the right place at the right time marked him as one of the best. His retirement left a huge void in the Shamrock’s attack. He is now passing on his skills to others.

He was impressionable. In September, he was listening intently to the wireless, as Derry launched their first bid for Sam Maguire. He wasnt just reliant on the radio waves to savour the magic. Twice a week, the Derry team would train in nearby Newbridge and he got to meet his heroes. Where the towns Credit Union now resides, John Joe Diamonds cafe was located on Bellaghys Castle Street. Tommy, now  years of age, vividly remembers the scene as his mother Cathy made plates of sandwiches for the players before they ed home, to the four corners of the county. googletag.cmd.push “When you get the county stars in your kitchen twice a week, I got to know them all well and I was friendly with them through the years,” Diamond begins. Sean OConnell would later train the Derry teams that Diamond would captain to All-Ireland glory. “I played with him too, hiscareer lasted a brave while...he mustve been  when he was still playing with Derry,” Diamond adds. When Bellaghy All-Ireland winning manager Harry Cassidy took charge at county level, he called Diamond into the senior  in the early s. He was part of the team that toured New York and Connecticut. googletag.cmd.push “We went out to play exhibition matches out there. It was an experience to get out there. We also won the Wembley Tournament two years in a row.” The semi-finals were played in the iconic stadium, with the final played out in New Eltham. “I was taking a look the other day and I think I have played in every county in Ireland,” Diamond added, of a county career that ended in . But it was the s, when he left his greatest imprint. *** In , Tommy was on Bellaghys first county U championship winning team and was a minor champion three years later. At county level, Derry minors had yet to reach an Ulster final. The first of Diamonds three years in the county minor team began in the closing stages of a game in Dungiven, with Antrim in the lead. “I remember being threw on as a late sub and two balls were kicked right over the full-back,” he recalls. “They landed in my hands and all I had to do was to kick them into the net and I think we won by a point.” After another season of consolidation, a place in the final again eluded them, but there was a crux of a team still eligible for . “We knew from , we had a good  and we didnt lose many,” said Diamond, who was made captain. When Derry defeated Tyrone, Donegal and Fermanagh on their way to the  minor league final, they did so without the St Columbs Derry players who focussed on winning the MacRory and Hogan Cups, under the management of former Fermanagh player Fr Ignatius McQuillan, just four years after tiptoeing onto the Ulster Colleges scene. “Then seven or eight of them came onto the Derryteam – which was some help,” Diamond added. “FrShields was the man who put the backbone into us and Sean , he put all the final touches to us, he was a great trainer.  Sean OConnell, Tommy Diamond and Fr Seamus Shields with the Tom Markham Cup “We trained twice a week up in Ballinascreen and after training we went into Timoneys for sandwiches and milk every night.” Aside from the medals and success, Diamond is grateful for the memories and friendships built up, that stood the test of time. “If any of us ever meet each other, it is a half day session. Thats the great thing about it.” They hammered Donegal in the  first round, in Dungiven, but the win came at a cost with a knee injury to Chris Brown. In the semi-final it was a dferent story and it was a narrow - to - win over Down, a game that saw Phil Friel sustain three fractured ribs. “We beat Cavan in the final in Clones,” Diamond remembers. “It was a hard, dour match and a typical Cavan match with hard hitting and not a lot of finesse about it.” Derry were Ulster champions and with the Hogan Cup now in the county, there was an air of quiet confidence as the squad headed to Croke Park. Diamonds first memory of their epic semi-final with Roscommon was giving the referee his name. “I was marking Dermot Early that day and we got booked after  seconds,” he laughs. “It was some start to a semi-final. I caught the ball and as soon as I caught the ball, he hit me. He was about two seconds late, I hit him with an upper cut and put him on the broad of his back and both of us were booked.” Derry were - to - winners and with the game in the melting pot in the second half, Early pulled a penalty wide of the posts when the Rossies were four points in arrears. “The great Miacutecheaacutel Oacute Muircheartaigh was commenting and he called it the game of the golden goals. Every one of them was hit in from  yards, absolute screamers.” It was time for one last push. Derry had one hand on the Tom Markham Cup. So too had Kerry. *** The Kingdom had the breeze and thanks to some wastefulness in Derrys attack, Kerry were a point ahead at the break. Sean OConnells pep talk worked wonders and the cogs began to turn. Tommy Diamond and Seamus Lagans performance at midfield helped them to a - to - win. “I dont remember an awful about it.” Diamond says. Earlier in the day, GAA President Alf Murray asked himhad his speech prepared with the customary lines of Irish, should Derry win. “I had no Irish, so he penned out the speech with the phonetics and I tucked it into the pocket of my shorts”. The speech mustve slipped out during the game and as he stood on the presentation podium, Diamonds pocket was empty. “I am the first man to just speak in English, I dont think it went down to well but I just had to go ahead with it,” he continued. The team stayed out in Portmarnock on the Saturday and Sunday night. Just recently Donal Mullan, son of county official at the time Paddy, handed Diamond a ticket from the post-final banquet. “The entrance admission was just  shillings,” he added. The homecoming on the Monday took nearly six hours, with crowds coming out along the route to salute the new champions. There were bonfires as the team crossed the county border. On the final leg of the journey, the victory cavalcade of cars coming to Maghera streamed all the way back to Tobermore. The Brackaghreilly Pipe band led John Mulhollands decorated lorry up Maghera street. “I remember being up on the top of the cab. They had a seat and I was tied into it and held the cup,” Diamond proudly beams. “It was some occasion for the firstchampionship to come into Derry.” Two years later, with Diamond still as captain, Derry won the Ulster U title before getting trounced by Mayo in the All-Ireland semi-final in Charlestown. “We were favourites for Ulster but we just werent ready for it ,” Diamond admits. “We were a year young and the next year we were all U and Sean OConnell was still in charge of us.” In , Derry swept all before them in Ulster, with only Down putting up any sort of resistance and Seamus McCloskeys - tally was enough to see off Monaghan in the final. Kerry came to Ballinascreen for the semi-final and trailed - to - at half-time, but had pegged the team back to a point midway through the second half. Diamond was switched to mark Brendan Lynch and a Kevin Teague goal helped swing the game in the home sides favour. Holders Mayo were shocked by Offaly in the other semi-final, setting up a Croke Park meeting with Derry. The Oaks led by nine points at the interval with the Faithful County down to -men after the dismissal of Eugene Mulligan, before easing to victory. He was the first player to captain his county to minor and U All-Ireland titles. But for Diamond,  was far from over. Despite playing three years for Derry minors, it took Diamond time to break into the Bellaghy senior team who would win seven titles during the s. He was dismissed, along with his brother Laurence, in the  semi-final win over Kilrea and missed the final. “Bellaghy had a strong  of players,” Diamond points out. “I only got my place on the senior team when Anthony Madden went to Australia and I got his place at right corner back.” There was nothing  only football and it is still the case. Karls son James is the first of his grandsons to play senior championship for the blues. The recent underage production line represents the hope in the new batch in the club. “They have the greatest facilities and have everything you would want and we have no team,” Diamond adds, referring to the -year gap since the John McLaughlin Cup rested in Bellaghy. “At that timewe had no facilities but we had teams....its a change of circumstances.” He picked up the third of eight senior medals in , but the Bellaghy adventure was only beginning. Once again, Diamond was involved in a first as the club were crowned Ulster champions in the first year of the competition. Frankie OLoane scored - in a  point win over Pearses of Belfast in the first round and it was followed up by a victory over a Newry Mitchells side that hammered Bryansford in the Down decider, thanks to goals from Sean Lee and Tom Scullion. Bellaghy beat St Josephs in the final, a combination of Ballyshannon and Bundoran, played on December  in the falling snow. “They had Brian McEnf and about  county men in total. They had a strong side and they actually, by right, shouldve beat us, but we were that dogged that day,” Diamond states. “It was a really cold day and we got a bit of a lead up against them. It was a rearguard action against the breeze in the second half but we held out.” There was no All-Ireland series until  when East Kerry won the title. Bellaghy retained their Derry title with a win over Slaughtneil in  before losing the final the following year to Newbridge. When they bounced back, it took them to their finest hour. A - to - win over Lavey saw them win Derry title number . In Ulster, they defeated Ballybofey, Ardboe and Teemore before taking on Armaghs Clann na nGael in the Ulster final. A - to - interval lead put them on their way to a facile win. In the All-Ireland series, it was a dferent story and Frankie OLoane was twice their savour. Tommy Diamond, Hugh McGoldrick and Chris Brown led from the half-back line against Portlaoise, but it was OLoane who tied the game late on, before Hugh Donnelly scored the winner in a - to - win. In the final, they took on the might of UCC and once again it took OLoane, with his seventh point of the game, to level matters late on. When Hugh McGoldrick broke up a Cork attack, Brendan Cassidy went on to score and the Tones were crowned All-Ireland champions. “Theyhad  county players, they were from all around. Moss Keane was full-back, he was a big tower of a man but Tom Quinn was too much for him.”   All-Ireland club - Tommy is on the extreme left of the front row Later that night, Cassidys lorry ferried the team up and down Bellaghy street to a heros welcome. Absent was the cup, as East Kerry didntit. “It is the sort of thing they cant take away from you,” Diamond said, of achieving the pinnacle of club football. He would later turn to management and managed Derry for  months at the end of the s, but stepped down after he felt the County Board were not allowing him full control of the team. Before that, at the start of the  season, Bellaghy were unable to get a senior manager, so Diamond put his name forward. The Tones went seven seasons without a title and werent tipped for glory. “Nobody wanted to take it. A lot of these managers, unless theyare good they are not interested at all,” he said. After winning the Derry title, Diamond took his side to Crossmaglen for the opening game of Ulster. After a battle, Bellaghy came out on top, but lost in the next round by a point at home to Castleblayney. “We shot in and shot inand Blayney went on to beat Burren in the Ulster final. I went to it in Dungannon, it was a dour match, - to -,” Diamond recalls, as Burrens quest for four-in-a-row failed. ”I said I would take themas far as I can, there wasnt much hope for them. We got them going rightly and I was disappointed we didnt win an All-Ireland with that team. I felt they were good enough.” *** Another passion is golf. He has been member of Ballymena Golf Club for  years, where he still plays with lelong friend Gerry McCann. He has been a member of Moyola, where he is now the Ranger.  Tommy andSeve Ballesteros Another friend of Diamond, Willie Cassidy, pulled off a coup in  by bringing Seve Ballesteros to play a round at the course, just months after he won the Masters. “I think it cost pound, to bring him to Moyola, he was number one in the world and Willie got him,” Diamond adds. “It is the only course in the north of Ireland I think he played on and I had the honour of caddying for him, I was the lowest handicapper at the club. “I marked his card, he countersigned it and it is up in the clubhouse for ever more amen.” A letime of memories. Aside from the current lock-down, the chat continues every Thursday night over the winter. Tommy plays cards with friends and his sons. It is a ritual. The social hub and the legacy of parents John Joe and Cathys cafe continues. RELATED - Derrys path to their first taste of September. Click here...

Every one of them was hit in from  yards, absolute screamers.” It was time for one last push. Derry had one hand on the Tom Markham Cup. So too had Kerry. *** The Kingdom had the breeze and thanks to some wastefulness in Derrys attack, Kerry were a point ahead at the break. Sean OConnells pep talk worked wonders and the cogs began to turn. Tommy Diamond and Seamus Lagans performance at midfield helped them to a - to - win. “I dont remember an awful about it.” Diamond says. Earlier in the day, GAA President Alf Murray asked himhad his speech prepared with the customary lines of Irish, should Derry win. “I had no Irish, so he penned out the speech with the phonetics and I tucked it into the pocket of my shorts”. The speech mustve slipped out during the game and as he stood on the presentation podium, Diamonds pocket was empty. “I am the first man to just speak in English, I dont think it went down to well but I just had to go ahead with it,” he continued. The team stayed out in Portmarnock on the Saturday and Sunday night. Just recently Donal Mullan, son of county official at the time Paddy, handed Diamond a ticket from the post-final banquet. “The entrance admission was just  shillings,” he added. The homecoming on the Monday took nearly six hours, with crowds coming out along the route to salute the new champions. There were bonfires as the team crossed the county border. On the final leg of the journey, the victory cavalcade of cars coming to Maghera streamed all the way back to Tobermore. The Brackaghreilly Pipe band led John Mulhollands decorated lorry up Maghera street. “I remember being up on the top of the cab. They had a seat and I was tied into it and held the cup,” Diamond proudly beams. “It was some occasion for the firstchampionship to come into Derry.” Two years later, with Diamond still as captain, Derry won the Ulster U title before getting trounced by Mayo in the All-Ireland semi-final in Charlestown. “We were favourites for Ulster but we just werent ready for it ,” Diamond admits. “We were a year young and the next year we were all U and Sean OConnell was still in charge of us.” In , Derry swept all before them in Ulster, with only Down putting up any sort of resistance and Seamus McCloskeys - tally was enough to see off Monaghan in the final. Kerry came to Ballinascreen for the semi-final and trailed - to - at half-time, but had pegged the team back to a point midway through the second half. Diamond was switched to mark Brendan Lynch and a Kevin Teague goal helped swing the game in the home sides favour. Holders Mayo were shocked by Offaly in the other semi-final, setting up a Croke Park meeting with Derry. The Oaks led by nine points at the interval with the Faithful County down to -men after the dismissal of Eugene Mulligan, before easing to victory. He was the first player to captain his county to minor and U All-Ireland titles. But for Diamond,  was far from over. Despite playing three years for Derry minors, it took Diamond time to break into the Bellaghy senior team who would win seven titles during the s. He was dismissed, along with his brother Laurence, in the  semi-final win over Kilrea and missed the final. “Bellaghy had a strong  of players,” Diamond points out. “I only got my place on the senior team when Anthony Madden went to Australia and I got his place at right corner back.” There was nothing  only football and it is still the case. Karls son James is the first of his grandsons to play senior championship for the blues. The recent underage production line represents the hope in the new batch in the club. “They have the greatest facilities and have everything you would want and we have no team,” Diamond adds, referring to the -year gap since the John McLaughlin Cup rested in Bellaghy. “At that timewe had no facilities but we had teams....its a change of circumstances.” He picked up the third of eight senior medals in , but the Bellaghy adventure was only beginning. Once again, Diamond was involved in a first as the club were crowned Ulster champions in the first year of the competition. Frankie OLoane scored - in a  point win over Pearses of Belfast in the first round and it was followed up by a victory over a Newry Mitchells side that hammered Bryansford in the Down decider, thanks to goals from Sean Lee and Tom Scullion. Bellaghy beat St Josephs in the final, a combination of Ballyshannon and Bundoran, played on December  in the falling snow. “They had Brian McEnf and about  county men in total. They had a strong side and they actually, by right, shouldve beat us, but we were that dogged that day,” Diamond states. “It was a really cold day and we got a bit of a lead up against them. It was a rearguard action against the breeze in the second half but we held out.” There was no All-Ireland series until  when East Kerry won the title. Bellaghy retained their Derry title with a win over Slaughtneil in  before losing the final the following year to Newbridge. When they bounced back, it took them to their finest hour. A - to - win over Lavey saw them win Derry title number . In Ulster, they defeated Ballybofey, Ardboe and Teemore before taking on Armaghs Clann na nGael in the Ulster final. A - to - interval lead put them on their way to a facile win. In the All-Ireland series, it was a dferent story and Frankie OLoane was twice their savour. Tommy Diamond, Hugh McGoldrick and Chris Brown led from the half-back line against Portlaoise, but it was OLoane who tied the game late on, before Hugh Donnelly scored the winner in a - to - win. In the final, they took on the might of UCC and once again it took OLoane, with his seventh point of the game, to level matters late on. When Hugh McGoldrick broke up a Cork attack, Brendan Cassidy went on to score and the Tones were crowned All-Ireland champions. “Theyhad  county players, they were from all around. Moss Keane was full-back, he was a big tower of a man but Tom Quinn was too much for him.”   All-Ireland club - Tommy is on the extreme left of the front row Later that night, Cassidys lorry ferried the team up and down Bellaghy street to a heros welcome. Absent was the cup, as East Kerry didntit. “It is the sort of thing they cant take away from you,” Diamond said, of achieving the pinnacle of club football. He would later turn to management and managed Derry for  months at the end of the s, but stepped down after he felt the County Board were not allowing him full control of the team. Before that, at the start of the  season, Bellaghy were unable to get a senior manager, so Diamond put his name forward. The Tones went seven seasons without a title and werent tipped for glory. “Nobody wanted to take it. A lot of these managers, unless theyare good they are not interested at all,” he said. After winning the Derry title, Diamond took his side to Crossmaglen for the opening game of Ulster. After a battle, Bellaghy came out on top, but lost in the next round by a point at home to Castleblayney. “We shot in and shot inand Blayney went on to beat Burren in the Ulster final. I went to it in Dungannon, it was a dour match, - to -,” Diamond recalls, as Burrens quest for four-in-a-row failed. ”I said I would take themas far as I can, there wasnt much hope for them. We got them going rightly and I was disappointed we didnt win an All-Ireland with that team. I felt they were good enough.” *** Another passion is golf. He has been member of Ballymena Golf Club for  years, where he still plays with lelong friend Gerry McCann. He has been a member of Moyola, where he is now the Ranger.  Tommy andSeve Ballesteros Another friend of Diamond, Willie Cassidy, pulled off a coup in  by bringing Seve Ballesteros to play a round at the course, just months after he won the Masters. “I think it cost pound, to bring him to Moyola, he was number one in the world and Willie got him,” Diamond adds. “It is the only course in the north of Ireland I think he played on and I had the honour of caddying for him, I was the lowest handicapper at the club. “I marked his card, he countersigned it and it is up in the clubhouse for ever more amen.” A letime of memories. Aside from the current lock-down, the chat continues every Thursday night over the winter. Tommy plays cards with friends and his sons. It is a ritual. The social hub and the legacy of parents John Joe and Cathys cafe continues. RELATED - Derrys path to their first taste of September. Click here...

They cant get enough credit. The leadership didnt faff about once Leo Varadkar signalled the need for a lock-down earlier this month. On a local level, clubs have rallied around their communities and provided direction on so many fronts. Last week they delivered the archive of All-Ireland finals to the world. What a brilliant gesture, following on from the terric coverage given by broadcaster TG. Struggling with the withdrawal from sport, for those who are fanatical about it, cannot be underestimated. Last week, it was great to take a look back at Derrys only All-Ireland title. Highlights aside, I havent watched the final - in full - since I was at school. googletag.cmd.push WATCH - All-Ireland final  Hammering Down in the first round was a statement of intent. A mauling that led Pete McGrath to admit, in the post-game interview, that Mourne fans deserved an apology. The gesture didnt sit well with the Down players. Monaghans Gerry Mone gave Derry a torrid time in the Ulster semi-final at Casement before Joe Brolly came from the bench to give the spark needed for victory. The Ulster final saw Damian Cassidy gracefully skating over the puddles in Clones, in a game the Derry players were going to win, come hell or high water. It took a late block by Tony Scullion on Manus Boyle and Brian McGilligans intervention to deny Donegal another goal chance, when they had crafted a two on one situation. googletag.cmd.push In the All-Ireland semi-final, it wasnt until Johnny McGurks wonder pressure point that Derry would eventually rest easy against the Dubs in the season-defining clash. Anthony Tohills outstretched arms of celebration before Joxers kick went over the bar will always stick in my mind. The branch of the Derry Supporters Shop at the top of Hall Street in Maghera was thronged with people in the lead-up to the final. There was so much expectation that Sam wouldon the Monday evening. In a powerful video interview with Shane Stapleton on #OurGame, Tony Scullion touched on how he felt the wave of emotion was almost congratulating them as they departed for the final. It was a Cork team that hammered a poor Mayo outfit in the semi-final, I thought. With hindsight and on watching the final, from someone outside the camp, the mental strength was Derrys greatest asset that day. Cork had nine players who had played in an All-Ireland senior final. They had played in five, winning two and losing twice, once after a replay. Derry, while being the upcoming team and having dispatched the  and  champions on their way, they were untested on the biggest day of the season. HAMMER BLOW From my position on the Hill that day, I can still see Joe Kavanaghs number  jersey cutting through the Derry defence before hammering past the advancing Damien McCusker. It was the first goal Derry had conceded since June , that sunny day in Castleblayney when Derry fans applauded Monaghan scoring their only point of the first half. In the second half, three Farney goals had Oakleafers shaking, before getting out with a draw. Kavanaghs goal brought me back to that day. Derry never do anything the easy way. Colin Corkery won the first two balls off Gary Coleman, John ODriscoll beat Tony Scullion to an early possession. Corks running game had Derry in all sorts of trouble. Fergal P McCusker and Henry Downey couldnt get to grips with Don Davis and Joe Kavanagh respectively. When Derry eventually went on an attack, Mark OConnor won the first battle with Seamus Downey. Derry were - to - in arrears. Was Derry going to fail the final hurdle again  Brian McGilligan then won a vital possession at midfield. It was small, yet massive. Later in the attack Damian Bartons trademark disguised hand pass - where he looked one way and gave the ball the other - found Johnny McGurk who fired over Derrys first point of the game. It took a series of Cork mistakes to swing the momentum. Teddy McCarthy dropped a routine pass from Niall Cahalane and McGilligan curled between the posts. The now dominant Tohill hoovered up a loose Teddy McCarthy pass before going on a storming run to win a free and Gormley slotted over. The Oaks were now only two points in arrears and growing in confidence. McGilligan turned the screw even tighter. John Kerins had been targetting Barry Coffeys height advantage over Johnny McGurk on his kick-outs. Across came McGilligan to win a ball he had no right to. It was inspirational. The big man launched a pass forward that eventually found Damian Cassidy. Cass swung a ball into the square. Seamus Downey made up the guts of  metres to take advantage of a mix-up between Kerins and OConnor, before punching to the net. Boom. Derry were on top. Heaney nearly beat Kerins to the ball for a further goal chance and, earlier, the Cork stopper made a brilliant save to deny Cassidy. Then referee Tommy Howard made two wrong calls. Cahalane buried Enda Gormley off the ball and got off with just a lecture. Seconds later, Tony Davis was harshly sent off for a lazy lunge at Dermot Heaney, with Howard gesturing the use of an elbow. It was the wrong call. The narrative was always that the punch woke Enda up. Thats harsh I feel. There was very little ball directed into his corner before that. Everything went thought Brolly. However, it lit a fire and Gormley went on to score six points. Derry twice led by three points and when Dermot McNicholl curled over, after the interval, it shouldve been the catalyst to push on. Brolly was toasting Brian Corcoran and shouldve been used more. John ODriscoll started the second half at wing forward, with Colin Corkery in on Tony Scullion. But when Don Davis inch-perfect pass took out the entire Derry defence, ODriscoll drilled to the net and Cork were ahead. Thats where the Derry resolve was again tested. And they passed. There was no sign of panic. McGurk was allocated the extra-man role. Fergal P McCusker, Henry Downey - and later McKeever – ran the show in defence. With the extra man, Damien McCuskers outfield experience saw him use short kick-outs before they were even invented. For all their control, they failed to ask any questions of Derrys defence, but when Gormley levelled the game, the Ulster champions superior fitness carried them into the three point lead. Even then, Derry did it the hard way. With Steven OBrien now at full-forward, Cork began to throw the dice for the last time. If every the term getting over the line was used, then this was all so relevant. Derry had performed better on other days during the Eamonn Coleman era, but winning was the only thing. Failure wasnt an option and they refused to be denied their moment of glory. It was richly deserved. Its just a pity there was no back door and that Eamonn was controversially sacked. This group had so much more to offer. RELATED - Sideline View wants Derry to fast forward.Click here...

A mauling that led Pete McGrath to admit, in the post-game interview, that Mourne fans deserved an apology. The gesture didnt sit well with the Down players. Monaghans Gerry Mone gave Derry a torrid time in the Ulster semi-final at Casement before Joe Brolly came from the bench to give the spark needed for victory. The Ulster final saw Damian Cassidy gracefully skating over the puddles in Clones, in a game the Derry players were going to win, come hell or high water. It took a late block by Tony Scullion on Manus Boyle and Brian McGilligans intervention to deny Donegal another goal chance, when they had crafted a two on one situation. googletag.cmd.push In the All-Ireland semi-final, it wasnt until Johnny McGurks wonder pressure point that Derry would eventually rest easy against the Dubs in the season-defining clash. Anthony Tohills outstretched arms of celebration before Joxers kick went over the bar will always stick in my mind. The branch of the Derry Supporters Shop at the top of Hall Street in Maghera was thronged with people in the lead-up to the final. There was so much expectation that Sam wouldon the Monday evening. In a powerful video interview with Shane Stapleton on #OurGame, Tony Scullion touched on how he felt the wave of emotion was almost congratulating them as they departed for the final. It was a Cork team that hammered a poor Mayo outfit in the semi-final, I thought. With hindsight and on watching the final, from someone outside the camp, the mental strength was Derrys greatest asset that day. Cork had nine players who had played in an All-Ireland senior final. They had played in five, winning two and losing twice, once after a replay. Derry, while being the upcoming team and having dispatched the  and  champions on their way, they were untested on the biggest day of the season. HAMMER BLOW From my position on the Hill that day, I can still see Joe Kavanaghs number  jersey cutting through the Derry defence before hammering past the advancing Damien McCusker. It was the first goal Derry had conceded since June , that sunny day in Castleblayney when Derry fans applauded Monaghan scoring their only point of the first half. In the second half, three Farney goals had Oakleafers shaking, before getting out with a draw. Kavanaghs goal brought me back to that day. Derry never do anything the easy way. Colin Corkery won the first two balls off Gary Coleman, John ODriscoll beat Tony Scullion to an early possession. Corks running game had Derry in all sorts of trouble. Fergal P McCusker and Henry Downey couldnt get to grips with Don Davis and Joe Kavanagh respectively. When Derry eventually went on an attack, Mark OConnor won the first battle with Seamus Downey. Derry were - to - in arrears. Was Derry going to fail the final hurdle again  Brian McGilligan then won a vital possession at midfield. It was small, yet massive. Later in the attack Damian Bartons trademark disguised hand pass - where he looked one way and gave the ball the other - found Johnny McGurk who fired over Derrys first point of the game. It took a series of Cork mistakes to swing the momentum. Teddy McCarthy dropped a routine pass from Niall Cahalane and McGilligan curled between the posts. The now dominant Tohill hoovered up a loose Teddy McCarthy pass before going on a storming run to win a free and Gormley slotted over. The Oaks were now only two points in arrears and growing in confidence. McGilligan turned the screw even tighter. John Kerins had been targetting Barry Coffeys height advantage over Johnny McGurk on his kick-outs. Across came McGilligan to win a ball he had no right to. It was inspirational. The big man launched a pass forward that eventually found Damian Cassidy. Cass swung a ball into the square. Seamus Downey made up the guts of  metres to take advantage of a mix-up between Kerins and OConnor, before punching to the net. Boom. Derry were on top. Heaney nearly beat Kerins to the ball for a further goal chance and, earlier, the Cork stopper made a brilliant save to deny Cassidy. Then referee Tommy Howard made two wrong calls. Cahalane buried Enda Gormley off the ball and got off with just a lecture. Seconds later, Tony Davis was harshly sent off for a lazy lunge at Dermot Heaney, with Howard gesturing the use of an elbow. It was the wrong call. The narrative was always that the punch woke Enda up. Thats harsh I feel. There was very little ball directed into his corner before that. Everything went thought Brolly. However, it lit a fire and Gormley went on to score six points. Derry twice led by three points and when Dermot McNicholl curled over, after the interval, it shouldve been the catalyst to push on. Brolly was toasting Brian Corcoran and shouldve been used more. John ODriscoll started the second half at wing forward, with Colin Corkery in on Tony Scullion. But when Don Davis inch-perfect pass took out the entire Derry defence, ODriscoll drilled to the net and Cork were ahead. Thats where the Derry resolve was again tested. And they passed. There was no sign of panic. McGurk was allocated the extra-man role. Fergal P McCusker, Henry Downey - and later McKeever – ran the show in defence. With the extra man, Damien McCuskers outfield experience saw him use short kick-outs before they were even invented. For all their control, they failed to ask any questions of Derrys defence, but when Gormley levelled the game, the Ulster champions superior fitness carried them into the three point lead. Even then, Derry did it the hard way. With Steven OBrien now at full-forward, Cork began to throw the dice for the last time. If every the term getting over the line was used, then this was all so relevant. Derry had performed better on other days during the Eamonn Coleman era, but winning was the only thing. Failure wasnt an option and they refused to be denied their moment of glory. It was richly deserved. Its just a pity there was no back door and that Eamonn was controversially sacked. This group had so much more to offer. RELATED - Sideline View wants Derry to fast forward.Click here...

Michael McWilliams writes a weekly column in the Irish News called Dodgy Tackle. For this weeks column, which is in todays Irish News, McWilliams puts forward his best ever team. The criteria for selection is based on the premise that his World XI must be made up of up of players from dferent countries who have never played for the same club sides. McWilliamssfinal selection includes many of the worlds best known footballers - and our very own Felix Healy. googletag.cmd.push His full line-up is: Manuel Neur , Junior , Paul McGrath , Paolo Maldini , Felix Healy , Paul Gascoigne , Dragan Stojkovic , Zinedine Zidane , Kevin de Bruyne , Kenny Dalglishand Diego Maradona . Explaining his choice of Healy in the midfield, McWilliams states that it was a straight fight between the Derry man and the Colombian World Cup Carlos Valderrama. He writes: Carlos Valderrama nearly went in here, but when it comes to moustachioed midfield fulcrums, the Derry man gets in on a dodgy decision. And it is Dodgys decision. Hes playing at the base of the Diamond. Just across from the Sandwich Co. Pulled the strings for an early eighties Coleraine side that delighted this young fan, all shimmies and subtlety. The only things hairier than his upper lip were the legs bulging out of a pair of royal blue Adidas hotpants, briefly ditched for a pair of white ones as he led the Honduras midfield a merry dance for  thrilling minutes at the  World Cup. Swapped blue and white stripes for Candy ones later in the decade and a treble was duly delivered. Can now be seen leading punters a merry dance in music venues across the north-west. googletag.cmd.push And McWilliams had a message for anyone who believes that Colombian star Carlos should have got in to his side ahead of Healy. You can stick your Valderrama up your Bogside, he writes.

In addition, another  food parcels were delivered by last Friday.Local council officials have been working in partnership with their colleagues across local government, health trusts and the Department for Communities to set up the hubs.Down Leisure Centre has been transformed into a processing centre to organise deliveries, with other sites currently being identied should they be required, with staff working in split shts, while observing social distancing and other safety protocols.The new service covers the councilrsquos seven even district electoral areas with deliveries focusing on food supplies with the packages including items such as tinned and dried food, cereals and some essential toiletries.Requests for help from the council and its community and voluntary partners are arriving via Access NI which is processing calls from across Northern Ireland on a freephone helpline.Council chairman Charlie Casey says he is pleased to see just how many of the districtrsquos most vulnerable residents have been able to receive food parcel deliveries recently.ldquoOur sincere thanks go to all our partners who worked with us over the Easter break to achieve this and all the volunteers who have already kindly offered their help, he continued.ldquoIt is important that we provide a leline to those following medical advice to shield to protect their health, or who are self-isolating, and have no other means of assistance.The council chairman said that during the local authorityrsquos COVID- response, it will continue to work hard to deliver essential supplies to those who need them and ensure no-one feels alone or isolated at this dficult time.A COVID- community helpline is operational, with those in vulnerable groups seeking support asked to make contact between am and pm, seven days a week, with the helpline managed by Advice NI who are processing calls from across Northern Ireland.The Freephone number is   , while the email is covid@adviceni.net.

Therersquos plenty like me and we are all in the same boat.ldquoIt started when I received requests from nurses who I made their wedding or bridesmaid dresses in the past for. I ended up making scrubs for some entire hospital wards, male and female and in a iety of sizes.ldquoThat widened out to sewing for staff at local nursing homes. I just want to do something to help, particularly for nursing homes as my daughter, Abigail, works in one in Castlewellan.There is plenty of work to be done to complete her bridal orders, but Mrs Moorhead feels that her priority is for scrubs.ldquoMy weddings have been pushed back until October or November or even next year. There are things that would hamper me. I canrsquot see brides to fit them and I wouldnrsquot want to go too far ahead with orders in case some people gain weight or lose weight, she said.ldquoAlso,the wedding changes seasons, that can change the outfit ordered in style and colour. For instance, a mother of the bride might want a jacket as well or might want to lose or shorten sleeves so I feel I canrsquot go to far ahead with my orders. Brides have needed me to reassure them that everything will be alright for their big day, whenever it happens, and I can absolutely promise that.ldquoAbigail is getting married in November and her sister, Johanna, is getting married next May, so they will be the most special wedding dresses I will make in my letime. I feel that I have to keep going with the scrubs as itrsquos so important. However, I will make sure that I will provide all outfits that have been ordered from me. It has become a family affair as Mrs Moorheadrsquos husband, Joe, who also is unable to work as an engineer in the lockdown, helps with the pressing of the garments while Johanna helps with the sewing.Mrs Moorhead has been creating the scrubs from donated material, much of it brand new, and is very grateful for the donations..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd April 2020 Crossgar.jpg","title":"Crossgar man takes Chance with move to Hong Kong 26 years later opens superstore  ","story":"AT the age of  and without a word of Cantonese, Richard Bowsie left his family and friends behind in his home village of Crossgar for a le of adventure in Hong Kong.Twenty-six years later and now a married father of two, Richard has found love, happiness as well as a successful career as the owner of two second-hand furniture stores in the huge cosmopolitan city with over seven million inhabitants.He and his locally-born we, Mavis, run nd Chance Furniture that provides shoppers in the city and online across the world a virtual Aladdinrsquos Cave with thousands of unique and affordable items - ranging from lacquered tables to pool tables, Chinese vases to Balinese drums.While other young ambitious men were told to lsquogo westrsquo, Richard went east, finding Hong Kong to be every bit as much the land of opportunity as the United States.The father of eight year-old daughter Kailey and son George, whorsquos coming five, literally changed his le in three days when he made the decision to fly to Hong Kong.From working as a leguard at the Tropicana centre in Newcastle and at the former Down Leisure Centre, the former student of the High School, Ballynahinch, had been close to completing his BTec qualication in Leisure Management at the former Newcastle College of Further Education.He ped out of his course a few months shy of graduation due to bullying. While his parents, Margaret and Ken, a well-known architect, were shocked at their middle sonrsquos decision, they were not surprised.He recalled: ldquoI had a friend who had travelled to Hong Kong three months previously. During a phone call he told me that the new international airport was under construction and work was easy to find. Three days later I arrived.ldquoI decided to go by myself as I had been trying to find an exciting job at home for a while but kept being told I was too young for the roles or lacked experience. My parents knew I was ambitious and how frustrated I was becoming with my career ambitions being knocked back all the time.Richard admitted he hadnrsquot a clue what to do once he arrived and took a bar managerrsquos job as an interim position as many of the airport workers drank there.His first job at the airport turned out to be with the Northern Ireland company, Lagan Construction Group, before going to another Belfast-based company, Rotary International, with which he worked for two years.ldquoI felt excited and nervous all at the same time when I first moved to Hong Kong, said Richard.ldquoThe first thing that struck me was the heat, after leaving cold and damp of home. Arriving in  degrees and high humidity was certainly a shock to the system, despite having been on family holidays to France most years with my family and once to America with a cross community group. The heat in Asia was a massive shock.Having grown up in a rented manse on the Rademon estate, Richard swapped a quiet rural existence for the hustle and bustle of the global port and major commerce centre. It was still under British rule and would remain so for another three years before it was handed back to China.Richard said: ldquoLanguage was the biggest shock but I made it my mission to learn the language and enrolled in YMCA lessons but also managed to pick it up from also working alongside locals.It wasnrsquot long before Richard felt confident enough to start out his own business, an electrical supply company which employed  staff.He said: ldquoI knew after the first few months that Hong Kong was going to work for me,you worked hard, nothing could hold you back, age was not an issue here. Opening a business here was very straight forward, just need a bank account and register an address.He met his we Mavis during his first month in the city and the two have been together ever since.They opened their first store in  in the after seeing a large amount of good furniture being thrown away each week and were determined to do something that would reduce the waste and help the environment. Within months, they had outgrown this store and relocated to their current , sq ft premises in Tuen Mun.The couple has recently opened a second, , sq ft premises in Chai Wan which is closer to the busy capital.Fluent in Cantonese for many years, Richard has seen Hong Kong go through many challenges, not in the least with the recent coronavirus pandemic.ldquoHong Kong has handled the virus very well, having been through SARS and bird flu before, said Richard. ldquoAs soon as we heard there was an issue over the border in China, Hong Kong went straight into prevention measures before even being advised to. Now everyone wears masks and observes hygiene measures.The preventative measures must have been successful as the city recorded zero deaths on Monday for the first time since the outbreak before Christmas.While the move to Hong Kong was the right one for Richard, he still misses home and his brothers and sisters, Simon, Gillian, Laura and William.He said: ldquoI miss the food, the greenery and, of course, my family who are all still in Northern Ireland. I miss being close to home as I have lost family members and grandparents.ldquoBut we come home as often as we can. Mavis and the kids love Crossgar, especially AJs Diner. They love the Rademon estate where we lived beside, walks down the Church Road to Kilmore and the open green fields. We have very few here in Hong Kong and any we do have are full of mosquitos.Home is always on Richardrsquos mind, as is his business.He adds: ldquoNext for our business is hopefully more expansion as I would like to start exporting furniture to other countries such as Northern Ireland.

Mr James said bluntly yesterday:ldquoThere are people who had an opportunity to say things at an early stage but did not. Now they have really pulled the carpet out from under our feet at an advanced stage. Irsquom bitterly disappointed at this kind of timing.The problem arose when the Housing Executive was in the final stages of preparing a scheme, which has been on the drawing board for several years, when it was told of the Government objections to a number of potential sites, including the Burren River catchment area and another, the most important, at the Dundrum Road end of the town.The Executive had finally got an agreement to purchase from the landowner of the Dundrum Road site and had made a final routine check with the Government departments before clinching a deal.

They have agreed with us that the water which they required was not there and this scheme would have caused serious ecological damage.Confirmation that the objectors had won the fight over the Kinahalla scheme came on Friday, when the Environment Minister, Mr Philip Goodhart, said his department had accepted the findings of the Commission which came out against the pound. million project.News that the Commission had recommended the scheme should be ped was leaked last month.

It is also my understanding that Newry, Mourne and Down Council and Northern Irelandrsquos other  councils are working closely alongside the government department at this time.Cllr Walker said he would like to see the recycling centres open again, suggesting that strict controls could be introduced to only allow two vehicles access them at any one time.ldquoI would also appeal to people at this time to keep their waste until the recycling centres are open again. I appreciate that many people who are not at work at the moment are making the most of the time they have to clean out their homes, sheds and garages and I commend them for being active.ldquoHowever, it simply isnrsquot on to load up you car with waste, drive to a secluded area and dump it. I just donrsquot understand the mentality of people who engage in this kind of behaviour.Cllr Walker also said the cost of clearing up illegal waste is borne by the districtrsquos ratepayers.ldquoWe have the ironic situation that those who dump their waste illegally end up paying for its removal viatheir rates. This beggars belief, he declared. ldquoThe stupidity of those who dump waste in secluded areas is beyond me.Cllr Walker added: ldquoThe time has come for common sense and people really need to catch a grip of themselves. One of the most worrying aspectsof illegal dumping is that waste which ends up in fields is sometimes eatenby livestock which often results in deadly consequences. To those who dump their waste illegal my appeal is stop now.The local council has confirmed that it is receiving increasing reports about fly-tipping across the district since the start of the COVID- crisis. But the organisation insists that it is currently able to manage the issue within existing resources.A council spokesman said that the organisation continues to work closely with the Environment Agency which also performs a key role in addressing incidents of larger illicit dumping.On the issue of reopening the districtrsquos household recycling centres, the spokesman explained that the decision is continually being reviewed in line with government social distancing measures.He continued: ldquoFly-tipping is illegal and the council will strictly enforce this where evidence can be gathered. Responding to fly-tipping incidents also erts important council resources away from providing other essential services.The spokesman confirmed that the council is unable to remove illicitly-dumped waste from privately-owned land, explaining that where this occurs, both it and the Environment Agency has the legal powers to request its removal.He said the council will enforce this where required.The spokesman added: ldquoThe council would urge the public to avoid producing any unnecessary waste, including undertaking DIY and house and garden clearances at this time due to the considerable pressure being placed on public services.ldquoAny additional waste that is produced should be stored for future disposal at the household recycling centres once they re-open.

In a glittering playing career, the Ballykinlar man went on to win two more All-Ireland medals and established himself as one of the legends of the Gaelic football. Here, he selects his greatest Down team of all timeHIS name alone is enough to rekindle treasured memories of a time when Down football reigned supreme.Paddy lsquoMorsquo Doherty had the deadliest left foot in Ireland and he used it to maximum effect as Down swept all before them.Incredibly, itrsquos  years ago that Down took the sporting world by storm when they defeated Kerry to win the All-Ireland senior football title for the first time. It was also the first time that a team north of the border had won the Sam Maguire Cup.To reinforce their emergence as a new power in Gaelic football, Down retained their title the following year with Paddy as captain of the side which defeated Offaly and he was also a member of the Down team which won a third All-Ireland for the county in , Kerry again falling victim to the Red and Black machine in the final.As well as his three All-Ireland medals, Paddy won seven Ulster Championship, seven Railway Cup and three National League medals. He was the leading scorer in Ulster for eight seasons and in Ireland for three years.Now in his s, hersquos followed Downrsquos fluctuating fortunes ever since, relishing in theof the glory days in the early s, sharing in the disappointment of the barren times and casting a critical eye from the sidelines, though always with the optimistic outlook of the true fan.So what does he believe is the greatest Down team of all time Not surprisingly, given their accomplishments, hersquos largely selected his choice from his team-mates from the Sixties mdash though with typical modesty, he has not picked himself for the starting .ldquoYou have to remember that the Down team of s was the first to bring the Sam Maguire over the border, he says.ldquoThat was a really big achievement and we had beaten Kerry in the final. We had shown we were the best team in Ireland and we proved that again the following year in the final against Offaly after beating Kerry in the semi-final. We also beat Kerry in the  final, which meant that we had beaten them three times.ldquoKerry have always been the benchmark. If we had not beaten them, they would have won another three All-Irelands.Asked how his Down team would fare against present day sides ldquoItrsquos a dferent game now, what with the blanket defence and other things, but the Down teams of the s would have won in any era. Well, thatrsquos what I think, though Irsquom sure there are many people who would disagree. Eddie McKay Eddie won two All-Ireland medals with me in  and . He was a very good goalkeeper believe me, always safe, dependable and brave. He was an excellent shot stopper and made many excellent saves. I also played against him many times when Ballykinlar took on Dundrum. These were local parish derbies and everyone was trying to kill each other, but somehow Dundrum never managed to beat us. George Lavery George also won two All-Irelands in  and . He was the quiet man on the team, but there were few better man markers in the game and he would have been a star in any era. He had played a match of two for Antrim, but Maurice Hayes, who was secretary of the Down county board, persuaded him to sign for Down. He played as sweeper and was a good, tight marker. Leo Murphy Leo was a terric full back, tough and reliable. Not too many players could get past him and he could kick the ball a long distance. He also won two All-Irelands in  and . Pat Rice There was no one better than Pat Rice at catching a ball. His high fielding was magnicent and he was quick at clearing the ball. He gave away few chances and often kicked the ball out for Eddie McKay. He missed little and he wasnrsquot a dirty player at all. Dan McCartan One of only three Down players to win three All-Ireland senior medals along with Sean OrsquoNeill, Joe Lennon and myself, Dan is one of the all-time greats of Down football. He had outstanding ability, tackled hard and always looked for the quick clearance up to the front men. He could play anywhere as he showed when he moved to full back in the  final. Joe Lennon He was our captain in , though he did not play in the second after getting injured. He was a great captain and a terric leader. Joe placed a great emphasis on fitness and pioneered new coaching practices. He thought greatly about the game and was possibly ahead of his time. He was a very talented player. Tom OrsquoHare Tom played in the  team, but was good enough to get his place on any team. He was probably one of our best players that year. He was always steady and was great at delivering a ground ball. Jarlath Carey Jarlath won two All-Irelands in  and . He was a tireless worker, who was at home either in midfield or in attack. He was always forcing his way into the forward line and would wag his finger at me to go back into midfield to cover for him. I didnrsquot mind one bit, because he was good enough and I was fit enough to do what he asked. Colm McAlarney They called Colm lsquoThe Mighty Arklersquo after the famous racehorse because of his long strides up the field. Colm and Tom OrsquoHare were our two outstanding players in  and Colm was definitely one of the best midfielders in Ireland at that time, or any other time. Tony Hadden Tony won two All-Irelands in  and . He could fist the ball further than many players could kick it and he could also move into midfieldthings were going bad. He was tall and well built and could score a point as well as anyone. James McCartan A very strong player. Down would not have won anything without him because he took a lot of the abuse which would otherwise have been directed at me or Sean OrsquoNeill. He played a critical role in the  final against Offaly. We were two goals down in the first half and getting beaten. I crossed the ball to James who turned in mid air and put into the back of the net. Two more goals from Sean OrsquoNeill and Breen Morgan had us a goal up at half time, but it was his goal that turned things around. Sean OrsquoNeill You would have to say that Sean was the greatest Down footballer of them all. He was named in the GAA Team of the Century which says it all. We played well together, wherever I kicked the ball, Sean was there to get it. He had a wonderful sidestep and took a lot of abuse, but he never retaliated. He went on to become a successful manager and won the Sigerson Cup with Queenrsquos University. Mickey Linden Mickey was a flying machine and one of Downrsquos best ever forwards. He could blow defences away with his pace and score with either foot. He was also very versatile. You could play him anywhere and he would still be a threat. Perhaps his only failing was that he was too nice a player. He rarely made a foul. Won two All-Irelands in  and . Patsy OrsquoHagan Full forward and winner of two All-Irelands in  and . He could have played full forward, full back, or just about anywhere . He was that good. One of his best performances was Wembley Stadium during one of the Wembley Cup tournaments when he scored four goals against Galway. Breen Morgan They made them tough in Annaclone and for his size Breen was one of the hardest men on the field. He had broken his jaw before the  All-Ireland final, but went to the field without the protector which was made specially for him. He just threw it on to a chair. He was marked by Offalyrsquos Paddy McCormick, who was made of iron, but Breen was afraid of no one.Paddyrsquos substitutesDanny Kelly , Greg Blaney , Barry Breen , James Milligan , Ross Carr , Paddy OrsquoRourke , DJ Kane , Dan Gordon , Benny Coulter , Paddy Doherty ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th April 2020 Queen.jpg","title":"Queen Karen Europe’s best  ","story":"A KILLYLEAGH grandmother is a European powerlting champion at the age of .Karen Burns won the European title in France in March and set a new world record in the process.Powerlting involves three disciplines mdash squat, bench press and deadlt mdash and Karen capped a brilliant performance with a world record breaking lt of  kilos in the deadlt.Itrsquos a fantastic achievement for Karen, who only took up powerlting four years ago.The legal secretary, who has two daughters and four grandchildren, started gym classes at the age of , but within a few months made the switch to powerlting.Coached by Aaron Kelly, from Affinity Fit at the CG Fitness gym in Annacloy, she trained four times a week and was soon competing and winning medals at a national, international and world levels.She was the British champion two years running in  and .

This would be known as Serious Condition Criteria.While widely welcomed, what was not made clear was Departmental staff have discretion around who meets criteria and can overrule a claimantrsquos medical evidence.A number of enquiries were submitted to the Department under a Freedom of Information request.The responses are concerning.The Department stated legislation does not refer to serious conditions but rather whether there is a relevant change of circumstances. The decision not to reassess those with severe, lelong disabilities or health conditions who are unlikely to ever move into work: ldquoTook effect from  September , but did not result in legislative change.The Department was asked about the right of appealing a decision rejecting a claimant for Serious Conditions Criteria, who responded: ldquoThere is no automatic right of appeal against a determination which is embodied in or necessary to a decision. , a claimant has a right of appeal against an outcome decision rather than a determination, which is merely a component of the outcome decision.This was complicated for non-legally trained or represented claimants, so questions were put around full compliance with the Disability Discrimination and Human Rights.The Department responded stating it: ldquoDoes not hold any information relating to this hellip.may have been undertaken by DWP.A copy of the risk-assessment template used by the Department in instances of considering Serious Condition Criteria, was requested, but: ldquoNo template existsInstead, the response referred to assessment procedures where Departmental Healthcare Professionals advise on the re-referral period, and consider whether a claimantrsquos condition meets: ldquoThe new severe conditions criteria andno further assessments are required.However, the claimantrsquos own medical professionalrsquos opinion around Serious Condition Criteria could be over-ruled, with this decided by: ldquoAn Administrative Officer appointed by the Department.In respect of providing the legislation or guidance which permits the Department to overrule clinical opinion provided by a claimant seeking consideration under the Serious Condition Criteria, the response referred to ESA Regulations , which: ldquoProvides for the redetermination of whether someone has limited capability for work. The time period in relation to this is not set down in the legislation but is largely at the Department Decision Makers discretion ndash usually based on available medical evidence including medical reports from ATOS hellip The decision not to reassess those with severe, lelong disabilities or health conditions who would be unlikely to ever move into work, took effect from  September  but did not result in legislative change.As the Freedom of Information request was answerd prior to the restoration of devolution, the Department was asked with a Minister now in post, to comment on current processes around Serious Condition Criteria decision-making and in particular, how it can by discretion supersede a medical diagnosis by a claimantrsquos clinician. It was also askedprocedures are under review andthere is intention to bring forward legislation to allow for scrutiny or challenge.A spokesperson said: ldquo Anyone claiming ESA will be automatically assessed for the Severe Conditions criteria at their Work Capability Assessment by a Healthcare Professional. If the personrsquos condition or its al effects meet the criteria, the Department will be advised that no further assessments are required.In response to the overruling of clinical decisions, the spokesperson said: ldquoThe Work Capability Assessment looks at the al effects of a personrsquos condition, rather than the diagnosis itself. It is not a supersession of the opinion of their clinician.This dfered to the response provided prior to the Minister taking office, which appeared to show the Department was permitted to over-rule the evidence of claimantrsquos clinician.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The reality is we will look at the medical evidence. The Northern Ireland Executive will have its own flexibility and we may see across the country some iations we saw some iations going into lockdown as well. Itrsquoll be a decision that all four nations take together based on the evidence, he said.Mr. Lewis said he was aware of the complexities of Northern Irelandrsquos Border with the Republic of Ireland amid the pandemic, explaining that he has been meeting with First Minister Arlene Foster, Deputy First Minister Michelle OrsquoNeill and Taacutenaiste Simon Coveney.ldquoEven where there are dferences in the approach between the Republic and the North,there are,we know that we can make sure we are clear with residents why those dferences are there.ldquoThe challenge of having iations within Northern Ireland is how we manage that.An investigation in The Sunday Times at the weekend featured a Whitehall source claiming the government ldquomissed the boat on testing and PPEand ldquojust watched as the death toll mounted in Wuhan, China.The report also claimed that Prime Minister Boris Johnson missed five crucial COBRA meetings in the Cabinet Office in London.When asked to respond to these serious allegations, Mr. Lewis said: ldquoI didnrsquot recognise some of what I saw in the Times.ldquoI was in the Cobra meetings in January and February COBRA meetings are chaired by the Secretary of State in the Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms. Itrsquos a place, not a thing.ldquoWe were making decisions the scientists and medical experts were making decisions at that time and planning was going on. This is the point to judge it now when we have two months more evidence is dangerous and a misleading thing to do.Turning to PPE which has been an issue in Fermanagh, Mr. Lewis used his own constituency of Great Yarmouth as an example of where there has been ldquono problems with accessing equipment.He added: ldquoWersquove had gowns sent over to the UK, OrsquoNeills [sportswear] converted to gowns, there is gin distillery in your part of the world producing sanitisers.ldquoWersquore shting five and a half million pieces of PPE across to Northern Ireland.

I am cautious about predicting what will be in a few weeksrsquo time.He believes the government could ldquoflatten the curve of Covid-people continue to stay at home, adding: ldquoWe want to see past the peak, you donrsquot want to see a downward trend and ease up as all you do is let it shoot back up again.ldquoIf you think back to the beginning there were some quite scary numbers being put about by some experts about what the deaths might be. Now any death is too many and we have sadly lost people, friends and family who have gone through tragic experiences recently, and the figures are nowhere near those numbers we saw at the beginning.ldquoThatrsquos because the public across Northern Ireland and the UK have done a good job generally of following the guidelines which means we can flatten that curve, he said.Mr. Lewis explained that he had personal experience of people close to him who had been diagnosed with Covid-, including his parliamentary private secretary.ldquoSomeone I know lost a member of their family this week, I have a few people in family who had the disease.

No less a person than gardening expert Alan Titchmarsh believes the Government has been unfair to garden centres by deeming them non-essential, forcing them to close during this emergency whilst supermarkets can carry on selling plants and flowers.He said this week that ‘ garden centres were to put in place the same protocols as supermarkets then they who earn their entire living from horticulture should be allowed to’. I rang my regular garden centre for advice and, yes, they were closed but I could place an order by phone or online with them. I couldn’t visit and stroll around to pick what I wanted, but they could deliver a phoned order or I could pick it up so long as I stayed in the car on their driveway and paid by swiping my card. I was happy with that though it deprived me of seeing what promising new plants and garden decorations were available. The colourful ladybirds on my garden shed door are not real, but metal, bought in the garden centre last year. It is this kind of trade that our garden centres will be deprived of and that is hardly fair to them.Without any worries about rain the digging began, the ground being a lot harder than I expected, obviously due to the dry weather. The bags of compost, delivered to my door by the garden centre, were all used up in no time and two days later planting began, watched by my menagerie of pets.Nightly watering was necessary but a great sense of satisfaction set in that despite the tough stance on garden centres people like me were able to progress our gardens.So le was rosy then  Not quite. After a couple of days I noticed my dog wasn’t in great form. In fact he was throwing up over the lawn, though he wasn’t running a temperature. He still wanted to go out for his evening walk so I assumed that he would recover. On the second day of throwing up I was about to ring the vet for an appointment but decided to investigate more closely what he had brought up and it was plain to see that one or other cat had found a new toilet spot amongst the plants and one nosey dog decided it seemed good enough to eat.I suppose there are more important things for the older generation to worry about than protecting their plants from inquisitive cats and dogs. For example, there are calls to remove the triple lock on the state pension – it rises by .pc yearly – which could see the value of the pension fall back while prices rise.The suggestion comes from the think tank Social Market Foundation, which believes the Government ‘should abandon the system to ensure the economy recovery from the coronavirus crisis is fair to working-age households’. It must think, wrongly, that my generation has had it too good.--A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

When you look at some of the dwellings being put up in the countryside, it shows you that PPS is not adequate to stop this abuse.I have also seen a dwelling being built a short distance from a farmhouse that crosses over a main road into a green field.It says it all when we are the only country in the UK not to have a national park.There are  in England, three in Wales and two in Scotland. Our neighbours in the Republic of Ireland have six. As was pointed out by Ben Lowry, around the Mournes, much of it is overrun by single dwellings.I can only conclude that the main reason we do not have a national park is because of the culture that exists here. I do not care how much money people have, but when planning decisions take away large swathes of the countryside and wildle habitat, it then becomes all of our concern.This is not an orange and green issue, but one of protecting the beauty and wildle of our country for generations to come.John Mulholland, Doagh"},{"url":null,"title":"jonny mccambridge mr miyagi tom sawyer and garden fence ","story":"Top Garda post for second ex-RUC and PSNI chiefPSNI thank public for helping find missing -year-old girl they had been ‘increasingly concerned’ aboutNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensCoronavirusNewsPeopleJonny McCambridge: Mr Miyagi, Tom Sawyer and the garden fenceThere is an old wooden fence which runs around my garden.By The NewsroomSaturday, th April , : am\"\"It is uneven, not quite straight, a little crooked.

My son watches me struggle, and laughs when I boot it in frustration.And then, finally, we are ready. My thought is that my boy can assist me, father and son working together, passing my wisdom and experience down to the next generation, bonding over sweat. We select a plank and begin to paint.Fourteen seconds later he says: ‘Daddy, I’m bored of this, can I go and play now ’I had expected as much. Luckily I have a cultural reference which can assist. I loved reading Tom Sawyer at school, particularly the scene where he tricks his friends into painting his garden fence.I step back, peering admiringly at the newly applied colour.‘That’s ok buddy, it’s just such a shame that you are going to miss all of the fun.’‘What fun daddy ’‘Well, the fun of painting. This is not work, it’s play. After all it’s not everyday that a man gets the chance to paint a fence. Boy oh boy, am I going to have some fun today.’The trap has been set and I can see there is a momentary confusion in his features. I give him a fatherly smile. He looks back.‘Duh daddy!’ he says, before running off.Deflated, I slap some more paint on wood, cursing Mark Twain’s novel for the fancul nonsense that it clearly is. I work on alone, my solitary state causing my thoughts to meander until I fix upon another cultural reference. There is a scene in The Karate Kid film where Mr Miyagi teaches Daniel the hidden secrets of martial arts by getting him to use a certain technique to paint his fence.I try to recreate it now. Long flowing vertical strokes with the brush, mobilising the flexibility of my wrist. Wrist up, wrist down. I can feel a newfound power flowing through my left arm. Wrist up, wrist down.Two minutes later I have to stop because I have developed cramp in my wrist. I switch to my right hand but the cramp appears here even sooner, complemented by the added hindrance of losing the feeling in my fingers. This causes me to drop the brush on my foot. I don’t remember this scene from the movie.Abandoning any hopes of a new career as a full-combat karate champion, I reduce my ambition to just getting some paint onto the fence. The truth, which both Tom Sawyer and Mr Miyagi ignored, is that there is no comfortable way of doing this. I try brushing up and down, side to side, diagonally, in circles. I try painting the outline of squares, and then colouring them in. It makes no dference my arm aches and I can feel my back beginning to seize up.I’m forced to consider alternatives. Just throwing the can of paint at the fence is attractive, but likely to be messy and inefficient. I seriously ponder the prospect of removing my boot, lying on the ground and gripping the brush between my toes, but the woman from across the road is watching out her window and I suspect she already thinks me a little strange. Best not to lower her opinion still further.I plough on stubbornly, becoming more reckless. There is, to be sure, some paint on the wood, but probably more on my clothes, skin and hair. I think,such a thing is possible, that I may have stained the insides of my eyelids. My son rides past on his scooter.‘Are you still having fun daddy ’I scowl and put down the brush and survey what I have achieved. I have painted part of the gate. My property is not large but the totality of the fence seems to stretch off into the misty horizon like the Great Wall of China. I wonderour garden fence can be seen from space.I go back inside.‘Have you finished ’ my we asks hopefully.I chuckle inwardly at the naivety of the query.‘No, no,’ I respond. ‘A job like this has to be done in stages.’‘But you’ve only been at it for less than an hour.’‘I know, but, but...you have to let the paint soak into the wood. Whoever painted it before did a bad job, that’s slowing me down.’She looks at me doubtfully.‘Don’t worry,’ I continue. ‘I’ll do a bit more tomorrow....or maybe the day after.’—— ——A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

In a comment which slipped by without provoking any reaction, she said “social distancing is going to be a feature of our lives it’s going to be a feature of our lives for perhaps up to a couple of yearsnot beyond”.As the two leaders spoke yesterday, the Department of Health confirmed “a further  people have sadly lost their lives to Covid-”.

Please try again later.Submitting...The total fatalities for the UK now stands at , . Globally the figure last night was , . There has been tension recently within the Executive, with Sinn Fein generally favouring a hardline approach to easing restrictions, and the DUP more inclined to allow some limited leeway – with the cemeteries a stark example of the ision.The Moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, Dr William Henry, last night described the reopening of cemeteries as “a sensible and compassionate response to an important pastoral and human need”.UUP leader Steve Aiken called it “a humanitarian act”.Jim Allister, TUV leader, declared: “The dys of the Executive delayed this for at least a week, causing needless hurt to many grieving families. Those behind the delay owe such families not just an explanation but an apology.”The public desire for reopening graveyards was gruesomely illustrated during the week when DUP MP Jeffrey Donaldson announced a pensioner had impaled himself on railings while trying to climb over them to visit his we’s grave.Arlene Foster said: “We’ve agreed to support the health minister in lting the restrictions on access to graveyards. This is about balancing public health concerns with the basic human need for people to visit their loved ones’ grave.”But she added: “Please do remain at home as much as possible. We’re not out of the woods.”On Tuesday Declan Kearneyhad told MLAs on the floor of the Assembly: “I and Executive colleagues understand how extremely dficult it is that members of our families, inidual friends, and our community are being denied the solace that moments of reflection at gravesides and places of worship can provide, but that is the price that we must pay because the coronavirus pandemic is an emergency.”At yesterday’s news conference, Michelle O’Neill was quizzed on how Sinn Fein “got this so badly wrong”.She responded: “I always said we’d keep these things under review, and we listened very carefully to what people had to say. And you have to get that fine balance between protecting people’s lives and also then listening to people whenever they’ve expressed concern.“So I’m glad the Executive has found a way forward... That’s us listening to people at this moment in time, that’s us understanding the angst that was there, that’s us not wanting to exasperate [sic] anyone’s mental health or families that are grieving right now.“But our number one priority right now is about dealing with the fact we’re still in the mist [sic] of the pandemic.”Asked about north-south co-operation on combating coronavirus, Ms O’Neill indicated that on this side of the Irish Sea “the numbers speak for themselves, insofar as our death rate here has been  to % less than what’s sadly been experienced in Britain”.She added that “we are an island and we have to use that to our advantage”.In the Republic, as of yesterday there had been  deaths.However, Mrs Foster said that comparing death figures in the Republic with Northern Ireland “is a little bit more nuanced than perhaps some people have presented”, because of “dferent data systems” and dferent reporting times for deaths.We need to share information [with the Republic]” she said. “But it’s also true to say we’ve greatly benefitted from being part of the UK as well.”When it comes to why Northern Ireland’s death rate is relatively low compared with Great Britain, she said “population density has a big impact on this”.For example, she said London has population density of nearly , people per square kilometre, against just  per sq km for Northern Ireland.A number of councils got in touch last night to say when they will re-open cemeteries some said Saturday, others Sunday.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

This will highlight the importance of community testing and support the containment of emerging coronavirus infections as and when restrictions are eased.Launching the framework, the First Minister said: ldquoOur approach to date has been one of lockdown. We have taken unprecedented steps to protect everyone, but particularly those most at risk from serious illness.ldquoThis has helped the NHS prepare and cope with coronavirus and, even though we have sadly seen more than  people die, it has helped to save many more lives. But this strategy comes with its own costs to peoplersquos wider health and wellbeing and long-term costs to our economy.ldquoWe are keeping these regulations under constant review. We know coronavirus will be with us for a long time yet but we want to see whether there are things we can do while we continue to tackle the virus and while the search for better treatments and a vaccine continue.The framework ndash and the seven questions ndash will help determine when the time is right to relax some of the stay-at home regulations.The seven questions are:bull Would easing a restriction have a negative effect on containing the virus bull Does a particular measure pose a low risk of further infection bull How can it be monitored and enforced bull Can it be reversed quicklyit creates unintended consequences bull Does it have a positive economic benefit bull Does it have a positive impact on peoplersquos wellbeing bull Does it have a positive impact on equality The Chief Medical Officer for Walesrsquo office has developed the Wales-wide programme of surveillance, case identication, and contract tracing.It will have four main strands ndash improved surveillance of cases of coronavirus effective identication of cases and contact tracing learning from international experience and engaging with the public.Dr Atherton said: ldquoAction to ease the lockdown restrictions will need to be supported by a comprehensive public health response, which will need to developed quickly and at scale.ldquoAcross the UK, we have worked and put in place unprecedented measures to contain and delay the spread of coronavirus. We have also worked to reduce the overall impact of the virus by strengthening essential services, including healthcare.ldquoWe are now working towards a new recovery phase to lead us out of the pandemic but only when the conditions are right.The First Minister added: ldquoCoronavirus is not going to disappear ndash it is likely it will be with us for a long time. We will need to have some sort of restrictions in place for some time yet to continue to control the spread of the virus and reduce community transmission. This framework will help us determine what is right for Wales.ldquoThere is a long road ahead of us towards recovery to pre-pandemic levels, butwe continue to work together, I hope we will be able to make changes to the restrictions and see a gradualto something resembling normal le.The Welsh Government has worked closely with the rest of the UK throughout the pandemic and has shared the development of the framework with the Scottish, Northern Irish and the UK governments. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

If your dog stays where they are, wait a moment, then go back and reward them with an extra treat.Increase the distance you move away and the time you wait before ing with the extra treat. You should soon be able to leave the room and close the door or gate. Progress to spending more time in a dferent room. Build this into the daily routine.It’s important that your dog remains relaxed. If they show signs of distress, leave them for a shorter period, or don’t move as far away, next time.Rachel Casey, Director of Canine Behaviour and Research at Dogs Trust, said: “For many of us it has been great to spend so much time with our dogs during lockdown andmostly our dogs love us being around too. But all this extra attention could potentially create a ticking time bomb of separation anxiety for our dogs. If they expect us to be about all the time, it will be more dficult for them to cope once we go back to our normal lives and aren’t in the house  .“Now is the time to act to avoid future problems – and it’s easy to do. Just make sure that you factor in time apart from your dog each day to help them be able to cope when alone – this could be separated from you by a door or child gate for an hour or two whilst you’re working or home schooling the kids. By organizing your dog’s day, with time apart, play times, exercise, other activity sessionsand quiet times, you can make sure that your dog maintains their ability to cope with the dferent aspects of ‘normal’ le when we get back to it.”For more ideas on how to keep your dog occupied visit www.dogstrust.org.uk--A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

INPT-. : -TONY HENDRONNNLocal MLA Jonny Buckley said: “I’m relieved that the Northern Ireland Executive have now come to the collective decision of reopening our cemeteries in a controlled manner.“This has been an extremely sensitive issue for grieving families and I am glad that Executive Ministers have reconsidered their stance.“Please keep safe whilst visiting the cemetery and adhere to social distancing rules.”Local MP Carla Lockhart said: “I know this has been heartbreaking for many families who have lost a loved one. Please await Council guidance on opening times and guidance on regulations.”Councillor Paul Berry said: “Let’s think of all those people who had loved ones die due to COVID and other health related illnesses but who couldn’t visit their loved ones grave . A very tough time for many many people.”SDLP Upper Bann said they were awaiting further details of opening hours and how it can be managed with social distancing but added: “For many people this visit is very important to them as part of their grieving process and something which they did on a daily basis prior to the pandemic.“The lockdown has robbed them of that special moment in the day where they go to visit the resting place of their loved ones.”Cemeteries were closed when social distancing measures were introduced towards the end of March .The NI Executive met on Friday afternoon and agreed that cemeteries throughout Northern Ireland could reopen.“This is about balancing public health concerns with the basic human need for people to visit their loved ones,” said First Minister Foster.Mrs Foster stressed it remains vitally important that the public remember they must continue to adhere to social distancing guidelines and wash their hands.Sinn Fein and the Alliance Party had previously supported the decision to close cemeteries across Northern Ireland.However, deputy First Minister and Sinn Fein vice-president, Michelle O’Neill, said the decision to re-open cemeteries came about because they had “listened carefully to the genuine distress of families who have not been able to visit the grave of a loved one”.“I understand that there’s a fine balance and making sure that people do not face additional burden in terms of their mental health and well-being and also our role in making sure that people are not put at further risk from the transmission of coronavirus,” she said.“So the opening of graveyards would only be permitted where there are those in charge of burial grounds that can ensure that we have compliance with the regulations and appropriate social distancing.“We continue to keep these issues under review,” she said.\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1587656147249.jpg--marts_to_reopen_gradually.jpg?158765614700","title":"marts to reopen gradually ","story":"THE Department for Agriculture, Environment and Ruralaffairs has welcomed the decision by the Northern Ireland Livestock and Auctioneers’ Associationto open Livestock Marts on a gradual basis from Monday,  April.Livestock Marts closed voluntarily on  March - including Rathfriland Co-Op and Hilltown Saleyard - in response to Covid- health and safety concerns.

Part of that food supply chain is the ability to trade and sell animals.“Staff within the Department have maintained regular contact with Livestock Mart operators over recent weeks and have been reassured that robust operational protocols, developed by the Marts in conjunction with other stakeholders, will enable them to conduct business in a manner that is safe for staff, farmers and buyers and adheres to social distancing requirements.“DAERA therefore welcomes the decision to recommence sales of primestock, cull animals and store stock on a gradual basis from week commencing  April.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_daeceeafbbc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bcdaaaa   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
