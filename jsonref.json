However, it is not clear if they have been given any new political instructions – thought to be critical to shift the deadlock. Government sources confirmed that Lord Frost and Mr Barnier will resume post-Brexit trade talks in Brussels today in a bid to resolve the outstanding issues. In a grim assessment, a No10 source said Mr Johnson did not want to leave \u0027any route to a possible deal untested\u0027. \u0027The PM and Ursula von der Leyen had a frank discussion about the significant obstacles which remain in the negotiations,\u0027 the source said. \u0027Very large gaps remain between the two sides and it is still unclear whether these can be bridged. The PM and Ms von der Leyen agreed to further discussions over the next few days between their negotiating teams. \u0027The PM does not want to leave any route to a possible deal untested. The PM and Ms von der Leyen agreed that by Sunday a firm decision should be taken about the future of the talks.\u0027Ms von der Leyen said in a statement: \u0027We had a lively and interesting discussion on the state of play on outstanding issues. We understand each other\u0027s positions. \u0027They remain far apart. The teams should immediately reconvene to try to resolve these issues. We will come to a decision by the end of the weekend.\u0027 Mr Barnier and Lord Frost have wrangled unsuccessfully for months over access to UK waters, level playing field rules and how to enforce the terms, and finally admitted earlier this week that they could not make any more progress. Mr Johnson landed in RAF Northolt near London from Brussels shortly after midnight. He had set the tone for the showdown yesterday by telling MPs no prime minister could accept the demands the EU is making, which include obeying rules it makes in the future, as well as those currently in place. In a bullishly optimistic performance at PMQs, Mr Johnson said the UK would \u0027prosper mightily\u0027 with or without an agreement – even thought the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has suggested the collapse of talks would knock two percent off GDP next year.Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey has warned that the long-term damage from falling back on World Trade Organisation terms would be worse than the economic hit from coronavirus.Tory MPs urged Mr Johnson to stick to his guns, insisting his pledge to \u0027take back control\u0027 and put sovereignty first must not be sacrificed to get a deal. But Sir Keir Starmer accused the PM of bungling the negotiations, swiping: \u0027Secure the deal, Prime Minister. You promised it.\u0027Cabinet minister Robert Jenrick waded into the crisis last night, telling ITV\u0027s Peston that while there had been \u0027good discussion\u0027 between the PM and Ms von der Leyen, there are still \u0027very significant areas of disagreement\u0027 and that had been \u0027no clear movement in the right direction\u0027.  The Housing Secretary said: \u0027It sounds as if, from the conversations I\u0027ve had with the Prime Minister\u0027s team tonight, that there are still very significant areas of disagreement.\u0027So I don\u0027t want to give false hope, but he did conclude with Ursula von der Leyen that we should get the teams back together in the coming days and they will work hard to see if there is a way forward until Sunday.\u0027Asked if the UK was closer to a deal, he said: \u0027I think there was a good discussion, but there was no clear movement in the right direction.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"Maradonas Italian love child says universal right know father","story":"Share this article Several Spanish-language memes went viral after Maradona\u0027s lawyer revealed the three Cuban children.One said: \u0027If you were born between 1980 and 2019 and you have extraordinary footballing skills, contact us.

She was born with a silver Euro-spoon in her mouth. Her father, Ernst Albrecht, was a founder of the European bureaucracy as well as senior West German politician, so Ursula inherited her place at the heart of German politics.But every ministry she ran turned to dust. She was ejected from the cabinet in Berlin after a disastrous tenure at the Ministry of Defence that left soldiers practising with broomsticks for World War III while vast sums were squandered on consultants.From being Angela Merkel’s anointed successor, she was parachuted into the job of President of the European Commission — a typical symptom of the EU’s embrace of a second-rate conformist.Far from handbagging her colleagues and the heads of government into getting things done, Ursula von der Leyen has presided over EU crisis management as a slow-motion sport.Tinkering with non-essentials has become a substitute for wrestling economic stagnation, population decline and tackling aggressive neighbours such as Russia and Turkey.That kind of policy paralysis is what led the once-mighty Ottoman Empire straddling the Balkans, the Middle East and North Africa to be called the original ‘Sick Man of Europe’ in the 19th century.Turkish sultans focused on everything except the essentials needed to saved their empire. The EU is doing much the same today.Fear of a revived, competitive Britain lies behind Brussels’ constant attempts to lock us into its business-stifling regulations even after Brexit. But even if Britain succumbed to these demands — and as I write, Boris Johnson is insisting that is out of the question — the rest of the world won’t.Canada, for example, hasn’t had to agree to a ‘level playing field’, obeying the Brussels rulebook at home.And can you imagine either of the world’s economic superpowers, the U.S. or China, meekly accepting conditions such as those Europe has been trying to inflict on Britain?Nor are up-and-coming powerhouses such as India going to tie their economic hands behind their backs to keep Brussels happy.Margaret Thatcher loved the poem Waiting For The Barbarians, by the Greek writer Constantine Cavafy. It caught the mood of a decadent empire which used the barbarian threat as a distraction from internal problems.For the EU, the end of Brexit will be the equivalent of the ‘bewilderment’ felt by the imperial elite in Cavafy’s poem at the news that the barbarians have moved away.‘What’s going to happen to us without barbarians? Those people were a kind of solution.’Britain was Europe’s great excuse for not getting things done. For decades we blocked ‘progress’ to a federal Europe. Then our protracted departure took up Brussels’ time and energy as the world moved on. Now, with Britain gone, what will hold Europe together in the face of self-inflicted wounds and hard realities?Brexit was a form of life support for Europe’s moribund, log-jammed system.Even if a deal is reached before the end of the transition period, Europe will still be left without excuses for its problems once Britain goes.Can Brussels diagnose the EU’s ills accurately? More importantly, will it prescribe the right medicine?Given its unimpressive record, that seems unlikely. Rather than candidly addressing its deep-seated ailments, Brussels is more concerned to proscribe unwelcome advice from dissenters and stick to the quack remedies that have only worsened its poor health.The EU has truly become the sick man of Europe.Mark Almond is director of the Crisis Research Institute, Oxford."},{"url":null,"title":"Scientists say Britons CANCEL Christmas gatherings","story":"Share this articleScientists warn against Christmas gatherings in UK despite relaxed rules | World news | The Guardian"},{"url":null,"title":"Expecting life return normal April thanks vaccine unrealistic","story":"Share this articleShare this article   The launch comes after official data showed pupils aged 11 to 18 were fuelling the winter surge of infections in the capital and South East England. The Department of Health said \u0027hundreds of thousands\u0027 of swabbing kits are being sent to the existing testing hubs, as well as 37 additional mobile units being set up.  Fifteen 15 extra mobile testing sites will be sent to London starting today and over the weekend, with an additional 12 in Kent and 10 in Essex, to bolster capacity.The seven London boroughs involved in the scheme are Barking and Dagenham, Hackney, Havering, Newham, Redbridge, Tower Hamlets and Waltham Forest.Five Essex boroughs will also take part – Basildon, Canvey Island, Brentwood, Harlow and Southend – but it is not clear where the tests will be rolled out in Kent.Officials are encouraging all pupils, their families and teaching staff to start booking their tests, regardless of whether they have symptoms or not.People can apply for the tests using the Government\u0027s online testing portal and will be asked to visit a mobile testing unit in their borough. Children under 16 need to be accompanied by a parent or guardian.Number 10 has still not revealed how often children will be swabbed and how many pupils it will affect. But London\u0027s seven hotspot boroughs are home to 640,000 children aged between 11 and 18, according to Office for National Statistics 2019 population estimates. The five Essex boroughs have more than 55,000 pupils in that age group. The deployment of the tests is an attempt prevent London and Essex being plunged into a Tier 3 lockdown — they\u0027re both currently in Tier 2.Covid infections are falling in most age groups but transmission is high in secondary school and college aged pupils.As long as it remains high in these groups there remains a risk children will pass the disease to their parents and the virus will race through the population. Kent is already in a Tier 3 but the county-wide infection rate is being inflated by a handful of districts with high transmission.     Officials said the 15 new mobile testing units in London will provide around 75,000 extra daily tests over and above existing capacity in the capital. They added that an additional 44,000 home test kits will be made available for school staff including teachers to test before returning in January."},{"url":null,"title":"No Deal tariffs ruinous UK Ireland","story":"Share this article Mr Johnson insists that the UK can \u0027prosper mightily\u0027 under a no-deal but the Office for Budget Responsibility financial watchdog has suggested that a no-deal outcome could wipe 2 per cent off gross domestic product -

Many other stores will extend their hours, opening their doors from 5am. The UK’s biggest supermarket chain has also installed a traffic light system in most stores to help regulate the number of shoppers.Next week, Waitrose is launching a queueing app, called Qudini, which enables shoppers to book a shopping time slot remotely. Customers will be able to book a slot at more than 100 stores to help prevent big queues building up in the peak shopping period.Asda is also using Qudini, which it has been trialling since the spring, while Sainsbury’s is enabling virtual queues via a different app in some stores.Steven Hand, head of customer experience at Waitrose, said: “We’re doing all we can to make our customers’ grocery shop as safe, easy and convenient as possible. Our pre-bookable slots are just another way we’re doing this and will give peace of mind to those who like to plan ahead and avoid queues.”Its supermarkets will also be opening until 11pm until 23 December.

This year, after months of irregular cinema activity and countless delayed releases, one tentpole title pretty much has all the hype to itself: yes, Christopher Nolan’s Tenet (multiple platforms from Monday) is now out to punch up your festive home viewing.Not that “festive” is really what Nolan does: hard, unsmiling and rendered in assorted shades of steel, Tenet is essentially a Bond film with the jokes dialled way down and a tangle of sci-fi complications in their place. Like all Nolan opuses, it takes itself very seriously indeed, but is nevertheless best enjoyed as handsome hot nonsense. John David Washington plays a CIA agent drawn into a shady organisation named Tenet, charged with preventing world war three by altering the flow of time. As one does.That’s a simple synopsis for a highly crowded film, bustling with corrupt arms dealers and art forgery and “temporal pincer movements” in which different parties must move backwards and forwards through time simultaneously: the palindromic title is no accident. Nolan has evidently conceived it to inspire a veritable online industry of fan theories and explainers, though I think approaching Tenet as a sum to be solved takes the fun out of it. Months after seeing it, my memories of Nolan’s film involve the athletic beauty of its sensational action set pieces, the high-voltage, movie-star glamour of its leads – with Robert Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki providing slinky foils to Washington’s stern straight man – and the general high-shine elegance of Nolan’s mise-en-scène. (Plus some bespoke tailoring to die for.) Tenet may or may not entirely make sense, but it thrilled me all the same.In fraternal duo Michael and Peter Spierig’s underrated Predestination (2014 Amazon Prime), Ethan Hawke’s time-travelling agent must contend not just with traversing multiple decades to nip future criminals in the bud, but with the shifting intersex identity of a new recruit, played quite superbly by Sarah Snook. It’s hokum of the most intricate order – Orlando meets Minority Report. And even that seems mainstream besides the still head-scrambling advanced calculus of Shane Carruth’s experimental, influential time-travel origin story Primer (2004 Amazon again).If you prefer your time-slip head-trips on the beefy scale of Tenet, meanwhile, Nolan himself must have been envious of Rian Johnson’s neat, backflipping Looper (2012 on Google Play), whose contract killer-after-himself conceit was less smartly ripped off last year by Ang Lee’s leaden Gemini Man. And Doug Liman’s rather brilliant Edge of Tomorrow (2014 Prime again), which strands Tom Cruise’s alien-fighting lieutenant in a time loop that gradually hones his battle skills, proved that the unimprovable one-day gimmick of 1993’s Groundhog Day (on Netflix) isn’t just good for romantic comedies – though at Christmas, I’d probably choose the latter.Babyteeth (Picturehouse, 15) After a cinema-only release in the summer, one of the year’s best films is now available for home viewing. Australian director Shannon Murphy’s debut remixes a number of heavily familiar genres – rebellious teen romance, terminal disease drama, black comedy of suburban ennui – into something unexpectedly vibrant and citrus-tangy, shot through with complex feeling, while stars Toby Wallace and Eliza Scanlen pop with young, spiky verve.The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone(Paramount, 15) History has come to brand the belated third part of Francis Ford Coppola’s mafia trilogy as a greater disappointment than its reception at the time suggested: it was always flawed, but we now underrate its grandiose power. Coppola’s new cut – the one he always wanted to present, he says – aims to rehabilitate the film’s legacy, principally via a tighter introduction and a more elegiac ending. The result is no masterwork, but an impressive, muscular film: that much has stayed the same.Wolfwalkers (Apple TV+, PG) Apple’s streaming service continues to assert its identity in rather low-key fashion, but here’s one of its more enviable exclusives: streaming dibs on this truly enchanting, unusual animated feature. The marriage of Irish director Tomm Moore’s distinctively stylised stained-glass aesthetic and storytelling rooted in wild Irish mythology is a rich and happy one.No Hard Feelings (TLA, 18) Twenty-six-year-old German-Iranian director Faraz Shariat won the Teddy award for best queer film at the Berlin film festival for his lively, surprising debut, and in a normal year it might have been a bigger arthouse success story. Combining gen-Z gay romance with sharp insights into the European migrant crisis, this study of the bond between a second-generation Iranian immigrant and two refugee siblings is alternately sobering and fizzy as sherbet.Funny Boy (Netflix) It’s been a while since Indo-Canadian director Deepa Mehta made a film with the broad arthouse appeal of her Oscar-nominated Water, but this busy, heartfelt coming-of-age drama comes close. Setting the tender story of a young Tamil boy’s discovery of his homosexuality in the 1970s against the more brutal backdrop of the Sri Lankan civil war is an ambitious bifocal strategy, but Mehta negotiates it with care and compassion.Archive (Universal, 15) A decade ago, Gavin Rothery was the visual effects supervisor for Duncan Jones’s film Moon now, as a director, he’s taken his own stab at resourceful, low-budget British sci-fi. The result, starring Theo James as a reclusive AI scientist attempting to bring his departed wife to android life, is auspicious and stylish in a brushed-chrome way, even if it wears the influence of films such as Moon and Ex Machina a bit heavily."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c77ed72e9aaa958577684d0bd89da7a63f24bd7/0_93_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=030faf763641d37a058ffb03e0a6a3dc","title":"guardian editor in chief katharine viner on how we reported 2020 podcast","story":"A look back at how the  covered a year that began with the outbreak of a pandemic, witnessed global anti-racism protests after the killing of George Floyd, and ended with the voting out of President Donald Trump"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ef74a41a44707be6dab50feff27d009c2da006a/0_119_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e013c0bdf2d0fd9bc058eb137f85c9be","title":"gp practices england opt out covid vaccine rollout","story":"Exclusive: more than 100,000 patients will have to get jab elsewhere as GPs say they lack capacity to take partMore than 100,000 patients will not be able to get the Covid vaccine from their family doctor after their GP surgeries decided not to take part in its deployment, the  can reveal.Dozens of GP practices in England have chosen not to join the NHS’s coronavirus vaccination programme amid concerns their workloads are already too heavy, they have too few staff and that patients could suffer if practices have to cut back other services so doctors can administer the injections.Their reluctance to inoculate patients threatens to overshadow the start of the second phase of the vaccine rollout, which is due to start next week, with GPs taking part for the first time. has established that a number of practices in Manchester, Sussex, Lincolnshire, Yorkshire and the Thames Valley have opted out of the programme. The local NHS will have to arrange for patients registered at those surgeries to be vaccinated elsewhere.While GPs are pleased the PfizerBioNTech vaccine has become available, many are concerned at how they will put on vaccine clinics from 8am to 8pm seven days a week, as they are obliged to do under the terms of the contract covering their involvement, which NHS England negotiated with the British Medical Association, the doctors’ trade union.A new rule requiring every vaccine recipient to then be monitored for 15 minutes, introduced by NHS England after two hospital workers had an allergic reaction to it when deployment began on Tuesday, has also prompted some surgeries to not get involved.Many GPs are torn between their desire to immunise patients in order to save lives and the practical difficulties of participation. Their feelings are also complicated by not wanting to be seen to be undermining public confidence in, or access to, the vaccine.Discontent in Manchester is so great that two primary care networks (PCN), or groupings of practices, which between them have more than 100,000 patients, have decided not to take part. One, Cheetham Hill and Crumpsall PCN, involves eight surgeries which between them have around 56,000 patients. The other, Higher Blackley, Harpurhey and Charlestown PCN, comprises nine surgeries with about 46,000 patients.“We are already struggling to staff our surgeries, so how are we going to provide the staff to do the vaccinations? And how can we scale back other services, to free up staff time to vaccinate people, without compromising patients’ safety?” said one GP in Cheetham Hill and Crumpsall.Primary care services in England are delivered by about 7,000 surgeries organised in 1,260 PCNs. Family doctors in about 250 PCNs are due to start vaccinating patients next week. They will join the 70 “hospital hubs” across the UK which began delivering the vaccine to over-80s, care home staff and NHS personnel with underlying health conditions on Tuesday.Dr Julia Patterson, the lead for Everydoctor, a network of grassroots NHS medics, said: “I’ve not spoken to a single doctor who doesn’t want to take part in the vaccine rollout medical professionals are acutely aware of the importance of vaccinations. However, PCNs in some areas may simply be forced to opt out in order to keep normal patient services going, and keep their patients safe this winter.”There is concern that, once a surgery has signed up, the length of the contract – nine months – could mean that patients may struggle to access care during that time.A letter from GPs at a surgery in Lincolnshire claimed the “inflexible” contract, and NHS England’s ability to unilaterally impose new conditions during the rollout, “pose a real risk to the safe and essential general medical services we provide to our patients, to the wellbeing of our colleagues, and to the financial stability of the GP practices”.Pulse, a news website for GPs, reported on Thursday that the 15-minute observation rule had prompted North East Derbyshire PCN to pull out of the scheme.The Royal College of GPs acknowledged the challenge facing GPs and tension in their ranks.Prof Martin Marshall, its chair, said: “It is going to be an enormous challenge, given the workload and workforce challenges GPs and our teams are currently working under … Given these challenges, we understand why some practices have felt like they cannot sign up. But there has been an excellent response from the large number of practices able and wanting to be involved.”A spokesperson for the NHS said: “As set out and supported by the BMA, general practices will deliver the vaccine from nominated sites within primary care networks, where it is safe and practical to do so. There has been a fantastic response from GPs across England signing up to do so.“Given the well-known logistical challenges of delivering this particular vaccine, GPs like others across the NHS are now responding rapidly to make arrangements for this to happen.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f82da981352d9b0d53cb5672d55f696e018b4eb/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=d85d6658d99d0438592108cc3df36c52","title":"rfu says it can fund dementia payouts from insurance if necessary","story":"English rugby union’s top official says the sport is safe to play and that the future of the Rugby Football Union is not at risk from possible multi-million compensation claims made by brain damaged former players. Bill Sweeney, the RFU’s chief executive, does say, however, that the union are wary of the potential impact on the game’s image and that making rugby entirely risk-free is “a journey with no conclusion”.Like everyone else the RFU has been “very sad and distressed” to learn that the 2003 World Cup-winning hooker Steve Thompson is among a number of players showing signs of early onset dementia in their early 40s. As yet, however, Twickenham is still awaiting precise details of the proposed legal proceedings and Sweeney believes his organisation would be insured in the event of any huge future payout.“I’ve got no reason to believe we wouldn’t be covered for this, but we’re not going into that detailed discussion until we see the nature of what is being submitted,” said Sweeney. “It’s hypothetical at this stage because we don’t know what ‘this’ is yet.”Given that the diagnosed iniduals so far include Thompson and Michael Lipman, both former England internationals who spent much of their club careers in the Premiership, the RFU is well aware of the potentially calamitous repercussions if rugby starts being perceived as too dangerous. “It would be disingenuous to say we’re not worried about reputational risk, but we certainly believe it is manageable,” said Sweeney.“We believe everything is being done – and will continue to be – to make sure rugby is a safe sport for kids to take up. We’re dealing with the white heat emotion of what is a really difficult human story … but most people understand the benefits you get from playing rugby. They still feel it’s a sport they get more out of than it takes out of them.”“But we do need to allay people’s fears and I think you do that by having a really balanced, fact-based conversation around what the issues are. We need the debate to be really factual and lay out all the detail. Then, as with so many things in life, there is a risk-reward balance that you make a decision on.“Our evidence shows that rugby is no more dangerous than other sports. But this is a journey with no conclusion to it. This is not a project with a start and finish date. As players get fitter and stronger we have to find ways to adapt.”To date, Sweeney has yet to speak personally to Thompson – the RFU says it had an out-of-date mobile number for him – but rugby director, Conor O’Shea, has been understandably moved by the former Northampton hooker’s diagnosis. “I find it really upsetting what is happening … but the game you see between England and France is not the same game your kid arrives down to play at under-8 level. The whole way through is graduated.”The financial effects of Covid-19, meanwhile, are set to cost the RFU £135m in revenue in the 2020‑21 financial year but Sweeney is predicting an overall loss of “only” £30m, partly as a result of the RFU cutting 165 roles and making savings of £30m. “The RFU business model is inherently still sound, but it will take a few more years to get back to being debt free,” he said.Sweeney also confirmed that discussions about the establishment of a new-look global fixture calendar are “still ongoing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/950861ade4fcbaa027d159d1df019f6826c3abb0/0_95_865_519/master/865.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=df22541eff1df76fea90bc3c737da7dd","title":"barbara windsor a life in pictures","story":"Beloved actor Barbara Windsor has died at the age of 83.

And what we’ve found has been nothing short of remarkable. As well as discovering stores stocked with hidden gems, we’ve found that local shopkeepers can also be fountains of knowledge and helpful advice – bringing a genuine passion to their wares and their trade.So, to make the most of the myriad benefits of shopping locally, be sure to ask your local shopkeeper questions that draw on their wealth of expertise. Not sure where to start? Here, seven independent local retailers offer their suggestions.Sean Cooper is the owner of Weyfish, a harbourside fishmonger in the historic Old Fish Market in Weymouth, Dorset. Produce lands daily on the quayside oppositeIs it caught locally? Is it fresh? “Provenance is critical to buying fish, and if it is fresh the monger should be able to tell you what boat landed it or, if not, which market it was bought from,” says Cooper.Can you prepare that for me? “A good fishmonger will display whole fish to demonstrate their freshness,” he says. “That same fishmonger should then be able to gut, scale, fillet and steak the fish while you wait.”How would you cook that?“A lot of customers want ideas for how to cook their purchase. Should it be grilled, baked, pan fried?”Amanda Allan is the owner of Heavenly Sensations, a hair, beauty and aesthetics specialist salon in Kirkcaldy, ScotlandCan I see your portfolio?“Before getting an aesthetic treatment, ask to see a portfolio of the therapist’s work,” says Allan. “And ask for a consultation before booking the actual treatment if you are unsure of anything.”What are the risks and costs involved? “Be sure to know about these – and the cost of any upkeep – before venturing forward then realising there are hidden costs.”I have an existing medical condition, will that affect the treatment? “On arrival, you should fill out a record card with up-to-date medical information, and treatments should not go ahead unless this form is completed.”Rachael Johnson is the owner of The Yesterday Society, a vintage clothes shop in Newcastle upon Tyne, north-east EnglandWhat size is this in current sizing?“Over the years the measurements used for different sizes have changed a lot, so when shopping for vintage you can’t assume that the size on the tag will be the same as that size today. I always advise customers to try items on to be sure they fit how they like before making a purchase.”How would you wash this?“The materials used in vintage clothing can be different to modern ‘easy-to-wash’ materials. Once you find that perfect vintage item, it’s a good idea to research how best to wash it to ensure it survives for many years to come.”What decade is this from? How would you style this?“I have a lot of customers who at first are nervous about wearing vintage as they don’t know how to style it without looking costumey. I personally don’t limit myself to one decade and much prefer wearing hybrid outfits from a range of vintage styles. Any wardrobe can benefit from a vintage piece or two, and these can be mixed with modern clothing to achieve a more quirky and stylish feel.”Kevin Fernandez is director of family-owned Rafi’s Spicebox, established by his mother Rafi in York, in 1989How old is this spice?“There is a belief that as spices are dry they have a long shelf life,” says Fernandez. “However, we believe that they are the best as fresh as possible and not stored for too long.”Can I purchase spices whole?“Roast and grind them when required – this will ensure the best flavour, as ground spices deteriorate quicker than whole spices.”What about its provenance?“It is imperative that spices are sourced from countries that produce them for their own consumption, and that the quality is the best it can be. At Rafi’s Spicebox, the vast majority of our spices are sourced from India, and we are very strict on ensuring the best quality available,” says Fernandez. “This does come at a price but it is definitely worth paying that bit more rather than getting tempted by bargains.”Stuart Andrew is a second-generation toy shop owner who runs Hal Whittaker, an independent toy retailer that’s been in Knutsford, Cheshire, since 1970What’s in or popular at the moment? “The toy industry is so fashion driven nowadays with crazes and trends,” he says. “As an independent, we have the ability to react and be in on a trend as soon as it becomes big.”Sarah Atkinson has spent her career working with animals, which led to her opening Bunny’s Moggy’s Doggy’s Pet Supplies in Chorley, Lancashire, with her husband, Neil, in 2011I’m thinking of buying this pet, what do I need?“Many animal purchases are impulse buys so the new owner won’t have done the research into what owning that animal entails,” says Atkinson. “Come in before you buy and we can give you a good understanding of what it’ll cost and what cage or equipment they may need.”What’s the best food I can give my pet? I’m looking to change my pet’s food, what do you recommend?“Choosing the right food involves many factors, including animal age, breed, energy requirements, budget, storage considerations and availability,” she says. “These are not questions that you’ll get answered in a supermarket or discount store.”Where is this raw food from and what is in it?“Raw feeding has been on the increase for many years,” says Atkinson. “Unlike some of those selling on social media, all raw meats sold via retailers are produced by Defra-licenced manufacturers, which offers traceability and knowledge of composition and backup support.”Simon Broadribb dreamed about becoming an award-winning butcher as a young teen and achieved his goal by taking ownership of Uptons of Bassett butchers in Southampton, Hampshire, 26 years agoWhere is your beef, lamb or pork from? Is it local or specially bred? Older or younger?“The latter affects the flavour and how tender the meat is,” says Broadribb.I’m making a curry, what cut would you recommend? “Here the cheapest cuts, such as beef cheek, chuck steak, lamb shoulder or even mutton chop, offer far more flavour and are cheaper.”Since Martha Brown opened the doors to Forge Bakehouse in 2012, it has become a firm favourite in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, later expanding to bigger premises and adding a cafeIf you have specific dietary requirements, ask what exactly is in each product “This is a real selling point for bakeries,” says Brown. “We can recommend breads to try if you think you struggle with gluten, for example.”What do you recommend? “This will often be met with: ‘What are you going to eat it with?’ as a response,” she says. “As well as the obvious pairings, staff have their own favourites and personal recommendations that they are always happy to share.”No question is too small or silly“Shopping in a bakery for your bread and pastries, you are able to ask whatever you want.”Dipak Patel is the owner of Saltaire Wines in Shipley, West Yorkshire, a specialist supplier of wines, spirits and beers, many of which are craft beers brewed locallyThis is what I was thinking of spending, what do you recommend?“Often the decision comes down to price in the end anyway, so it’s helpful to know the budget from the start,” says Patel.This is what I’m cooking, what goes well with it?“We get asked this question a lot, like what goes well with fish or red meat.”What’s newly in?“As specialist merchants, we get excited about stocking new products and items that are unusual and can’t be found anywhere else,” he says. “It’s great when we can share this with customers.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4873a5ac95d514a4308143e3afa31031c09ef6e/0_2249_5114_3068/master/5114.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=516a3a0b14c08e5d9f32aab020df30dd","title":"lets hear it for the locals a rallying cry to shop at independent retailers","story":"For local shopkeepers, your purchase means much more than a sale. Remember to support them over the festive season and beyondYou can walk to them in your pyjamas. You’re served by an actual person. You can even strike up a friendship, safe in the knowledge they’ll almost certainly never use the words: “Unexpected item in bagging area.”Local shops give our communities their character. They make our local high streets different to all the others. They’re the independent thinkers providing the heart and soul of our shopping experience – experiences that have increasingly been in danger of becoming anonymous digital wishlists.And, this year, many of us have discovered that they offer so much more besides. Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, our local shopkeepers have been like local superheroes, supplying us with crucial items that we never previously thought we’d risk running out of, transforming their online presence and delivering to our doorsteps.These benefits of shopping locally mean as much to merchants as they do to customers. Indeed, shop owners point out that having regular local customers enables them to plan for the future of their business and their staff. Others note that having more local customers vindicates the heroic efforts they’ve had to go to this year. As Kristina Currie, owner of Bon Tot, an Edinburgh-based independent kids’ clothing shop, says: “We feel every purchase, we appreciate every single pound. Every purchase is a vote of confidence in what we do and we want people to know that we value every single sale.”So as you complete your Christmas shopping, ask yourself: could I buy locally? To you, that item might just be a name crossed off a Christmas list, but to the shopkeepers, it’s another crucial step to paying their business rates or keeping the lights on. In a financially perilous year for the self-employed and independent traders, little purchases can go a long way.This is why it’s so important that we keep up the habit beyond Christmas, permanently reshaping our shopping patterns as we enter the new year. The more we all shop local, the more of a difference we’ll make. Not just to them, but to you as well. Because the longer we can all support their existence, the richer our lives and communities will be."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b08e67d45c554e1416a0d05e20f37399801fb0de/846_671_5154_3093/master/5154.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aec1f05050616f960bb1049e30f52d83","title":"we recommend things we love independent retailers on why shopping local is best","story":"From providing service with a friendly touch to stocking gems you can’t find anywhere else, local shopkeepers are vital to our communities – and the benefits go both waysYou could call it an extra level of customer care. Simon Broadribb, owner of the Uptons of Bassett butchers in Southampton, has a habit of bowing to those who visit his shop. “Some of the other butchers take the mickey out of me because I bow, but I want the customer to feel that we’re grateful,” he says. “Anyone can go to the supermarket and buy meat in there, so for them to spend their money with us is an honour.”Broadribb is not alone in feeling immense gratitude towards his customers, particularly after what has been such a difficult year for small independent retailers. Siân Wild, owner of The Flower Lounge in Didsbury, Manchester, feels much the same: “We’re so lucky that our residents have a strong sense of community and love to support local businesses, as it has been vital to us surviving this pandemic.”It ought to go without saying that this gratitude should run both ways – extending from us to the local shopkeepers who have gone above and beyond for us this year. To celebrate this special bond, we asked some shopkeepers about the meaningful relationships they have forged with their customers and their communities.The customer communitySarah Atkinson of Bunny’s Moggy’s Doggy’s Pet Supplies in Chorley, Lancashire, describes regular customers as part of an extended family that has long been looking out for each other. “We are a little community,” she says. “We watch their children and pets grow up and they us. We are very much a family unit.”Similarly, Rachael Johnson of vintage emporium The Yesterday Society in Newcastle says: “My customers mean the world to me and I now have great friendships with several of them.” This allows her to provide a level of personal service that would not otherwise be possible: “I have been known to contact my regulars if I get something that I think they will love or know they have been looking for.”Karen Harvey of Scottish Scandi homeware boutique Hoos in Glasgow, emphasises the importance of physical presence. “What’s really different about local shops is that the owner of the business is often present, and customers get to build a relationship with them,” she says. “At Hoos, it’s like a village store. You say: ‘How are you? How’s your grandchild?’ You get to admire the new baby when you’ve seen the mum come in while she’s pregnant.”This personal element is something many local retailers strive to maintain even as they’ve had to reorient their businesses this year. Despite having to pivot into e-commerce during the pandemic, Wild is dedicated to ensuring The Flower Lounge still provides customers “the personal touch that comes from buying locally – the feeling of purchasing something unique and handmade just for them”.The commercial communityCommercial success ripples out across the community as well. “We buy our bread from six miles down the road,” says Broadribb of his butchers. “We sell over 100 loaves per week, which supports Jim the baker. We also sell jam from a lady nearby and two local beers.”Atkinson points out that local shopkeepers are also the customers of other local businesses: “It’s so important to support local independent traders because your money is put back into the local economy – buying from us means we can shop and support local businesses. We source as many of our products as locally and independently as we can.”Paul Rawlinson of Baltzersen’s bakery in Harrogate agrees. “The unseen benefits of shopping local are that smaller businesses tend to support one another and the community through their supply chain, use of local tradespeople, engage with professional services and get involved with charities,” he says. “Shopping local keeps families in their homes and their businesses on the streets of our towns and cities where they belong.”A poignant reminder of these community connections was shared by Sean Cooper, boss of Weyfish, a harbourside fishmongers in Weymouth, Dorset. “We have 32 fishing boats that we buy from. Some of those don’t land every day, but around half of them do,” he says. “Come rain or shine, they’re out there.”“In a week when two fishermen were lost off the south coast, it’s a sobering reminder of what a dangerous profession it is,” he says. “Yes, we make a profit on what we buy from them. But we also make a contribution to the entire fishing community of Weymouth. That support makes a difference to so many families.”Connecting the two communitiesBy championing local suppliers, independent retailers effectively build bridges between business communities and customer communities. “We get to recommend the things we genuinely love, and in turn pass that knowledge to a customer to enjoy,” says Steve Courtnell of Pie and Vinyl in Southsea. “When discovering a new act or album, we can hopefully bring them the very same joy we felt.” Indeed, it’s that combination of passion and expertise that can make shopping local so magical."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9110394f01615431ce04fabc8e34ddbca00f5203/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=f7135c0607fab103b692f283240e4a00","title":"who accused conspiring italy remove damning covid report","story":"Exclusive: document intended to help prevent future deaths allegedly pulled from website after requestThe World Health Organization has been accused of conspiring with the Italian health ministry to remove a report revealing the country’s mismanagement at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic – the publication of which was intended to prevent future deaths.Italy was the first European country to become engulfed by the pandemic. The report, produced by the WHO scientist Francesco Zambon and 10 colleagues across Europe, was funded by Kuwait’s government with the objective of providing information to countries yet to be hit.Called An Unprecedented Challenge: Italy’s First Response to Covid-19, the document was published on the WHO website on 13 May before being taken down the next day, as first reported by the  in August. The 102-page report said Italy’s pandemic plan had not been updated since 2006 and that, due to being unprepared, the initial response from hospitals was “improvised, chaotic and creative”. It took time for formal guidance to become available, the report added.The document was allegedly removed at the request of Ranieri Guerra, the WHO’s assistant director general for strategic initiatives. Guerra was the director general for preventive health at the Italian health ministry between 2014 and late 2017, and was therefore responsible for updating the pandemic plan as per new guidelines laid out by the WHO and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Guerra is among the scientists on the Italian government’s Covid-19 taskforce.The outdated plan is a crucial element in the preliminary investigations being carried out by prosecutors in Bergamo – the Lombardy province hardest hit during the first wave of the pandemic – into possible criminal negligence by authorities. Covid-related deaths in Italy surpassed 60,000 on Sunday, the highest toll in mainland Europe.Investigators are also using a report compiled after the first wave by a retired army general, Pier Paolo Lunelli, which concluded that as many as 10,000 deaths may have been attributed to the lack of sufficient anti-pandemic protocols.Zambon, who is based at the WHO’s office in Venice, has been summoned three times to speak to prosecutors but has been prevented from doing so by the WHO, which has insisted he and the other 10 researchers involved in producing the report should have immunity from testifying. Only Guerra was heard by prosecutors in early November but the contents of the hearing have not been disclosed.After the first summons to Zambon and the other researchers was issued, the WHO said the regional prosecutors needed to follow diplomatic channels by making their request via Italy’s foreign ministry.Zambon’s latest summons was on 10 December, but again he was blocked from going despite requesting permission.“When I received the first summons I reported it to the WHO’s legal office and soon after they responded saying I couldn’t go as I was protected by immunity, despite the fact that I wanted to go as I had something to say,” Zambon told the .Zambon claims Guerra threatened him with job dismissal unless he modified the part of the text referring to the outdated plan. He said that despite informing senior WHO officials of the threats and risks posed to the organisation’s transparency and neutrality, no internal inquiry was carried out. At the time, the WHO did not explain why the report was removed but said in a statement last week that it “contained inaccuracies and inconsistencies”.“The report did not criticise the Italian government but highlighted the criticalities faced in the management of the pandemic, starting from the premise of the old pandemic plan, which was only ‘reconfirmed’ and not updated in 2017,” Zambon said. “The team thoroughly checked this and found that all the plans that came after 2006 were just copied and pasted – not a word or comma was changed in the text.”Zambon claims that a month before publication he sent an outline of the findings to Guerra, who shared it with Italy’s health minister, Roberto Speranza.Emails sent in May to Zambon by Guerra and Hans Kluge, the WHO’s Europe director – who also wrote the introduction of the removed document – also appear to reflect a pact made with the Italian health ministry to keep the report under wraps. The emails, seen by the , formed part of a recent documentary by Report, an investigative programme on the state TV channel, Rai.The WHO said in an emailed statement to the  on Thursday: “We are currently working with the Italian government to clear up the issue.” Referring to the removed document, the statement added: “While it was offline, a decision was taken to instead use a new mechanism created in the early months of the pandemic aimed at helping member states conduct intra-action reviews and assess their Covid-19 responses follow best practices prevent errors and update national strategic preparedness and response plans. The document was, therefore, not republished.“We understand that the issuance and subsequent removal of the report caused confusion and we have updated our publishing procedures accordingly.”Italy’s health ministry denied any involvement: “As far as we know, this is not an official WHO document and has never been sent to the ministry of health, which therefore has never assessed or commented on it. Any information pertaining to it does not come from institutional sources,” it said in a statement. Speranza recently said in an interview that the WHO “should be reformed and strengthened in order to increase transparency”.As of Thursday night, Guerra had not replied to a request for comment.If Bergamo prosecutors find that Italy had failed to update its pandemic plan, then all health ministers and prime ministers since 2013 risk facing trial. Antonio Chiappani, the chief prosecutor, told Corriere della Sera this week: “Italy was unprepared for Covid, there was a lot of improvisation … we need to find out why there are so many victims compared to elsewhere.”Zambon said the information contained in his report could have helped save lives in countries that were behind the pandemic curve.Luigi Di Maio, Italy’s foreign minister, sent out a strong signal to the WHO this week when he said he was “against immunities”. The WHO said in its statement that Guerra had spoken to prosecutors “in his personal capacity”. The statement added: “WHO (and UN) staff are international civil servants who undertake all activities impartially and without fear of retribution or expectation of favour. To preserve its objectivity and independence, WHO does not normally become involved in legal matters at the national level.”Zambon did not receive a formal refusal from the WHO preventing him from speaking to prosecutors on 10 December, but was informed on Wednesday night that the WHO had written to Italy’s foreign ministry, saying: “Zambon and other aforementioned WHO experts have been requested not to present themselves at these hearings.”Zambon said he was ready to collaborate with prosecutors, who have so far interviewed the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, and Speranza. He added that the reference to the report being “full of inaccuracies” was defamatory and that it had gone through all the required stages of checks.“It’s not about the consequences that I might suffer,” Zambon said. “I do this because I strongly believe that the world needs a transparent and independent WHO, which ultimately focuses on the people.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70679fd1a47b4955489d8ae5593cbdecd6277571/0_52_1121_672/master/1121.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05849785550e9c69b745f51a682edfef","title":"wuhan in then and now pictures","story":"In Wuhan, China, a city once at the centre of the Covid-19 pandemic, there have been no recorded cases of community transmissions since May.

And we activated our systems right away,” said Van Kerkhove. She hasn’t had a break since.Within days they knew it wasn’t Sars, it wasn’t Mers, it wasn’t flu, Legionella or a host of other pathogens. It was new.Van Kerkhove, who painstakingly explains developments in the pandemic twice a week at WHO’s briefings on Zoom, is a respiratory expert who had worked a lot on coronaviruses including Mers. “I immediately thought this could be a new coronavirus, because there are literally hundreds to thousands of coronaviruses that are circulating in animals,” she said. That’s why coronaviruses already featured in the WHO’s blueprint for needed epidemic research and development. The danger had been out there and recognised since Sars in 2003.We now know that by the time Van Kerkhove saw her email, at least 124 people had fallen ill and some had died in Hubei province after contracting a novel virus against which humans had no defence. Some will have been infected in mid-November. Almost all (119) were in the province’s capital city, Wuhan. The other five had all been there before they fell ill. Wuhan had excellent surveillance, as well as a world-class biosecure laboratory that would later fall under suspicion. The cluster was detected in Wuhan, but it is still possible it came from somewhere else.Patient zero may never be found. The first victim of the Ebola epidemic in east Africa turned out to be a toddler called Emile Ouamouno who died in a remote part of Guinea in December 2013. But Ebola is so lethal and so unlike most other diseases that the detective work was easier. Covid-19, as we now call it, looked like acute pneumonia when it killed frail and elderly people. And it is possible the first people to catch it had no symptoms.The market was closed by the Chinese authorities on 1 January and comprehensively cleaned and disinfected, which was helpful to hygiene but destroyed clues. Nonetheless, swab tests showed traces of the virus in areas where wild animals had been held. In late January, an inventory list emerged from the Da Zhong domestic and wild animals shop in the market that gave a flavour of the trade. It included live wolf pups, golden cicadas, scorpions, bamboo rats, squirrels, foxes, civets, salamanders, turtles and crocodiles. It sold assorted animal parts, such as crocodile tail, belly, tongue and intestines.Yet it is not certain that the virus came out of the market. It is possible that an infected human took it in, although nobody gives much credence to the latest assertions from the Chinese state media that it could have been someone outside the country’s borders. “Although China was the first to report cases, it doesn’t necessarily mean that the virus originated in China,” the foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a briefing in late November. “Origin tracing is an ongoing process that may involve multiple countries and regions.”For the safety of the entire world, it’s important to know. The WHO has been investigating since the outbreak began. Ideally, door-to-door detective work, talking to the first people to fall ill and their families and colleagues, would have begun in Wuhan in January. But the city was in lockdown its streets deserted. And the rest of the world had not yet understood what it was facing, said Bruce Aylward, the Canadian doctor and epidemiologist appointed by WHO to lead its fact-finding mission to China in early February.“From the moment you landed in China, you knew you were dealing with something very serious that the rest of the world wasn’t getting. You got off the plane and you were in an empty Beijing airport. It was absolutely stunning, your footsteps would echo through the great cavernous halls of Beijing airport, which is teeming day and night normally,” said Aylward.He was struck immediately by how seriously the government was taking the outbreak – and the cost to the country in every sense of such a comprehensive shutdown including closing borders. But at that stage China was doing what it needed to do – and what so many countries failed to do. It was stamping out the virus, not looking for the source.On 11 January, however, Chinese scientists handed the world an invaluable clue. On the day the first death (of a man who regularly visited the market) was reported, their genetic sequence of the novel virus was published.That is not enough. As with Sars and Mers, which are both coronaviruses with bat origins, there must have been an intermediate host. In March the virologists Eddie Holmes and Andrew Rambaut and others published a review of what can be deduced from the genetic data in the journal Nature. Specifically, the spike protein for which the new coronavirus has become famous has a “receptor binding domain” that will stick to a certain receptor – called ACE2 – on a human cell. Bat viruses don’t have that. But coronaviruses in Malayan pangolins do, they pointed out.Pangolins came under suspicion, but were not listed in the Huanan market, although that does not prove they were not there. But there are other animals that could conceivably pass such a virus to humans with which we are all far more familiar.Despite the strong genomic trail, excitable China-blaming theories took off on rightwing news websites and social media in April, alleging the virus had been made in the Wuhan Institute of Virology lab. They were dismissed in the Nature paper, whose first author was Kristian Andersen from the Scripps Research Institute in California. “Our analyses clearly show that Sars-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus,” it said.That was important to say, said Josie Golding, Wellcome’s epidemics lead: “It was a bunch of prominent researchers coming together to say this is why we don’t think it’s made in a lab: because you would never make a virus like this and there are too many links to other viruses that have been found in the wild.”Nor is it likely to have escaped accidentally from the Wuhan lab, said Golding, who used to work in a high containment facility in Pirbright, Surrey. The idea that one person got infected in the lab and spread it to the entire world is the stuff of movies, she said. “Show me the evidence … It just doesn’t seem very realistic.” It is far more likely that animals were infected and people picked up the virus from them.However it began, the advantage China and other Asian countries had was that they realised the threat. Aylward said many countries in the west still haven’t understood. China’s concern, having experienced Sars, was serious virus the west’s was serious disease. And that, for him, is why they have not ended their epidemics. If the west has 1,000 cases, it will put the 100 that are severe in hospital. “The other 900 – nobody has any idea where they are, I mean, you can’t win that way,” he said. “The huge difference was just that extraordinary effort ensuring that they effectively isolated all moderate or mild cases.”Regardless of where it came from – or blame – the only way to tackle a novel virus is to take it incredibly seriously. “China saw it as a serious virus from day one,” Aylward said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a007b63521bc9f4ebb037e2e38e14278a9776b25/3_0_7867_4724/master/7867.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0f4b756f0cf731577617189f9141c4d","title":"masked horses photographs by tim flach in pictures","story":"Wildlife photographer Tim Flach’s series Masked Horses speaks to the role of the horse as a companion to humankind over the ages.

It is also going to be a challenging time for shoppers, as they try to get organised for a Christmas like never before with more than 40 shopping days taken from them almost overnight.We know the problems all too well, but we know the solution, too, or at least part of it. The internet. But,\u0026nbspas we have said before and will say again,\u0026nbspshopping online comes with a caveat. As much as 70 per cent of Irish consumers’ virtual spending leaves the country as people shop overseas.It doesn’t have to be that way. As we are learning, there are many, many local sites that need our support this month and every month. If we could keep just 10 or 20 per cent of our online spend this year at home it would inject tens of millions of euro into our local economies. That would save jobs and keep businesses going.So our 100 became 200, and is now becoming 400.Jump to: Toys Food and drink Art and gifts Jewellery Clothes Books Music and tech Sporty stuff Health and beauty Everything elseTOYS nimblefingers.ie  A Dublin toyshop that has been making children and their parents happy for generations.

Finding someone comes down to intimate local knowledge of a townland – something postmen and postwomen have built up over the decades.  Photograph: Eric Luke On an afternoon in March five years ago, a small team of six people packed into a cramped office room in central Dublin’s Winetavern Street assigned the final Eircode to Ireland’s 2,277,037 addresses.It was Friday 13th. But despite the ominous date, Pat Donnelly, who had led the team over four years developing the world’s first national postcode system to identify every inidual address in a country was elated. “Because I was completely wrapped up in it for years, I thought the rest of Ireland would be just as interested. Then we launched and the country just shrugged its shoulders – it came as a big surprise,” he says. Donnelly, who runs AutoAddress – one of three companies (including Capita and Bearing Point) in the consortium that developed the system and which did “all the technical stuff” – admits he was “thin-skinned” at the indifference.Even worse was the stinging criticism that followed, with politicians and callers to phone-in radio shows queuing up to brand it a complete waste of €38 million in taxpayer’s money. But five years in, the country is taking to Eircode. Fresh figures from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications show 18.3 million searches for Eircodes on the online finder since the outbreak of the pandemic in March this year - a 42 per cent surge on the same period last year. In October alone, there were 2.75 million searches on the finder – the highest monthly figure since Eircode was launched in July 2015. Home deliveriesWhile the rise in home deliveries during the coronavirus lockdowns is behind much of this year’s increased usage of the postcodes, there had been an escalating upward trend before the outbreak. The National Ambulance Service credited it with the potential to save lives. But the main driver was Google Maps incorporating it into its system in October 2016. “People were saying ‘finally it’s useful’,” says Donnelly. “The vast majority of usage is on Google Maps. Everything from bouncy castle hire to plumbers, people ask for an Eircode. There was a guy delivering a bouncy castle to my house in Wexford and he said to me: ‘Eircode is great . . . because it turns out my left isn’t the same as everyone else’s left when they are giving me directions’.” Rural Ireland was quickest to embrace the system. This isn’t surprising when it was designed with them very much in mind. The biggest factor in deciding to develop - for the first time - a unique national postcode system which identified every single address inidually, rather than an area based postcode as used in other countries, was a uniquely Irish problem. About 30 per cent (almost 680,000) of homes in Ireland don’t have a house number or name. Finding someone comes down to intimate local knowledge of a townland – something postmen and postwomen have built up over the decades. The next nearest EU country to have a problem locating such addresses is Portugal. There, just 2 per cent of homes have no number or name. “Overseas companies looking for Irish addresses don’t understand that for many in rural areas their address is their name and their townland. That’s it,” says Donnelly. “If there are two Paddy Reillys, a father and son, living beside each other, the postman just determines that a guitar is probably for the younger one, and the letter from the pension company probably for the older. Then they can swap if it is wrong.”Allocation of schoolsAnother issue was postcode bias. The team behind Eircode didn’t want it used to determine areas which can lead to unfairness in the issuance of flood insurance cover, say, or the allocation of schools. Building the code was a laborious slog. “There is an awful lot of hidden design to make sure problems haven’t arisen,” says Donnelly. “And you get no thanks for problems that haven’t arisen.”Once the seven character formula was decided – the first three a “routing key” to define an area so An Post and others can sort mail, the final four a “unique identifier” pinpointing exactly an address’s location – there were a number of pitfalls to sidestep. Each code had to be memorable for an addressee. To avoid any confusion, the number of available letters and numbers had to be whittled down, so a capital B, for example, wasn’t mixed up with the number 8. M might sound like N over the phone, so one was dropped, the N. The team was left with 10 numbers and 15 letters to play with to identify all of Ireland’s addresses. Then there was the danger of inappropriate combinations being thrown up. “We took out Scrabble, an urban dictionary as well as three and four letter abbreviation dictionaries to make sure no code might cause offence,” Donnelly recalls. “At one stage someone in the office shouted: have we restricted M1LF yet? I decided then we need to build an office app – we can’t have an office where people are shouting things like that at each other. After that, anyone who thought of any inappropriate phrases just added them into the app.” Gaelgeoirs were also asked to suggest inappropriate Irish phrases. Once whittled down, Eircodes were “effectively pulled from a barrel, starting from the top which were most memorable” and assigned to each address in An Post’s GeoDirectory database. These were then checked again to make sure no two neighbouring codes were similar. Each four character unique identifier code has at least two differences to any other address within 300 metres. Donnelly says an analysis of his own company’s clients – AutoAddress provides address-finding technology to much of the country’s insurance, telecommunications, finance, eCommerce and food delivery companies as well as Government – took him by surprise some months ago. Last year, when asked to give an address or an Eircode on online forms or online shopping carts, 25 per cent of customers went with the code. This year, the figure has risen to just over 50 per cent – for the first time, more than half of people online are choosing an Eircode over their traditional address, according to the internal study. Other countries such Bulgaria and Malaysia are looking at copying the Irish model. “At the start, people were piling on, saying it was a complete waste of money, no-one is ever going to use it, it needs to be redesigned. Now there is an army of people who are saying it has made a big difference to their lives.”"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Five years after Paris, UN gathering an acid test of where world now stands on climate actionEU stands at crossroads on climate change and Ireland is heading in wrong directionTaoiseach claims \u0026lsquohistoric development\u0026rsquo as he emerges from marathon debate with fellow EU leaders"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4434301.1607707326!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"covid whistleblower investigator to examine handling of emails after complaint","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA staff member at Mary’s Hospital in the Phoenix Park raised concerns over access to personal protective equipment  early in the pandemic in a protected disclosure on May 6th. Photograph: Eric Luke An investigator examining a whistleblower’s concerns about Covid-19 protections at a HSE-run nursing home in Dublin has been asked to examine whether emails were removed from an IT system after their concerns were raised.Minutes of a HSE meeting covering the Dublin area on May 14th show that during a discussion about an investigation into claims made the previous week by a staff member at St Mary’s Hospital nursing home in Phoenix Park, health officials were told to “take emails off the system”.A staff member at the care facility, one of the worst-hit nursing homes in the country with 24 confirmed coronavirus-related deaths at the time, raised concerns over access to personal protective equipment (PPE) early in the pandemic in a protected disclosure on May 6th. The May 14th meeting was attended by HSE staff from community health organisation (CHO) covering the Dublin city area and staff from St Mary’s. According to the minutes, everyone in attendance was responsible for the direction and that it was to be carried out immediately.One member in attendance “advised to take any emails off the system”, the minutes state.In response to queries from The , a HSE spokeswoman said the action arising from the meeting of the Covid-19 team at the May 14th meeting was “to ensure all staff were aware of their obligations to comply with the HSE’s procedure for protected disclosure”.“I can confirm no request was made to remove emails and no emails were deleted. St Mary’s Hospital has fully co-operated with the investigation team and provided all information requested,” said the spokeswoman.She added: “We accept that the wording as highlighted does not reflect this clearly and we apologise for any confusion caused.”Freedom of Information requestThe minutes were included in records released by the HSE to the Fine Gael TD Fergus O’Dowd under a Freedom of Information Act request.Mr O’Dowd has asked investigator Gerry Rooney, who has been assigned to examine the whistleblower’s concerns, to seek a full explanation of what transpired at St Mary’s following the May 14th meeting and to interview all appropriate staff.“It is essential to fully address the issue of the possible removal of significant emails from the systems in St Mary’s,” the Fine Gael TD told Mr Rooney in an email.“I would ask you therefore to take whatever steps are necessary to secure and protect any possible other written records and, in particular, IT records on computer systems and laptops, phones, etc and have them examined by independent experts in this field.”Mr Rooney, managing director of Co Dublin-based mediation and dispute resolution company Acrux Consulting, told Mr O’Dowd the investigation would consider the matter.Two days before the May 14th meeting, the HSE appointed Mr Rooney as an independent investigator to examine the whistleblower’s claims after their protected disclosure was made to the HSE, the Department of Health and health service regulator, the Health Information and Quality Authority, under 2014 whistleblower legislation.Mr O’Dowd told The  the issue around the purported direction at the May 14th meeting must be “fully and properly examined” to check whether emails may or may not have been removed and if the emails tie in with the protected disclosure.

Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsPeople have been urged by the Government to do their Christmas shopping at off-peak times and on their own amid continued concern around the spread of coronavirus. The Government’s Regulators’ Forum met on Friday and heard reports of high levels of compliance to date in businesses and organisations that have been inspected. The forum is made up of Government departments, agencies and other bodies involved in compliance and enforcement of Covid-19 public health guidance and regulations In a statement on Saturday morning it said a high level of inspections would be continuing in the days ahead and the Garda would be continuing its compliance work “with high visibility patrols over the weekend, and the carrying out of checks of licensed premises under Operation Navigation.”The statement added that while the high level of compliance was welcomed, a number of “issues of concern” were raised including around Saturday’s All-Ireland camogie final, Sunday’s All-Ireland hurling final and Christmas shopping activity. “Ahead of a high profile weekend of sport, in particular for the GAA, the importance of supporting your team in a safe way was highlighted - fans and the hospitality sector are called upon to fully respect public health guidance,” it said. It said, where possible, “people are encouraged to shop at off-peak times, with many retailers having extended their opening hours to facilitate a safer shopping experience. “Shoppers are also encouraged to shop inidually where possible”. It said people should wear face masks in public areas in cluding busy outdoor spaces such as shopping streets and in queues.“Businesses are reminded that no organised indoor gatherings should take place. This means that restaurants and pubs operating as restaurants should not organise any events in their premises.”Intensive careThe number of people in ICU with Covid-19 has crept up in recent days and was at 35 on Saturday morning, with 190 people in hospital with the virus. On Friday night, chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan urged people to take responsibility for their own safety with activity ramping-up ahead of Christmas, as a further 313 cases and three deaths were reported.Dr Holohan stressed the importance of iniduals recognising the risks they find themselves exposed to. In it’s daily statement on Friday, the Department of Health said there has been a total of 75,507 confirmed cases of the disease and 2,120 related deaths since the pandemic reached Ireland.Of the latest 313 cases, there were 70 in Dublin, 31 in Mayo, 21 in Kilkenny, 19 in Donegal, 18 in Laois with the remaining 154 cases spread across 19 other counties. The median age of the cases was 35 years and 67 per cent were among under 45 years.Three of the top five worst areas in the country for the 14-day incidence rate of coronavirus are in Co Donegal, with Carndonagh’s rate more than six times the national average, latest official data released on Thursday night shows.The 14-day rate per 100,000 population is a useful measure of how the virus is spreading, and the Government tracks it across the country’s 166 local electoral areas. The 14-day rate across the Republic is 80.2 per 100,000 population.The updated figures on the Government’s data hub show the Covid 19 incidence rate in Carndonagh at 518.7 per 100,000 population. The figure in the Inishowen town has more than doubled from last week (271.2) and is almost 6.5 times the national rate.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4434237.1607703912!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"a no deal on january 1st now looks more likely than at any time since the dawn of brexit","story":"Speaking after an EU meeting in Brussels, Taoiseach Micheál Martin has said that he hopes a last minute trade deal can be struck between the United Kingdom and the European Union. Video: Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Micheál Martin  at the EU summit in Brussels on Friday. Photograph:AFP via Getty ImageThe familiar rituals of the season: Christmas trees were going up all over Europe and Brexit returned to dominate the political agenda in Dublin, London and Brussels.It will continue to dominate in the coming days as the clock ticks down towards December 31st, when, finally, after months of prevarication and procrastination, decisions will have to be taken.The Irish Government followed closely the progress of the stuttering negotiations in Brussels between Michel Barnier’s European Commission team and the British negotiators led by Sir David Frost.In government, officialdom and business, Dublin is far more attuned to the realities of a no-deal Brexit in comparison to London. People in constant contact with their counterparts in London say that the British on the whole are astonishingly complacent about a no-deal. One person compares it to the insouciance of the British Covid response. That bodes well neither for the prospects of a deal nor for the management of a no-deal if it comes.Taoiseach Micheál Martin has quietly cultivated a relationship with Ursula von der Leyen – giving her the commissioner she wanted in Maireád McGuinness was important in that process – and he remained in close contact with the European Commission president early in the week through texts and calls until the two met in Brussels on Friday.More surprisingly, perhaps, he has also maintained personal contact with Boris Johnson, and the two men also kept in touch during the week.At one stage Martin missed a call from the British prime minister while he was on his feet in the Dáil, indicating the informal nature of the communications channel – it was not a call set up by officials – and perhaps the impulsive nature of Johnson’s management of these things. That’s one of the things that alarms the highly process-driven Brussels bureaucracy.Much of the detail of the negotiations was shrouded in secrecy, but it was plain early in the week that the difficulties over fisheries, the “level playing field” – the need for the UK not to gain a competitive advantage over EU products by lowering standards – and governance of any new agreement were as acute as ever. They may yet turn out to be insurmountable.The tense exchanges and diplomatic efforts to read the tea leaves were reminiscent of the past Christmas crunches over Brexit – last year and 2017 – but there was one important difference this time: the question of the Irish Border was not centre stage.Critical deadlineEach time the Brexit negotiations have come to a critical deadline – in the countdown to the joint declaration of 2017, and to the Withdrawal Agreement of last year – the Irish question has been central. But not now. The signing of the Northern Irish protocol last year and the agreement of the British government this week to implement its provisions meant that Ireland has no longer been in the crosshairs.Many observers – including such veterans of EU deal-making as former taoiseach Bertie Ahern – had warned that there was an acute danger for Ireland if the Border became the last obstacle to a final agreement. But that danger has been averted by two things.Firstly, by the agreement of last year in which Johnson reversed his aversion to treating the North substantially differently from the rest of the UK , and, secondly, by US pressure in recent weeks, pushing the British into agreement on the implementation plan. That has taken Ireland out of spotlight , much to the relief of the Government.Last year’s withdrawal agreement represents one of the most significant foreign policy achievements of any Irish government, says one Minister. It gave concrete form to the EU’s adoption of Irish interests as core EU priorities since Brexit began.After three years of patient Irish diplomacy and politics, the full weight of the EU was thrown behind Irish interests to at times British incomprehension and irritation. “People miss the significance of that,” the Minister says.The agreement on the implementation of that plan this week, when British minister Michael Gove and commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic issued a joint plan, demonstrated not just that EU support was unwavering, but that Irish diplomacy could be effective on the other side of the Atlantic as well. The warnings from Washington were clear: that the UK failing to keep its word on Northern Ireland would have consequences when it came to a US-UK trade deal in the future.That some of these warnings came directly from the president-elect of the United States piled further pressure on the British government.Pretty mutedBut such satisfaction as there is in Dublin about all this is pretty muted. The truth is that a no-deal on January 1st now looks more likely than at any time since the dawn of Brexit.For much of the last four years few people in the wider government circle have believed it would come to pass: now they do. Taoiseach Micheál Martin has told people privately that he thinks it the more likely outcome, and has been urging his fellow EU leaders to keep the space open for a deal.At home Ministers were left in no doubt about the scale of the potential disruption to trade and the economy when Simon Coveney briefed them at Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting.Despite the mitigating measures in the Northern Ireland protocol, which mean the Government is not facing the reality of conducting checks on good at or near the Border, many Irish exporters face crippling tariffs entering the UK market. The consequences for the agri-food industry are especially grim. Many businesses will be pitched into a full-scale crisis. The Government has plans to help, but the shock will be severe.It is not yet unavoidable. If Martin is pessimistic, some senior officials still believe a deal is more likely, not least because they believe it is so self-evidently in both the UK’s national interest and Johnson’s political interest.There is great focus on the personality and psychology of the British prime minister. Borisology. However, it remains an inexact science. While both von der Leyen and Martin say privately that they believe Johnson wants a deal, it is also clear that he is willing to flirt with – even if he is not logistically prepared for – a no-deal.Moral characterThere is general agreement on the assessment of Johnson’s moral character – it is not favourable – in Dublin, in Brussels and in European capitals. But there is no fixed view on what he is likely to do in the coming days.Tánaiste Leo Varadkar essayed on Morning Ireland this week the view that the “real” Boris was “much closer to the more liberal London mayor that he was than the more conservative Brexiteer”. But this was based on hope as much as analysis.The “real Boris”, according to several Irish figures close to the issue, is the one who famously described his attitude to cake as “pro-having it and pro-eating it”. But he will now have to decide between those two alternatives.The UK can have access to the EU’s single market and observe its rules, or it can decide on its own rules and have its access to the single market duly restricted – it can’t have both. And it never could.The overriding attitude at the summit, according to insiders, is not a desire to get a deal at all costs, but impatience that Brexit is still paralysing so much of the EU’s bandwidth.For most it is a minor issue, with little direct effect. Von der Leyen and others wanted no talk about Brexit at the summit, believing that tempers would only harden.There is still an opening for a deal, but it is closing, and closing fast.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Chung Sung-JunGetty ImagesMore than 71.1 million cases of coronavirus have been recorded worldwide with more than 1.5 million deaths, according to the latest data from Johns Hopkins University. The following is a summary of the latest developments on the virus around the world:UKScientists and government advisers have urged people to rethink Christmas plans and ignore the easing of Covid rules amid fears over rising cases and hospitalisations in parts of the UK. While “Christmas bubbles” let three households mix between December 23rd and 27th, experts warned ministers were sending the wrong message by saying families must simply “follow the rules” - suggesting this could lead to a third wave with just weeks to go until mass vaccinations protect society’s most vulnerable. Official data suggests Covid cases are rising in some parts of the UK, including London, raising concerns that more areas will need to be placed under tighter restrictions. On Friday, the R number for England was estimated to be between 0.8 to 1.0, with concerns that the epidemic could be growing in some parts of the country including London and the east of England. The R number for the UK as a whole was estimated to be between 0.9 and 1.0, up from 0.8 to 1.0 the week before. Hospitalisations have plateaued in the past week but are rising in some parts of the country including London and the southeast, NHS England admissions data to December 8th shows. The data has led scientists to urge people to rethink their festive plans. The latest rises in London, Kent and Essex, concentrated among children aged 11 to 18, makes the concerns more acute. Increases in infection rates in young people eventually lead to a rise in infections among older people. On Thursday health secretary Matt Hancock announced mass testing in schools in these areas.The number of new cases per day in England is now similar to levels seen in early October, while hospital admission figures are similar to those of mid-November, with 1,466 admissions on December 7th. About a third of upper-tier local authorities in England recorded an increase in case rates between the week before lockdown began and December 6th. Medway in Kent, which is now in tier 3, reported the largest rise, with rates increasing by almost 300 per cent.GermanyGerman chancellor Angela Merkel is scheduled to discuss on Sunday a tightening of lockdown restrictions with state leaders as coronavirus infections rise and amid growing calls for action, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.Germany has been in partial lockdown for six weeks, with bars and restaurants closed but shops and schools open. Some regions have already imposed tougher measures.The discussions on Sunday will include whether shops should be closed before the Christmas holiday and the timing of such a move, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity.Economy minister Peter Altmaier told the RND newspaper group on Saturday that hospital intensive care units were beginning to be stretched to their limits and that Germany couldn’t wait until after Christmas to react.“We have to clarify how things will continue now,” he said. “Otherwise the pandemic will get completely out of control.”Germany, which has Europe’s largest economy, was more successful than many European countries in keeping the pandemic under control in the first wave in March and April, but it has been struggling to turn the tide in the second wave with what has been dubbed a “lockdown lite”.Daily new coronavirus infections have climbed to 28,438, while the daily death toll was 496, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Saturday.RussiaRussia confirmed 28,137 new coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours on Saturday, including 6,622 in Moscow, pushing the national tally to 2,625,848 since the pandemic began.Authorities said 560 people had died overnight, taking the official death toll to 46,453.UkraineThe World Bank has approved an additional loan of $300 million to help Ukraine’s government support low-income families amid the novel coronavirus pandemic, the bank said late on Friday. “The new funds will help finance Ukraine’s Covid-19 social protection emergency response by introducing fast cash transfers to iniduals and households who have lost their jobs or income sources because of the pandemic,” it said in a statement. The new assistance will be added to the first tranche of $150 million provided in April under the Social Safety Nets Modernisation Project as the bank projected that poverty in Ukraine could increase by 4 per cent , reaching around 23 per cent by the end of 2020. Ukraine has registered 12,811 new coronavirus cases in the past 24 hours, bringing the total number to 885,039 with 14,998 deaths since the pandemic started. The government had decided to introduce tight lockdown restrictions from January 8th, hoping to stop the rapid spread of Covid-19 infections.USThe United States said it authorised the use of Pfizer Inc’s Covid-19 vaccine on Friday, with the first inoculations expected within days, marking a turning point in a country where the pandemic has killed more than 295,000 people. The US Food and Drug Administration granted an emergency use authorization for the vaccine, developed with German partner BioNTech, which was shown to be 95 per cent effective in preventing the disease in a late-stage trial. It said the vaccine can be given to people aged 16 and older. Healthcare workers and elderly people in long-term care facilities are expected to be the main recipients of a first round of 2.9 million doses this month. BioNTech chief executive Ugur Sahin said the vaccine “will help to save lives across the United States and could accelerate a return to normality.” US health authorities, shipping services, hospitals and pharmacies have been readying a nationwide inoculation campaign. Pfizer said it would start shipping immediately and state public health systems have been planning to begin shots as early as Monday. California’s new cases rose to a record with intensive-care availability at a low. Indoor dining at New York eateries will halt on Monday, dealing a setback to social and economic life, after the city breached virus benchmarks.MexicoMexico’s health agency Cofepris approved Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine for emergency use, deputy health minister Hugo Lopez-Gatell said at a press conference Friday night. The health agency began reviewing data on the vaccine November 26th and a 24-member committee voted unanimously to approve its use, according to a statement. Mexico joins the UK, Canada and the US as countries that have granted emergency use of the Pfizer vaccine. It’s the first country in Latin America to do so. Mr Lopez-Gatell made the announcement moments before presenting numbers that show Covid-19 is still spreading rapidly in Mexico, especially in its capital. The health ministry reported 12,253 new cases, bringing the total to 1,229,379, and making it the fourth day straight the country has seen infections rise by more than 11,000. Deaths rose by 693 to 113,019. Mexico has the the fourth highest number of Covid-19 fatalities after the US, Brazil and India, according to Johns Hopkins University data. Hospitalisations in the capital of Mexico City have been accelerating, Lopez-Gatell said. Occupancy of beds with ventilators, used to care for patients with the most serious cases, has reached 62 per cent . While Mexico has avoided enacting strict lockdowns to stem the spread of the virus, Mr Lopez-Gatell implored Mexico City residents to stay home except for essential activity and avoid parties and gatherings.BrazilBrazil reported 53,030 additional confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus in the past 24 hours and 646 deaths from Covid-19, the health ministry said on Friday. The South American country has now registered 6,834,829 cases since the pandemic began, while the official death toll has risen to 180,411, according to ministry data. Brazil has the world’s second highest death toll behind the United States and the third highest case count behind the United States and India.South KoreaSouth Korea reported a record 950 daily coronavirus cases on Saturday, exceeding the late February peak of 909, with the president calling the country’s third wave of Covid-19 an “emergency”. The South Korean authorities warned they may tighten social-distancing restrictions to their strictest level but held off for now. Of the Friday cases reported by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA), 928 were locally transmitted and 22 were imported, bringing the total to 41,736 infections with 578 deaths. More than 70 per cent the domestically transmitted cases were from Seoul and its neighbouring areas, where about half of the nation’s 52 million people live. “This is indeed an emergency situation,” said president Moon Jae-in, ordering the mobilisation of police, military personnel and public medical doctors in an effort to curb the further spread of the coronavirus, chiefly driven by small, widespread clusters.–, Bloomberg, PA, ReutersEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4435367.1607763221!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"us authorises use of pfizer s covid vaccine with first doses to be given monday","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPfizer said it would start shipping immediately and state public health systems have been planning to begin shots as early as Monday.

It said the vaccine can be given to people aged 16 and older.Healthcare workers and elderly people in long-term care facilities are expected to be the main recipients of a first round of 2.9 million doses this month.BioNTech chief executive Ugur Sahin said the vaccine “will help to save lives across the United States and could accelerate a return to normality.”US health authorities, shipping services, hospitals and pharmacies have been readying a nationwide inoculation campaign. Pfizer said it would start shipping immediately and state public health systems have been planning to begin shots as early as Monday.The government plans to accelerate vaccinations in the coming weeks and months, especially if a second vaccine from Moderna Inc is quickly approved. An advisory group to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will meet on Saturday to make crucial recommendations about whether some groups such as pregnant women and 16-year-olds should be immunised.The authorisation comes as cases are surging in the United States, with thousands of deaths per day, while hospital intensive care units across the country are nearing capacity, threatening to overwhelm healthcare systems.“It is one step in a sequence of steps that will bring this pandemic to an end,” said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.He added: “A lot of people will be infected, a lot will be hospitalised and a lot will die before the vaccine is able to have a meaningful impact on spread.”The PfizerBioNTech vaccine was first approved in Britain earlier this month, and UK residents began receiving the shots on Tuesday. Canada also authorized the vaccine and expects to start inoculations next week.Mexico, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia have also approved the Pfizer vaccine.US president Donald Trump, in a video posted on Twitter, trumpeted the achievement and blamed China for the pandemic. Critics have said his focus on China was aimed at deflecting attention from his missteps in combating the pandemic.“The United States is the first nation in the world to produce a verifiably safe and effective vaccine. Today’s achievement is a reminder of America’s unlimited potential,” Mr Trump said.Complex challengesOthers with vaccines in advanced development include Moderna, which could win emergency US authorisation as soon as next week, AstraZeneca Plc with Oxford University, and Johnson \u0026amp Johnson.BioNTech began developing the vaccine in January, using a technology called synthetic messenger RNA (mRNA) that had yet to produce an approved product. The technology uses a chemical messenger to instruct cells to make proteins that mimic part of the new coronavirus, which the immune system learns to recognise as an invader. BioNTech struck a development deal with Pfizer in March.The vaccine comes with complex distribution challenges as it must be shipped and stored at -70 celsius, requiring specialised ultra-cold freezers or supplies of dry ice.Moderna’s vaccine employs the same technology but does not need to be stored at sub-Arctic temperatures.Pfizer has developed a special shipping container that will be filled with dry ice to keep the vaccine from spoiling. Many states are concerned about whether there is enough dry ice for shipments to rural areas that lack the specialised freezers, but Pfizer believes there should be sufficient supply.US health officials have said they will have enough to supply all of the 330 million US residents who wish to be vaccinated by the middle of 2021.‘Herd immunity’The US government has ordered 100 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine - enough to inoculate 50 million people - through its Operation Warp Speed virus development programme and could negotiate for more. The status of those talks are unclear.Pfizer board member and former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in an interview with CNBC earlier this week that the company had offered to sell the United States more doses as recently as last month but had been turned down.The United States has agreed to buy 200 million doses of Moderna’s two-dose vaccine. The government also has supply deals with J\u0026ampJ and AstraZeneca, but authorisation of those vaccines are not imminent.Top US infectious diseases expert Dr Anthony Fauci said if distribution goes well and enough Americans agree to get vaccinated, relief for a pandemic weary nation may be on the horizon, with enough immunisations providing safety for the ‘herd’ of collective society.“By the end of summer or end of third quarter, we may actually have enough herd immunity protecting our society,” he said.– Reuters Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons december 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlTo order The 2020 limited-edition Matt Christmas jigsaw, go to telegraphcartoonjigsawsOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178How the UK will get Pfizer\u0026#39s Covid vaccine from factory to patientHouse owner pulls out of sale at eleventh hour after Banksy paints mural on his wallThe priority list for the Pfizer vaccine - and how it will be rolled outCoronavirus latest news: Pfizer Covid vaccine approved by US authoritiesTaking the drug Ecstasy appears to help solve marriage problems, scientists discoverThe hospitals that will have the Covid-19 vaccine, and how it will be rolled outWhat exactly is the Pfizer vaccine, who will get it, and is it safe? Covid-19 vaccine: Latest updates on Oxford, Moderna and Pfizer breakthroughs - and who will get it first?Royal Navy prepares to protect British fishing waters if there is no dealWhy London could be facing Tier 3 lockdown restrictionsHow long will it take for life to return to normal after the Covid vaccine rollout?No-deal Brexit odds - what are the chances of the UK leaving the EU without a trade deal?When does a Brexit deal need to be done by?What no-deal Brexit means, how it might happen, and how it might affect daily life in the UKBrexit Day 2020: When is the UK due to leave the EU and how will it happen?Brexit deal: what has been agreed, and what happens next?What are the new tier system rules, and when will Covid restrictions end?Schools face being sued if they close early for ChristmasHow to watch multi-coloured Geminid meteor shower this weekendComment: Footballers aren’t Marxists.

Welcome to Covid Christmas. At least going to church this festive season will provide your family with some semblance of normality.Think again. Just as there was no room at the inn for the Holy Family as Mary and Joseph arrived in Bethlehem, so it’s likely there will be little room in the pew for you and your own loved ones at church this Christmas.Church worship has been a seesaw experience during the pandemic. First there was full church closure, then limited opening for private prayer, progress to socially-distanced services, back to lockdown and now services are allowed again.During the deep lockdown of early spring, the Church of England upset many when it ordered church doors to be locked and its clergy took to their kitchen tables and livestreamed from there. The Roman Catholic Church, also mindful of contagion, directed churchgoers to livestreaming of Mass but kept its priests at their altars, broadcasting solitary services.A week into Advent, doors have opened again after public health experts showed that masks, sanitiser and regular cleaning make church buildings safe spaces. Regular churchgoers now regard QR codes, no handshaking at the sign of peace and definitely no congregational singing with its risky aerosol particles as the norm. Choirs, though, have returned.  Given that most parishes have congregations small enough to accommodate even when socially distanced, church services have gone pretty smoothly. But Christmas itself is different. People who usually only go to church for hatching, matching and dispatching add Christmas to their attendance. Tis the season to be jolly and to do God as well. They want to hear that the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us. Singing O Come All Ye Faithful with gusto matters, even if the rest of the year they are, well, pretty faith-lite. The hush that falls as people queue up for Communion while Silent Night is sung, soft as a lullaby, means it truly is Christmas.Covid has put paid to that. The usual rugby scrum for a seat will not be happening. From the grandest cathedrals to the snuggest village chapel, it will be ticket-only for Christmas services. But word has not got round – if Channel 4’s Gogglebox is a sounding board for the nation. Blackpool-based Pete, hearing a news report that the pubs will not be open all hours this Christmas, turned to his little sister Sophie and suggested: “There’s always altar wine at Midnight Mass”. Only if you’ve booked your perch, Pete. The Church of England has already recommended to vicars and cathedral deans that they set up a booking and seat allocation system for all Christmas services. “Let everyone know that attendance must be booked”, its guidance says.One alternative is first come, first served. But lengthy queues with people getting crosser and too close for comfort will hardly encourage the Christmas spirit and could even be lethal. And first come first served would also mean last to arrive, first to miss out. It could turn people off churchgoing for good at just the moment when research suggests people have been rethinking their values during the pandemic and wondering if religion is for them. Considerable numbers have tried church by watching online in the privacy of their home. But Christmas is Christmas: people need smells and bells, music, candlelight, sonorous voices intoning the Gospel and a high solo treble rising to the rafters, not peering at a flickering screen.So, however tough the year has been, and however tired they are, this is the moment when our clergy need to step up and welcome as many people as safely as possible to church this December 24 and 25. That might mean cutting the usual hour-long celebration to half an hour and doubling the number of services held. What about open air events? Think of those outdoor heaters beloved of pubs or the braziers people once used to roast chestnuts. They could keep a frosty gathering cosy. With the heavens twinkling above, what better way to remember that star leading people onward to the Christ child in the Bethlehem stable.When Boris Johnson announced the Government’s relaxation of restrictions for Christmas, it was a recognition that after all the sacrifices people have made, families really do need to be together at Christmas. A true celebration is a communal experience and religion too is about people gathering together. For most of us wanting to mark the birth of Christ, a digital, streamed experience just isn’t enough. We need the comfort and joy of being together, even if we are a safe two metres apart. And if the churches can’t help us do that, it really will be a bleak midwinter.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"cash usage boosted thirst beer scotch eggs","story":"Thirst for beer and scotch eggs has boosted cash use, Link revealed as new data showed that more people took money out during the second lockdown than the first.Figures from the company, which operates the cash machine network, showed that cash withdrawals were down by 47 per cent year-on-year during the November lockdown, falling from 139 million to 73 million.This compares to a drop of 60 per cent in April at the height of the first lockdown when a smaller number of people were withdrawing larger amounts of money than normal, the data showed.Graham Mott, from Link, said the increased resilience of cash usage could be because people are less fearful of the virus and are no longer afraid of being infected by notes and coins.Research by the company showed that in the summer around 30 per cent of people said they were taking extra precautions when handling cash, whereas that number has now fallen to 17 per cent.The Bank of England has said that the risk of catching Covid-19 from banknotes is very low as the virus does not survive for very long on that type of surface.Mr Mott also said that the return to school, prompting quick cash withdrawals on the school run, and the reopening of pubs, cafes and restaurants had led to greater cash usage.He added: “We\u0027ve seen more pubs and restaurants stay open in recent months offering takeaway alternatives. “I think almost certainly people want to support local businesses, especially the pub, so our thirst for beer and scotch eggs may be one reason we\u0027re using more cash.There have been warnings that coronavirus has hastened the decline of cash with experts saying the system of providing free access to those who need it cannot cope with such a steep fall in usage.An estimated two million people still largely rely on it for day-to-day spending.The Government has promised to legislate to protect access for the most vulnerable and in October the Treasury announced plans to allow people to get cashback from shops without buying anything.A similar trial is underway in four towns around the country.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"no deal not inevitable fast becoming viable option","story":"Negotiations are the way each side works out what the other really wants. That is obvious. Slightly less obvious, but equally important, is the fact that they also force each side to work out what it wants.In most Brexit matters, Boris Johnson is guided by the principle that one should study Theresa May’s example – and then avoid it. Although she publicly stated early on that “No deal is better than a bad deal”, Mrs May accepted the framing and sequencing of negotiations which Brussels proposed. She did not know what she wanted. So the EU understood from the start that she did not mean what she said. A bad deal was therefore inevitable, and duly arrived. That is why she was forced from office.As foreign secretary, Boris watched these events unfold, and resigned. He then became party leader and Prime Minister. He got the first half of a Brexit deal, partly by insisting that no deal was a genuine possibility. He resoundingly won the ensuing general election by saying “Get Brexit done”. That victory was a year ago today, and tomorrow is the deadline for agreement – or lack of it – between Britain and the EU over the Brexit second half, our future trading relationship after we leave the single market and customs union on December 31.It is not credible that Boris will use the weekend of the anniversary of his victory to capitulate.Cynical though one must be about some of his promises, doubtful though one sometimes feels about his strength of purpose, such a surrender would not make sense. It would end his political career.I must admit that when the Prime Minister flew off for dinner with Ursula von der Leyen on Wednesday, I feared he was breaking his “Don’t do a Theresa” rule. It reminded me of her embarrassing dawn flight to Brussels three years ago to “seal a deal” that could not work. Boris has additionally promised to fly anywhere – Berlin, Paris – which might help. Are such journeys really necessary? It would be better if he stayed put and avoided getting into a compromising position alone in a room with any EU leader.His leading officials, Lord Frost and Oliver Lewis, are long-marchers from Vote Leave days. They know what they are doing. But so far, no harm has come of his journey. And he does, to be fair, have an interest in showing the wider world that he will not be the one to collapse the talks.Compared with the latter half of 2019, Boris is, on the European issue, in an oddly strong position today. Then, he had no reliable majority in a Parliament that was trying to usurp executive power. Most MPs opposed a genuine Brexit, but his party members, and the original decision of 17.4 million voters, supported it.He was in the tightest of corners. He got out of it with the Withdrawal Agreement which the EU – to many people’s surprise – granted him. It contained problems for the future relationship, notably about Northern Ireland, but it did the trick.Now, the Prime Minister has an 80-strong majority. His reputation may have been dented by erratic policy over Covid-19, but no one else within or outside his party is about to take over, and it is four years until the next general election.There has been more fuss about Ireland, and the Government’s threat to break international law to defend our customs territory but this week, the clouds parted, revealing an Irish rainbow. The EU conceded on the Protocol: it will ensure that nearly 100 per cent of goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will pay no tariffs. As it had secretly planned, the Government duly withdrew the relevant clauses from the UK Internal Market Bill.In the current negotiations, Boris enjoys what could almost be called a luxury. Of the three possibilities – a real deal, no deal, and the deal currently proposed by Michel Barnier – he would be happy with either of the first two. He would prefer the first, because a deal would bring more peace and less disruption than no deal at all, but he is content to accept the logic of no deal if a bad one is the alternative.The one thing he cannot say is that he will accept automatic EU control of any new trading rules which it may decide to make, and of our fish. As both sides agree, our decision to leave the EU is a decision to erge, not converge. We haven’t got this far out only to go back in later.The EU negotiators, and especially the French, may have reckoned, as they hardened their positions ten days ago, that the fear of no deal would force Britain to back down at the last minute. If so, that was a psychological misreading.Perhaps I am being oversanguine, but I think the public see this. They think – and in essence, if not in detail – they are right, that the key decision has been made. They are irritated by delay. Literally years of scare stories about no deal may have depressed the spirits, but they have also vaccinated people against what might come.The problems are real, but not eternal. The preparations, though still not good enough, are better advanced. It is not going to be pleasant for us – or, indeed, for the French – if President Macron tries to coerce local officials in the Pas-de-Calais to impede our goods, but it is hardly going to rekindle our enthusiasm for EU membership.Most Conservative MPs see all this. Perhaps they cannot have their cake and eat it, but they know which side their political bread is buttered. Besides, they have not got the mechanism to reject no deal, even if they wanted to. It is what will happen if nothing else does.Politically, the situation reminds me of the miners’ strike in 1984-85. Appalling and prolonged though the contest was, the most dangerous bits for the Government were whenever it seemed to wobble on the principles at stake. It was a fight it just had to win. As in that struggle, Labour MPs today, under their fairly new leader, are visibly confused about which line to take.What of EU leaders themselves? In the longer term, they would do better to be flexible. The United Kingdom, even outside, will remain a major market for the continentals. The sooner that can be maximised, you would have thought, the better. There are more intractable problems for them to consider – Covid, lack of growth, mutualised debt, quarrels with Poland and Hungary, threats from China.At present, however, the protectionist club seems to feel it must punish the British rebel. The mood is brittle, as if the EU fears that an independent Britain could actually succeed, thus exposing its own economic and governmental model. It is acting like an empire that grows old and starts losing colonies, rather than an internationalist model for more backward nations. Which only confirms we are right to leave altogether.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sadiq khan unveils plans 350 entry charge journey london","story":"Drivers could be forced to pay a £3.50 “entry charge” to journey into London every day, under plans unveiled by Sadiq Khan.The Mayor of London has asked Transport for London officials to investigate the “feasibility” of introducing the Greater London boundary charge.While a flat fee has been proposed, the charge could be devised on a sliding scale, with the most polluting vehicles paying the highest rates.However, critics have argued that the fee would amount to a “surcharge on workers” who drive into the city.The proposal means that motorists could face £31 to travel into the capital, when coupled with the £15 central London congestion charge and £12.50 ultra-low emission zone (Ulez), which expands to the suburbs on October 25 next year.The charge is one of a series of options suggested as a way of restoring the transport body’s finances, after it was forced to ask for two Government bailouts worth more than £3 billion this year.Mr Khan said: If ministers aren\u0027t prepared to play fair, then we will need to consider other options to address this unfairness, such as asking people who live outside London and make journeys into Greater London by car to pay a modest charge, which would be reinvested in London\u0027s transport network.Mr Khan\u0027s plan would involve drivers with vehicles registered outside London having to pay once they enter an outer borough such as Croydon, Enfield, Hillingdon and Havering.The President of the AA Edmund King warned that an “entry charge” could “backfire” on the mayor.He said: Many of the vehicles that cross the London boundary are essential service vehicles such as plumbers and electricians, or vehicles of key workers and shift workers who can\u0027t afford to live in the capital.Such a charge would basically be a surcharge on workers. Few people just drive into London for fun as most have a job to do.The £3.50 daily fee would raise an estimated £500 million a year to invest in London\u0027s transport system and would not be introduced for two years.The proposal is being drawn up as an alternative to a reform of the rules on vehicle excise duty (VED), of which only a fraction is handed back to the capital.A spokesman for the mayor said he has broad powers to launch such schemes to achieve his transport strategy.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"schools close last week term could face legal action ministers","story":"At least one council has already told some of its schools that it would support them to move to online learning only for the last week of term, and secondary schools across London and the South East are expected to tell parents that they will be closing early for the holidays. Headteachers whose schools do stay open also intend to turn a blind eye if parents choose to keep their children at home, The  understands.   However, senior sources at the Department for Education (DfE) warned schools and councils that it would be prepared to apply for High Court injunctions to force them to stay open.   Presdales School, an academy in Hertfordshire, is the first school in the country to be told it could be taken to court over its plans to move to remote learning at the end of term. According to Office for National Statistics infection data for England as a whole, rates of infection are now highest among secondary school age children – those aged 11 to 16. Ministers announced on Friday that for those who have come into contact with someone confirmed to have coronavirus, the amount of time to self isolate will be cut from 14 to 10 days. This means Monday is effectively the cut off point when someone could come into contact with an infected person and still spend Christmas with their extended family. In a bid to keep schools open, mass testing is being rolled out at secondary schools in parts of London, Kent and Essex. But the announcement that mobile testing units are urgently being sent to schools across the capital is said to have “spooked” parents.Headteachers are braced for a marked drop in attendance during the final week of term as parents “vote with their feet” and keep their children at home rather than risk having to cancel Christmas plans if their child gets infected.Parents who fail to send their children to school next week are unlikely to be fined, The  understands, meaning families will effectively be given a free hand to act as they please.Geoff Barton, general secretary at the Association of School and College Leaders, said that headteachers will not be minded to fine parents who fail to send their children to school next week.“What the season of goodwill is definitely not about is sending fines out to parents,” he said.Ordinarily, children are only allowed to miss school if they are too ill to go in or if they have advance permission from the headteachers.Parents can be issued with £60 fines if their children are absent with no good reason, which doubles to £120 if it is not paid within 21 days. If it is not paid after 28 days, parents face prosecution by their local authority.But it is up to inidual headteachers to choose how they record children’s absence and whether they report it to the local authority.Downing Street has insisted that keeping classrooms open is a “national priority” and ministers are keen to avoid any more periods of closure after children missed up to six months of school during the national lockdown earlier this year.The Education Secretary was given emergency powers under the Coronavirus Act to override the desires of a school’s headteacher and governing body and force them to stay open.Presdales School, which has since confirmed that it will remain open for all pupils until next Friday, was sent a “minded to direct” letter from the DfE and told that unless it backed down it would face legal action.Government officials are in contact with Essex County Council chiefs in an attempt to pressure them to change course after they announced that they will support headteachers in Basildon who want to move to remote learning next week.The Welsh Government has told schools to move to online learning from Monday. The Government is also adamant that exams should go ahead next summer, and any further periods of school closures could throw this into doubt.This week the Scottish Government announced that all exams would be cancelled for the second year in a row. Mr Barton said that the Health Secretary’s “dramatic” and last-minute announcement about mass testing in schools “may have the unintended consequence of spooking everyone”.He went on: “There is an increasing sense that young people just aren’t coming into school.  I think there will be a lot of parents who will take decisions into their own hands.“They will just vote with their feet and say ‘I would prefer my children to be at home, I don’t want the risk of my child being in school’.”On Friday, the DfE sought to reassure parents, with the regional school commissioner for the East and North East of England saying that the testing programme is not directly linked to transmission in schools or colleges.   A DfE spokesperson said: “We are prioritising children’s and young people’s education and wellbeing, by keeping nurseries, schools, colleges and universities open.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph weekly news quizwhere uks first doses pfizers covid","story":"In the week that Margaret Keenan became the first Briton to receive a Covid vaccine as part of the NHS\u0027s roll out of the Pfizer jab, the \u0027s weekly news quiz is here to find out how closely you have been paying attention to this week\u0027s headlines. The moment that the first few people rolled up their sleeves to receive the coronavirus vaccine on Tuesday morning will be regarded as a historic intervention in the fight against coronavirus, but where in the UK were the first doses administered? Elsewhere this week, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge boarded the Royal Train for the first time, setting off on a festive three-day journey to pay tribute to those who have gone above and beyond. Who were they serenaded by as they boarded the Royal Train for the UK tour?If you\u0027ve been reading this week\u0027s  Front Page newsletters you will have come across all of the answers to the quiz.

Cambridge University academics, those well-known defenders of conservatism, have seen off an attempt by a tiny band of radicals to impose a policy of blanket censorship on campus. In the process, they have revealed that the “woke” activists are not, as they claim, a grassroots movement commanding overwhelming majority support, but a small sect of fanatics. This sect has been defeated, roundly, abjectly, in its own intellectual breeding ground.The argument began in March. Under pressure from the Cambridge student union, university authorities decided to introduce a new “statement on freedom of speech” that, in true Orwellian fashion, did the opposite of what its title suggested. It would have required that everyone on campus, scholars, speakers and students, “be respectful” of “differing opinions” and “erse identities”. What this “respect” should entail was not defined, but it is clear that it would not mean respecting the “differing views” of Cambridge fellows like Noah Carl, who was fired last year for defending sceptical attitudes towards immigration and arguing for free scientific inquiry into genes and intelligence. The new policy, for example, listed various grounds on which the university could ban speakers, including the idea that they might threaten the “welfare” of anyone on campus, again without defining what this meant.Alarmed at the implications, a philosophy don called Arif Ahmed decided to take a professional risk. He was already on the advisory council of an outfit called the Free Speech Union (as am I), but he had not yet done anything to attract special attention from woke activists. Nonetheless, he set about gathering 25 signatures from fellow academics needed to force a vote on the matter. Doing so was not easy. Academics were afraid of being attacked by the same mob who had gotten Dr Carl fired. Eventually, however, he reached his target.He and his allies tabled amendments to the policy, replacing the demand for “respect” with a requirement for “tolerance”, deleting the list of reasons to ban speakers and replacing it with a commitment to allow all speakers so long as they didn’t break the law, libel or harass anyone. At this point, Cambridge could have decided to negotiate. It would have been a straightforward matter for the university council to endorse the uncontroversial idea of “tolerance” or else solicit the views of its faculty and students outside the coterie making the decisions. Instead, the council dug in.Months later, Cambridge finally staged the vote. The result, thought to be unprecedented in its 800 year history, was a monumental defeat for the university bigwigs. Out of nearly 1,700 academics who voted, just 162 supported the new policy. Over 200 voted for no change and 1,316 voted to introduce the tolerance policy proposed by Dr Ahmed. His allies ranged from radical feminists to Christian conservatives, libertarians and old-school Left-wingers worried about the free speech rights of university staff. If vice chancellors were MPs, then Cambridge’s Stephen Toope has just become the Michael Portillo of the academic world.Like Portillo in 1997, Professor Toope ought to be feeling thoroughly ridiculous. The strident woke activists, who argue that “speech is violence” or biology is “transphobic”, turn out to be a tiny minority even among the faculty of Britain’s most famously reformist academic institution. They have been winning battles to disinvite speakers and fire people not by broad-based support, but by convincing institutional elites of their power using aggression and intimidation. Like a chump, Cambridge’s top governing body fell for it.Thankfully, in this case, the university rulebook took the decision out of their hands. But that isn’t usually how it works. The usual playbook is for activists to bamboozle administrators and PR departments with petitions, threats and online pile-ons, frightening, guilt-tripping and shaming people into submission. Those who refuse, like Sophie Watson, a radical feminist Cambridge student who supported Dr Ahmed’s campaign, find that erstwhile friends “have simply stopped talking to me”, leaving her with “a sense of unease” on campus.This “unease” is a potent weapon. Rather than make their case in open argument, the enemies of free speech prefer to isolate their opponents, attacking their backgrounds and labelling them untouchable “bigots”. If their attacks seem beside the point under discussion, it is because they are not aiming at the point. They are aiming at the opaque levers of power wielded by corporate procedures and human resources departments.But the Cambridge vote gives reason for hope. The woke activists aren’t as powerful as they seem. They play on a sense of fear and people’s need to belong. But it turns out that they, in fact, are the aberration, the affront to decency and reasonableness, whose power comes only from our belief in it. What if universities, multinationals and public bodies, confronted with a demand to fire someone for questioning “white privilege”, debating colonial history or reading Right-wing newspapers, simply said “no”? Perhaps the sky wouldn’t fall in.The Free Speech Union has been trying to turn the tide of attacks on free expression, often by writing to public or corporate bodies to point out their obligations under their own codes of conduct or their legal duties to employees. Sometimes, you have to fight procedure with procedure, defining and enforcing the laws that protect our freedoms, especially when a person’s livelihood is at stake.Ultimately, however, the argument against “no platforming” and its ilk will be won by the very thing it tries to suppress: open debate. Most people don’t subscribe to gender or critical race theory or intersectionality or whatever other ideology these activists deploy. They understand the world is complex, that most “categories” of people have some good and some bad in them. Once our bureaucratic elites grasp that they are being petitioned by a tiny but noisy group of extremists, perhaps they will find the courage to withstand the assault. Our institutions are cowering before a paper tiger.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"multi coloured geminid meteor shower how watch","story":"A multi-coloured meteor shower will be particularly bright this year because the Moon won\u0027t get in the way, the Royal Astronomical Society has said.Stargazers across the northern hemisphere could see as many as 70 meteors an hour this coming Sunday, as the Earth passes through a cloud of cometary dust.The celestial display of shooting stars will be particularly prominent as it will be a new Moon meaning it won’t be visible in the sky to interfere with the view.“Although some Meteors are very bright, some are significantly fainter and so to get the best possible view you need a dark sky.“If there was a full moon in the sky then the whole sky would glow softly and that would mean you’d see fewer meteors,” explained Robert Massey Deputy Executive Director at RAS.The Geminid meteor shower, which returns every December, is expected to peak some time during the night of December 13 and will be visible until the early morning of December 14. The Geminids originate from a rocky asteroid called 3200 Phaethon with a comet-like orbit, and were first observed in 1862.The meteors, small pieces of interplanetary debris, appear to radiate from near the bright star Castor in the constellation Gemini.Friction with the upper atmosphere heats up the incoming debris, causing the air around them to glow brightly.This leads to streaks of light that are also known as shooting stars.According to the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, the Geminids are unusual as they can be multi-coloured - mainly white, some yellow and a few green, red and blue.These colours are partly caused by the presence of traces of metals like sodium and calcium, the same effect that is used to make fireworks colourful, experts at the Royal Observatory said.To see the shower, observers should look upwards after 10pm UK time on Sunday, when the radiant will be high in the south-eastern sky, experts at the Royal Astronomical Society said.The best views are always away from city lights, but with a clear sky even urban skywatchers should see at least a few meteors, they added.The showers will continue to be visible until December 17.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"one year election government keeping promises","story":"The unprecedented battle against coronavirus may make it seem like a lifetime ago now, but the General Election was in fact just a year ago today. Nobody could have predicted what the year following Boris’ victory would hold in store, and a huge national effort has been needed to get through this toughest of times. But despite everything that has happened this year, we haven\u0027t forgotten the promises that  readers elected us on. Even while fighting this virus tooth and nail, we have been delivering on the People’s Priorities.As Home Secretary, keeping you, your family and our country safe is my number one responsibility. One of our key election promises to you was to recruit and put an extra 20,000 police officers on our streets to cut crime, and I’m delighted that one year in, we have already recruited nearly 6,000 more officers across the country. These officers will help us stamp down on knife crime, county lines drug gangs and violent offenders and we will continue recruiting more officers over the years to come. As well as having more bobbies on the beat, it’s important our brave officers have both the powers and tools to protect themselves and the public when dealing with weapon wielding thugs. In our manifesto, we promised to give our police new powers, resources and funding they need to keep themselves safe. We have kept to that promise, providing funding to equip more officers with Tasers and giving the police the biggest funding increase in a decade. We are backing the police to keep us safe. All too often in our criminal justice system, the rights and needs of victims seems to have played second fiddle to the rights of criminals. Just last week, Labour MPs were writing to me to stop the deportation of foreign murderers and rapists, with not a second thought for the feelings of their victims. We promised in our manifesto to increase support for the victims of crime, particularly victims of sexual violence and domestic abuse and we have delivered.This Conservative Government has demonstrated that it will stand by the hardworking majority, not the criminal minority. Stand with the brave men and women of our police and security services. And against the criminals. The gang leaders, drug barons, thugs and terrorists who seek to do us harm. 2021 will see us continue to do that without apology, no matter how much the Labour party virtue signal and shout.Another key promise we made a year ago was to honour the referendum result, leave the EU and end free movement. Despite the best efforts of the Labour party and Sir Keir Starmer, who voted against our Withdrawal Agreement to leave the EU, we left on January 31 earlier this year. And just last month, we passed our Immigration Act through Parliament. This puts into law the end of free movement, and paved the way for the introduction of our new points-based immigration system, where people who want to come here are judged on their skills and what they can offer, not where they are from.Sir Keir ordered his Labour MPs to vote against this, too, but with the votes of our brilliant new Conservative MPs, we got this key piece of legislation passed to take back control of our borders at last. The Labour leader claims new leadership, but it’s just more of the same out-of-touch approach to the EU, crime and immigration. Elsewhere across the government, my colleagues have also been delivering on manifesto promises. In March, we passed our NHS Funding Act, enshrining into law our £34 billion cash increase for the NHS, which has once again stood resolute in the face of huge pressures through this crisis. We’ve ensured every secondary school gets a minimum £5,000 per pupil funding from this academic year, helping our kids to get the best start in life. And our £3.6 billion Towns Fund is funding high street upgrades and local projects in towns across the country. There’s no doubt this has been one of the toughest years our country has faced in my lifetime. Fighting coronavirus has demanded so much of us all. But this Government has not forgotten the pledges you elected us on. From recruiting more police officers, to regaining control of our borders, we will build back stronger and better from this crisis.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"70 families not able visit","story":"News% of families not able to visit loved ones in care homes during the pandemicA report by Age UK found families feared lack of contact with their loved ones in care homes led to the deterioration of their healthmirrorShareCommentsByGeorgia MulraineLizzy BuchanPolitical Correspondent:,  DEC NewsCampaigners raised concerns that many will not see their loved ones before Christmas \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

A report by Age UK found friends and family of care home residents felt the lack of contact with loved ones has led to the deterioration of their health. One woman told the charity how her mother, who had mild dementia, stopped eating and drinking and “just gave up”. She was only able to see her mother in the final two weeks before she died in September. Care homes were devastated by the virus at the start of the pandemic, with nearly , deaths linked to Covid- between March and June. Visits were banned until July to protect vulnerable people and the Department of Health and Social Care provided iPads to help those in care homes in touch with their families. But the report found that those who said they had been unable to visit their loved one since the start of the pandemic did not find digital and phone communication good alternatives to in-person visits. Progress on making proper visits the norm has stalled, with some care homes worried about insurance issues or the accuracy of rapid tests. Caroline Abrahams, Charity Director of Age UK, said it was “extremely disappointing” that many older people and their loved ones are still waiting to meet up. “While these debates go on, far too many older people and their families are stuck in limbo, agonising over whether they’ll ever see each other again,” she said. Shadow Minister Liz Kendall said: “Ministers must support care homes to resume visits as quickly as possible, and back this up with the resources to make this happen. “Families must be reunited before Christmas.” Judy Downey, chairwoman of the Relatives and Residents Association, said the overwhelming majority of calls to its helpline continue to be about banned or restricted visits. She said: Government guidance seems to give people hope and then take it away. The confusion about visits is compounded by the chaos of the lateral flow tests.

The two leaders have agreed to make a decision on the future of the negotiations by the end of the weekend. Speaking to reporters on a visit to Blyth in Northumberland, Mr Johnson said: Unfortunately at the moment, as you know, there are two key things where we just canapost seem to make progress. And thataposs this kind of ratchet clause theyaposve got in to keep the UK locked in to whatever they want to do in terms of legislation, which obviously doesnapost work. And then there is the whole issue of fish where weaposve got to be able to take back control of our waters. So there is a way to go - weaposre hopeful that progress can be made. But Iaposve got to tell that from where I stand now, here in Blyth, it is looking very, very likely that we will have to go for a solution that I think would be wonderful for the UK, and weaposd be able to do exactly what we want from January. It obviously would be dferent from what weaposd set out to achieve but I have no doubt this country can get ready and, as I say, come out on World Trade terms.  Earlier Mrs von der Leyen said the UK would be free to decide whether to follow suit each time the EU changes its regulations - thoughit refused the bloc would adapt the conditions for access to its markets. French president Emmanuel Macron meanwhile insisted he was not demanding to have my cake and eat it in response to a question on the EUaposs proposals that the blocaposs fishermen would be able to continue to access UK waters for a year in a no-deal. Chief negotiators Michel Barnier and Lord Frost are continuing talks in Brussels after Mr Johnson and Mrs von der Leyen agreed at a dinner on Wednesday to resume negotiations ahead of a decision on the future of talks this weekend. Downing Street declined to deny reports that Mr Johnson had requested calls with the leaders of France and Germany but was rejected, after he said he would be willing toto Brussels - or head to Paris or Berlin - to get a deal over the line. If we donapost make enough progress on three key issues - fish, EU rules and governance - over the weekend it could be curtains for a trade deal. That could mean we crash out of EU rules without a trade pact - with tarfs and paperwork being slapped on much of the UK’s £bn a year in trade with the EU from January . Food could become more expensive in the supermarket and deliveries could be held up by bureaucracy at the border. The Budget watchdog says it could cut GDP by % in  and delay our Covid recovery by almost a year. It’s a far cry from when Boris Johnson said in : “There is no plan for no deal because we are going to get a great deal.” And it’s hardly the “oven-ready” deal the Prime Minister promised the British people he had in last year’s election. So what are the three sticking points  Why hasn’t the so-called “oven-ready deal” been as tasty as we hoped  And when might the deadlock end  Here’s what you need to know.What is the deal we’re trying to agree  The UK is trying to agree a Free Trade Agreement with the EU for when the Brexit transition period ends on December . This would allow us to enjoy cheaper, easier trade with our nearest neighbours thanwe crashed out of the EU with no pact. While no deal will be as seamless as EU membership, Brexiteers say an FTA is a way of having our cake and eating it. We could make our own laws while also paying smaller tarfs and having less bureaucracy than a nation with no trade deal.  If we don’t get a deal, EU trading rules will end on New Year’s Eve and slap billions in tarfs overnight on essential goods. Britain is also negotiating trade deals with dozens of other countries like Japan but the EU is far, far more important. In  the EU accounted for almost half of UK trade - £bn. The second-placed US counted for £bn. Japan, £bn. And our economy has been used to tarf-free EU trade for decades, meaning any change on January  could be a big shock. How is this dferent from Boris Johnson’s ‘oven-ready deal’   You may remember Boris Johnson won the election by promising to ‘get Brexit done’. He said: “We’ve got a deal that’s oven-ready. We’ve just got to put it in at gas mark four, give it  minutes and Bob’s your uncle.” But his “oven-ready” deal was only the Withdrawal Agreement to leave the EU. That agreement didn’t actually guarantee how any trade would work after . Call it clever wording, call it lies - however you look at it, the ‘oven-ready’ deal doesn’t help us much now. It’s like he put an empty pie casing in the oven to blind-bake, but hadn’t mixed any of the filling together yet. Brexit trade deal talks have been held up over three issues which the EU and UK canapost agree. They are: Fishing: The two sides are split over two issues - quotas and access. In -, % of the fish in UK waters was caught by EU boats and % by UK boats. Britain wants both more quota to catch its own fish, and ultimate control over who accesses the waters. Reports suggested the EU was prepared to% of its current quotas to UK fishermen, but Britain demanded %. The UK offered a three-year transition to having control, but the EU reportedly wanted  years. Level playing field: This means how closely we follow EU rules in the future. The UK wants to be free to set its own laws in areas like labour, environment, climate, sustainable development and subsidies for businesses . Britain wants to be allowed to “give an undertaking” that it won’t “renege” on environment or other standards, but the EU demanded equivalence, with the UK effectively mirroring EU rules in future, in what officials branded a last-minute ambush by the French. Governance: The final key dispute is about how any future disagreements between the UK and the EU on trade are resolved. The UK is confident there will be no role for the European Court of Justice but the exact arrangements are still being drawn up. For more information click here. The EU and UK have been negotiating an agreement since Spring, but since about the summer talks have been deadlocked. They are stuck on three issues - fishing rights, the ‘level playing field’ and how any deal will be policed . Talks missed deadlines of mid-October and mid-November, before coming to what the UK claimed was almost a breakthrough. But the EU then “added a whole load of additional demands”, according to Environment Secretary George Eustice. UK officials believe French President Emmanuel Macron was behind the new harder position. Adding to this, there’s a row over Boris Johnson planning to break international law. The UK Internal Market Bill - due in the Commons on Monday - will give the UK ultimate power over the rules for goods travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. This would breach the Withdrawal Agreementwhich the UK and EU signed last year. Back then, Boris Johnson promised to arbitrate those rules via a joint committee.  Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen were having dinner on Wednesday night. But even then,talks did not break up they were expected to resume in the following days rather than a deal being announced between the two leaders alone. There is nothing to stop talks continuing even after Christmas Day - although a trade deal needs to be ratied by the UK and EU Parliaments by December . Any deal ideally wanted to be agreed by EU leaders at a summit this week before being signed off by the European Parliament before New Year. The three sticking points explained Fishing  The UK and EU each want as much fish as possible from UK waters after December . But it’s not as simple as just barring all EU fishermen. There needs to be a negotiation - otherwise UK fleets would struggle to access EU waters, or sell their fish into EU markets. The first key point is quotas - whether UK boats will be allowed to catch more fish in their own waters than they do now. In -, % of the fish in UK waters was caught by EU boats and % by UK boats. Reports suggested the EU was prepared to% of its current quotas to UK fishermen, but Britain said this wasn’t enough and wanted around %. Environment Secretary George Eustice said: “The EU have suggested a very modest increase that they would tolerate the UK having of the fish in its own waters. But given we only have half the fish in our own waters now, that simply wouldn’t be possible.” Quotas cover many issues but not all of them - because fish move around the seas. The other key point is over access - both to the territorial waters within  miles of UK soil, and a -mile economic exclusion zone around its coastline. UK sources say the EU essentially wants the same access as it enjoys now under the Common Fisheries Policy. That is unacceptable to UK officials, who say they want to control access to UK waters - even , in reality, EU fleets will be let in anyway. Mr Eustice said the EU was trying to get access to UK waters “in perpetuity” rather than agreeing three years at a time. “Such a suggestion really is quite ludicrous and not consistent with international law,” he said. Itaposs thought the UK is looking at a three-year transition period to new access arrangements, but the EU wanted  years.

Fears are growing that Chancellor Rishi Sunak will slash those million claimants’ benefits back in a major cut to Universal Credit.Ministers will only decide in the new year what UC claimants will get, so they will be left in the dark over Christmas. Charities and campaigners warn cutting Universal Credit in April will plunge hundreds of thousands into poverty.Despite the thin gruel rises to most benefits, the state pension going up by .%. So what are the full rates and what’s happening to most benefits, pensions and Universal Credit  Here’s what you need to know. What’s happening to Universal Credit   Officially, this week’s benefit rates say the standard allowance of Universal Credit will rise from £. to £.. That’s an increase of £. per month for over-s. But that’s not true, because the standard allowance is currently £. due to an extra £-a-week coronavirus boost. That meansthe benefit “rise” goes ahead as planned, but the £ boost is axed, it will actually be a cut of £. a month. Chancellor Rishi Sunak is still deciding whether to extend the £-a-week boost beyond April . Mr Sunak is understood to be open to the idea - but is still reluctant to confirm any extension and allies are stressing it was only “temporary”.  Allies are reluctant to add the sum permanently to government spending documents - as it would be a rise of at least £bn a year. Once a benefit rise becomes official and permanent, it has to appear dferently on government accounts. Any announcement may only come weeks before the deadline, a source told the Mirror. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation have warned a £,-a-year cut would “pull many people under” and leave them “destitute”. Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Jonathan Reynolds accused the DWP of deception for leaving the £ rise out of this week’s rates. He said: “This dishonesty will only cause confusion to the millions of people relying on Universal Credit. “It is unthinkable that the Government are still on course to cut Universal Credit by £ a week for  million families next year. “The Government should spend less time trying to spin their cuts and more time supporting people through this economic crisis.” "},{"url":null,"title":"keir starmers vision win 2024","story":"NewsKeir Starmers vision to win in  - economy, love of Britain and voters trustEXCLUSIVE: Labour Leader Keir Starmer spoke to the Mirror via Zoom and set out his vision for bringing Labour back to power after  years of Tory rule has led to Boris Johnsons triple failuremirrorShareCommentsByPippa CrerarDaily Mirror Political Editor:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror incoming video boris-johnson-very-very-likely-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

In its latest weekly update, the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies , which has been helping to guide the Government through the pandemic, said it is no longer confident R in every English region is below . The crucial number could be as high as . in London, the South East and the East, with new infections rising by as much as -% each day in those regions, less than a week before the Government decides whether to move cities and towns out of their current tiers. Englandaposs overall R number, between . and ., was unchanged from a week ago. For the whole of the UK, the R number, which measures how fast Covid- is spreading, has moved slightly to .-. from .-. a week ago, but the number of new infections is shrinking by between zero and % every day. Have you been affected by coronavirus  Email webnews@mirror. An R number between . and  means that on average every  people infected will infect between  and  other people. Two weeks ago, the UKaposs R rate fell below  for the first time in three months to between . and .. If the R value is above one then the Covid- epidemic can grow exponentially, butit is below one it shows the outbreak is in retreat. London and Essex are at risk of being moved into Tier  due to rising infection rates, while places in the North could finally escape the toughest category.  These are the latest values by region, with the R number followed by the growth rate, based on data up to December : - UK: .-., -% to % - England: .-., -% to % - East of England: .-., -% to +% - London: .-., -% to +% - South East: .-., -% to +% - Midlands: .-., -% to -% - South West: .-., -% to % - North East and Yorkshire: .-., -% to -% - North West: .-., -% to -% A Sage statement read: The R estimate for England remains broadly consistent with previous weeks, at between . and ..  All NHS England regions have R estimates that are below or span . This suggests that the epidemic continues to shrink in some NHS England regions and Sage is confident that this is the case in the North West and North East and Yorkshire. Sage is not confident that R is currently below  in the East of England, London, and South East. The estimates for R and the growth rate are provided by the Scientic Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling , a sub-group of Sage. The growth rate, which estimates how quickly the number of infections is changing day by day, is between minus % and zero for the UK as a whole. It means the number of new infections is shrinking by between zero and % every day. Estimates for R and growth rates are shown as a range and the true values are likely to lie within this range, according to the experts. Sage also said the figures published on Friday more accurately represent the average situation over the past few weeks rather than the present situation.  Meanwhile, Professor Sir David Spiegelhalter, a Sage member, talking in a personal capacity, warned that Covid- is killing , more people a month than normal and family gatherings at Christmas could only make things worse. He told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: The downward trend that happened after the higher tiers and lockdown has now stopped, cases are going up.,  deaths a day in the UK - thataposs about , a month. And these are real deaths. These are extra deaths that would not have happened normally. They are from Covid, they are not just with Covid. He added: I am sure people wanted a downward trend before Christmas to produce a, kind of, buffer before the Christmas season, because there is bound to be some effect. Now, I wouldnapost want to say what the size of that effect is going to be because it depends crucially on peopleaposs behaviour. And, how much they obey the rules and are sensible. Asked about why there would be a Christmas impact on Covid, he told Today: Because there will be more travel. People will be mixing. And we can just see how behaviour just influences things.  Sir David said: This could be just a blip, and it might not be that big, I wouldnapost want to say. I think we need to look beyond that towards the whole winter, I think. We canapost make this disappear and we canapost let it get out of control. And, it wonapost get out of control... that wonapost be allowed to happen. So, itaposs keeping a lid on it.

And with hope on the horizon in the form of a vaccine youaposd be forgiven for not having given too much thought to what  is going to happen in .But there are some pretty major changes to the law coming in within a matter of weeks - and most of them are tied to Brexit.Whether thereaposs a deal or no deal everything from travelling abroad, healthcare and mobile phone charges are set to be effected. We have rounded up a number of the new laws taking effect in  - some connected to the B word and others not. From immigration laws tolaws have a read below to see what changes next year has in store for you..Freedom of movement ends and a new immigration system comes inThe UKaposs freedom of movement within the EU - which gives people from EU membership countries the right to live and work abroad - will end on December . A new point-based system will then replace it, much like they have in Australia. From January, jobs offered to non-UK workers must have a skill level of aposRQFapos or above . Workers must also be able to speak English and secure a salary from their sponsor that meets the threshold - £, or the going rate for the job, whichever is higher. Workers who earn less than £, but no less than £, can still apply to work in the UK by apostradingapos points against their salary - i.e.the role is in a aposshortage occupationapos such as certain science roles, engineering jobs, some IT and business jobs, medical roles and veterinarians.You can view the full list here. The skilled worker visa will cost between £ and £, per person unless they have skills that the UK needs more of. EU citizens , or people from Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, who are living and working in the UK will need to apply to continue living in the UK after December , this year..Drivers to be banned from picking up mobile phones  Tighter laws surrounding using mobile phones are set to come in next year. In , there were  casualties on Britain’s roads – including  deaths and  serious injuries – in crashes where a driver using a mobile was a contributory factor. The government has been consulting on current laws around mobile phones in cars in a bid to make it illegal in all circumstances. Currently, it is only illegal to make and receive calls and texts while behind the wheel. But there is no law stopping drivers from taking photographs, playing games or even scrolling through music playlists. This is because doing any of these are not classed as interactive communication, which is the definition of the offence. Changes to make this legal loophole obsolete are underway and are expected to be introduced in the spring. .UK travellers banned from entering EU after January  due to coronavirus  Brits are set to be banned from travelling to Europe when the transition period ends in January, according to reports. Strictly speaking this would only be a temporary change but itaposs an example of how Covid- and Brexit makes for a double whammy. Currently, Brits are still allowed to travel to large chunks of the continent under freedom of movement rules. But from New Yearaposs Day, when the United Kingdom leaves the European Union either with or without a deal, that will change. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab admitted travel could be disrupted across Europe as a result.Due to the pandemic, EU countries only allow non-essential travel from non-EU countries with low  coronavirus  infection rates.Currently only travellers from eight such countries are allowed travel into the EU, according to a report in the Financial Times. EU officials told the FT there was no proposal to add the UK to that list of safe nations, which includes Australia, New Zealand and Singapore. Some EU member states do not even allow in travellers from countries on the safe list, reflecting the hard battle much of Europe is facing to control coronavirus infection rates. .End to free mobile roaming for Brits in Europe    UK mobile phone users currently get free data roaming across the whole of the EU.But after January , Brits will no longer get this privilege and phone firms will be free to hit you with roaming charges.You must check with your phone provider to seeyou will be affected. If you are hit with roaming charges, you can rack up a bill of £ before you are prompted and askedyou want to spend more.At the moment EE, , Three and ­Vodafone say they have no plans to start charging UK customers when they’re in EU countries.How long that lasts, however, remains to be seen..Return of blue passports and what it means for travellers   New - or old, depending on how you look at it - blue passports become a permanent fixture from January. Burgundy passports will still be valid after Brexit until theyaposre replaced, with all new passports issued from mid- turning blue. From next month you must have at least six months left on your passport, which needs to be less than  years old, in order to travel to most EU countries. Travel to Ireland does not apply. Tourists on short trips of under  days to the EU will not need a visa to travel but they may be needed for trips longer than that and for work, study and or business travel. Travellers are advised to check the advice for the country they are travelling to before planning a trip.  . law Changes tolaw will come into effect on January , the first in almost two decades.Its purpose is to give artists, musicians and publishers a better chance of being paid when their work appears online.The agreement aims to provide a “balanced” approach that would protect smaller artists without causing a signicant impact on the biggest internet s such as Google and YouTube.The bigger s will now be legally responsible for the user-generated material they host in the EU.

Ex-chief inspector Stewart Miller, who led high-profile murder and rape investigations in Humberside, was sacked for gross misconduct.Chairman of the disciplinary  Simon Mallet said his comments were “incredibly damaging” to public perception of the police, Hull Live reports.Giving the decision of instant dismissal, he said that unconscious racism had been at play in Mr Miller’s case, but that this was still a “serious act of discrimination”. “The use of language was very serious and the fact that a senior officer in the Humberside Force can use such language is incredibly damaging and undermines race relations, he said. Mr Miller, who had been a police officer for more than two decades until this afternoon, admitted that remarking to a colleague: [He] isnapost fat or diabetic and has a good job so doesnapost fit in to the category, in fact he is as close to white as he can be, in fact heaposs a choc ice. The counter terrorism trained officer added: [He] is probably more white and middle class than I am. The statements were made to a detective inspector in relation to a black officer who had been raising concerns about his safety while working during the Covid- pandemic. He made the racist comments in June - just months after receiving disciplinary action in relation to two cases of disreputable conduct, which came to light during the hearing. The officer of  years service said that he only realised what “choc ice” meant after Googling the term.He said he only made the comment, in his role as specialist command officer for coronavirus, to emphasise that the BAME officer did not need to shield at home during the Covid- pandemic as he did not meet the “risk factors” for doing so.Ex-Ch Insp Miller argued that the comments did not amount to gross misconduct - something that the  disagreed with. “The comments were racist, offensive, inappropriate and breached standards and equality and ersity, said legally qualied  chair Mr Mallet, who was also joined by Detective Superintendent Laura Koscikiewicz and independent  member Yvonne Fisher. “The officer said that he did not know that the term choc ice was racist or derogatory and was horried when he found out what it meant, but denies gross misconduct.  “He said it was an off the cuff comment that he should not have made an was suspended, but said that he was ‘not a racist’. “When asked what he meant by saying ‘white middle class’ he has that in hindsight he should not have used the term ‘white’ but that % of the population would put the term ‘white’ before middle class.” Mr Mallet said the comments were damaging for the Humberside force, particularly in a time where there are “national concerns about the policing of black communities” - alluding to the Black Lives Matter campaign. Former Chief Inspector Miller, who has led investigations into the notorious murder of Shaun Lyall and a rape under Railway Street bridge in Grimsby, said the comments on June  in his office in Birchin Way police station in Grimsby. He claimed he thought that “choc ice” meant that someone had a blended lestyle of black and white cultures and that he said it in ignorance. But the  chair said that even this was racially offensive as it suggested that a white lestyle was above a black one, as was suggesting that a black man was “more white” than him. He also said it was racist to refer to a “blended lestyle” as it suggesting dropping a black culture to take on a superior white one.Ch Insp Stewart Miller said that the racist comments were made in the “background of Covid” and used “by mistake, in error and ignorance and used in a clumsy way that was not meant to be racist”. He said it was a “momentary accidental mistake, over in seconds”. Even though the  accepted that the officer was under “signicant pressure” at work and balancing “numerous responsibilities”, his excuses did not allow him to keep his job. They said he should have been careful in the language that he uses as it influences the culture of the team and that regardless of rank, all police officers are aware of the importance of ersity and treating everyone “fairly and with respect.” “The officer accepts that he used the term choc ice and accepts that it was derogatory and racist as it means a black person that has sold out their heritage,” said Mr Mallett. “Referring to a BAME officer as aposchoc iceapos without knowing the meaning of it is a serious failing and he should not have used that expression. “It is an offensive and insulting expression to use and should not be used at all - it is a racist expression. “It fell far below the language expected by a police officer, especially a senior officer and the use of language demonstrated unconscious racism. “It is incredibly damaging to the public perceptionand damaging to race relations locally in a time when there are major national concerns about the policing of black communities.” Ch Insp Miller has led high-profile police investigations in the past, including the case of a fairground worker who raped a -year-old woman in Grimsby as she walked home from work. After a large-scale manhunt, Henry Froggatt was eventually jailed for  years and  months for his crimes. He also led the appeals to try and find the killer of Shaun Lyall, who was found dead at his home in July . Craig Whittle was jailed for le after the horric murder, with a judge condemning the extreme violence used after a court heard Mr Lyall suffered  separate injuries during the fatal attack. But his previous track record in the force could not save him from immediate dismissal today. Presenting the case against Mr Miller, Olivia Checa-Dover urged the  to dismiss him without notice and said that there was “no room for racism at any rank”. She said that he could not rely on good character as he did not have an “unblemished record” due in February facing “disciplinary action in relation to two cases of disreputable conduct”.

A new study had found that three in four rats in the UK have developed a genetic resistance to common pesticides.The worrying news comes on top of a % increase in the rat populations due to the coronavirus lockdown.If there is not a very cold winter, then the population is likely to rocket next year. Newly released data from the Campaign for Responsible Rodenticide Use showed that % of rats in the UK carried a resistance gene to popular rodenticides. In some locations in the UK, one in five rats have two dferent genes, making them super resistant to poisons. Pest control expert Jenny Rathbone, from Pest, said: Itaposs very worrying because this aposhybrid-resistanceapos means that some common rodenticides simply wonapost work to control rat numbers. This together with a bumper breeding year means we are in for a heck of a ride in we donapost have a very, very cold winter. According to the report it is the first time in the UK that aposhybrid-resistanceapos has been found on this scale, with potentially unknown dficulties for pest rodent control. Experts said the genetic resistance has been heightened among rats through interbreeding. They said conditions this year have created a perfect storm for breeding rats, with many people reporting seeing the pests out in the open for the first time. Miss Rathbone said: This year has been very challenging for pest controllers with an increase in the population thanks to lockdown plus a sht in where rats are looking for food and shelter. The news that interbreeding is causing a resistance to the bait and poison we use to control infestations is extremely worrying.  The population of rats in the UK is now about  million, up % from .

The two royals have spent a lot of time together over the years, both at public engagements and privately with William and the Cambridge children, and reportedly get on very well. And they are such good pals that Kate decided to buy Harry a rather bold joke Christmas present one year - and it went down a treat. The family famously exchange cheap and cheerful joke gts rather than serious presents, and it sounds like theyaposve come up with some brilliant ideas of the years.When Harry was single following a string of high-profile relationships, Kate gted him a aposgrow-your-own-girlfriendapos kit. And to make things even funnier, the family all sit down and open their Christmas presents together - which means the Queen would have been watching when Harry opened it up. Ouch. Harryaposs no stranger to a prank present himself, and he apparently once gave his grandmother a shower cap which said aposainapost le a b*tchapos on the front. And Meghan Markle has also had some brilliant offerings, giving the Queen a singing hamster toy at her first royal Christmas in . The Monarch reportedly loved the gt - but unfortunately, one of her dogs did too and is said to have broken it later that day. Like many families around the world, the royalsapos Christmas will be very dferent this year - and they will be spending it separately.

It’s two years since she was put on to Universal Credit as one of the first guinea pigs in Northern Ireland, after a traumatic family break up. In the chaos as the new flagship benefit was rolled out, she waited nine weeks for any help, plunging her deep into debt and struggling to support her two children. A qualied teacher, Deirdre told me she used to be a social butterfly. “After Universal Credit, I stopped leaving the house. My curtains were always closed. They nearly broke me. “My fridge broke last summer, and I asked the DWP robotthere was an emergency fund I could apply to. I felt like I was asking for a kidney. They said I had to get another loan, which would then come out of my benefit again. I said: ‘Are you trying to kill the poor people, because that’s what it looks like ’ “Now my cooker’s gone. I have to go to my friend’s round the corner to cook our food. I sit here freezing because I don’t put the heating on until the kids get home from school.” Deirdre’s children are musically gted, but she has had to stop their piano lessons and cut guitar lessons. Her voice breaks. “My daughter ended up spending her communion money to get to school. God love her. Money she was using to try to save up to buy a laptop for schoolwork.” Deirdre, part of the brilliant ­claimants’ campaign group, UC:Us, is one of the people receiving a £-a-week uplt to Universal Credit during the pandemic.She doesn’t actually see the £ as it goes on debt repayments clawed back every month by the DWP. But, like millions on UC, her family are already living below the breadline, so it’s hard to see how she could possibly lose £ a week. Yet that is what the Government is proposing. The £ uplt is due to expire in April, just as millions more are likely to become unemployed. That’s why  charities, trade unions, councils and community groups have begged Chancellor Rishi Sunak to reconsider and #KeepTheLeline. Modelling from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation suggests thatthe uplt is cut, around  million people would face an overnight loss of £,. And , more people, including , more children, risk being swept into poverty. Half a million more could end up in deep poverty. Meanwhile . million mainly disabled people and carers who are on benefits that ­pre-date UC have received no uplt at all. In the time of a pandemic, this beggars belief. Those claimants affected by the benefit cap are also denied the £. Deirdre, , says being part of the claimant-led UC:Us has itself been a ­“leline”.  “They treated me as a person not a number,” she says. “Without them, I wouldn’t have gone out of the door. Now we’re meeting policymakers and advocating to make the benefit system work for future claimants.” Through UC:Us, she has met with politicians across the spectrum, and the group is working with York and Ulster Universities to share ­experiences of UC and develop ­recommendations. On Wednesday night, I spoke at an event held by Unite Community, which has campaigned tirelessly on Universal Credit. Also speaking was Lucy Wood, a Unite member who is on UC. Lucy spoke movingly of how the £ uplt meant she had been able to get new shoes for the kids.  “They were over the moon,” she said. “Last autumn, I couldn’t get coats for the children and had to ask a friend to help. This year, that £ bought a coat.” Unite’s Assistant General Secretary, Steve Turner, spoke passionately about the times he had needed “social solidarity” in his le. “This fight is personal for me,” he said. The Shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Jonathan Reynolds MP, said Labour was actively fighting to keep the £ and extend it to legacy benefit claimants, and renewed the party’s pledge to scrap Universal Credit. “I do not, and will not ever, find it acceptable that children in Britain should be going hungry,” he said. “£ may not seem much to the Tories, but it can make the dference between having food in the fridge at the end of the week and money in the meter.” The Treasury have been approached for comment. The DWP has previously said it is “wholly committed to supporting people on lower incomes and have paid out more than £ billion in welfare support this year” and that the £ increase to Universal Credit continues to be in place until the end of March . Universal Credit is a rotten, broken system that needs to be torn down.

The revellers broke household mixing rules and did not appear to wear face masks or observe social distancing, despite infection rates spiking in  of Londonaposs  boroughs. The rave reportedly lasted around an hour, with some people not allowed in because the venue was crammed. The event sparked a mixed reaction among music fans, with some congratulating the organisers while others claimed attendees were putting lives at risk. On the DnB Rollers page, one partygoer said: Was sick while it lasted. Another added: Looks like it was an amazing night! Big up to the organisers who had the balls to put quality of le first.However, according tosomeone  commented: Definitely not the time to be doing s*** like this yet.Not only is it making it drag on longer for the people who are actually sticking to the rules but it’s putting lives at risk. Bit selfish really.  The politan Police has previously warned young Brits they are putting themselves at risk by attending raves. Speaking about another rave, a Met spokesman previously said: UMEsare illegal, have no security, are not insured, are not ticketed and they are frequently associated with anti-social behaviour and violence. Those attending a UME are putting themselves at risk.

Not just her infectious giggle, her wonderful sense of fun or the way she lit up a room. Nor was it just about her acting skills, brilliant though they were. Whether she was camping it up in the Carry On films or ruling the roost in the Queen Vic, she made the parts she played her own. She was also loved because she had real class, which she showed in her fight against Alzheimer’s and how she campaigned so selflessly for better care for others with dementia. And she showed it in the way she treated everyone, from royalty to road sweepers. Dame Barbara was the unofficial queen of showbiz and with her passing a cheeky bit of joy has gone from our lives. There could be no better tribute to her than giving dementia care the funding it needs. It’s Keir’s year TODAY marks a year since the general election and only one party can look back at the last  months with pride. Under Keir Starmer the fortunes of Labour have been turned around and they are once again looking like a government in waiting. By contrast, Boris Johnson has shown the dference between being good at campaigning and good at governing. His first year has been a history of U-turns, missed opportunities and incompetence. The UK has suffered one of the highest death tolls from Covid and the deepest recession. Key election promises, such as the reform of social care, have been allowed to gather dust. Child poverty is on the rise, unemployment is increasing and growth has stalled. No amount of bluster by the Prime Minister can disguise how poorly he has performed.

But donapost worry, heaposs kindly shared the aposrightapos way to do it and claims his method will give you aposperfectapos bacon. Jeff Baker says that a lot of people make a common mistake when cooking the meat and end up with it being very greasy. Speaking to The Daily Star, the food expert revealed his secret, saying that itaposs all to do with getting the pan nice and hot, rather than cooking the meat slow and steady. By doing it this way, the bacon should caramelise, making it crispier and giving the meat a punchier flavour. He explained: I find that the best way to cook bacon is on a medium to high heat pan with a small amount of natural fat, searing it on each side for a minute or so. If the bacon is properly dry-cured and cut to a nice thickness, it should caramelise on the edges. The fat will then render without dissolving, resulting in delicious flavour. The chef, who works with online butchery retailer Farmison  Co also shared another top tip - but itaposs pretty controversial. He continued to say that he doesnapost think you should add any condiments to your bacon, so wave goodbye to ketchup or brown sauce. In my opinion,cooked this way the bacon won’t need any sauce to enhance the taste - it’ll be perfect as it is, he said.

He’s got a great attitude.”“Micky Mellon will look at who has the ability and who is on form when he’s picking his teams. He certainly isn’t afraid to throw young players into big games. He’s shown that already.“It’s part of the reason he came here – giving young players a chance.“A lot of young players have committed to Dundee United.” vw, px\"  Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_sub_data  ,\"evening-telegraph-first-epaper--month\": today for unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  nThis offer will auto renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"evening-telegraph-web-pack--month\": today and get unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite. nThis offer will auto renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"plan_ids\":[\"cancelation-offer-evening-telegraph-web-epaper\",\"evening-telegraph-first-epaper--month\",\"evening-telegraph-web-pack--month\"],\"subscribe\": ua. per month  u recurring subscription n\",\"label\":\"\",\"highlight\":,\"recurring\":\"\",\"has_multi\":,\"editions\":true,\"durations\":true,\"free_trial\":,\"benefits\":[\"Enjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.\",\"Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

across the north-east lit up with bright and cheerful decorations.The campaign focuses on the vital role of #home# and how important it has been during .All their locations can be found on a map on the Aberdeen Cyrenians website, and can be downloaded for a small donation to the charity.Photos will be uploaded on its Facebook page from Monday, with vouchers and a bottle of fizz available for the wonderland that receives the most likes.Participating festive houses, offices and community buildings have also been encouraged to set up a fundraising page so that people can scan a QR code to donate to their favourite one, or give online.Those raising the most money for the charity will also win a prize.Emma Bellu, fundraising and communications manager at Aberdeen Cyrenians, said: “Everyone needs a safe place to call home, but sadly as this pandemic has highlighted, not everyone is safe or has a place they can call home. Anyone can be affected, and the pandemic has pushed many into crisis.“This year we’ve helped people move from cycles of homelessness to settled and secure housing they can truly call home. We’ve helped people flee abuse, ensuring they have not only what they need to survive, but helping them to recover and thrive.  We’ve helped people with mental health and addiction challenges to weather the pandemic restrictions, stay safe, and keep the roof over their heads.#Home has been at the heart of all our lives this year so, we’re delighted that people across the city have embraced the celebration and are sharing our message of hope for a brighter future.”The charity hopes to bring a bit more positivity to residents.Emma added: #The year has been totally devastating but now that the vaccine is being rolled out there#s hope again, and we wanted to share that message of hope and celebrating how important home is while supporting the many people who have been left in crisis by the year.#There are  participating festive locations, which have been split into north, central and south, to help those out on the hunt for each of the buildings.This year, Aberdeen Cyrenians has provided a wealth of support to those across the north-east who have needed help # including delivering thousands of care parcels.It is also assisting those who may be at risk of homelessness, or worried about income, with non-judgemental staff assisting in any way they can, from helping come up with a budgeting plan, to assistance applying for any benefits someone might be entitled to.To download the trail map, visit https:aberdeen-cyrenians.org download p trailmapFor as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. vw, px\"   blaize_sub_data  ,\"evening-express-epaper--month\":This offer will auto renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time n\",\"free_trial\":,\"evening-express-web-pack--month\": today and get unlimited access to the Evening Express website. nThis offer will auto-renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"plan_ids\":[\"cancelation-offer-evening-express-web-epaper\",\"evening-express-epaper--month\",\"evening-express-web-pack--month\"],\"subscribe\": ua. per month  u recurring subscription n\",\"label\":\"\",\"highlight\":,\"recurring\":\"\",\"has_multi\":,\"editions\":true,\"durations\":true,\"free_trial\":,\"benefits\":[\"Unlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Now that we understand where the jet stream was located , years ago it tells us a lot about the climate of the past.“Our technique involved studying the glaciers from that time, in order to work out the quantities of snowfall and how the atmosphere was moving. There are existing reconstructions of temperature, but they don’t tell us about how the atmosphere was behaving nor where the weather was coming from.“That is what is unique about this study. The results are extremely valuable in terms of providing data to test how climate models can predict movements of the jet stream and the resulting weather into the future.”The study analysed over  glaciers stretching from Norway and Ireland to Morocco’s Atlas Mountains, the Balkans and Turkey.The findings can be used to improve numerical models to better inform us about the long-term effects of ongoing climate change.Dr Spagnolo described the techniques they used as being similar to those used by paleontologists – but instead of studying fossils, they studied the landscape to determine the location and height of glaciers, allowing them to build an understanding of past climate. vw, px\"  He said: “The techniques we use rely on the ‘landscape memory’ left by ancient glaciers as a proxy to understand the circulation of air masses across Europe , years ago.#It is not possible to find another proxy that gives you that information, and the few people who have attempted this type of work previously mainly focused on one glacier, in one location.“Here for the first time we take them all together and we see a Europe-wide picture of how the climate behaved back then.”Dr Spagnolo added: “Ultimately this study is about climate change. Current climate models rely heavily on recent data, but in order to improve these models we have to go much further back into the past.“This is the most accurate proxy-based representation of the atmospheric circulation at the end of the last glaciation that’s ever been produced, and the data can be used to improve the models that predict what’s going to happen to our climate when – as is likely – the  jet stream shts as a result of ongoing climate change.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. vw, px\"   blaize_sub_data  ,\"evening-express-epaper--month\":This offer will auto renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time n\",\"free_trial\":,\"evening-express-web-pack--month\": today and get unlimited access to the Evening Express website. nThis offer will auto-renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"plan_ids\":[\"cancelation-offer-evening-express-web-epaper\",\"evening-express-epaper--month\",\"evening-express-web-pack--month\"],\"subscribe\": ua. per month  u recurring subscription n\",\"label\":\"\",\"highlight\":,\"recurring\":\"\",\"has_multi\":,\"editions\":true,\"durations\":true,\"free_trial\":,\"benefits\":[\"Unlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

It is so galling that the government appear to be inactive on such an important issue.Football is being treated like an afterthought by Holyrood.That’s an insult, considering the game brings more than £ million to the economy and sustains thousands of jobs.The Scottish Government is also overlooking the social impact of football and just how important it is to so many people within the nation.A £m package has been confirmed for football by the Scottish Government in grants and low-interest loans. That is a positive, but will only paper over the cracks.Supporters back in grounds is what will save clubs.Their continued absence in Scotland is particularly frustrating when thousands of fans are allowed back at games in England.Aberdeen’s bid to have , supporters inside Pittodrie for the game against Ross County was rejected by the government. I can see absolutely no rhyme nor reason as to why there cannot be , fans socially distanced at a ,-capacity stadium.It would be a controlled environment where Aberdeen know the details of everyone present, there is staggered entry, no shouting or singing and many hand sanitiser points. Supporters cannot go to Pittodrie tomorrow, yet they can go to a shopping centre where there will be thousands of people and no details of who they are. It doesn’t make sense!I was at the test game in September when  fans were inside Pittodrie and I am confident a few thousand could be safely accommodated in the stadium.In Level  areas,  fans are allowed. Yet where is the plan to increase that number If this inaction from Holyrood continues clubs will go under this season. Some with more than  years of history – lost for good.Clubs begin season ticket sales around March. There must not only be some fans regularly back in grounds by then, but also a plan to increase numbers safely.You have to give confidence to fans they will be able to attend games in the - campaign or season ticket sales will crash.All Scottish clubs and fans must make a unied and strong stand now – before it is too late.Strikers Curtis Main and Ryan Edmondson should both start against Ross County at Pittodrie tomorrow in a two-man attack.Aberdeen’s leading scorer in the previous two seasons, Sam Cosgrove, has struggled to make an impact since ing last month from a knee injury.Cosgrove netted  times last season, but has not scored in his last four starts.He was replaced at half time in the - Betfred Cup loss to St Mirren and also substituted midway through the second half of the - draw in the Premiershipwith the Buddies.He did not have a shot on target in that draw.Cosgrove rejected a multi-million-pound move to Guingamp in the summer, but is struggling to hit the levels that made the French side move to sign him.Aberdeen boss Derek McInnes needs to freshen it up in attack tomorrow, so I would start with Main and Edmondson.Main is a grafter and will give his all for the cause.He harasses defenders and had moved himself into the position of first-choice striker ahead of Cosgrove in March before football was shut down due to the coronavirus.Main has also had his injury problems this season, but is now fit and available.On-loan Leeds United teen Edmondson also offers dig and fight up top. Start with both and they could deliver goals.Aberdeen’s home clash with Ross County tomorrow is a must-win as they cannot afford the recent slump to continue. The Dons are now four games without a win, which is concerning enough before you even take into consideration three of those games were against the bottom two sides.A team with Aberdeen’s ambition should be defeating sides like St Mirren and Hamilton Accies.Aberdeen need to rediscover their self-belief because they have already proven this season they can play to a high standard and get results. They need to remember that.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. vw, px\"   blaize_sub_data  ,\"evening-express-epaper--month\":This offer will auto renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time n\",\"free_trial\":,\"evening-express-web-pack--month\": today and get unlimited access to the Evening Express website. nThis offer will auto-renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"plan_ids\":[\"cancelation-offer-evening-express-web-epaper\",\"evening-express-epaper--month\",\"evening-express-web-pack--month\"],\"subscribe\": ua. per month  u recurring subscription n\",\"label\":\"\",\"highlight\":,\"recurring\":\"\",\"has_multi\":,\"editions\":true,\"durations\":true,\"free_trial\":,\"benefits\":[\"Unlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

I know we can’t go out and dominate a team for  minutes, but it’s when you’re not having a dominant period you need to be solid and make sure you stay in the game and not end up chasing it.”With two wins from their first seven League One fixtures, McInally believes his sides performances aren’t reflected in their points total.However, Scotland’s longest-serving manager insists the Blue Toon can’t dwell on previous opportunities missed.He added: “Of course we should have had more points on the board, but we can’t dwell on that we have to move on and make sure we get the necessary amount of points to make it a decent season.“Nobody likes being at that part of the league towards the bottom, but we’re there and it’s a pressure in itself and we need to deal with it.“I’ve reiterated to the players that the big pressure this season is making sure the club survives andwe can make it a decent season on the pitch – and there’s no reason why we can’t with what we’ve shown in games – then that’s what we need to do.“There’s no point in dwelling on points we could have picked up because it’s an unforgiving league and we just need to get on with it.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. vw, px\"   blaize_sub_data  ,\"evening-express-epaper--month\":This offer will auto renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time n\",\"free_trial\":,\"evening-express-web-pack--month\": today and get unlimited access to the Evening Express website. nThis offer will auto-renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"plan_ids\":[\"cancelation-offer-evening-express-web-epaper\",\"evening-express-epaper--month\",\"evening-express-web-pack--month\"],\"subscribe\": ua. per month  u recurring subscription n\",\"label\":\"\",\"highlight\":,\"recurring\":\"\",\"has_multi\":,\"editions\":true,\"durations\":true,\"free_trial\":,\"benefits\":[\"Unlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Saints, however, failed to harness the wind advantage and it was the home side who looked the more threatening in the early stages.Skipper Lewis Buchanan registered Saints first effort on goal in the th minute, cutting in from the right to send a well-struck shot just wide of the postage stamp corner.Saints manager Donald Black made early use of the agreed rolling substitutes policy, sending on Fraser MacFarlane in the th minute to replace Alan Buchanan in the centre forward#s role.It didn#t take MacFarlane long to make an impact and his neat turn on the edge of the D created the space for a right foot volley which arced away from the Red Star keeper#s right hand to nestle in the bottom corner and give Saints a st minute lead.Red Star cancelled out the Saints advantage on the stroke of half-time after good work on the right from Chris Hart took him all the way to the bye-line from where his cutback picked out Stuart MacLean on the six-yard line for an easy finish.With the wind gathering pace, a long second half was in prospect for Saints and it took the hosts just four minutes to capitalise on their controlled first half performance when central defender Ben Forbes poked home an Andy Weir right wing corner through a sea of legs.After Lewis Buchanan had headed a th minute Andy Weir left wing corner off the line, Weir#s follow up delivery from the opposite flank picked out right full back Coll McCallum eight yards out for the home side#s third goal.Red Star stretched their advantage still further on the hour mark when Ben Forbes whipped a wind assisted free-kick from the halfway line into the postage stamp corner giving Murdo MacKenzie no chance.After keeping the hosts at bay for  minutes, Saints conceded a fth goal with almost the last kick of the ball. Murdo MacKenzie did well to parry a dipping -yard Aaron Moore shot, but luck deserted the Saints keeper when the ball broke to Ewan Litster, who chipped over the stranded keeper into the unguarded net.With the rain coming horizontally, both sets of players were delighted to hear referee Jimmy Litster#s final whistle immediately after the restart signalling a stampede for the sanctuary of the ious cars and vans in the school car park."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 17 congratulations and jubilations","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Some applicants do not have English as their first language and Citizens Advice Bureauoffices have experience in obtaining advice via interpreters.Outreach clinics, centred in local area job centres, are also a feature of the CAB service and enable job centre staff to refer clients directly to a CAB Advisor based there for a day.Any cuts will increase the workload on CAB offices exponentially as thousands more may be made redundant, find they have no income of any kind, and turn to CAB for advice. Cuts will undoubtedly affect the vulnerable in our society immediately, with theIn cities such as Glasgow, the closure of offices would mean that many claimants could find it impossible to travel to other parts of the city and, in any case, with an already growing list of applicants those offices would soon be overwhelmed,they are not already.Several members of CAB staff have already been made redundant. I believe that more may follow without additional funding.In Glasgow alone, five offices face closure, though it is estimated that in excess of , people in Glasgow sought advice from these offices in the last year. This is likely to be the case in major cities around Scotland.Our petition calls on the Scottish Parliament to urge the Scottish Government to provide urgent funding to Citizens Advice Scotland. It can be found on the Scottish Parliament website # petition number PE: Urgent funding for Citizens Advice Bureaux.Alistair S Stephen, by emailSir,The Covert Human Intelligence Sources Bill currently going through Westminster, dubbed the Spy Cop Bill, gives agencies including police, armed forces, HMRC, and even the Food Standards Agency permission to break the law with impunity.These agencies will be permitted to break international and domestic law in direct contravention of the Geneva Convention on human rights.Why is this legislation being brought in, and why are HMRC and the Food Standards Agency being given such powers  It is beyond belief that the majority of MPs actually voted for this bill.A clue may come from recent comments made by the home Secretary and endorsed by the prime minister about #leftie lawyers# and #do-gooders#, referring to human rights lawyers and refugee organisations.As for the Food Standards Agency, clues might come from the other very concerning bill in process at present which is the Internal Market Bill which contravenes the Good Friday Agreement and the devolution settlements for Scotland and Wales by undermining the authority of the devolved governments, as well as breaking an international treaty signed less than a year ago.This bill contains some deeply concerning clauses which would come under the remit of The Food Standards Agency which normally only has jurisdiction south of the border, but this bill would enable a UK trade minister to unilaterally overrule Scottish legislation on food safety standards to allow for a trade deal with the US, and the importation of sub-standard foods and food products.It is also the case that any UK minister or appointee would be able to overrule any Scottish legislation. This could affect all aspects of our lives.The Spy Cop Bill is a means of enforcing the Internal Market Bill by using the threat of underhand means. Thus piling illegality on illegality with regard to international law.We need to be very concerned on both counts.Amnesty International has already voiced its grave concerns, as have other international bodies and governments.Surely independence is now the best option for Scotland, where we can build a better, fairer nation for ourselves one that obeys international laws and respects the basic human rights of all its citizens, with a written constitution to ensure that no future Scottish government could ever impose such draconian legislation on the people of Scotland.Cecilia Rees , Lochgilphead.Sir,The Covid- pandemic continues to be exceptionally dficult for all of us, but has also led to crisis levels of #pet poverty# in the UK.PDSA is a charity that provides free and low cost vet care for those who struggle to pay treatment costs for their sick and injured pets.Since the first UK lockdown began, we’ve seen an overwhelming number of additional enquiries from pet owners who have hit hard times.

Martin Bonar replaced Scott Johnston for Saints while Chris Hart made way for Innes Meikle for the hosts.The deadlock was broken in the th minute from a quickly-taken free kick by Cammy Hill after Martin Bonar had been brought down in the centre circle by James McGuiness.Hill spotted Aaron McKay in space on the right and sent him scurrying forward. McKay cut into the box and picked out the run of Craig MacEwan who was foiled from six yards by Ally Lewis.The young keeper#s good work was undone when he couldn#t hold MacEwan#s shot allowing the ball to spin away from him.Ben Forbes was on hand with a sliding challenge to knock the loose ball away from MacEwan but only as far as Gavin Forgrieve, who gleefully tapped home from four yards.Lewis saved again from MacEwan three minutes later this time managing to hold onto the ball at the second attempt before a neat Matty Kelly turn on the corner of the Star -yard box wrong footed Ben Forbes creating the space for Kelly to curl a ball to the far post a matter of inches in front of the outstretched boot of Scott Maitland.Maitland got forward again in the st minute finding Gavin Forgrieve in front of goal. He took the ball down well only for Innes Meikle to get back with a vital challenge at the expense of a corner kick.Martin Bonar climbed well at the back post to meet Forgrieve#s delivery from the right but couldn#t direct his header on target.Despite being unable to hit the target himself Bonar was able to claim an st minute assist for the second and final goal.The big midfielder, a key member of Red Star#s  Scottish Amateur Football League Premier Division Two title winning side, won possession well in the centre circle and opened up his former team mates with a perfectly weighted pass for the forward run of skipper Craig MacEwan.Top marksman MacEwan comfortably beat stranded Red Star keeper Ally Lewis with a deft chip from  yards into the unguarded net.Referee Jimmy Litster, who ensured the two local rivals remained on friendly terms throughout, called time on proceedings after three added minutes with both sides satisfied to complete another  minutes while the majority of their respective league rivals remain side-lined."},{"url":null,"title":"in praise of john campbell factor mor","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The town on its present site would be taking shape by the time young Zachary began his schooling.His education, however, was said to be #rudimentary#, so young Zachary began teaching himself Latin and Greek as he absorbed English classic literature.Employed from the age of  in a merchant#s office in Glasgow, historical references describe him falling into #bad company# and indulging in excessive drinking.At the age of  in  he emigrated to Jamaica to take up a role as a book-keeper, effectively a slave overseer, on a sugar plantation. Such was his horror and disgust at the way in which slaves were treated on the plantation that he became an implacable opponent of the slave trade.He gave up his job in Jamaica # by this time a #model book-keeper# # and ed in  to Britain and secured a position in London. His sister Jean had married Thomas Babington of Rothley Temple, Leicestershire, a country gentleman and ardent evangelical. Babington took MacAulay under his wing and introduced him to the Clapham Sect # a group of Tories against slavery.Among them was William Wilberforce, founder and leader of the anti-slavery movement.Through working with the Clapham Sect, MacAulay was invited in  to visit Sierra Leone # the West African colony established to provide a home to emancipated slaves from the United States who came to Sierra Leone via Nova Scotia.In , aged , he was promoted to the post of governor and remained in the post until .Returning to England on a slave ship, he brought with him  African children, with the hope of finding them a better le in the Clapham Sect community.He settled in Surrey following his marriage to Selina Mills on August , .Having witnessed the misery of slavery, MacAulay became a member of the Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade, working closely with Wilberforce, and soon became a leading figure in the parliamentary campaign. He later became secretary of the committee, which became known as the African Institution.The campaign succeeded in , with an Act of Parliament making the slave trade illegal throughout the British Empire. The practice, however, was to continue despite this victory.Many abolitionists had thought slavery would fade away once the slave trade was stopped, but that failed to happen.MacAulay continued in his activism, helping seize a slave ship in . On this act, William Wilberforce commented in a letter to MacAulay, #you really deserve a statue#.In the s MacAulay turned his attention towards securing the total abolition of slavery itself. He helped found the Society for the Mitigation and Gradual Abolition of Slaveryin , and was editor of its monthly publication, the Anti-Slavery Reporter from its launch in .His major contribution was the collection and collating of a huge volume of evidence showing the true scale of slavery # a role to which he was ideally suited as a skilled statistician with a meticulous approach and an exceptional head for figures.It was also during this period that MacAulay co-founded University College London.Publication of the Reporter continued until , but by the end the work had worn MacAulay out and he had got into debt.In  Selina died and, with his finances in disarray, MacAulay was exiled to Paris in  # the year the Slavery Abolition Act came into force which ended slavery throughout the British Empire.He ed to England once his debts were liquidated and died on May , . He was buried in a London cemetery, but after the site became a public park # St George#s Gardens # the exact location of his grave was lost.MacAulay is commemorated with a le-sized memorial bust in Westminster Abbey.To mark the th anniversary of his birth in , a memorial plaque was unveiled in the gardens, donated by the Royal Statistical Society, the Friends of St George#s Gardens, University College London and the Clan MacAulay Association.William Wilberforce said of Zachary MacAulay: #My sober and deliberate opinion is that you [Zachary MacAulay] have done more towards this consummation [abolishing slavery] than any other man.#For myself, I take pleasure in acknowledging that you have been my tutor all the way and that I could have done nothing without you.#"},{"url":null,"title":"a family passion for scotlands beauty","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Frances and Ross depict the ever-changing and often harsh weather conditions which frame their Argyll home.A Family Affair explores their shared artistic tropes as they both represent the landscape of Scotland’s islands and west coast, working in nature, directly inBoth use oil paint and other media, drawing with the brush or palette kne to make urgent, swt marks that capture the fleeting effects and drama of changing weather.They also share Crinan, where the Ryan family has run the Crinan Hotel since the mid-seventies, from where Ryan left for school, then art school and set out on extensive travels. But the beauty of Argyll # and his boat Sgarbh # drew him back.Earlier this year Ross held his second solo exhibition with The Scottish Gallery, but due to lockdown not a single person was able to attend.Frances has been a regular exhibitor with the gallery for years with her distinctive Hebridean seascapes and landscapes showing the repeated mots of Iona, The Mull of Kintyre, the bays around Crinan and the view across to Jura and the Corryvreckan.Like a good modernist Frances is reluctant to give any commentary on her works but Ross, on the other hand, makes extensive notes on his journeys allowing others to understand how hard-won the paintings are, particularly in winter when the harsh conditions create privations and huge physical problems. Each painting becomes a manestation and record of time and place.His affinity with the natural world is reflected in his long-term project of setting messages in bottles on the ocean, which brings him encounters as he journeys to meet the people who find them, and make new works at the location of the find.A Family Affair will be presented concurrently with Mark Hearld’s Menagerie, which will transport visitors to an animal-filled world with a series of prints, woodcut and linocuts inspired by the artist’s love of British flora and fauna.A Family Affair and Mark Hearld’s Menagerie will be at The Scottish Gallery in Edinburgh between Saturday November  and Wednesday December ."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column november 20 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Hill spotted Aaron McKay in space, who cut into the box and picked out MacEwan, who was foiled from six yards by Lewis. The keeper couldn#t hold the shot, and the ball eventually fell to Gavin Forgrieve, who tapped home from four yards.Nine minutes from time Saints midfielder Bonar, a key member of Red Star#s  Premier Division Two title-winning side, passed to MacEwan, who beat the keeper with a deft chip from  yards.Match report and photographs: Derek Black"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor november 20 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

All representatives who are isolating or unable to attend must be able to speak up for their voters.We noted as early as June that the abrupt shut-down of remote participation was bound to leave communities unrepresented as the pandemic continued to rage. The Commons took a step backwards in ending this too early.MPs and voters need consistency and transparent standards for how these crucial democratic decisions are made.We can#t have ato the conga line chaos we saw in June, or the decisions simply being made on a whim by a minister.MPs need clarity about how they can continue to represent their voters during this stark second wave and beyond.There must be far greater transparency over how these decisions on participation are made, rather than ministers being forced to act at the last moment.Since some MPs may be isolating or not safe to travel in person, there’s a real threat for democratic representation and political equalityremote participation continues to be strictly limited or indeed denied. Virtual proceedings in the summer were a real success in bringing parliament into the st century. Let’s learn from that and ensure all voters are heard.Darren Hughes, chief executive, the Electoral Reform Society.Sir,SNP ministers must outline how they are planning for a Covid- vaccine rollout across Scotland.People are understandably feeling positive about a potential vaccine for coronavirus, which is why it is critical for the SNP government to lay out the detail of its roll-out plans as a matter of urgency.We can ill-afford to repeat the same mistakes we saw with the flu vaccination earlier this year.Ministers need to set out what infrastructure is being put in place right now so they are ahead of the game when it comes to rolling out any vaccine across Scotland when it becomes available, and doing so fairly and effectively.Getting this right will be particularly important for the Highlands and Islands with our dispersed population and challenging geography.We must be assured that our region does not end up playing catch-up with the central belt which is an understandable concern locally, given the track record of this government in other matters affecting us.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSP and Shadow Health Secretary.Sir,In the recent storms  houses at Bruach Gorm, Port Charlotte, using the communal West Highland Housing Association satellite dish lost half their sky channels including BBC  and STV.As I write, it#s been  working days since at least three of us that I know reported the issue to West Highland, but not a word of a fix date.The dish has done well for  years, but things degrade over time. I had an inkling this year there would be a dish problem and in the summer I bought a TV aerial kit for £ # a lot cheaper than fitting a dish.I put the aerial in the loft and there is a good reception, with BBC  and STV back. It is storm proof in the loft, though was disappointed with the lack of channels from the Bowmore transmitter.I Googled it and the mast is a Freeview Light and lacks channels other UK areas enjoy. I use Sky HD freeview channels but with Sky you have to navigate the TV guide through all the blocked subscription channels to find the one you want to watch. Via the Bowmore mast the TV guide just lists the the Freeview channels, which is great.Freeview said that there were more channels available on main transmitters than there was on relay transmitters, which play a vital role in providing more remote areas with TV coverage.There are a lot of aerials on houses and I think Islay#s TV transmitters should get an upgrade to the same channels as other areas expect.I will also raise this issue with those elected to improve our lives, including our MSP, MP, council leader Councillor Currie and Councillor Horn.Colin M Campbell, Port Charlotte, Isle of Islay.Sir,I think we all need a boost of positive news, so I would like to appeal to your readers to give a brave and special young person in your area the credit they deserve by nominating them for the  WellChild Awards.We are looking for inspirational children and young people who have defied the odds in the face of serious illness and the selfless nurses, doctors, brothers, sisters and friends who help care for them.This is your opportunity to give them the recognition they deserve at a prestigious event regularly attended by WellChild Patron, The Duke of Sussex.Nominations are open now so please get yours in before the closing date on Monday December  at noon.

The current bus stop and car park at the head of Glen Croe would also be bypassed. This is an important public transport link for local residents.The consultation launched by the Scottish Government’s Transport Secretary, Michael Matheson is a muddled exercise. It confuses the urgent need to decide on an alternative route for a new road through Glen Croe with the much longer-term strategic transport options for improving connectivity between Argyll and west-central Scotland.Most of the strategic options involve a number of new civil engineering challenges including the construction of bridges over Loch Long and Loch Fyne and extensive road building, both new and upgraded. For reasons of cost and complexity, none of these options are likely to be implemented within this decade.Whatever long-term strategy options may be investigated for their feasibility, there remains the urgent need to build a new road in Glen Croe. It will always be necessary to link the communities of Arrochar Tarbetwith Loch Goil, Cairndow, north Loch Fyne, Inveraray and beyond with the A.I note that both my local community council in Loch Goil and Argyll and Bute Council support the route that follows the existing forest track on the opposite side of the glen from the Rest and Be Thankful without a similar risk of landslides. Compared with the strategic options, this is a modestof road to construct.The sooner that steps are taken to realise this solution the better it will be for all who currently suffer the increasingly frequent road closures due to climate change and the unstable hill.Alastair R Moodie, LochgoilheadSir,Every year thousands of children contact Childline about being bullied online and tell us that they feel it is hard to escape from.Lockdown has intensied these feelings for many and since April we’ve counselled more than , children and young people across the UK about online bullying.Children have told us about people sending threatening or abusive messages and being pressured into engaging in sexual conversations. Others have shared that they’ve been excluded from online games by other children, while some spoke of online identities being stolen to embarrass or cause trouble while using their name.Before lockdown measures were first introduced this year, the average monthly number of counselling session with children about online bullying was . Between April and October that value increased by  per cent to a monthly average of .This is worrying, particularly as we continue to adhere to strict social-distancing restrictions across Scotland and children continue to spend more time online. Bullying can have a long-term impact on the mental wellbeing of a child and, as we mark Anti Bullying Week this month and beyond, it’s important to ensure that every child knows who they can turn to for support.If a parent thinks their child is being bullied online, it can be hard to remain calm, but it’s crucial not to overwhelm a child with questions. Taking their device away is likely to make them feel like whatever has happened is their fault instead, it’s helpful to listen to their worries, suggest they take some time away from certain apps, and provide them with reassurance.Adeniyi Alade, service head of Childline at NSPCC ScotlandSir,Boris Johnson’s comment that devolution has been #a disaster north of the border# and #Tony Blair’s worst mistake# should hardly come as a surprise to anyone.The Tories have never been great supporters of devolution, vehemently opposing both the referendums in  on establishing a Scottish Assembly and in  on the Scottish Parliament.Most recently the devolution power grab that is highlighted in the Internal Market Bill simply reinforces this stance.The Scottish Social Attitudes surveyon constitutional preference found that only seven per cent favour abolition of the Scottish Parliament and it found that trust in the Scottish Government sits at four times that of the UK Government.

Why  Because this modication very effectively protects moths from becoming bat-fodder.Butterflies are active during the day but moths are mostly nocturnal. And under the night sky moths make a tasty meal for insectivorous bats. These tiny mammals detect their prey by echo-location, a method of hunting that involves emitting repeated ultrasonic squeaks, generally with a dominant frequency range of - kilohertz . Their prey is then located from the direction of the ing echoes.Moths have evolved ious mechanisms to evade these predators: some have developed ears that detect bat echolocation calls, allowing them to take evasive action, but others, the earless moths, have to rely on passive defences – so-called acoustic camouflage # that is, their hairy thoraces.Comparing tomographic echo images from two species of earless moths with two species of diurnal butterflies, the Bristol scientists found very little effect on the ultrasound echoes from the thin layer of thoracic scales of butterflies. In contrast, the hair-like scales covering moth thoraces absorbed around  per cent of the ultrasonic sound energy in the broadband - kHz. This provides clear protection from hunting bats and consequently is a very signicant survival advantage.Addressing the mechanisms behind the ultrasound reduction achieved by moth thoraces, the scientists found that the hair-like scales form a connected network of air pockets, which act as porous ultrasound absorbers. Sound waves entering the network cause air molecules in the pockets to vibrate, thereby dissipating energy and reducing echo reflection.The overall arrangement and microstructure of hair-like moth scales closely resembles man-made fibrous materials designed to absorb sound but, interestingly, the Bristol team showed that the moth scales have a considerably higher absorption capacity. So perhaps we could learn lessons from these small hairy creatures.* J. R. Soc.

It helps to boost our immune system and those of us able to should strive to get the benefit this winter.#A -minute daily walk is one of the best ways to look after yourself and it’s something we can do from our own front door.#During periods of physical distancing, isolation and uncertainty, many have expressed increased feelings of anxiety, stress or worry. Daily outdoor exercise, while adhering to guidelines, is an important way to improve physical and mental wellbeing.#We would encourage those who are able to get outdoors this winter to do so, evenit is for a short walk to the shop or to school.#Research shows that half a million older people regularly experience periods of isolation, going at least five or six days a week without seeing or speaking to anyone at all.Getting out for a daily walk allows interaction with neighbours, others in the community and can create a sense of connection and community belonging, even while social distancing.Dr William Bird, founder of Intelligent Health and the Beat the Street game said: #When I talk to patients on a day-to-day basis, most of them ask for advice on how to avoid getting Covid- or how they can improve their chances of fighting itthey do catch it.#Walking is always one of the best things that people can do for their health, however during these times of Covid-, it’s more vital than ever. When you go for a brisk walk, this stimulates the creation of natural killer cells which are part of the immune system. They sit at the nasal cavity and are ready to mop up any virus including Covid- and kill it before it has a chance to replicate and get into the cells.#Not only that, but walking in green space and nature has a positive impact on the brain also reduces stress and its negative impact on the immune system.#UK-wide research by King’s College London during lockdown revealed  per cent of people in the UK have felt more anxious or depressed than normal, with walking shown to be an effective method to prevent and manage mental health conditions. Surveys have shown that Scots have increased their walking during this unprecedented time more than any other part of the UK.For more information on Paths for All and the Walk Once a Day this Winter campaign, search pathsforall.org.uk walkonceaday"},{"url":null,"title":"welcome 140000 boost for pool redevelopment","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Working in tandem, both approaches will help to mitigate the challenges presented by this notoriously unstable slope.#The bulk of the fencing work will take place in the spring and summer of .George Fiddes,Transport Scotland special projects manager, said: #Commencement of these vital deer fencing works marks an important milestone in the hillside planting strategy.#We look forward to continuing to work with Forestry and Land Scotland on this key project which forms part of the Scottish Government’s wider landslide mitigation works at the A Rest and be Thankful.#As well as protecting the trees, the fence will have ecological benefits across a wider area by reducing grazing pressure and will help to develop a network of native woodland at a landscape scale.Careful consideration has to be given to selecting the correct species of trees and shrubs that would best be able to cope with the extreme conditions on such an exposed site.#Anything planted at this site should not only be able to provide the rooting structures that will help slope stabilisation,# continued Mr Hand, #but should also be resilient enough to survive in this environment.#Sourcing Scottish plants from local areas, as close as possible to the site, means we’re benefitting from the plant species that are adapted for the current environment and that are most likely to be resilient to a changing climate into the future.#The combination of species will include downy birch, aspen, oak, blackthorn, hawthorn, hazel, juniper and Scots pine.As well as enhancing the landscape and contributing to the scenic value of the National Park, the mix of species will be good for bioersity, helping to sustain golden eagles and black grouse.The project overall will also protect water quality and habitats, especially those associated with spawning salmonids.Natural regeneration of native species will also be encouraged and there is scope for more planting nearby.Information  will go up at points where new gates will be built across traditional access routes telling walkers why the fence has appeared."},{"url":null,"title":"trad stars get cooking in eilidhs memory","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It cost the lives of  British servicemen and severe injuries to many more but it made Blair a rich man, resulting from his popularity in America where many of my friends still think the sun shines from his posterior.I would agree, however, that allowing the electorate in Scotland to vote in favour of devolution, was undoubtedly Blair#s second biggest mistake.His motivation was to placate those crying for Scottish independence, following the discovery of North Sea oil, but the irony was that it led to a series of disastrously incompetent Labour Lib Dem coalition governments.These in turn resulted in the electorate choosing, in , a minority SNP government, enabled by support from the Greens.My letter would be far too long were I to dwell on all the areas of incompetence in Holyrood government since , so I#ll confine my evaluation to education, upon which the future of Scotland depends.In , Salmond#s election promise was primary school class sizes of under  but, two years later, Fiona Hyslop changed that target to fewer than  pupils. That was just before Salmond sacked her and Mike Russell admitted smaller class sizes might not be possible before .Those councils that did enforce the limit of  only did so by refusing places to children whose siblings were at the same school.The #attainment gap# between children from poorer backgrounds and those from more affluent areas has continued to widen rather than diminish, as Nicola Sturgeon promised, while older students cannot find places at Scottish universities because these have to be allocated to foreign students, whose fees are a necessity to fund the universities.Meanwhile, I hate to think what Scotland#s deficit is now. It was around eight per cent of GDP before Covid decimated so many areas vital to Scotland#s economy.Doubtless, Alex Orr will remind me Scotland cannot legally have a deficit, but an independent Scotland could and it would prevent the dream of Scotland rejoining the EU from ever being attained.Brian Gee, Carradale East.In the recent storms,  houses at Bruach Gorm, Port Charlotte using the communal West Highland Housing Association satellite dish, lost half our Sky channels, including BBC  and STV.As I write, it’s been  working days since at least three of us that I know reported the issue to West Highland, but not a word of a fix date.The dish has done well for  years, but things degrade over time. I had an inkling this year there would be a dish problem and in the summer I bought a TV aerial kit for £ – a lot cheaper than fitting a dish. I put the aerial in the loft and there is a good reception, with BBC  and STV back. It is storm-proof in the loft, though I was disappointed with the lack of channels from the Bowmore transmitter.I Googled it and the mast is a Freeview Light and lacks channels other UK areas enjoy. I use Sky HD freeview channels but with Sky you have to navigate the TV guide through all the blocked subscription channels to find the one you want to watch. Via the Bowmore mast, the TV guide just lists the freeview channels, which is great.Freeview said that there are more channels available on main transmitters than there is on relay transmitters, which play a vital role in providing more remote areas a TV coverage.There are a lot of aerials on houses and I think Islay’s TV transmitters should get an upgrade to the same channels as other areas expect.I will also raise this issue with those elected to improve our lives, including MSP, MP, council leader Councillor Currie and Councillor Horn.Colin M Campbell, Port Charlotte, Islay.I think we all need a boost of positive news, so I would like to appeal to your readers to give a brave and special young person in your area the credit they deserve by nominating them for the  WellChild Awards.We are looking for inspirational children and young people who have defied the odds in the face of serious illness and the selfless nurses, doctors, brothers, sisters and friends who help care for them.This is your opportunity to give them the recognition they deserve at a prestigious event regularly attended by WellChild Patron, The Duke of Sussex.Nominations are open now so please get yours in before the closing date on Monday December  at noon.

A guide will also be available in the village shops.In this way, we hope to brighten the preparation for Christmas for everyone.More than , children are admitted to hospital every day in the UK and it has never been a scarier time for them.With unfamiliar wards, health professionals in additional PPE, only being able to have one parent with them, and no visits from their brothers or sisters during the pandemic, it can be very worrying and lonely.That is why play and distraction services in hospitals are now more vital than ever. Having access to toys and entertainment, when recovering or waiting for treatment, or using play as a distraction for procedures can help to alleviate pain, aid recovery and bring joy back into children’s lives.At the children’s charity Starlight, thanks to our supporters, we provide hospitals with boxes filled with toys, games and puzzles to be used on wards.This year, Starlight’s fundraising income has fallen due to many cancelled events, which is why we have started our Time to Play campaign. Our goal is to raise £, before the end of the year to help , children get access to play in hospital and limit the negative effects of illness on their childhood.It’s easy to support and our website has fun ideas of how to take part, including our Stream for Starlight fundraiser for computer gamers.Or,you are able to, please considering making a simple one-off donation. However big or small, it will help Starlight to continue to be there to support children and their families this Christmas.I’m hoping your readers will join together and help support Starlight, to bring back joy into the lives of the , seriously ill children living in the UK this Christmas.Please visit www.starlight.org.uk time to help us. Thank you.Every year thousands of children contact Childline about being bullied online and tell us that they feel it is hard to escape from.Lockdown has intensied these feelings for many and since April we’ve counselled more than , children and young people across the UK about online bullying.Children have told us about people sending threatening or abusive messages and being pressured into engaging in sexual conversations. Others have shared that they’ve been excluded from online games by other children, while some spoke of online identities being stolen to embarrass or cause trouble while using their name.Before lockdown measures were first introduced this year, the average monthly number of counselling sessions with children about online bullying was . Between April and October that value increased by  per cent to a monthly average of .This is worrying, particularly as we continue to adhere to strict social-distancing restrictions across Scotland and children continue to spend more time online. Bullying can have a long-term impact on the mental wellbeing of a child and, as we mark Anti Bullying Week this month and beyond, it’s important to ensure that every child knows who they can turn to for support.If a parent thinks their child is being bullied online, it can be hard to remain calm, but it’s crucial not to overwhelm a child with questions. Taking their device away is likely to make them feel like whatever has happened is their fault instead, it’s helpful to listen to their worries, suggest they take some time away from certain apps, and provide them with reassurance.Adeniyi Alade, service head of Childline at NSPCC Scotland.Boris Johnson’s comment that devolution has been #a disaster north of the border# and #Tony Blair’s worst mistake# should hardly come as a surprise to anyone.The Tories have never been great supporters of devolution, vehemently opposing both the referendums in  on establishing a Scottish Assembly and in  on the Scottish Parliament.Most recently the devolution power grab that is highlighted in the Internal Market Bill simply reinforces this stance.The Scottish Social Attitudes surveyon constitutional preference found that only seven per cent favour abolition of the Scottish Parliament and it found that trust in the Scottish Government sits at four times that of the UK Government. This points to it hardly being a disaster.For those accused of scaremongering that there is a threat to Holyrood, Mr Johnson’s comments are clear vindication. The irony of all this being that devolution has given new le to the Scottish Conservatives after its wipe out in  and it is now the opposition in the Scottish Parliament.Be under no doubt that the Scottish Parliament, which was hard fought for, is under threat and we must do all in our power to defend it.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.While this year Christmas is going to be dferent from usual for many of us, it is still a time for preparations and extra food.

Usually we look forward to the Christmas lights and decorations brightening up the dark winter nights and bringing hope and cheer.This year, we wait and wonder. We wonder what level our area will be in, we wonder what level our family and friends will be in, we wonderwe will be able to see them or have them in our homes or go to their homes.We wonder. We watch the news and hope restrictions will be eased, but we are afraid of that too, as this could lead to the virus spreading. So we wait and watch and wonder – a bit like the shepherds of old, gathered on the hillside, waiting and watching and wondering.It has been a tough few months and for many it has been a gruelling and harrowing few months.How do we celebrate in such times Yet, I have heard so many people say: #Well I’m going to put up my tree and I’m going to do it early to bring some cheer into our lives.#We are a people of hope, even in the darkest days.We wait in the darkness for we know that even the darkest night has the first streaks of dawn to lighten the sky.So as we approach the time of preparing to welcome the Christ child once again, we will wait hopefully."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 18 follow me","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

For every dozen sold, p will be donated to the girls# fund.When staff at Jura Community Store, one of the shops selling the eggs, found out about the appeal, they decided that for every dozen eggs they sell in pink boxes, they will donate an additional p to Children st.Wearing T-shirts bearing the Children st logo and colours, the girls set off from Aqualibrium last Sunday morning, and were joined throughout their journey by Jessica#s big sister Adelle and her friend Jade McCallum, as well as Jessica and Adelle#s parents.Many friends and family members turned out to cheer and clap for the girls and there was even a special, hand-made banner which read: #Well done, girls!#Despite a drizzly shower, the weather was largely pleasant, meaning the girls could enjoy a few pit stops on their journey.They were welcomed at the finish line with balloons, cake, hot chocolate, medals and gts.The girls# parents said: #They smiled, danced and sang the whole way and, as they did, they spoke about the children and families they would be helping and how their Christmas might be now, as a result of the fantastic amount of money raised.#They were absolute stars and did so well. We could all see the pride bursting out of them which was lovely.#As always, friends, family and our community have just been so kind and supportive.

There are probably no more than half-a-dozen casks of -year-old Scotch whisky in existence.It is the habit at Springbank to reserve small quantities of whisky for longer than normal maturity. Although  years is not so very uncommon,  years is exceptional.The particular cask was ‘refill sherry hogshead’ which was filled on December  , with Springbank at a strength of . over proof .It originally contained the equivalent of . proof gallons but more than  years later, maturation had taken most of the spirit away: there was only the equivalent of . proof gallons left, and the strength had dropped to . proof.The out-turn of the bottling operation was  cases and one bottle. These will have a special label and each numbered bottle will carry a certicate inidually signed by the company’s chairman Mr Hedley G Wright, whose great-grandfather founded the present company. Unfortunately it is improbable that any of this whisky # after all there are only  bottles # will be seen by the retail trade the price would be astronomical anyway.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOIslay distilleriesLast working season was a prosperous one for the Islay distilleries, as well as for Highlands distilleries generally.During the summer great activity has been seen in the numerous arrivals of vessels with coal and barley and preparations were made for a resumption of distilling.Wet weather, scarcity of labour and a scarcity of carts made the securing of peats very dficult, and only the dry autumn relieved the situation and allowed the peats to be got home. At Ardbeg, Lagavulin, Laphroaig, Port Ellen, Port Charlotte, Bruichladdich, Bunnahabhain and Caol Ila work is now actively going on, and large deliveries are leaving the district.Highland distillers, however, have now to face the competition again of the distillers of grain whisky, which is now plentul on the market. The Distillers Co Ltd quotes its grain whisky at five shillingsper gallon and with all the high costs of wages, coal repairs etc which encumber the malt distillers, the competition is likely to be severely felt."},{"url":null,"title":"law book not just for legal eagles","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

What started as a personal challenge for David Brown has motivated not only himself but many others to raise money for charity as they keep fit.Many members of the charities for which David has raised money in  have supported him by completing their own runs and walks, the latest being Tom Donnachy, who features on our back page.The fundraising efforts of the three young girls who completed a K walk last weekend also inspired two businesses # Deliciously Scottish Eggs and Jura Community Stores # to donate money to Children st.Finally, it is heartening to hear of the community coming together to help dog Rogan who suffers from cancer.No matter what le throws at us, we can be sure our community will support us."},{"url":null,"title":"letters december 4 2020","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

He decided to donate the proceeds from his November fundraising to Kintyre Link Club.The #take five# challenge was created so others could join in by walking, running or doing the exercise of their choice, to raise additional sponsorship for the club.Tom decided to participate in a bid to repay some of the financial and emotional support he has received from Kintyre Link Club.He was joined on Monday by a troupe of supporters, many of whom also took part in the #take five# challenge throughout November.Tom told the Courier: #I suffer with a lot of mental health problems and, without the support of Kintyre Link Club and Tracy, who has been absolutely fantastic, I would have fallen into a really dark place.#Tom#s mental health deteriorated after the breakdown of a relationship, but it was his ex-partner who put him in contact with Tracy, and also sponsored him £ to take part in the challenge.He was also sponsored £ by Caroline Semple, of Campbeltown charity Shopper-Aide, whose idea it was to do the walk in drag.Tom explained: #I asked everyone to sponsor me £ and Caroline told me she would give me £I did it in drag. I couldn’t do it in drag every day – it would be too inconvenient to get my make up done # but I suggested doing the last day in drag and she said fair enough, she#d sponsor me £.#Tom has raised between £ and £ in total.#People have been really generous,# he said. #I hoped I would raise £ but it spiralled and people started offering me more and more money, especiallyI did it in drag.#He received help from Beckie Shields, also from Shopper-Aide, who applied his glamorous make-up ahead of Monday#s walk.He added: #Finding the motivation to get out the house can be really dficult, so having this challenge was brilliant it did me the world of good.#I think I will keep up the walking – not seven days a week but maybe Monday to Friday. I’ve actually treated myself to a pair of walking boots as all my trainers were wearing down.#I’d love to thank the people at Shopper-Aide for all their help and donations, Kintyre Link Club for being there and supporting me, and Sarah from ACUMENit wasn’t for her, we wouldn’t have done it.#"},{"url":null,"title":"swimmers getting back to their best","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

There are only two criteria: the narrative of the short story must take place on the island and the story should have a link to one of the many myths and legends about Jura.The finished product will be published on the Isle of Jura#s website.TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGOShip launch boost for CampbeltownAn estimated £, was pumped into the Kintyre economy last weekend with the naming of a new class of Stern trawler at Campbeltown shipyard.Around  guests travelled to Campbeltown for the naming of the latest addition to the fleet of Peterhead-based George Moodie and Sons Trawlers Ltd, Shemarah II.They came in coaches and occupied a large number of hotel rooms in and around Campbeltown.The . metre trawler was named by Mrs Jenner Moodie. It was the th addition to the family#s fleet she has named.Piper Derek Wilson of Kintyre District Pipe Band played a selection of tunes before the naming took place.Mr Douglas Moodie said at the naming: ‘She is lovely. We had a number of quotes from overseas to build her but we wanted to keep the work in Scotland.’Other guests at the naming included Sir William Lithgow and his we Lady Lithgow, Argyll and Bute MP Mrs Ray Michie, Argyll and Bute District Council chairman George McMillan and district Councillor Archie McCallum.FIFTY YEARS AGOUnique legal historyMaking his first appearance as a solicitor at Campbeltown Sherf Court on Friday was Mr Patrick Stewart, son of procurator fiscal, Mr A I B Stewart.Mr Stewart is the third generation to act as a solicitor in Campbeltown. His grandfather was Mr Archibald Stewart.Appearing with him was Mr John Mactaggart, son of Mr Charles Mactaggart. Mr Mactaggart is the fth generation in direct descent to work as a solicitor.There are older legal firms in Scotland than C and D Mactaggart, but none with a record of five generations in direct descent.Campbeltown is probably the only town in Scotland with such legal history. The stability of the legal profession in Scotland owes much to such family tradition.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOCampbeltownIn the gale of third December, a boat of the Campbeltown fishing fleet belonging to Mr James Wareham was totally lost at Lochranza.The crew had just discharged the cargo at the pier when the gale burst upon them. The sea was so heavy that the crew had to jump ashore for their lives and look helplessly at the boat being smashed to matchwood.The only salvage is the motor engine. Given the present state of the fishing industry and the high cost of boats, the loss will be seriously felt.Gigha A meeting of the education authority for the County of Argyll was held in Glasgow on Thursday November th. Major AJM Bennett, Dunoon, chairman presided.The committee agreed with the Kintyre District Education Committee that it is not desirable, in view of the present cost of building, to erect a cookery room at Gigha public school as recommended by the local school management committee.JuraThe sad news of the death of Neil Cameron, youngest son of Mr and Mrs Cameron, Skervuile Lighthouse, Jura, has caused the greatest sorrow among his many friends on the island and at Oban where he was employed for two years on the Northern Lighthouse steamer Hesperus and held in high esteem by the captain and crew.Anxious to advance in his calling, he joined the SS Strathlore of the Strath Line in July last and made a voyage to the West Indies where he accidentally met his death.The deceased was a young man of excellent character and genial disposition and his abilities would doubtless have brought him to a high place in his profession had he been spared.Many expressions of sympathy have been received by his sorrowing father, mother, sister and brother in the great and sudden sorrow.CAPTION:A  advertisement encourages Courier readers to get their pocket lamps #put in order# at MacGeachy#s in Union Street.

When you then think of other celebrities earning mouth-watering sums from the BBC, this gives clear evidence that the BBC could quite easily continue with the free television licences for the over-s.My income does not qualy for pension credit by a small margin but I have now had two communications from TV Licensing reminding me to pay the fee.Each time it encloses a brochure and ious forms to complete in the hope that I feel empowered to pay the £. required to watch TV.So far, I have decided to weather the storm and not pay. My hope is that thousands of over-s do likewise and Auntie will realise that expecting us to fall into line is not as simple as it expects.Silver Voices continue to pressure the BBC to think again and reinstate free licences for the over-s.It has my full support and will continue to do so until the BBC bites the bullet and cancels its continued harassment of OAPs.Keith Abendroth, Campbeltown.For many of us, the festive season is a time for giving and sharing, which is why we’re inviting you to celebrate Giving Tuesday.I’d like to take a moment to share with your readers how, in choosing to give to our charity, Revitalise, you’ll be making a real dference to the lives of the disabled people and carers that we support.As a charity we know that however tricky this past year has been, le is about spending time with the people we love, and everyday le can so easily get in the way of that. Hilary has cared for her son Shaun since he had an accident on holiday in Ibiza, aged .Caring is simply something she does for the person she loves. As she explains: #For the last  years I’ve been caring for Shaun but I definitely wouldn’t call myself a carer, it’s just something I do as his mum.#I’m never, ever, going to give up on my son. Le is too short you know you need to keep fighting.#On top of the dficulties this year has presented, disabled people and the elderly have also been left with far less support than usual, as the Emergency Coronavirus Act allowed local authorities to axe their duty of care responsibilities. Feeling vulnerable and abandoned, many carers are close to breaking point.#This is why we have launched our campaign, Care For Carers and the fundraiser Raise a Million, aiming to raise £ million to support carers and their loved ones to access respite care breaks following lockdown.We have provided respite care breaks # a vital leline to so many unpaid home carers and their disabled loved ones # for over  years.So, in celebration of Giving Tuesday this month, why not pledge to give something special to our charity this festive season I am so proud to work for Revitalise as we amply the voice of carers, and will continue to do so until carers stories are heard. Please support our campaignyou can, and help us spread the word about the struggles carers are facing right now.To find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or the ways that we may be able to support guests, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Devon Prosser, Revitalise"},{"url":null,"title":"neil goes to great lengths for worthy cause","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We were short on resources and there were many things to fix.#I don’t mean to pile on at the time of a pandemic, but it does concern me theof time it is taking to fix street lighting.#Very often the answer from the roads department is that due to Covid or staffing, we won’t be able to have anybody look at the light for the next month.#I am a little concerned that Covid is a go-to answer now for everything.#Perhaps that is unfair, but I have concernsstreet lighting is not going to be looked at quicker.#Mr Smith responded: #I can give assurance that we are not using Covid as an excuse. There are glitches out there, and through the winter months street lighting repairs are more numerous than during the summer.#Provost David Kinniburgh then asked: #I know there are issues at the moment for street lights. Nothing is replaced because they are sourced from England, and because of Covid they were on furlough.#Do we have any update on when the supplier might be opening up again #Mr Smith answered: #There are supply challenges in numerous areas, but the demand remains the same, not just in the UK but across Europe as well.#The general position is that things are starting to trickle through and we are now receiving equipment that was not available before.#We have some lights to install in the Oban area which should have been with us a while ago. We have also had supply issues on things like parking meters.#So the short answer is that there remain some delays, and we are not in the position we were in pre-March to get things off the shelf, but it is beginning to improve.#Commentary in the report said: #Due to the team being signicantly reduced for a substantial period of time, the lighting team have been prioritising lighting repairs.#Actions are being taken to progress solutions to ensure the street lighting team have the resources necessary to carry out repairs.#The service plan on bringing in third party contractors to address the outages and communication is ongoing to address the more complex issues in order to get these resolved.#"},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week december 11 2020","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

There are no dragons on hand, but you might spot green woodpeckers, dippers or nuthatchesyou are lucky.The castle itself sits on a rocky outcrop carved by the Burns of Care and Sorrow . It dates from the early s, when it was known as Castle Glume. Ownership passed to Colin Campbell, st Earl of Argyll, through marriage, and he chose to change the name to Castle Campbell via an Act of Parliament in .John Knox and Mary Queen of Scots were both said to have visited the castle in the th century. Knox reputedly gave a sermon while he was there. A century later, it was occupied by Oliver Cromwellrsquos forces during the Civil War. But after the execution of the eighth Earl of Argyll in  for his initial support of the parliamentarians , the castle began to fall into disrepair.By the Victorian era, it was a picturesque ruin attracting the attention of passing artists including Horatio McCulloch who painted the castle twice, in  and again in . In , the great Victorian artist Joseph Mallord William Turner made two sketches of the castle that were to become part of the Turner Bequest to the nation in . Sir Walter Scott also visited a couple of times in the s, but, for once, he had nothing much to say about it in his writings.It wasnrsquot until  that the castle passed into the control of the National Trust for Scotland and it is now administered by Historic Environment Scotland. What remains is an imposing tower house some  metres high , a courtyard and gardens amidst a setting that has the Ochils as a backdrop and the Forth Valley spread out below.Because of the coronavirus pandemic, the castle is currently closed to visitors, but it remains a marker in the landscape, a marker of Scottish history and our ability to find romance in stone and setting.

Scenes ndash bad scenes ndash are conjured up and along with them possible outcomes that set my heart racing and my breathing grow shallow and fast.For all has changed here yet again. I am no longer crossing the road to the other unit, thank God. I would have gone downhill fast in there I know.No, Irsquom going home. Home to Las Molieres. Home alone with this time no Ceacutesar, no companionby my side to mind and keep me company as the hours tick by.It seems now that with my walking much improved and, bizarrely, my general health too, they feel I can do it. They have more faith in me I think than I have.Having been here since March it feels asI am about to step off a precipice, hands tied behind my back, and no-one there any longer to catch me.I will not always be alone. A nurse will check me morning and late evening. An aide will possibly,I wish, come in three or four times a week to see what help I might need around the house. A physio will come daily and with her help I hope to master walking outside again and strive for balance control.A prescription will be given for wheelchair and Zimmer although I hope to use them as little as possible andmyself to an upright human position.And I have the devoted Miriam for whom I give daily thanks. She will come morning and night to unshutter and shutter the house ndash the first check of the day.She will also get any shopping, prescriptions I need, and will do the housework. Finally, we have come to a financial arrangement for that which makes me feel immeasurably better but in no way recompenses for million kindnesses she shows me and has shown me over the years.Deb and Alistair too are ready to come whether called or not and also do shopping. They will dose me with English and a shared black humour sadly absent in Miriam.For the obvious and many reasons le at LM cannot be as it was before. I must move often not sit peering into the world from my Mac with a vin close to hand.And, despite the circumstances, I must come to terms with the loneliness of my isolation which was eating me far more than I realised before all this happened.I must strive to cook properly to keep up my strength for the treatments still to come and not rely on vin rouge and crisps as a substitute for dinner. I already know my first meal though ndash yes, my beloved oven chips with two eggs cracked in for the final minutes.I must hope the treatment side effects are deal-able with when alone and frightened butnot the SSR where I am have promised they will bring me back to deal with them.But of all I must learn, the most important is to try to live without Ceacutesar, my mad beautul boy nuzzling at my feet or disdainfully refusing my entreaties to come in for the night and stop howling at the moon.Learn to live without his long hound nose nudging my arm and elbow for attention his deep sleep breathing on the tiles by my side his Afghan perfume as he dances around me.Today on her visit, tears streaming I asked Miriamshe would remove his feeding bowls and bed to the attic before I entered the house a week from tomorrow.Already thought of and done. As an aside she says,I want, she will stay all night on the first night. I want.I will still see them of course, and him, but Irsquoll not feel him as I often did Portia, for he lives on apparently happy where.

Instantly. A reporter touched a camera. A reporter took a photograph. Aargh.I actually never ever saw it happen. In decades. Not once. Tonight, thanks to unintended consequences of Tier Four bubble-mania, it sparks nothing more than a frisson of all-round irritation.Okay, mostly from me. The fat food critic who doesnrsquot even own a camera. Never has. Canrsquot even work the things.Anyway, the doorbell has gone, the delivery been accepted and laid on the kitchen table. Tinfoil is unfolded, space is cleared, stuff unboxed, iPhone unleashed and the new ritual gone through. Snap, snap, snap.

Food ready. We sit, we get the big spoon out. Early doors  This is a proper lasagne. Bubbled on top, browned righteously, parting into portions that reveal the tell-tale softness of fresh pasta and most importantly, most reassuringly, there is layer after layer of it.To me, a lasagne in Italy, one made by someone-you-know in someone-you-knowrsquos actual house always has loads of layers, the thinnest spreading of ingredient separating them, and a creamy bechamel in there just thick enough to temper everything. Like this.Layers so fine it looks like alternating stripes. This is a good lasagne, we agree, and vote we would order it again. Though maybe a bit bolder with the seasoning next time, please Onto that cannelloni. Fat long tubes, draped in cheeses stuffed with enough spinach to give the ricotta a peppery kick, once again the pasta buttery smooth, those fat tubes holding everything in place until it sprawls at the touch of fork.Wersquoll still be finishing both of these off tomorrow night. And enjoying them.Oh, there are a couple of caprese salads, ordered out of curiosity, served on cocktail sticks, doused in olive oil, the basil surprisingly lively. A bag of handmade, heart-shaped, cinnamon flavoured biscuit things from abruzzo.Now, Irsquove got to tell you I actually emailed three dferent small-scale finer food suppliers on Facebook.

But, as I sat back on Wednesday night, hot chocolate in hand, fire roaring, staring at my six-foot tree with gaudy fluorescent pink baubles, silver peacocks, chocolate Santas and twinkly, flashing coloured lights, I felt a flash of joy not experienced for many months.It took me back to an argument I had at eight years old with my mum and dad who didnrsquot celebrate Christmas, because in their minds it was a religious festival that they, as Muslims, could not celebrate.My dad told me how he had attended a Christian college in Lahore under the British Raj and had memories of being forced to sing hymns every morning at assembly.Me: Ok, but I just want a tree. Them: No, because we are not Christians. Me: With lights, tinsel and baubles, please, oh and an angel. Them: Christmas is for Christians. Me:Everybody has a tree.Do you really want me to be dferent  Them: OK wersquoll get a treehellipBut no carols and definitely no Midnight Mass.Unfortunately for them, I loved singing so would sneak out for choir practice, belting out O Come All Ye Faithful and Away in a Manger with all associated harmonies, just for the sheer, unadulterated joy of it.But somewhere between then and my th birthday I began to feel that Christmas didnrsquot quite sit right with me. It felt strangely unfulfilling and I couldnrsquot understand why. I could join in with the playground chat about whether I was hoping for a Chopper or a Sindy for Christmas, and Irsquod sing the solo in the church, but something was missing.I recognise now that what I was feeling was the half-pleasure that comes from a type of cultural appropriation. I was appropriating Christmas for myself, without fully understanding what I was celebrating, and that felt more than a little hollow. That year there was no request for a tree from me and ours was the only front room on the street without a tree, although my sister, who was nine, in a quiet act of rebellion against the rest of us, set one up in her bedroom.Thereafter, Christmas was always a welcome and peaceful break from school, university and then work, and a happy time spent with my atheist in-laws, which, whilst I enjoyed, I never fully understood what we were celebrating. It was really the worst sort of cognitive dissonance but one which I trained myself to accept to lsquofit inrsquo.Itrsquos taken no less than a pandemic to persuade me otherwise. Now, like a crazed pleasure addict I seek more of the warm glow that comes with gazing lovingly at my tree, receiving online deliveries at the rate of four per day, and watching my bank balance fluctuate between quite healthy to overdraft at an alarming rate.The buying, the wrapping, the cards, the food, the table decorations, the sparkly clothes ndash I have decided to do it all to get a fix of much-needed cheer at the end of the weirdest year ever. I did argue a few weeks ago in this column that we should all go for a simple, scaled back Christmas this year, but no, this six-foot tree has persuaded me that we all need a bit of pleasure in these tricky times and we shouldnrsquot be too fussy about where we find that. My own kids having been raised as full-blown mixed race, mixed heritage, best of both types, have definitely got the hang of this whole damn festivals thing ndash hold on to every possible opportunity to extract cash gts from your loved ones, go with the flow, sod the culture wars and enjoy.So this year Irsquom going to fully culturally appropriate Christmas and milk it for all it is worth: From themed advent calendars and a dferent Christmas movie every day to socially distanced carols in my street and turkey with all the trimmings, Irsquom here for Christmas for the first time ever.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

They will lecture us on the dark forces that impelled Brexit and portray those who supported it as semi-literate yokels who, in their ignorance, were incapable of comprehending the issues. On my travels throughout Englandrsquos northern regions following the  referendum, it became clear that this was a smear every bit as contrived as the fiction of taking back control.Rather, many of them had felt the chill of the European Unionrsquos neo-liberal, free market instincts in their own communities. The EU, at its heart, is a corporate Xanadu where the writ of capitalism is given licence to roam. Wersquove known this for many years.In a  paper published by New Yorkrsquos Cornell University the academics Nathan Lillie and Ian Greer shone a torch on the iniquities at the heart of the EUrsquos industrial plan. ldquoConstruction employers, with the aid of the Commission of the EU, and acquiescence of national governments, have made it an integral part of their strategy to access opportunities outside the national state framework. In each of our country cases, construction employers are using migrant labour to push the industry toward a lsquolow-roadrsquo model of weaker collective bargaining and worker representation.This, they argued, enabled employers ldquoto protect themselves from legal liability, while isolating migrants from the economic and social norms of the host society. Put more plainly, the EU creates feeding grounds for capitalists to squeeze local workers and exploit foreign labour.Remainers who posed as liberal and progressive also chose to overlook the EUrsquos bullying of Greece as it sought to make it a vassal state. In this they were spurred on by German banks who have made more than euro billion in interest payments on Greek bonds since . Membership of the EU confers advantages but most of them accrue to those who already possess a disproportionate share of the worldrsquos bounty.The Nobel-prizewinning economist Paul Krugman also dismantled the moonbeams and unicorn narrative. ldquoI fairly often encounter assertions to the effect that Greece didnrsquot carry through on its promises that it failed to deliver the promised spending cuts, he wrote. ldquoNothing could be further from the truth. In reality, Greece imposed savage cuts in public services, wages of government workers and social benefits. He added: ldquoEuropean discourse is still dominated by ideas the continentrsquos elite would like to be true, but arenrsquot. And Europe is paying a terrible price for this monstrous self-indulgence.In effect, a capitalist troika ndash the IMF, European Central Bank and European Commission ndash was making ordinary Greeks pay not only for the greed of their own business elites but also for the irresponsible lending of German banks looking to make a quick buck.Working-class communities in Fe and the Western Isles have recently had a taste of what lies aheadan independent Scotland opts to climb on board the EU capitalist express. The Scottish Government was able to retreat behind the old state aid contrivance as it abandoned workers at the BiFab fabrication yards to the whims of global corporatism.Having made future membership a cornerstone of its independence offering, the SNP is thus keen to appear a supine acolyte of the EU, despite it being highly unlikely that Scotland will become a member any time soon. Its dealings with the Bab workers were both dishonest and craven. Across the rest of Europe there has always been room for manoeuvre and negotiation within the EUrsquos state aid regulations. The SNP though, ever eager to assist the global, neo-liberal procession, chose to disavow Scottish workers.The SNP knows that its stated future direction of economic travel will require an abrupt detouritrsquos serious about EU membership in the short-term. Thus it chooses not to highlight the obstacles. Not the least of these is the \"sterlingisation\" currency proposal contained in its Growth Commission report, a document now proving so brittle it may soon require to be housed in an air-tight chamber. A singular requirement of supplicant EU members is that their ldquoeconomic and monetary policy contains specic rules requiring the independence of central banks.The SNP has also hitched our future economy to the EUrsquos Growth and Stability Pact, a concordat which one prominent trade unionist described to me as ldquopeak neo-liberalism representing a massive danger to democracy. This is because it caps government deficits at three per cent of GDP and debt at % of GDP. Yet, as in its state-aid regulations, there is no absolute requirement to implement this.By following this an independent Scotland faced with trade deficits and lacking spending autonomy under sterlingisation leaves its citizens vulnerable to the predations of the credit jackals. A grown-up conversation needs to take place about thesethe SNP is genuinely serious about throwing Scotland into the arms of the EU. But the only pro-independence bodies advocating such are scorned by party lickspittles as ldquothose Common Weal types.Six years after the last independence referendum the SNP is no further forward in saying how it will secure a second one. Does anyone really believe that an In Out EU referendum will happen soon after independence is gained Authentic self-determination offers a one-time-only opportunity to develop a dferent type of economy. In the dismal argot of the Holyrood managerial class we can dare to alter the paradigm and change the conversation: to have an option for the poor and to unlock the full economic potential of working class communities.Independence gives Scotland a chance for popular democratic control over the economy and the state, but notthe EU has anything to do with it.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

protects against Covid-.A class of anti-inflammatory drugs called JAK inhibitors, which includes the rheumatoid arthritis drug baricitinib, already produces this effect.They also discovered that boosting the activity of another of the five genes - INFAR - is likely to create protection by mimicking the effect of protein molecules which are released by immune system cells to defend against viruses.: What Scotland should learn from the disastrous unravelling of Wales firebreak successHowever, experts caution that - to be effective - patients might need the treatment early in disease.The researchers say that clinical trials should focus on drugs that target these specic antiviral and anti-inflammatory pathways.Dr Baillie, who is also a senior research fellow at the Roslin Institute, thanked the patients and their families for taking part.He added: ldquoThis is a stunning realisation of the promise of human genetics to help understand critical illness.\"Just like in sepsis and influenza, in Covid-, damage to the lungs is caused by our own immune system, rather than the virus itself.\"Our genetic results provide a roadmap through the complexity of immune signals, showing the route to key drug targets.ldquoOur results immediately highlight which drugs should be at the top of the list for clinical testing.

From the northern isles’ perspective, we see it rather dferently. The pandemic has shown us what is possible for other people because so many people in my constituency are left bumping along on speeds that are less than  megabits per second.“I joined the st century just a couple of weeks ago, when I bought myself an iPhone , which has G capability. I speed tested it as I was coming up for the debate today. I got a speed test of  megabits per second download and  megabits per second upload. We have spoken for years about a digital ide, but that ide is now a chasm.“For Orkney and Shetland, the idea that internet speeds and access to the internet should be more than  times greater in SW than in KW,  and , and ZE,  and  illustrates the nature of the problem we face. It speaks eloquently about the failure. Simply leaving it to the private sector is what has produced the situation today.“My hon. Friend the Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross [Jamie Stone] asked “Who is responsible for this ” We have this constantly in Scotland: on the one hand, there is the provision made by the Scottish Government and, on the other, we have schemes funded by the UK Government. The dficulty is that neither of them gives us what we need.“This House legislated for a universal service in broadband. Constituents of mine get quotes from BT for that and they hear of £,, £, or £, for a broadband connection to get them to  megabits per second. If that is only available to people who have a spare £,, £, or £, lying around the house, it is hardly a universal service.“However, my constituents are also frustrated at the lack of certainty and community consultation we see from the R scheme of the Scottish Government. We still do not know what they are going to deliver and when we are going to get it. All the signs are that the problems that we have had—a service to be deployed in the isles that is designed in Edinburgh what people in Edinburgh think we can get and we need—are going to be there again. The most remote and the most economically fragile communities in my constituency still risk being left behind.“It should not be rocket science. Surely, with a bit of will, the Governments could speak to each other and do better than this.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He therefore called for similar support to be made available to protect the future of Orkney’s leline ferry services.In response, Mr Wheelhouse said that through discussions between Transport Scotland and local authority ferry operators it was decided that funding pressures as a result of COVID- should be addressed through engagement with COSLA. This was part of a wider ask from local authorities on COVID-related support, which he understood was still ongoing.Afterwards, Mr McArthur said: “The board of Orkney Ferries made crystal clear in a letter to the Scottish Government in August that there is a grave risk to the future of these leline services due to the level of losses sustained this year.  However, despite the severity of the situation, the appeal has so far fallen on deaf ears.“While emergency support has rightly been provided for other transport services, Orkney’s ferry services continue to face considerable uncertainty and instability.  That is no way to treat a service that is a leline to our island communities.“Losses at this scale are entirely unsustainable and urgent action is needed.

On Tuesday, as part of an “urgent item” added at the very last minute to the agenda of an OIC general meeting, councillors agreed to top this up with an additional payment of £ for each child.This payment is per child, not per household, and for those families on a low income — anyone whose P- children receive a free school meal due to the universal provision will not be eligible. Therefore, for a family with three eligible children, the payment would be £.This comes after the council was offered a discretionary grant of £,, ring-fenced for tackling food poverty in the county.Proposals to immediately award a portion of this money to some of Orkney’s lowest-income families gained unanimous support from councillors.OIC Leader Councillor James Stockan said: “These are extraordinary times we are living through and our most vulnerable families in Orkney are likely to be worst hit. That is why we as a Council have universally decided to make a supplementary payment of £ on top of the Government grant.“This additional £, will come from a discretionary grant we hold from the Scottish Government. Our officials are to be commended for their swt response in ensuring this additional money will be with our most vulnerable families ahead of Christmas.Councillor Stockan also appealed for families who may be eligible for free school meals in Orkney to come forward to check to seethey qualy.“We are fearful there are families out there who are missing out on free school meals, and now these additional payments, due to a misconception of there being a stigma attached. Please be reassured the system we have in place has already been commended by other parents and carers who have applied as being subtle and ensure complete privacy.“I would urge people to please check to seeyou qualy – more people are entitled to this – this is our chance as a Council to do something additional to help iniduals.”Applications can be made online at the Council website –  http:www.orkney.gov.uk School-Benefit or by calling  for a paper application form.Further information is available on  https:www.orkney.gov.uk Service-Directory S School-Meals-and-Clothing-Allowances.htmcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This includes users of all ages and levels of mobility – cyclists, walkers, runners and wheelchair and mobility vehicle users.The route has been chosen to promote active travel, link communities, improve local access, and act as a springboard for an island-wide network of safe paths.The project group has lodged a planning application for the Skye Bridge to Ashaig Airstrip section of the route, following the old A road where possible. And they are now starting on a detailed consultation for a link between Ashaig and Broadford.In March the project group held a community consultation on the three possible routes for this section. It was concluded that the single track ‘committee road’ option running through Breakish would give the best compromise between a quiet, scenic, low-traffic area, and the straightest, most direct route. This was the link most favoured by public consultees. met with supporters of the project outside Breakish Hall to find out what the Skye Cycle Way would mean to them.Broadford Primary pupil Krista said a cycle path would allow her and other children to do what they loved without any worries.She said: “For little kids that want to do more cycling it would be safer because just a little slip off the pavement could lead to a road accidentthere’s a car coming, so I think the cycle path would be really handy.“It wouldn’t put me at risk of traffic and it would mean I just go out and cycle.”Breakish resident Lis Phillips felt the cycle way could help recapture the feeling of safety for cyclists experienced during the lockdown.She said: “I cycle back and forth to my work at Broadford surgery, and during the lockdown, I noticed people on bikes who I’ve never seen cycling before because there were hardly any cars on the roads.“There is obviously an appetite for people to be able to cycle but they don’t feel it is safe, so they don’t do it.”The project group has been working with engineering consultants and main funder Sustrans, to come up with a design proposal for the route that will meet their requirements.The plans involve separating cyclists from pedestrians and other users. Cyclists would share the single-track carriageway with motor traffic, and pedestrians would enjoy a new . metre wide footpath. that the safer environment would help pupils thrive.“There is no way to avoid traffic when you are living here in Broadford, it is so busy – all the traffic that comes through Skye comes through us. So for the children, it was quite daunting to let them out on their bikes through the village.“However, during the lockdown, they were out on bikes, and more of them were cycling than ever before. You are seeing fitter and healthy children with just that bit more independence and freedom.“The cycle way is a wonderful thing.”Kyleakin resident Ian Sikorski, who has a family house in the area, earmarked the best route between Ashaig and Broadford through the community consultation and said: “Hopefully people will see the necessity for it. We have the house at the end of the ‘committee road’ beside the cattle grid.“My auntie lived there, and at that time there weren’t many houses at all. Now look at the number, and in another  years there will probably be twice the number – and you have seen the state of the road, so it badly needs a footpath.“Highland Council should have put in a footpath really. It is definitely needed. If people with families are going to build houses then it would be greatthey are able to walk and cycle along to Broadford or Kyleakin.“I used to cycle up that main road, regularly. I haven#t cycled it for years now. It is too dangerous.”﻿‘Future users’ group to be launched to help shape design of cycle way﻿The Skye Cycle Way project group secured funding from Transport Scotland via Sustrans to develop the detailed design proposals for the whole route, secure access permissions, and planning consents, and work up its strategy for finding the estimated £. million required. Match funding will be needed as this accounts for  per cent of the overall project costs.This builds on earlier feasibility studies, concept designs, and community consultation undertaken during , also funded by Transport Scotland and Sustrans. that a ‘future users’ group will be launched in the new year to ensure that all sections of the community have the opportunity to help shape the design of the path.They added: “We want this to be a safe, shared-use path for everybody, an asset for our communities, our environment, and our economy.”Due to Covid restrictions, the group have been unable to hold any face-to-face public consultations since March but are hoping this changes in the new year..

As well as the council, the plan involves Highlands and Islands Enterprise and the Scottish Futures Trust.All three agencies will help identy funding, once the list of projects has been agreed under five broad headings: Strengthening communities, health and education, sustainable tourism, digital and transport infrastructure and a erse and green economy.This week, following an online area committee meeting, Skye and Raasay councillors welcomed the progress to date .Tourism body SkyeConnect also welcomed the potential for the plan to deliver material benefits for the island.A spokesman added: “The priorities for SkyeConnect are, unsurprisingly, additional toilet facilities, road improvements, car parking and a greater provision of ’stop-over’ locations for campervans with appropriate basic infrastructure. In addition, SkyeConnect is working with a number of bodies to develop a so-called ‘internet of things’ which will greatly assist in managing the flow of visitors around the island.”The ‘internet of things’ concept sees digital infrastructure providing real time information on traffic flow and footfall at key locations. This can then be used to send mobile alerts to visitors with suggestions for alternative sites that are not too busy.John Gordonwas pleased the plan was “progressing well” as it had been a priority for Skye and Raasay councillors for some time. He also thought that upgrading Portree harbour would be an ideal project.“This update is encouraging and is an exciting development for Skye and Raasay,” he added. “Over the last few years we have seen some great partnership working at ious tourist hot-spots that has attracted some investment which has made a signicant dference, but we acknowledge there is much to do, and major investment is still needed.“The local area committee and partners are ambitious for Skye and Raasay and this investment plan which spells out actions for coordinating and securing funding and for the implementation of the plan.”Calum Munro highlighted the redevelopment of Uig harbour as a possible candidate for inclusion.He added: “The development of the Skye and Raasay investment plan is at an important and exciting phase as over the next two months stakeholders gather to engage with all the potential projects which will be part of that plan. It will be great to look at projects and see which ones best achieve the outcomes we want to see for Skye and Raasay in terms of infrastructure, strengthening communities, health and education, developing a green and erse economy and sustainable tourism.“Looking at these projects and identying interconnectedness and partnership opportunities is crucial and it’s clear that to bring in the required investment there needs to be an approach which is strategic and cohesive.“We are now at the stage where virtually the whole of Skye and Raasay have formed community trusts so I’m really looking forward to seeing some of these communities building on the work they’ve already done and achieving some of their other ambitions over the next two-three years.”Calum MacLeod said: “I’d like to see a collaborative economic recovery plan continuing with all relevant stakeholders’ involvement that is essential to address the Covid impact, and also a continuing plan to address at pace more attainable affordable housing. “The plan would also be a great opportunity to improve sustainable green tourism including better public transport infrastructure and the Skye cycle path.“It is a necessity to see trunk road agencies working closer together in achieving better and safer measures for all road users and residents working with councillors. The good work and investment that has been established to date on improving ious key projects should continue going forward towards full development.”For John Finlayson, a place-based and joined up Skye plan is “long overdue” and it was essential that the public sector, businesses, community interests and the wider community “work together to support economic recovery and development taking account of the unique challenges and the unique opportunities” in the Eilean a’ Cheo ward.He added: “The key areas of focus in what has to be an outcome driven plan and which were included in the report to the area committee are strong starting points for further community discussion and engagement. But I doubt many willargue that strengthening communities, health and education, sustainable tourism, digital and transport infrastructure and a erse and green economy are not areas we need to focus on.“I personally have a strong commitment to ensuring the best for our young people. This of course means that we need to make sure that our children are educated in st century buildings which provide safe, healthy and modern learning environments and I will continue to champion the need to build new schools at Broadford and Dunvegan.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CROFTING-SHEEP-1.jpg","title":"the rams are out to mark the start of the crofting","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineWith most now looking ahead to the year-end celebrations and festive reflections, the shortened daylight hours of late autumn and winter actually mark the start of the crofting year, certainly for those whose main interest is livestock, which is the vast majority.This is the time when the rams go out with the ewes, everything bar breeding stock has more or less been sold and it’s time to hunker down for the long winter ahead.Sheep have a natural production cycle which fits the seasonal patterns. As the days shorten, they naturally come on “season” ready for the ram, so that their lambs hit the ground with the new flush of spring grass. Mother Nature never ceases to amaze.Cows, on the other hand, can breed all-year, with the same gestation period as humans, though most calve in or around the spring, for much the same reason as sheep.But late autumn is when you start with a blank canvas. The next few weeks and months are all about ensuring everything has enough feed and reserves to carry it through the cold and wet – but especially the wet.I’ve heard many an old-timer say that the cold and wind rarely bother the animals. It’s the wet that really has an impact, as the lack of a dry lying area just saps their reserves.The financial s from a few animals are just too low to justy expenditure on large sheds and then there’s the cost of bedding. In conversation with a mainland farmer, I happened to remark that it cost us in Lewis north of £ for a big bale of bedding straw, sometimes £. He was getting it at £. He was in no doubt that at these prices it was completely unsustainable to have cattle inside for anyof time.If it’s a crisp, frosty winter, the cattle aren’t much of a problem. But the incessant rain can become a depressing drudge as you constantly battle the mud and dampness. With most crofters having a full-time job, you can see why so many just concentrate on keeping a few sheep – they don’t poach the ground nearly as much and, for quite obvious reasons, require much less feeding.For my own part, I’ve noticed a huge improvement in the grazing and ground since introducing cattle and they’re also vital for accessing environmental funding streams aimed at increasing bioersity.When the better weather finally does come, they’re much less selective in their grazing, meaning they will consume a lot of the harsher grasses, leading to greater rejuvenation of sward. Their dung is an extremely proficient fertiliser that attracts a myriad of insects which, in turn, brings more birdle – a very important consideration in today’s environmentally-conscious times.It’s all pros and cons and weighing up what’s right for your own personal circumstances, time and available infrastructure.But, whatever, it’s crucial to get the winter maintenance regime right so the animals can get off to the best of possible starts and, with a bit of luck, we can settle down to the festivities in a relatively rested frame of mind, however muted the celebrations might all be this year.WHILE we look back on what has been the most tumultuous of years, I hope we don’t forget the massive extra volunteer effort that was needed to carry us through. It was rather gratying to see the best of selfless human endeavour coming through in the worst of crises.At one stage it looked like there would be no livestock sales in the islands. In the greater scheme of things it would hardly have been the worst of outcomes, but it would nevertheless have created huge logistical problems. Fortunately, it did not materialise.The commercial aspect on sale day is overseen by Dingwall and Highland Marts, in the case of Stornoway, Portree and Lochmaddy, and United Auctions in Lochboisdale and the Argyll islands. But it still requires a huge amount of volunteer effort at local level. Even in normal times it is a thankless task to ensure all the animals are in their correct pens and the sale keeps moving along efficiently.Considering social distancing rules and that livestock owners were not allowed to be present on sale day, it must have been all the more challenging this year. So a huge debt of gratitude is owed to all those who ensured the sales went ahead – and relatively smoothly into the bargain. The fact that the prices were so good was a bit of an extra boost, just when we all needed it most."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Dining-Room-2-.jpg","title":"business spotlight priory hotel","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe Priory Hotel is a three-star VisitScotland rated hotel in the picturesque village of Beauly, no more than a short drive north of Inverness and just off the North Coast  driving route.Ownership of Beauly’s Priory Hotel is in the hands of its employees.

The big dference for those who have worked in the town over the past two weeks is the great smell of cookery in the air - that has been largely absent since the imposition of mini lockdown restrictions two weeks ago. By am the whf of Christmas dinners being cooked was wafting through the town as restaurants geared up for the lunchtime trade. Sadly, Council had to take the decision to cancel the Greenvale Street Christmas Market - and this may be a wise move in the context of what seems to be a rising trend in infections across the area.As usual the vast majority of people were following all the proper protocols with the numbers choosing to wear face masks on street markedly on the rise.Bear in mind it’s only .am and we can expect numbers of shoppers to rise steadily throughout the day. And that is why the Mayor of Mid and East Antrim Borough Council is urging shoppers to keep safe whilst out shopping this weekend.Councillor Peter Johnston said: “As we move closer to Christmas, our energy is focused on reminding people to stay safe whilst doing all that they can to support local businesses in these challenging times.“This has been a dficult year for everyone, not least those who have been striving to run a business, as they continue to provide services and keep people in jobs during this pandemic.“Business owners and retailers in Ballymena, Carrickfergus and Larne have worked hard in putting the necessary measures in place to help keep staff and customers safe. So when out and about, it’s important that everyone follows the public health advice: wash or sanitise hands often, wear a face covering and practise social distancing.“We all have an important role to play in helping to stop the spread of Covid.“We have a fantastic retail offering across Mid and East Antrim, and I encourage everyone to safely #Rediscover the #SpiritofMEA by supporting local this Christmas.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3527296.jpg--.jpg?1607673374000\n","title":"vaccines save lives health minister","story":"Health Minister Robin Swann has asked people objecting to Covid- vaccination on anti-abortion grounds to think again.The Minister said some pro-le activists are ‘ironically criticising’ a vaccination programme that will save many lives.His comments come after social media postings from Ballymena based councillor John Carson claiming human tissue was used in the vaccinations captured local headlines.“The Covid- vaccination programme is not compulsory. People are entitled to their own views and I fully respect that.“However, they are not entitled to mislead others and potentially deter them from taking a vaccine that will protect them from a lethal virus.“Making unfounded claims on social media is overstepping the line and I urge them to think again.“Firstly, it should be stressed that the Pfizer vaccine does not contain any human cells.“Secondly, and crucially, It must be remembered that vaccines have saved millions of lives worldwide.“We need widespread take-up of the Covid- vaccine in NI to protect the population, particularly older and vulnerable citizens in our community. Widespread take-up will also help us move gradually towards the easing of restrictions in society.“It is disappointing that people calling themselves pro-le would be objecting to vaccination programme that will save many lives.”It is the case that the development and testing of some vaccines can include the use of human cell lines grown in labs, having been replicated from fetal cells obtained in previous decades following abortions.“If people want to object on those grounds and leave themselves unprotected from Covid- that is their choice. They will be at odds with other pro-le advocates including the Irish Catholic Bishops’ Conference who issued a very clear statement this week.“Any link between any vaccination development and abortions is incidental and remote, involving cells replicated in labs.“As the Irish Catholic Bishops’ Conference stated, refusal to accept a vaccine could contribute to signicant loss of le in the community and especially among those who are most vulnerable.“In matters of conscience, I believe saving the lives of our fellow citizens in the here and now must come first.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3527333.jpg--.jpg?1607676331000\n","title":"your world around your wrist with local woman erinn s ivy and gold bracelets","story":"LOCAL woman Erinn Kerr has been helping mums, friends and family wear their world around their wrist as her personalised Ivy and Gold bracelet brand has recently soared to success.Erinn lives just outside Broughshane with her husband and little girl, Ivy.Her daughter Ivy was diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis when she was just two weeks old, after a newborn screening heel prick test was performed. The condition is inherited, with both parents being carriers of a particular gene. Symptoms include the build up of sticky mucus in the lungs and digestive systems of people with Cystic Fibrosis over time. Erinn explained: There is no cure. “However, there has been lots of great news about new medications that will be available to Ivy when shes older which will be le changing for her.The success of her bracelets has led to Erinn stepping away from her media job at the BBC and devoting her time to building up her business, Ivy and Gold Bracelets, as well as caring for Ivy.Erinn also recently donated a portion of her sales to the Cystic Fibrosis Trust.SUPPORTA firm bloggers favourite, Erinns bracelets have become a real Instagram hit with her creations gracing the wrists of high profile influencers such as Naomi Genes, and Ballymena based Blossoming Birds, Anna Corry.Erinn has been overwhelmed by the growing success of her bracelets and told the : I cant believe how popular they have been. Im blown away by the support I have received and by how much everyone loves the bracelets.Its a really big deal for me to see these influencers wear my products. “I guessthese people, who I consider to be really cool think these bracelets are worthy of wearing then that makes me really excited about the future.Lots of lovely local influencers have been so supportive of me and my business too. “People like Anna from Blossoming Birds, Elle Pearls and Gluten Free Fi. “Help from people like that is huge to a small business.FORMATIONErinn made her first bracelet on a whim, after seeing similar products online from a few dferent sellers in America.Apprehensive about postage and import fee costs, Erinn went in search of a maker based in Europe.However, that search proved futile and Erinn decided to try to make some of her own.Erinn said: I honestly dont know why. Ive never made proper jewellery before.I made one for myself saying IVY and then when I wore it people started asking could I make them one with their kids names on it. It just went from there.Its not dficult to see why Erinns bracelets have become so successful. Blending contemporary designs with traditional gold and silver, her now signature personalised name bracelets have proved to be most popular.From modern stacking bracelets, in gold filled and sterling silver beads, to personalised designs for both adults and children, her bracelets are quickly becoming the perfect gts for family and friends.Erinn is grateful for each and every order she receives and is particularly thankful to those who have helped her along the way.Erinn commented: My husband has helped me endlessly. He made my website and logo and has been so supportive when things have been stressful, even writing envelopes at times. “Though I havent got him actually making bracelets yet.Anna from Blossoming Birds has also been a huge supporter. She helped me get some beautul imagery to help me get started and has given me loads of great advice.Im so grateful to everyone who has ordered a bracelet from me.CHANGES has been quite a year for Erinn becoming a new mother, grappling with a worldwide pandemic as well as standing down from her busy job at the BBC.Erinn said: Its hard for me to compare le at the BBC with le as the owner of a small business because so much has changed all at once. I became a mum for the first time just a few months before the pandemic really hit and at the same time I started this business. So, le before Ivy, Ivy and Gold and the pandemic all go hand in hand and to be honest its like a totally dferent world.I can barely imagine leaving Ivy to drive up to Belfast every day after months spent locked down and not even allowed to go to the shop because of shielding for her condition.I loved my job at the BBC, but after Ivys diagnosis, coupled with the pandemic and shielding, my priority was staying home with her, doing all of her treatments and keeping my family safe.Ivy and Gold has allowed me to do that and Im so grateful.Christmas sales have been crazy, so much so, that I closed the website to new orders on November .I will be working right up to December , the last posting day with Royal Mail, to get all the orders out.You can view Erinns bracelets at Ivy and Gold Bracelets on Instagram and facebook, or by visiting her website www.ivygoldGt cards only are available now for Christmas.

They have been the worst-hit.It#s challenging. We#ve tried to mitigate it, but we can#t replace all the financial loss which has been suffered.She and First Minister Arlene Foster warned people to limit their social interactions between now and Christmas and during the new year.Mrs Foster said: We have made provision that people can get together over Christmas, but they should do so in a safe way.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseFirst Minister Arlene Foster at Stormont yesterdayKelvin Boyes   Press Eye FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueFirst Minister Arlene Foster at Stormont yesterday Just because we say that you can doesn#t mean you have to - and that#s key.Belfast restaurateur Michael Deane said availability in his five restaurants was now limited to just a few lunchtimes.December tables at his Michelin-starred Eipic restaurant sold out within  minutes, with the business enjoying a profile boost from head chef Alex Green#s participation in the BBC#s Great British Christmas Menu.Mr Deane said it looked pretty healthy across the board in most of his eateries.Eipic booked out in  minutes for December. That was no problem because of the TV profile of Alex Green, he added.We usually trade very heavily in December. It#s the cash cow to get us through to Valentine#s Day, but we#re just not going to have that this year.OX, another fine-dining establishment with a Michelin star, also reported strong demand, as did Belfast restaurants Hadskis and James Street.Elsewhere, afternoon teas have been proving popular, with the Ross Park Hotel in Ballymena sold out on Friday, as are other luxury hotels in Belfast.In Londonderry, meanwhile, Ciaran O#Neill, managing director of the Bishop#s Gate Hotel, said demand was healthy, with just one or two rooms left for this weekend - and strong take-up for the rest of December.Mr O#Neill explained that the hotel had tweaked its business model to deal with the rules.It won#t be Christmas parties or office parties but bedroom sales and small tables of two households having dinner together, he added.Grant Thornton economist Andrew Webb said he anticipated strong demand in Belfast on Friday and Saturday.He added that it may be tempered with caution because people will not want to jeopardise their family celebrations.The hope is that trade will be like a traditional Boxing Day, which can see upwards of £m going through the tills in Belfast, he explained.Mr Webb also stressed that with the city accounting for about a quarter of retail and accommodation in Northern Ireland, the reopening of hospitality and shops could result in a total spend of around £m.We#ll have to wait and seea festive flurry grips the city orpeople maintain a cautious approach in order to protect their own Christmas plans, he said.On balance, I#d expect to see brisk trading, with Saturday more likely to be the busier of the two days.Janice Gault, the head of the Northern Ireland Hotels Federation, said it was positive that hotels were reopening, but it was still not a normal Christmas.Bookings have been relatively good in terms of rooms and dining, she added.Social distancing and other measures have signicantly reduced capacity and there will be none of the traditional Christmas party trade. However, it is important that hotels trade and have an opportunity to create some much-needed income.The sector has invested more than £m in ensuring compliance and mitigating risks and will continue to trade in a responsible manner.Martin Murphy, the co-owner of Belfast restaurant Howard Street, said planning was hard.We#ll probably have a decent weekend, but from the point of view of a typical Christmas, it#s not great. I suppose it#s as good as it can be, he added.Pedro Donald, the owner of Belfast pubs the Sunflower and The American Bar, said rules around wet bars meant he was unable to reopen.Last time we were advised to invest in an outside area, so we spent £, on that, though they#re now saying we can#t . We#re being run by a bunch of jokers, incompetent fools the lot of them, he added.In Londonderry, Alison Canney said she was ready to open the doors of her Italian restaurant Spaghetti Junction, but was expecting to have to close again in two weeks, with a further lockdown anticipatedinfections rise because of get-togethers.I am just going to have to write this entire year off because even though we will open, we cannot do anything close to the  or  covers a night we could be doingthere was no pandemic, she added.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ed .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_d-fd---faef_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ed .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_d-fd---faef_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ed .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_d-fd---faef_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ed .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_d-fd---faef_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ed .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_d-fd---faef_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern IrelandNorthern Ireland leaders defend lting of circuit-breaker lockdownStormont leaders have defended the relaxation of circuit-breaker restrictions in Northern Ireland at a time when daily death and infection numbers remain high.Most ReadBelfast school hit with third tragedy as pupil Daniel Black dies suddenlyMark Devenport: Former BBC Political Editor on the highs and lows of past two decades and how family tragedy influenced decision to quitPSNI investigating after officer caught on video wearing RUC badge during search operationCoronavirus Northern Ireland:  deaths and  new cases confirmed as lockdown restrictions easePatrick O#Hagan, who saw pregnant mum murdered by UVF at age of , dies suddenlyLatest CoronavirusFoster calls for clarity as Storey funeral probe outcome delayed until new yearCoronavirus-linked death toll in Northern Ireland has topped ,NI beauty services put in overtime to meet backlog #insanity# after Covid lockdownMark BainOpinionThe magic is missing from shopping trip, but at least my hands smell greatChoose between visiting family or friends, says Northern Ireland medic fearing Covid super-spreader calamityLatest from Belfast ‘Signs of green shoots’ in  inbound tourism forecastJay Rodriguez urges Burnley to finally make the Emirates their happy placeRalph Hasenhuttl wants to show ing fans how far Southampton have comeChris Wilder has faith in Oli McBurnie’s goalscoring abilityBrighton boss Graham Potter refusing to look past Sunday’s trip to Leicester,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Before dawn, non-essential shops and cafes were getting ready to raise the shutters for the last big splurge of the year and spirits were already high.The festive flurry meant Belfast city centre was certainly busier than usual for a Friday morning as queues formed outside many of the most popular retailers from early morning.Shoppers have just under a fortnight to stockpile for Christmas but it#s going to be an equally anxious time for retailers as they try and recoup the losses of a desperately dficult year. Having missed a fortnight of trading during their busiest four weeks of the year, they#ve also faced a battle with online rivals.For those who made the journey into the city centre there was a definite sense of relief to be out and about again but also concern that some people were not keeping their distance or wearing masks in shops.Colm Begley from Clonmore in Co Tyrone had made the trip up to Belfast to pick up his Christmas pyjamas from Primark. This had to be the first stop as it wouldn#t be Christmas without them and you can#t buy them online.

I can#t thank May and the NHS staff enough for looking after me.My advice to anyone offered this vaccine is to take it. If I can have it at , then you can have it too.Mrs Keenan, who will receive a booster jab in three weeks, was the first patient at dozens of hospital hubs across the UK administering the Pfizer vaccine on what the emotional Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, dubbed V-Day.Not long after Mrs Keenan made history, Dundrum nursing sister Joanna Sloan became the first person to receive the jab in Northern Ireland.The -year-old said she hoped her five-year-old daughter, Cailie, would be impressed by what she had done, adding that she felt emotional at being part of such a momentous occasion.Ms Sloan, who manages the Belfast Trust#s vaccination centre, had to put her wedding on hold this year because of the pandemic.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseJoanna Sloan receives the vaccinePA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueJoanna Sloan receives the vaccine She is now due to get married in April next year.This feels like the last hurdle towards keeping people safe - myself and everyone around me, she said.I#ve been looking forward to this for so long and it feels great.

Additionally, the number of people who are trialled or being trialled are comparable to a regular vaccine efficacy trial. Therefore, no corner has been cut on testing, evaluation and determining safety of the Covid- vaccine. The vaccine causes infertility autism etc.Most of vaccine-related side effects or complications are short-lived and appear within days of vaccination. The side-effects of Pfizer#s mRNA vaccine are mild and include fatigueand headachesafter the second dose. During the Pfizer vaccine trials in thousands of volunteers, no long-term disabilities such as infertility or autism were reported.The vaccine will give you Covid-.Most of the promising vaccine candidates including Moderna, Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines only use a portion of the SARS-CoV- virus which by itself can#t cause disease. Therefore, none of the approved vaccines can give disease in vaccinated people. Instead, these vaccines protect people from getting severely sick who could otherwise end up in hospital or ICUs.I get my flu jab - I don#t need a Covid  vaccination as well.The flu jab can#t protect people from Covid- infection. Therefore, to safeguard from both diseases, two vaccines - each specically designed for flu and Covid- - are required. The flu jab is even more important this season due to possible increase in Covid- infection after the festive season in January and February. The vaccine is unsuitable for those with weakened immune systems or existing conditions.There are dferent kind of vaccines to do the same job - protection from infections. Some of these vaccines, particularly live attenuated vaccinesmay not be suitable for people how are on immune-suppressive drugs, chemotherapy or have immune compromising conditions. However, the currently rolled out Pfizer BioNtech vaccine is based on mRNA technology and can safely be applied in these vulnerable communities. The vaccine contains a microchip to track those who get it.This is a myth and there is no scientic backing to this misinformation. All vaccines carry genetic instruction of the virus so that these components of the virus can be presented to our immune system to establish immunity. After this immunity is established, the person is no longer susceptible to the virus and therefore will be safeguarded from severe form of the infection. These genetic instructions are only short-livedand thereafter these are removed through our body#s clearing mechanisms within days. Importantly, the virus genetic instructions in the vaccines are delivered to our cell cytoplasm whereas our DNA is in the nucleus. Therefore, integration of the vaccine encoded instructions can#t reach to nucleus and thus can#t permanently integrate to be tracked. The Pfizer vaccine is based on mRNA technology and RNA can#t be microchipped to DNA as these are not compatible. The vaccine will be used to control people through G cell phone towers.The vaccine contains components of the viruses to train our immune system and these molecules are only controlled by our body cellular and metabolic machinery. Therefore, G mobile phone signals can#t transmit the virus or reduce our defences to attract viruses.The mooted travel and hospitality passports are designed for the government to police people#s behaviour.We are dealing with a deadly virus that has killed more people in a single year than HIV, flu, Ebola did. Therefore, it is a personal, moral and administrative responsibility to ensure at least % coverage of the vaccine so that herd immunity through vaccination is achieved to break the transmission chain of the SARS-CoV-.If everyone  gets the vaccine, I don#t need to.With a % effective vaccine, we need to immunize  out of every  people in a population. This means there will be people within the community who can#t be vaccinated due to their medical complications. This poses a societal responsibility for everyone to take part in vaccination campaign. Herd immunity is a better solution. It would be better to get Covid-.Herd immunity is an established and probably ultimate solution getting out of Covid- pandemic. The question lies how we would achieve herd immunity - either through natural course of infection or through vaccination. In the former case, we will lose signicant lives, people will develop long Covid, and this expensive way of immunity might last only for a year which means the whole process needs to be started again multiple times. The vaccine-induced herd immunity is the safe, plausible and legitimate way out of this crisis. This vaccine has been rolled out too fast.It is true that the timeline for the Covid- vaccine from concept to reality has been in a short one-year time. However, this squeeze in time has been due to re-purposed technologies, cutting short administration, availability of funds and willingness of people to participate in clinical trials. Additionally, the number of people who have been trialled in safety and efficacy studies are comparable to participants in regular vaccine assessment process. Therefore, approval from regulatory bodies is an assurance for its safety and effectiveness. Why is there a vaccine for a disease with such a high survival rate The vast majority of people infected will survive and many will not even notice the clinical signs . However, people who are infected asymptomatically may pass the infection to people with underlying conditions. Finally, while we have learned a signicant number of facts about the virus, there are still fundamental questions that need illustration. For example, people developing #long covid# may become a norm in the long-term, necessitating the importance of vaccines to break the community spread of the virus.Belfast Related Content Geraldine McHugh and Karen and Declan\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland fed .ece AUTOCROP wh --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland fed .ece AUTOCROP wh --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland fed .ece AUTOCROP wh --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland fed .ece AUTOCROP wh --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland fed .ece AUTOCROP wh --_new__I.JPG w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   Geraldine McHugh and Karen and Declan\"VideoCoronavirus PremiumexclusiveWe didn#t know she#d be first in the world: NI family#s pride as Margaret Keenan gets first Covid vaccineThe niece of the first recipient of the Covid- vaccine has spoken of her immense pride at auntie Peggy becoming world-famous.VideoCoronavirusCoronavirus: Delight as the first vaccine is administered but public is urged to stay vigilantThe First and Deputy First Ministers expressed their delight that Covid- vaccinations were rolled out across Northern Ireland on Tuesday - but the public has been warned not to drop its guard against the deadly virus.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_efefc-e-d-e-adcdd_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_efefc-e-d-e-adcdd_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_efefc-e-d-e-adcdd_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_efefc-e-d-e-adcdd_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_efefc-e-d-e-adcdd_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern IrelandNo delay to schoolafter Christmas, says Education MinisterThe Education Minister has insisted there are no plans to delay theof schools after the Christmas break.Most ReadBelfast school hit with third tragedy as pupil Daniel Black dies suddenlyMark Devenport: Former BBC Political Editor on the highs and lows of past two decades and how family tragedy influenced decision to quitPSNI investigating after officer caught on video wearing RUC badge during search operationCoronavirus Northern Ireland:  deaths and  new cases confirmed as lockdown restrictions easePatrick O#Hagan, who saw pregnant mum murdered by UVF at age of , dies suddenlyLatest Northern IrelandSenan MolonyOpinionWhy Sinn Fein could well have dodged a bullet at the last electionChristmas easing of restrictions a ‘mistake which will have consequences’Two thirds of Belfast adults have never had sexual infection checkPets aren#t presents: animal charity issues Christmas pleaJudge to get guidance after #inappropriate# remarksLatest from Belfast Ralph Hasenhuttl wants to show ing fans how far Southampton have comeChris Wilder has faith in Oli McBurnie’s goalscoring abilityBrighton boss Graham Potter refusing to look past Sunday’s trip to LeicesterIanis Hagi and other second-string stars will get opportunities – Steven Gerrard‘I love it here’ – Matt Doherty relishing fight for right-back spot at Tottenham,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This will require declaration on goods moving from Great Britain into Northern Ireland.We will be keeping customs checks to the minimum necessary to police the regimeAidan Reilly, HMRCCommittee member and North Antrim MP Ian Paisley had asked whether traders would expect to see an increase in the current -% rate of checking goods.Mr Reilly said he did not expect to see that percentage increase.“That’s very reassuring and probably something traders will welcome that they won’t actually see much of a dference,” said Mr Paisley.Mr Reilly said he anticipated  million declarations a year on goods moving from Britain into Northern Ireland.Alliance MP Stephen Farry suggested that number appeared low and highlighted that the Government’s Trader Support Scheme had estimated  million.The official acknowledged the figure was “uncertain”, explaining that very little HMRC data existed on movements between Great Britain and Northern Ireland due to the fact that custom declarations were not required previously.“The number is a very uncertain number,” he said.“It’s not a data flow we have previously captured any data on. So the number of traders, the number of movements, what will happen, and whether trader behaviour will change, and you might start to kind of load signicantly larger loads, means that is the best estimate of the number that we have got at the moment but, as I say, that is highly uncertain.”We have a number of core systems that we#ve been developing for the previous two years and our delivery track at the moment is to have all of those core delivery components delivered for the st of JanuaryMark Denney, HMRC’s director of IT for managing the EU exitMark Denney, the HMRC’s director of IT for managing the EU exit, said systems for declarations would be ready by the end of the transition period at the end of December.“We have a number of core systems that we’ve been developing for the previous two years and our delivery track at the moment is to have all of those core delivery components delivered for the st of January,” he told the committee.“So at the moment, we’ve got a very busy December coming, where we’ve got a lot of testing to finish off. We’re getting ready for deployment and implementation. But we fully expect to have a broadly ing model available for the st of January.”The joint UK EU committee working out the operation of the protocol are at loggerheads on what goods entering Northern Ireland from Britain are categorised “at risk” of onward transportation to the Irish Republic and, as such, would be liable for tarfs.If the UK and EU were to strike a zero tarf zero quota trade deal then the need to determine “at risk” products would no longer be required.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming db .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ee-dcc-d-ac-dbfadb_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming db .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ee-dcc-d-ac-dbfadb_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming db .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ee-dcc-d-ac-dbfadb_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming db .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ee-dcc-d-ac-dbfadb_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming db .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ee-dcc-d-ac-dbfadb_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming db .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ee-dcc-d-ac-dbfadb_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming db .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ee-dcc-d-ac-dbfadb_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming db .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ee-dcc-d-ac-dbfadb_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming db .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ee-dcc-d-ac-dbfadb_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming db .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ee-dcc-d-ac-dbfadb_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"North Antrim MP Ian Paisley said he was reassured by the evidence from the HMRC officials PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueNorth Antrim MP Ian Paisley said he was reassured by the evidence from the HMRC officials The customs aspect of the Northern Ireland Protocol is separate from the Single Market dimension which will require increased regulatory checks on animal-based products entering from Great Britain, regardless of whether a broader trade deal is agreed.During Wednesday’s evidence session, Mr Reilly also sought to reassure MPs that issues around the compatibility of the EU and UK’s respective IT systems were being addressed.“We’ve done a series of performance testing on the ious systems with theCommission, all of which have worked appropriately,” he said.“And my understanding from the conversation with the Commission is they are very satisfied with the HMRC systems and the sharing data etc will work with the Commission’s systems.”PAMost ReadBelfast school hit with third tragedy as pupil Daniel Black dies suddenlyMark Devenport: Former BBC Political Editor on the highs and lows of past two decades and how family tragedy influenced decision to quitPSNI investigating after officer caught on video wearing RUC badge during search operationCoronavirus Northern Ireland:  deaths and  new cases confirmed as lockdown restrictions easePatrick O#Hagan, who saw pregnant mum murdered by UVF at age of , dies suddenlyLatest Northern IrelandSenan MolonyOpinionWhy Sinn Fein could well have dodged a bullet at the last electionChristmas easing of restrictions a ‘mistake which will have consequences’Two thirds of Belfast adults have never had sexual infection checkPets aren#t presents: animal charity issues Christmas pleaJudge to get guidance after #inappropriate# remarksLatest from Belfast ‘Signs of green shoots’ in  inbound tourism forecastJay Rodriguez urges Burnley to finally make the Emirates their happy placeRalph Hasenhuttl wants to show ing fans how far Southampton have comeChris Wilder has faith in Oli McBurnie’s goalscoring abilityBrighton boss Graham Potter refusing to look past Sunday’s trip to Leicester,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The -year-old, who played for AC Milan, Juventus and more, passed away yesterday.Italian media reported he had been ill for some time.Rossi became a household name after leading the Azzurri to victory at the  World Cup, finishing as the top scorer on six goals and being named the tournament#s best player.He scored  goals in  appearances for Italy and more than  Serie A goals during spells with Vicenza, Perugia, Juventus, Milan and Verona.The forward was awarded the Ballon d#Or following his World Cup performances.Belfast photographer Michael Donaldsaid Rossi was an incredibly humble man who was thankful to former Italy manager Enzo Bearzot.Prior to the World Cup, Rossi had become embroiled in match-fixing allegations and had not played a professional game of football in two years.Although he maintained his innocence, he was banned for three years following the  Totonero scandal. The suspension was reduced to two on appeal, meaning he was available to play Spain#s  World Cup.Mr Donald, who lives close to Arsenal#s Emirates Stadium in north London, met Rossi through his work on the ESPN documentary I Scored a Goal in the Fa World Cup Final.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseThe football legend in action for Italy during the  World CupGetty Images FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueThe football legend in action for Italy during the  World Cup Originally intended to be a book, which it eventually became, the documentary took Mr Donald across the world, interviewing every living footballer who had scored in the most famous game of all.His interview with Mr Rossi was held in the player#s olive grove and vineyard in Tuscany in September .Mr Donald said the World Cup star could not have been more hospitable towards him and his camera crew. We went out and he put us up in a house on the vineyard, explained Mr Donald, the brother of Pedro Donald, who owns the Sunflower and The American Bar in Belfast.We arranged to do the interview the next day and he came over the night before to make sure we had enough to eat. He was absolutely delightful.His backstory in terms of the World Cup is odd because when the Italian manager Bearzot took him to the  World Cup, he hadn#t played a football match for two years because he had been banned.In many respects, he was a disgrace. He was a scrawny little thing and he knew himself he wasn#t match-fit. Obviously, he was desperate to go to the World Cup, but he thought that he shouldn#t be there. Bearzot saw something in him.Rossi had a slow start, failing to score in the opening group stage. In the second group stage game against Brazil, however, he scored a hat-trick, sending the Azzurri to the semi-final.He later scored goals against Poland and another in the - win over West Germany in the final.Marco Tardelli netted the other goal, leading to arguably the most famous World Cup celebration of all time.Hesaid that when that first goal went in against Brazil, it was like he was touched by a magic wand, said Mr Donald.From that point on, he became a dferent person and a dferent player. He was integral to them going on to win it.Belfast Most ReadBelfast school hit with third tragedy as pupil Daniel Black dies suddenlyMark Devenport: Former BBC Political Editor on the highs and lows of past two decades and how family tragedy influenced decision to quitPSNI investigating after officer caught on video wearing RUC badge during search operationCoronavirus Northern Ireland:  deaths and  new cases confirmed as lockdown restrictions easeSafety of EU officials in NI #not raised or discussed at any meetings# with political reps, says PSNI, despite Paisley#s claims Latest Northern IrelandSenan MolonyOpinionWhy Sinn Fein could well have dodged a bullet at the last electionTwo thirds of Belfast adults have never had sexual infection checkPets aren#t presents: animal charity issues Christmas pleaJudge to get guidance after #inappropriate# remarksTributes to tragic St Malachy#s pupil Daniel Black who was #one of the good guys#Latest from Belfast Senan MolonyOpinionWhy Sinn Fein could well have dodged a bullet at the last electionViewpointOpinionPublic must engage in organ donor talksSteven BeacomOpinionThey may be nasty and nice but Larne are going to be tough nut to crack this seasonTwo thirds of Belfast adults have never had sexual infection checkPets aren#t presents: animal charity issues Christmas plea,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

From feeding, grooming and exercising, to healthcare requirements - there are many areas needing thorough discussion. USPCA Chief Executive, Brendan Mullan, said:It is completely unacceptable to take in a pet on an impulse - you need to ensure that the animal will receive the same care and attention as it did on day oneThe USPCA is also warning the public to be vigilant against the cruel puppy trade this Christmas.Brendan said: Since March there has been unprecedented demand for puppies as people found they had much more time on their hands. Unfortunately, this not only underpins our concerns around the public#s understanding of puppies being a letime decision, but has also fed into the trade of unregistered illegal puppy farmers and dog dealers. They are capitalising on this demand and are exploiting the public with puppies reared in terrible conditions, with their only interest being the lining of their pockets.

She would have given you the last penny in her purse. She would have loved putting on a big hat and playing Lady Bountul all over the place, and she’d have had the money given away faster than me.”Frances added: “For the anniversary of my mum’s death I was running a knitting company and I made packs of blankets and hats and jumpers for the premature baby unit. I’ve never turned my back where there was a need I came across my entire le.”To date, the Co Down lottery winner, who was speaking publicly for the first time, said they have given away half of their fortune to others in the biggest ever Lottery giveaway, helping “thousands” of people, with Frances having lost count of “the number of times I’ve cried my eyes out” following a recipient’s response to her generosity.Frances dismissed suggestions that new found wealth could be as much a burden as a blessing.“This is just love and joy on a permanent basis,” she said.“How could this be a burden  It’s just like winning the lottery every day.”Yet, Frances, who suffers from a medical condition that has her destined for a wheelchair, is also all too aware that fabulous wealth can’t buy you everything.“My auntie told me I had Perthes’ disease as a kid,” she revealed.“When I was a baby I had a big metal frame around my hips my dad used to be able to pick me up with the back of the frame.“I just managed. I’ve always done plenty of sport but about  years ago my cruciate ligament went and all of a sudden the joints went so my mobility is really poor.”She told how she spent years “sitting on a chair, unable to go anywhere or do anything”.“I actually spent about three years in Northern Ireland sitting on a chair because I couldn’t really go anywhere or do anything,” she confided.“I had an operation the year before we won the lottery and it has got me back on my feet again for a bit but I will eventually not be able to walk so I’m preparing for that.”But Frances told the Belfastthat it’s not something that scares her at all.The mother of three daughters — Katrinaand twins Natalie and Fiona— added: “What can you do about it  You just have to get on with it.”She also revealed to this newspaper that her health condition was a factor in her choice of home. Although she had her heart set on a bungalow, estate agents insisted on showing her a castle and a -bed stately home which came with an entire village “somewhere in the north east” of England.But she’s perfectly happy in her current abode — “a five bedroom, brick-built house with good sized rooms and a couple of acres of garden” which she “found on the internet”.The Connollys’ generosity was especially appreciated during the ongoing pandemic.In Northern Ireland, the couple bought new sewing machines for charity workers who were making PPE during Covid, as well as sending food parcels to many sheltering alone.The pair also paid for hundreds of elderly patients in nursing homes to have iPads to Facetime their families — including Frances’ great aunt Sheila Graham — and for young carers to be able to learn from home.“Sheila’s home in Omagh was one of the ones that got tables to keep people from being isolated she was able to talk to my -year-old father Frank in Essex over Skype,” Frances said.Being filthy rich does, however, take some managing.“I get up at am so I can answer all the messages and emails people have sent me before I start a day’s work,” she said.“Then Paddy gets up and makes me my breakfast.”When asked what a multi-millionaire has for breakfast she replied: “Pancakes and pineapple juice this morning...”Frances, now based in Hartlepool, spent a lot of time in Northern Ireland in the pre-Covid days, and admitted that she always has got a buzz out of helping others.The businesswoman added that she has “been doing voluntary work since I was nine”.“Obviously I’m able to do it now on a much bigger scale and the buzz is bigger because you’re actually making a massive dference,” she said.Apart from splashing out on “some nice bits of jewellery” and “more clothes than I need” Frances admitted that she still looks for bargains.One of her most recent purchases was  bottles of Bollinger champagne for people working on the front line.“Patrick and I watched a programme on Monaco recently, and somebody spent £, on a single bottle of champagne,” Frances, who doesn’t drink alcohol, said.“I found a special offer on champagne for £ a bottle, and I’m saving them to hand out to people who deserve some gratitude.”In the meantime, her plans for  include doing a PhD in clinical psychology — and writing a book about her good fortune.Frances said that while money hasn’t changed her as a person, “it does change how you live”.“We’re living in a nicer house, driving nicer cars, I can make a shopping list and, miraculously, my PA just has everything in the fridge for me and it’d be absolutely amazing,” she said.“If I want to go and stay in a hotel I can just do that but it doesn’t change who you are.“We have come into money late. If you’d come to it when you’re young, you’d maybe let it change how you live a bit more.”Belfast Most ReadBelfast school hit with third tragedy as pupil Daniel Black dies suddenlyMark Devenport: Former BBC Political Editor on the highs and lows of past two decades and how family tragedy influenced decision to quitPSNI investigating after officer caught on video wearing RUC badge during search operationCoronavirus Northern Ireland:  deaths and  new cases confirmed as lockdown restrictions easePatrick O#Hagan, who saw pregnant mum murdered by UVF at age of , dies suddenlyLatest Northern IrelandSenan MolonyOpinionWhy Sinn Fein could well have dodged a bullet at the last electionChristmas easing of restrictions a ‘mistake which will have consequences’Two thirds of Belfast adults have never had sexual infection checkPets aren#t presents: animal charity issues Christmas pleaJudge to get guidance after #inappropriate# remarksLatest from Belfast ‘Signs of green shoots’ in  inbound tourism forecastJay Rodriguez urges Burnley to finally make the Emirates their happy placeRalph Hasenhuttl wants to show ing fans how far Southampton have comeChris Wilder has faith in Oli McBurnie’s goalscoring abilityBrighton boss Graham Potter refusing to look past Sunday’s trip to Leicester,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald told apodcast this week: “We should have run more candidatesandI’d been in the possession of a crystal ball and could have accurately predicted… we would have had more parliamentarians, more Teachtai Dala elected.”As it was, she got an amazingly inflated clutch of TDs, increasing the intake of elected members by  seats, while all other large parties, save the Greens, fell away.Sinn Fein provided nine of the top  vote-winners, with Michael Healy-Rae limping into that th place.It had over pc of the vote in Donegal, one of only two constituencies where it ran more than one candidate, both storming home in each, the other being Dublin Mid-West.Sinn Fein now has the same number of seats as Fianna Fail –  apiece. Yet it ran precisely half the number of candidates as FF,  to . Another  seats went a-begging.It may have been just as well. Events of this week have shown that quantity and quality are not the same thing.And so the party of Mary Lou may actually have been spared further embarrassment than has been generated by recent events among its members.Furthermore, such absence may ironically help its credibility as the major Government party in waiting.At the next election, it can sweep in with whatever number of eejits it likes…Simon Coveney spoke to this point, at least in part, when he said this week that “people need to know who Sinn Fein are when they vote for them”.He told Claire Byrne or RTE radio that he didn’t knowSinn Fein voters knew the party’s stance on Provo violence, although he granted that “people vote for Sinn Fein for lots of reasons”.It was, of course, a reference to Laois-Offaly TD Brian Stanley letting the cat out of the bagby equating a War of Independence ambush with the Provisional IRA killing  members of the Parachute Regiment at Narrow Water in .In this worldview, the War of Independence has never ended, evenit is currently being pursued by purely political means.Amazingly, the national broadcaster fell into the trap of aping Sinn Fein language by mentioning Mr Stanley’s references to “IRA attacks” separated by nearly  years, when it is the case that the phrase ‘Old IRA’ came into being to deliberately distinguish between the former undercover army of the independent state – declared by the first Dail in , overwhelming elected by the people – and a paramilitary group that merely claimed inheritance.The Provos had no truck with democracy until  when elections boosted the Hunger Strike campaign.This week Sinn Fein TD Martin Browne of Tipperary reminded many that Mr Stanley’s view – notwithstanding his apology for his ‘insensitivity’ to the living loved ones of the soldiers killed  years ago – is central to the party.Sinn Fein should stop apologising for their “core beliefs”, including that the conflict in Northern Ireland was justied by British “occupation”, he said on Tipp FM.That’s still an extremist viewpoint, even as the party has conquered, and still courts, much of the middle ground.Extremists, given power, can ride roughshod.Meanwhile Mr Browne’s online antics have held up the party as a laughing stock, with past Facebook posts promoting   conspiracy theories, comparisons of NATO to the Nazi SS, and blaming the US and Israel for creating IS.Every party has its lobby fodder.Sinn Fein also has many of the Dail’s best, brightest and most capable.But Mary Lou might reflect that perhaps it’s just as well, after all, that she only ran one candidate in  constituencies.Belfast Related ContentNorthern IrelandUnited Ireland by  and unionists can remain British, says Sinn Fein#s Mary Lou McDonaldSinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald has said there will be a united Ireland by , describing the coming years as the decade of opportunity.Most ReadBelfast school hit with third tragedy as pupil Daniel Black dies suddenlyMark Devenport: Former BBC Political Editor on the highs and lows of past two decades and how family tragedy influenced decision to quitPSNI investigating after officer caught on video wearing RUC badge during search operationCoronavirus Northern Ireland:  deaths and  new cases confirmed as lockdown restrictions easeSafety of EU officials in NI #not raised or discussed at any meetings# with political reps, says PSNI, despite Paisley#s claims Latest Northern IrelandTwo thirds of Belfast adults have never had sexual infection checkPets aren#t presents: animal charity issues Christmas pleaJudge to get guidance after #inappropriate# remarksTributes to tragic St Malachy#s pupil Daniel Black who was #one of the good guys#Latest from Belfast ViewpointOpinionPublic must engage in organ donor talksSteven BeacomOpinionThey may be nasty and nice but Larne are going to be tough nut to crack this seasonTwo thirds of Belfast adults have never had sexual infection checkPets aren#t presents: animal charity issues Christmas plea#They broke the mould when they made Barbara Windsor#,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Sat th Decemberwill see an event streamed live from Raacuteth Moacuter – which will reflect on everything that has happened throughout the year and look forward to a brighter . The event, which will be MC’d by the Silver Fox, will feature live music and contributions from a number of local school choirs and special messages of goodwill, thanks and festive cheer from staff, local residents, tenants, customers, community organisations, and friends of Raacuteth Moacuter from far and wide . googletag.cmd.push Creggan Enterprises Limitedwill still be giving away plenty of prizes on the day – via a free unique raffle code, which viewers can get by liking and contacting us on the Raacuteth Moacuter Facebook Page . Winners will be drawn at random throughout the day and PM’d on FB messenger with details explaining how to collect their prizes . CEL’s development executive Conal McFeely said: “At this time of year CEL would customarily thank all our tenants, staff, customers and users for their support throughout the year and wish everyone a very happy and peaceful Christmas. This message carries an even greater signicance this year in light of the Covid crisis and its impact on the community and local economy. We would especially like to encourage everyone out their to support their local indigenous business and community projects by ‘shopping locally’ and we extend our immense gratitude to all the frontline workers here at Raacuteth Moacuter and wider area who have continued to service this community throughout this dficult time.” googletag.cmd.push ‘There has been so much going on within the community to support people throughout the last number of months. Efforts were really stepped up to support people slipping through the statutory support net, and the wider grassroots community sector really came to the fore amid the health crisis and the ying levels of restrictions and lockdown.’ “Reflecting this immense effort CEL have received numerous messages of support and thanks which we are passing on to all the frontline workers here at Raacuteth Moacuter, and beyond, via brief youtube video clips over the coming days in advance of Christmas.” “These messages of support will complement a range of ‘festive wish videos’ created by the users and tenants of Raacuteth Moacuter themselves, as well as some of our community partners, for all our customers and everyone throughout the city and beyond”.     This event is part of the Raacuteth Moacuter Revival Shared Space Project funded by TEO under its Central Good Relations Programme.

Education Minister Peter Weir tweeted a picture of the paintings after he visited the school last week, and the portraits quickly went viral, appearing on BBCs The View programme. Titillated Executive ministers praised the childrens artwork on social media, with Justice Minister Naomi Long adopting the painting as her Twitter profile picture. The Alliance MLA felt the work captured her essence perfectly. “I love my wonky eyebrow! It looks like Im a bit cross about something which I usually am! Fantastic work and say thanks to all the young artists!” she said. googletag.cmd.push Finance Minister, Sinn Feacuteins Conor Murphy, took time to write to the pupils and express his gratitute, saying the painting was an improvement on the real thing. Mr Murphy also told the children that one of their local heroes had held pride of place in Stormont for years. “The late Martin McGuinness, who was Deputy First Minister, had in his office a large photograph behind his desk in Stormont Castle of someone who attended your school,” he wrote. “It was of the  All-Ireland winning captain, Henry Downey. In an office which had photographs of world leaders including Nelson Mandela, the photo of Henry Downey of Lavey had pride of place.” googletag.cmd.push After the paintings were beamed around the airwaves, requests began to make their way to South Derry and the children have been busy. The Blame Games Tim McGarry, Jake OKane and Colin Murphy got the full treatment from the Mayogall Monets, along with local councillor Sean McPeake, who helped arrange the visit. Principal Mary OKane said the paintings, and associated publicity, had created a great feeling of positivity around the school. “Its created a great buzz, which is very important at this time,” she said. “Following lockdown and the long period of absence from school, its important that children get a wee boost now.     “Its important for the whole school, but particularly those children who are getting a real buzz out of it at the moment. They see themselves as being pretty famous artists.”  Another famous local artist, Kilreas Conor Larkin, agreed to give the childrens paintings a professional artists scrutiny for us this week – and he was very impressed!  Aoe and Charley Arlene Foster: The artist has captured Arlenes ‘lockdown cofure’ – a large, thick plumage of black hair. Arlene is looking away from the viewer, maybe deep in thought or dreaming of an easier time. They have captured a fantastically sombre and meditative state that many artists strive for!  Lisa and Maria Michelle O’Neill: The subject has been caught in a moment of contemplation or reflection. She appears to be gazing just below the viewer’s eye-line. Thinking hard and remaining very tight-lipped, giving no clue to her inner-thoughts. Her hands are clasped, asplaying her cards close to her chest.  Isabelle, Christopher and Charlie Naomi Long: The artist has gone for a bold palette of contrasting colours. The subject is looking a little bewildered or deflated. She appears to have one hand behind her back, asnot wanting to show the viewer her crossed fingers. Or have we purposely been left wonderingNaomi’s hands are tied   Ella, Shannon and Dara Nichola Mallon: The subject appears very happy or comfortable in her own skin. She stands up straight with her hands by her side, portraying a certain pride. This could be the Mona Lisa of political portraits, with her confident gaze following the viewer around the room.  Serena and Chloe Caraacutel Niacute Chuiliacuten: Simple and effective brush strokes have been used to capture the subject’s vibrant hair and expressionless face. The subject stares directly from the canvas, almost straight through the viewer. The artist has done well to capture this moment of determination.  Anna, Riacutean and Molly Conor Murphy: The artist has captured this subject well, leaving the viewer wondering ‘what has he just been asked ’. His bottom lip juts out in a moment of deep concentration, staring past the viewer in search of an answer, as the viewer begs to know what exactly the question is.   Emily Rose and Isla Diane Dodds: A subtle palette of greys has been used to portray the subject’s face, perhaps an indication as to how she is feeling. The subject appears to be smiling, but also looks panicked as she scans her surroundings.  Charley, Don and Seamus Oacuteg Peter Weir: This subject is portrayed as being happy and almost laughing, leaving the viewer asking ‘what is so funny ’. But, looking behind the glasses and gazing further into his eyes, the viewer soon realises there is no joke here.  Amber and Riacuteonach Robin Swann: The artist has really taken the time to depict someone under extreme pressure. His fists are clenched tight, his mouth opened wide asshouting for someone to listen. But, his eyes look sad and his cheeks tear-stained. His gaze is directed straight at you, asto say ‘I have more bad news.  Johnny, Callum, Cathal and Conan Edwin Poots: This painting shows someone who appears to be very happy with themselves, but look deeper into the subjects eyes and you can see that one eye is looking hard at the viewer for approval and the other is looking back at himself in some doubt.  Sean, Conor and Donnacha Sean McPeake :The Artist has captured the subject wide eyed, maybe in disbelief. The pale hue used for his lips, blend into his skin tone – perhaps the artist is sending the subliminal message that the subject is lost for words. The silvery grey hair gives the subject a ‘worldly wise’ appeal.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There is a quiet and unassuming excitement in his voice, of total contentment in the hand sport dealt him. Every syllable resembled a play from his glory days. They were all the same. A vehicle of expression. During lockdown, his we Aisling produced a research masterpiece. A selection of pictures, accompanied by some , words, listing his honours and a selection of comments from his peers and those who watched him blossom. googletag.cmd.push Success followed him everywhere. Also, the comments translate into the story of an ultimate team mate. The type no successful team s without. Thirdly, at the top of the page was the translation of Dermot – without enemy. An evening fishing in Dermot Heaneys footballing repertoire backs up the gentleman tag that has followed him everywhere. A legacy to be envious of. The fact he was pigeon-holed as Derrys most underrated player spoke volumes of the wealth of talent within that Oakleaf golden generation who grabbed the headlines. But Heaney deserved every ounce of his success. Thud, thud, thud. Evening after evening the gable wall at home was peppered with high ball after high ball. Up like a salmon. Time and time again. Laying the foundation for a career bossing midfield and being a magnet at full-forward. The ball always stuck. The definition of fulcrum. googletag.cmd.push Football was always part of le. His brother Kevin, cousins Eugene, Paul and the late Adrian Eggy played for Derry. Dermot was very close to Eggy, someone he rated as super and one of the best club players of his generation. Dermots other brother Niall lined out with the Dawson, while Joanne – the oldest in the family - has All-Ireland medals with Magherafelt athletics club. Their mother Anne Downeys brothers played with Bellaghy. When Dermot helped Castledawson to the -a-side B minor league and championship double, his father Joe was along the line helping brothers Francie John and Tom OKane take the team. Dermots parents became a fixture at the Broagh when, as Dermot jokes, it was frowned on for women to even go to games.     He remembers coming in the evening from games, dropping the kitbag in the corner. “Howd it go,” his father would ask. “Daddy wouldve been at the game, but hed want to hear how I thought it went first,” Dermot jokes. “He was a big fan of football, an honest observer. Not one that their son could do no wrong. If you werent having a good game, he soon told you werent. “They are the things that you remember that are important, more important for the people around you than it is for yourself.” His uncle Eamon was a fine player and also left an imprint. With hindsight, Dermot doesnt know how he found the endless hours. “It was him that got me to use both feet before there was any talk of coaching. He wouldve been kicking the ball to me steady, into my chest.” At primary school level, Heaney and Newbridge Dermot Dougan led Anahorish to the South Derry title. Roger Gribbin, who also played on the team, remembers the simplistic gameplan – get the ball to Dougan and Heaney, they did the damage.  South Derry Championship Winners,  BACK : Hugh McLarnon, Dermot Dougan, Stephen McVey, Brian Heaney, Niall Martin, Stephen McCann, Tony McCannFRONT : Noel Weir, Bernard Mullan, Seamus Diamond, Roger Gribbin, Dermot Heaney, Jonny Nugent, Raymond Gribbin Organised football began at U. Numbers were scarce and Dermot would always feature on the teams above his age. Getting enough players to field a team was often the challenge, with hammerings often at the end of the struggle against clubs picking from a wider base. As St Pius, he flourished under Brian McIver and Brendan Convery, who had a lasting impression on Heaney and their All-Ireland winning teams. As a second year, Dermot was a sub for the  All-Ireland U win, before graduating to their winning team two years later. On that side was future Tyrone defender Fay Devlin, as well as Gary Coleman, Jarlath Martin and John Mulholland, a trio that would play a part in his early glory days with Derry. At that time, St Pius were always able to beat St Patricks Maghera in challenge games, the same group that went on to win the Hogan Cup, including Eamonn Burns and Anthony Tohill. Derrys pieces were coming together. *** Heaney made his county minor debut at corner-forward in , a five-point defeat to All-Ireland champions Down at Ballinascreen, but was among seven of the team eligible for the following season. While Maghera were marching to a first Hogan title, the rest of John Joe Kearneys minor team soldiered through the league, without winning a game. A narrow defeat to Cavan in Cootehill saw Derry score four goals, two each for Heaney and Declan Bateson who was making his debut. By the time the first round of the championship came around, Fermanagh were favourites, and Derry were pushed to the pin of their collar. They narrowly came out of Irvinestown and into a semi-final with Cavan, which transpired into a make or break afternoon with Derry staring into a nine-point deficit. “That was complacency,” Heaney reckons. Running the Breffni men close in the league, with virtually half a team was a  reading. “We thought wed beat them easy in the championship. They played us off the park that day, only for Eunancoming on and turning the game. “The St Pats boys were not around the  long and it takes a while to get used to it. In the final, we hammered Armagh, I remember Neil Lennon playing for them.” It took Derry into an All-Ireland semi-final with Roscommon, a game Heaney remembers for the cauldron of noise. It was his first game in Croke Park. Roscommon hit an early goal, but in the next move a ball was tossed into the box, one full-forward Heaney wasnt favoured to win, but he did, earning a free for Burns to tap over. Derry were settled and Heaney won another ball for a Burns score and slammed in a goal after half time to kill the game. Before the final whistle, he had a hand two of Derrys further three goals. In the final, it was like Cootehill all over again. He set up Bateson for Derrys first goal and had the favour ed with ten minutes to go with Heaneys goal clinching the All-Ireland. But it was only the beginning. *** Heaneys graduation from the minor ranks, coincided with Castledawsons consistent form at senior level. Two years earlier, in , they trailed Dungiven by two points. Manager Tom OKane threw teenager Heaney into the Dean McGlinchey Park cauldron for his debut. His youthful exuberance and ball-winning ability almost did the trick. A ball was flicked in his direction and he was away on goal. “The defender got his fingertips to it,” Heaney jokes. “Whether I wouldve scored it was another matter, but we couldve been county champions.”  Dermot Heaney nips in ahead of Swatragh goalkeeper Brian Oacuteg McAtamney in a Derry SFC clash Newbridge and Ballinderry were thrown out of the championship after a brawl in the other semi-final. The Dawson were back in the final in , losing to neighbours Newbridge who were pipped by Lavey the previous year. “We were going well until Newbridge got the man sent off,” Heaney states. “Damian Barton moved back to centre half back to control the game and Liam Devlin got three goals. We were the better team, up until they went down to  men.” Castledawson were back in the final in , this time going down to a Dungiven side that would conquer Ulster. They lost star forward Stephen McLarnon early in the game with an injury he was nursing all week. “He was a huge loss and we lost our way after that,” Heaney remembers. It ended an eight-year period during which the Dawson knocked out of the championship by eventual winners. “Im not saying wed have won it, but we had a good bunch of players at that time,” he admits. The elusive senior championship medal came in , at intermediate level. After going into semi-retirement, Heaney wanted to stay on and play for the reserves. A slice of action here and there at full-forward, to help the young players bed in. Before long, his footballing brain was head and shoulders above reserve level. Its hard to dull the brightest diamond. Soon it was a starting role at midfield, before the senior management came calling for an impact when games were in the fire. Going down the final stretch of the county final, they trailed Steelstown narrowly and in came Heaney from the bench. His reputation and size brought a cocktail of fear and respect which saw him triple marked. It allowed Paddy Henry and Niall McNicholl enough latitude to eke the scores to win the game narrowly. “I never touched the ball,” Dermot jokes. The Dawson finished their unbeaten season, by winning two rounds of promotion play-offs before bowing out in Ulster to Rasharkin, a game they felt got away. Heaneys race was run. And a fruitful one it was. *** Fresh from the  All-Ireland minor win, came the call from Tommy Diamond to join the senior , but he felt hed leave it until after Christmas. By that stage, Diamond and Derry went their separate ways and in came Mickey Moran. Heaney made his debut in a league clash in Drumsurn. Heaney felt he did okay, but Down visitors ran out winners. When the  was named in The Irish News the following week, Heaneys name didnt appear. “Thats the way it was back then,” Heaney remembers. “ It was before the days of text messages and messaging. Mickey asked me why I didnt attend, insisting my name shouldve been on the list.” When the  season rolled around, Eamonn Coleman was appointed manager. And with the fusing of a series of successful youth and school teams, boosted by Laveys All-Ireland success, the pieces of the puzzle were coming together. But Derry lost to Down in a semi-final replay. “We wouldnt have won the All-Ireland that year, absolutely no chance. I think you have to suffer hurt to realise what it means, I know that sounds silly,” Heaney said, while also feeling they werent ready. “Ulster teams werent winning All-Irelands at that time, but Down showed the way again. They had that arrogance about them, the further they go in a tournament the better they get.” The following year, , Derry won the first of four league titles. A week after beating Tyrone in the league decider, Heaney hammered in an early goal to sink Tyrone. After blowing a lead in Castleblayney, it took a Bateson goal to help Derry stem Monaghans late tidal wave and Derry saw them off in a replay. Dermot in action for Derry against Antrim in the  Ulster SFC  It set up a blockbuster with Down in a sweltering Casement Park, packed to the gills for the meeting of league and All-Ireland champions. “It was a cracking game,” Heaney states. “Thats what you miss about knock-out football...it meant something.” Derry fell to Donegal in the final, a defeat Heaney didnt see coming at all. “I dont think we were complacent,” he states. “I went out and had no energy, so I probably was nervous. This was the first big occasion. I was playing midfield and had a poor game, a lot of the Derry players had a poor game that day. We got a goal against the run of play to bring us back into the game and still couldnt beat them.” The following year was payback. Dermot Heaneys thoughts were in tandem with every other member of the squad who has recalled the  Ulster final, played in a Clones monsoon. Nothing was going to stop Derry. Nothing. “Back in those times – like beating Down in  - we were rarely beaten by the same team two years in a row,” he said. “Donegal go on about the conditions in  andit had been a dry day... we had played them on an airstrip or in a swimming pool, there was just no way we were losing that game.” After that, Coleman turned up the man-management another notch, installing a new level of belief. It fed into the sight of Paddy ORourke and Anthony Molloy lting Sam. Now, it was Derrys time. But Heaney recalls the moment he told Coleman hed be missing training on the Friday after beating Dublin to attend a U concert in Dublin. Back then, nobody missed training. Starting players, lists. Nobody. Coleman – and the rest of the players – wouldnt stand for it. “I remember the night I told Eamonn I was going to the concert and it wasnt aswe were staying the weekend. I was going to be back for the Sunday session,” Heaney explains. He remembers the response to this very day. “Well,you are not starting in the final, dont be blaming me...thats the exact words he said to me. You just didnt miss.” Heaney bopped to the vibes of U and started the final, where he turned in a towering performance. Like the minor semi-final with Roscommon four years earlier, he dug in when Cork were hammering into Derry early on. When Derry dug themselves back from John ODriscolls goal, it was his trademark catch at full-forward that made Enda Gormleys equaliser and it was fitting than when referee Tommy Howard blew the final whistle, Gormleys fist-pass had the ball in Heaneys hands. The endless hours of thudding the ball at the gable wall, his fathers honest feedback and his uncle Eamon forcing him to use both feet had paid off in style. “I have been exceptionally lucky to have come on the scene at a good time – for school, club and county,” he modestly sums up. Iconic commentatorMiacutecheaacutel Oacute Muircheartaighs assessment went much deeper. “Henry Downey’s second half display at centre back was crucial,” he said. “But I would rate Dermot Heaney’s  minutes of hard endeavour as the greatest single reason in making Sunday, September ,  Derry’s day of days,” he belted across the airwaves. Eamonn Burns, who played against him at school and club level, but soldiered with him for Derry rates Heaney as second to Anthony Tohill of the best players he played with. Midfield. Full-forward. He was a master of both, but when Derry were going to Croke Park in  the team got shuffled up. Burns remembers the gasps among the squad in the changing room of St Patricks Maghera at a training session before the semi-final with Dublin when Heaney was listed at number . The first time he ever played there. “But, he took to it like a duck to water,” Burns states. When asked about the All-Irelands that got away, Heaney mentions . He laments the  semi-final with Galway, surrendering control before being hit by Matthew Clancys sucker punch. In , they were beaten comprehensively by Galway, one of their own doing. A week after beating Donegal, Derry played a challenge game before taking in the Tribesmens replay extra-time win over Roscommon in Hyde Park. “It was an awful game of football. We came out of the game laughing and it was the worst thing we ever did, we left thinking about who we were playing in the final,” he remembers. “As Donegal found outyou cant do that.” In all, he is happy with his lot. The backdoor couldve helped him pick up a second All-Ireland, though it couldve seen Down or Donegal come back to pip later in the  season. The medals rest in a cabinet and the jersies are packed in a bag in the attic. Memories of a letime. “You think back then, that it is going to happen again and we didnt make the most of it,” he sums up. “It was an unreal time to be involved, that friendship doesnt go away. Youd always bump into the boys and chat about those special days.” Derry are coming with a batch of young players, hoping to mould together a team to climb the football pecking order. They will need a player like Dermot Heaney. Every successful team does. Someone who is underrated by everyone but those in the trenches with him. Aside from the medals, thats the big Castledawson mans greatest legacy. All with a smile on his face.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Ballinascreens Aine McAllister played both camogie and football for Derry this season. She tells Michael McMullan about her love and passion for playing both codes. *** With a day of teaching in Eglintons Broadbridge Primary School done and dusted, Aine McAllisters mind is still racing. Her voice remains charged with energy. A passion for sport hugs every dancing word. Its much like her all-action playing career. She empties the tank every time she pulls on the jersey. The colour is irrelevant. Red or maroon. It doesnt matter. Since the early U days with Ballinascreen, football and camogie have been a constant. Her parents Mickey and Maria supported every move and ferried their sons and daughters around the corners of Derry. googletag.cmd.push Now , nothing has changed for Aine in her eighth season on the Derry senior squad. In the months after Derrys  All-Ireland intermediate title, the county held their annual presentation. As part of the minor squad, Aine was there in the Wild Duck that night to bring down the curtain on the season. It was then senior manager John A Mullan who asked her about stepping up to senior level. The following year, aged , she joined the squad under Joe Baldwin and vividly remembers her first training session. Slamming sliotars against the wall of Magherafelts Meadowbank complex, they honed their striking action, reflexes and handling. A whos who of McAllisters idols. googletag.cmd.push She always dreamt of playing for Derry and here she was rubbing shoulders with the likes of Katie McAuley, Grainne and Meabh McGoldrick. It was far from daunting. Eiliacutes Niacute Chaiside was there too, a fourth year at St Marys Belfast when McAllister came in as a Fresher. They played on the team that reached the Fr Maher Final, a competition Aine would win with The Ranch in her final year. “That helped break the ice and I knew the faces from Ballinascreen. Bronagh McGillian wouldve been involved that year,” McAllister remembers of that first training session. “They were great,” she said of how the younger players were treated. “Katie McAuley wouldve scared the bejesus out of me for club camogie, but they were all very welcoming. They wanted girls no matter what club you were from, which was great.”     Of Derrys  Ulster championships, Aine has four winners medals and scored two points in the  decider at Swatragh, during current manager Ciaran Cunninghams last stint in the Oakleaf hotseat. In football, she reluctantly joined the county squad in recent seasons. It wasnt that she didnt want play football. “I wouldnt have wanted to have came in at that point, not having trained all year,” Aine said of Paul Croziers invite to come on board. “It wasnt possible, training on the same nights and there was a lot on top of each other. I didnt want to be at camogie and not fully committed to camogie...it was the same for football.” An all or nothing person, with half measures not sitting well. Crozier and some of the football squad, who were soon on the phone, assured Aine she was welcome. “They knew I was flat out trainingand not lying at home doing nothing,” she points out. Aine did join the  and this year the schedule had a dferent pattern. With Covid- forcing a split season format, her involvement with Ballinascreen was complete by the time the county scene rolled around and Aine was able to throw her lot into both camps. “We always played both,” she said of her career. “Butyoud asked me when I was younger, Id have said camogie was my first sport. As Ive grown up, they have just gone alongside each other.” There was always ladies football in Ballinascreen, so it just went hand and hand , demanding constant communication between the camps. Already, camogie manager Reamann Tam Kennedy and his football counterpart Conor McGarvey have touched base. With the experiences of last year consigned to history, they have picked through the rubble to plot a better path to take. “Tam was on the phone the day after the Slaughtneil game,” she reveals. “Telling me how we were going to improve for next year...he never switches off.” Growing up, it was a constant wrestle between Screen and Swatragh for honours. Aine, with the benefit of a good birthday, availed of a fruitful extra year, with U, U and minor glory coming her way. “In my school year, Swatragh were always a step ahead of us,” Aine remembers. “I was lucky enough to be part of the when we won the  All-Ireland Feacuteile in Kilkenny. Two years later we got down to Galway, but we didnt win it.” At St Marys Magherafelt, her teams were in the shadows of Cross and Passion, Ballycastle and rivals St Patricks Maghera. She decided to repeat her Upper Sixth year to get the grades for her teaching degree. “I refused to leave,” she can now joke. She needed a medal before calling time on her Convent days and they stopped the Maghera dominance to land the  title. “Out of all the medals, thats one of the best ones because of the long slog of school camogie and to finally get over the line was just great,” beams McAllister, placing much of the credit at her coach Reamann Kennedys door. “He did tactics and St Pats didnt have a clue what was going on and by the time they did, we were in the lead and it worked to our advantage.” *** What a dference a year makes in sport  Twelve months after watching Steelstown celebrate the  ladies title through their own tears of devastation, it was Ballinascreens turn to shine. The years of playing both codes would eventually pay idends. Again it was Steelstown in the final, but it took every sinew to pull Screen into dreamland. Louise Murphy grabbed two goals, with Casey McKenna bagging a third in a - to - win. They still needed goalkeeping heroics of Kathryn Conneryin a player of the final performance. It sparked pandemonium in the celebrations, as history was made with a first title. Lauren McKennas movement for Connerys kick-outs was another factor. So too was Aine McAllisters input at midfield, it a team that included her sisters Rachel and Sarah. Ballinascreen celebrate winning the  senior ladies championship, a first in their history  They retained their title last season, with victory over Ballymaguigan in a Sunday night monsoon at Owenbeg. It was Aines second game of the weekend, having played with Derry camogs  hours earlier. Having the football moved allowed her to play for both teams. Last month, she did the same – playing for Derry camogs and footballers in the same weekend. The refreshing thing was how much energy she was able to expend going down the final stretch of the second game. For McAllister, the split season had a huge impact on not only her own availability, but the rest of the county players. In the case of camogie, Ciaran Cunningham was able to boast a more competitive squad. “We didnt have the pressure of club football and camogie.” Aine states. The county titles were long dished out. “County is great and I really enjoy it, but I am sure there are people who say their club comes first. The one thing that sometimes bothered me, was that when you were playing county you were missing out on club training sessions, which was always the way it was going to be.” McAllister and Megan Kerr are Derry camogs representative on the WGPA. They recently circulated a survey to the rest of the , one that will be collated across all  counties in both bodes. Figuring prominently was the questions over keeping the split season. Speaking with both passion and reason in equal measure, Aine feels keeping the club and county seasons apart is the way forward. Everyone is a winner. “There are occasions that girls have turned down playing for Derry camogie, because they have a lot of pressure on from their club management, not wanting them to miss club training,” Aine points out. “Some girls are put into the situation where they cant win. Its not fair,you are playing for a club you should have the opportunity to represent Derry. “Its a pitygirls are not coming outit a case of support from clubs not being there...they would make a dference to Derry.” The split season or not, McAllisters schedule remained a busy one, training virtually every night of the week with at least one game at the weekend. It is something she accepts, butthere is a bit of give and take between both management teams, it can work. “It is about good communication between managers, and players being honest and taking the rest, they need to have their own responsibility for their own performance,” she adds. One group of people she feels need all the credit in the world are the fixture committees. “I dont know how they manage it,” she said. “When it comes to the championship, they do the best they can, but there is a big overlap with ladies football and camogie, Im sure it is the same for hurling and football. “I know Teresa McKenna has done so much for Derry football, with some of the fixtures that have been clashing.” But, in the long run, Aine feels the club championship season needs to be looked at. Ballinascreens entire football team are dual players. It prevents them from perfecting any last-minute preparation. A challenge game to work on tactics, or a few nights off to keep the limbs fresh. Aine in football action for Derry  “You have to give them credit in Slaughtneil for how well their camogie team have dominated not only Derry camogie, but across Ireland. “I can imagine their preparations and being down southand all the stuff Id love to do, but being dual it just doesnt work. It is not possible and girls have been burned out and that has been the case for some of the girls by the championship and they look more unfit.” That said, she wouldnt change being a dual player for the world, with the more positives than negatives. *** After their defeat to Meath in the All-Ireland series, Ciaran Cunningham praised the efforts of his team. Aine McAllister has a similar train of thought, having held all the aces for much of the first half. In recent seasons, Derry have more than held their own with Tipperary, Kilkenny and Cork, backing it up with four Ulster titles since . Former manager John ODwyer said the same. On their day, Derry can beat anybody. “If you are to go, player by player, when we come up against Down - I wouldnt swap anyone,” Aine admits. “Its like Slaughtneil camogs, they have learned how to work together as a unit. That is something we are missing. “Its not that girls wont pass to anyone, thats not it. I think we are just missing that link up, thats the dference between us and the so called stronger teams.” Down have had the core of their team playing together four or five years and they know each other inside out. Clonduff had been another shining light at club level. “But they really do live and breath for county camogie,” Aine adds.” “In Derry camogie, we have missing girls who are not out representing their county. It is as simple as that, some girls dont have the same interest as others. Its a pity, as the talent is there. Slaughtneil wouldnt have got as far as they have without their obvious talent.” The gap is closing in the Derry scene. Swatragh won the league in recent times and took the Emmets to a replay this year. Lavey pushed Swatragh all the way. And Ballinascreen, like Swatragh, have threatened to topple Slaughtneil. When it comes to the Derry squad, the same drive just hasnt been there. “We have struggled for numbers in Derry camogie and that shouldnt be the case...there is the pick of four or five girls in each club,” Aine stresses. There are the excuses of not committing due to club, but it doesnt wash with Aine. If the fixtures fit, it can work. “You can manage it,you want to play,” she added. The  season has proved it. “At the start of the year, I was the only Screen girl representing Derry in camogie, which is ridiculous when you see how close we are in the championship. “They all came out and these are girls were starting on the team...they realised how much they can get out of Derry camogie and how much they enjoyed it. “Then there are is Swatragh, Lavey and Slaughtneil,you look at Ceacuteat McEldowney, she such an asset to Derry camogie.” What she wouldnt do for having the full  to pick from, chomping at the bit to push for a start. ”Its a pity, its the only word I can say,” Aine continues. “When I was growing up all I wanted to do was to play for the Derry camogie team and better myself. I dont think there is any other way than going to the county, you are playing against better opposition and with better girls around you.” She longs for the day, when there are enough girls putting themselves forward that it requires trials. With players pushing to even make the . “If everybody would buy in, the damage wed do in intermediate camogie, never mind senior. When I started we competed at senior level. “Losing Katie, the McGoldricks, Aileen McCusker, who are massive misses but there are young girls out there who should be making up for some of the players, but are not coming on board, but hopefully that changes.” One thing wont change, Aine McAllisters love for sport. She knows nothing .  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

And the Taoiseach’s recently announced Shared Island Unit and commitment of half a billion euros over the next five years is a chance to attract crucial investment into the North West and address infrastructure deficits. “I am excited to get to grips with my new role and I will be working extremely hard over the next year to help make sure that local businesses succeed in a successful North West.” Outgoing President Redmond McFadden said that despite the challenges that  has presented, the past  months have been both a professional and personal honour. In my role as President this year, I have worked hard to fight the corner of the North West and on behalf of our fantastic business community. “I’ve seen first-hand this year the talent, compassion, and adaptability of our local business leaders as they faced the most dficult challenges of their professional lives and made the most dficult decisions they are ever likely to make. “It’s important to also acknowledge the successes and high points of this year including the long-awaited sign off of the Graduate Entry Medical School and the commitment from the Executive of match funding for the City Deal. “I would like to again thank the members for their faith in me this year and thank the entire team at Chamber for their support. I wish Dawn and Aidan the best of luck for  and I am certain that they will represent our region with strong, committed, and dynamic leadership.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It was very popular from the kick-off because there was nothing  in the area. It was warm and had a canteen. Many young people hung around there chatting and for some of the male teenagers there was two snooker tables, and that was about it. A garage storeroom at the rear of the building was used to house one of the three caretakers cars and he and his buddy worked on it and others, like it was their own garage. googletag.cmd.push On a visit to see my brother, the manager, I had a look around and the idea of a youth drop-in centre with an Irish flavour began to take shape in my head. All I needed was a room and the garage looked perfect. I went to Tony Carlin’s paintshop in William Street and he donated tins of paint and ‘rubber’ yellow paint to cover the floor. When a few youth stuck their heads into the garage, they began to get interested in me painting the whole floor a bright yellow. One young man, Martin Rooney, was the first to volunteer and he and I finished the floor. googletag.cmd.push I asked to talk to one of the graffiti painters, Jim Collinsand he took charge of the garage walls and covered them with lots of celtic mots, Irish words, and images by Louis le Brocquy from Thomas Kinsella’s translation of the The Tain. I built a thatched cottage in the garage, now called An Ceardlann the workshop. Various cultural things were rolled out. I had a small collection of Irish traditional instruments, tin whistles, fiddle, starter uileann pipes and bodhraacuten and left them lying about for the young people to handle and try their hand at. Beginners’ Irish classes and old Irish script calligraphy workshops were organised.     The place was usually jammed. And the youth, boys and girls, soon laid claim to it. That carried on in that vein for a year and then I made contact with the Arts Council and successfully applied for grants to set up a darkroom, screen printing, woodwork carving tools. Next a colour darkroom was added. Then I set up a drama club, kicking off with the Mummers which toured the pubs and attracted youth from outside the area. More cameras were provided and ious local artists put on workshops, like weaving, week long drama workshops, painting. The plays took off and large performances took place in the great hall of the centre with hundreds attending. Towards the end of the eighties, we were still impressing the Arts Council people who agreed to provide equipment for our plans for a much need extension, which Derry City Council and the Western Education and Library Board finally gave me in the face of a runaway success story. The Arts Council paid for a pottery workshop, new extended darkrooms with great enlargers and cameras, an art gallery and framing equipment in the new extension, now called Eden Place Arts Centre. And as a nod to our dramatic achievement bought us stage lights, a stage and  chairs. In , I moved to Donegal and handed the baton over to Madeleine Callaghan. Now my cousin’s daughter, Judi Logue, is in charge. These two women were legends and Judi has been the longest-serving coordinator we’ve had.    Judi Logue takes up the story I became Co-ordinator ofEdenPlaceArts Centre in , knowing that I had big boots to fill. Madeline Callaghan had been running the centre for some time and was an amazing woman. She was a very talented photographer with an artistic eye like no other, she also had a great way with people. Looking back over nearly two decades I feel very privileged to have been part of facilitating the erse range of arts and artists that have been through the doors ofEdenPlaceArts Centre. We have worked with womens groups, community groups, human rights groups, schools, youth clubs, groups of children and adults with additional needs, LGBT groups, really every group you can think of and each group experience has been very special. We have exhibited art work by local artists, artists from around the country and International artists. We have run courses in many erse art forms for the community. Throughout all those years this one has to be the strangest. We have gone from the lively wee buzz out the back of Pilots Row to online classes, events and exhibitions. These are all going very well but we hope to be back in situ in . EdenPlaceArts Centre is a hub of activity, friendships are made and art is created in a relaxed and welcoming environment. We are very thankful to the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, EA and DCSDC for their support throughout the years, to the Voluntary Management Committee who do so much work in the background that most people do not see, to the amazing facilitators who have been so loyal to EPAC over the years and who always go above and beyond to help the participants on our courses. I would like to pay special tribute to Brian McMenamin who passed away earlier this year and who had always been a great supporter of the centre. And to Kevin Logue for having the vision, for without that visionEdenPlaceArts Centre may never have happened and all the art that flowed from it may never have had an outlet. HopefullyEdenPlaceArts Centre will be making people happy for many, many years to come.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It was a bit surreal,no doubt.Down went into the game with the pain of a one-point semi-final defeat to Westmeath last term still very much in their minds.That was a heart-breaking reversal for the Mourne girls, but one that they were able to use to fuel their bid for glory this time around.Caitriona said that despite the stadium being bereft of fans the players knew there were so many cheering them on from afar.ldquoThe early goal at the start of the game really helped to settle us down, she said. ldquoIn those stages I was thinking of my mummy and the nerves she would be feeling watching us. But as a team, we needed to get switched on early, get those nervy jitters out of our system quickly, because we knew the challenge that Antrim would pose to us.ldquoEverything went great from early on in the game for us. The communication was good, the flow of the moves worked, and on the day thankfully it all clicked.She also told of how in the days leading up to the final the players spoken about the heartbreak of having come so close in the past. That was something that they knew they could not allow to happen again.ldquoWe did talk about the defeats and the funny thing is, in a way those defeats can actually work to spur you on a bit more, she revealed.ldquoIt played a big part for us psychologically for last weekend, especially for the older players on our . The older you get, you donrsquot know how much more often the chances will come around I suppose. For girls like Catherine McGourty and Fionnuala Carr, they have been there for such a long time, since I was a wee girl really.ldquoThe satisfaction that they must feel, having been there for thatof time, is probably a dferent type of satisfaction to what the younger players must be experiencing now in the wake of what we have done.ldquoAll of this has been a long time coming, but the progress of Down camogie for a while has been brilliant. The numbers participating are going up all the time, there is a great junior structure.ldquoEveryone who was in our team at the weekend, has bettered themselves as players and gone from strength to strength. The bond that has developed with us as team mates has been unbelievable.All of the Down camogie camp are also acutely aware of the wider positive impact their success has had on people within their own communities. With many people feeling the implications of the restrictions placed on le by coronavirus, it has been a dark time for many. Caitriona said she and her fellow All-Ireland winners feel very lucky.ldquoWe have been in a fortunate position. When I think back I suppose only a matter of weeks, none of us were really surewe would get much,any, camogie action for the remainder of the year.ldquoTo go from that, to being All-Ireland champions, it really is just dficult to put it into words what that means.ldquoCastlewellan has been brilliant in supporting us all the way too. I have had so many messages, both wishing me luck before the final and congratulations since. It shows how much our success has meant to the community.She added: ldquoThis year, of all years, we were lucky the championship even went ahead. To go from that position, to be sitting here now talking to people as an All-Ireland champion, well it just doesnrsquot get much better to be honest with you..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th December 2020 A team.jpg","title":"A team effort%2C says Niamh  ","story":"DOWNrsquoS Niamh Mallon has paid tribute to everyone in the successful camogie camp after they were crowned All-Ireland champions.Derek Dunnersquos side swept aside the challenge of Antrim in Saturdayrsquos showpiece in Cavan to clinch the Intermediate title for the first time since .The Portaferry player said the win had been a long time in coming with the final win secured by a group of players who have been together for almost a decade.ldquoWe have been on the road and this journey together for a long time, said Niamh. ldquoI suppose it hurt in the past couple of years how we came so close, but just couldnrsquot quite get the title. But after that hurt, I suppose the big thing now is relief.The win was the crowning of an unforgettable journey for Down camogs, led by their manager and Laois native Dunne, with Niamh explaining that it has been a year they will never forget.ldquoItrsquos a big win for all of us as iniduals but it was all about doing it for Down, said Niamh, playing down the crucial role she played in scoring two girls to propel her side to the coveted title.ldquoFor the two goals I was in the right place at the right time, she said. ldquoWe worked all week on how we would be able to get on top of Antrim. We knew they were young and a bit inexperienced, but a seriously talented team.ldquoWe knew we could not afford to let them into their stride but, I suppose, in that first half we were guilty of letting them do that a little bit. At half-time, it was about getting in, regrouping and we really drove home the game-plan and swamped the middle third of the pitch.Niamh said she and her team-mates were convinced that once they were able to open up a gap it could prove too much for the fledgling Antrim side to overcome.ldquoThat is what we hoped, she continued. ldquoIn many ways, we have been hurt by our results at this stage in the past, but it also does make you stronger and the experience we gained from the past undoubtedly was a help going into this final.ldquoThat was something we knew we had over Antrim and had to use to our advantage. We knew once we got that little edge on them on the scoreboard, we were on our way to the win.With the title secured, the Down camp can look forward to some well-earned rest and reflection over the Christmas period with Niamh admitting for a iety of reasons that it will be a year that will be impossible to forget.ldquoWithout any doubt it has been a mad year but,you know the Down camogie set-up, yoursquoll know we never do anything by half. Winning in  in a pandemic is just like us. Itrsquos great to get over the line with the win and great to get our hands on the title. We will enjoy this one for sure, she said.Having joined the squad as a gted -year-old in , Niamh has endured junior final reverses disappointment in  and  along with a number of her teammates, admitting that after knocking on the door it was terric to finally lt the title.She continued: ldquoWe won the junior title in  and a lot of girls then stepped away. We regrouped then in  and  and changed our approach this year. We didnrsquot look at the bigger picture and took it game by game. Obviously with the restructure after the pandemic you had to adapt and go again and we did and wersquore just delighted.Niamhrsquos scars of battle are very evident with a cut on the nose but the Portaferry sharpshooter is understandably unconcerned. She has spent more time in deeper roles this year, making her harder to pick up when drting inside to often stunning effect.This was evidenced on Saturday with - of her tally of - from play arriving within six minutes of Maeve Kellyrsquos magnicent th minute goal that gave Antrim the lead. That speaks of a big-game player, but Mallon reiterates her managerrsquos assertion that this a truly collective achievement.Modestly, Niamh doesnrsquot mention herself in her checklist of those the team used to lean too heavily upon, acknowledging the privilege of being allowed to congregate and socialise as elite sportspeople in the midst of COVID- when many are confined to their quarters.Niamh added: ldquoDown is no longer reliant on Sara-Louise Carr [Graffin], Fionnuala Carr and Karen McMullan ndash itrsquos an overall effort from  to  with the title win coming straight from the training ground.ldquoItrsquos been massively enjoyable and I have been based from home since the pandemic struck. From a camogie playing perspective itrsquos been great. Irsquove just been around home and able to train.ldquoWe havenrsquot taken for granted the situation we found ourselves in. We have been massively privileged as a lot of people have not had the opportunity to socialise like we did over the past couple of months.

Mr Bidenrsquos links with the area are very recent and local.Cllr Brown said Mr Bidenrsquos great, great grandfather Patrick Blewett left Mayo in  to become a sailor in the USA, settling in Scrampton, Pennsylvania, while his great grandfather, James Finnegan, arrived in New York in the late s after travelling from Warrenpoint.He added: ldquoWhile Mr Biden visited Ireland as recently as , there is every reason why Ireland and the UK would be top of his travel list when circumstances allow. Mr Biden has unwavering support for the peace process, given the instrumental role his party played in bringing it together.ldquoWhat better place for the incoming president to visit than our district to trace his ancestral routes in Louth, visit the port his family emigrated from and see the resting place of St Patrick in Downpatrick.SDLP councillor Gary Stokes said the man who will become the th US president ldquoclearlyvalues his Irish heritage and believes thatthe local authority works alongside Louth County Council, there is a better chance of him visiting the Newry, Mourne and Down area.The DUPrsquos Glyn Hanna suggested that the incoming president had made himself a ldquoisive character with his ill-advised remarks about Orange and Green.He also argued that a man who has spent  years in politics was either badly briefed or totally ignorant of the situation in Northern Ireland, given his remarks which he should apologise for.Cllr Hanna added: ldquoMr Biden should stop looking through his Irish American tinted glasses and see the reality of the situation that there will not be a united Ireland without the consent of the people of Northern Ireland. I would suggest that he is reminded of this.UUP councillor David Taylor said the motion ldquotook the local authority into US politics which it had never done before, arguing that itrsquo was not a unorm view that everyone welcomed Bidenrsquos victory.ldquoThe incoming president and his vice-president are more than welcome in Northern Ireland at any time. The leader of the free world should be more than welcome to come here which could be beneficial from an investment point of view, he said.ldquoWe acknowledge Mr Bidenrsquos ancestral links to the area and it is not the case that we donrsquot welcome any US president.Sinn Feinrsquos Declan Murphy said that while he understood where his unionist colleagues were coming from, he did not necessarily agree with them.He said he was not supporting the motion for sentimental reasons, explaining it is primarily an opportunity for the island of Ireland to access the White House and to provide more leverage, as it has done in the past, when it comes to dealing with some dficult issues including legacy which politicians here have found it dficult to sort out.Cllr Murphy said he believes that Mr Bidenrsquos election provided ldquogreat opportunities for investment, particularly given the uncertain times ahead as a result of Brexit, adding: We are going to need all the support we can possibly get..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th December 2020 Boost.jpg","title":"Boost for Dunleath development plans  ","story":"AMBITIOUS plans to redevelop Dunleath Park in Downpatrick as a centre of sporting excellence have taken a step forward.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council committee is to examine the proposal and is being encouraged to establish a project board to take the development further and unlock the facilityrsquos full potential.At Monday nightrsquos monthly meeting of the local authority, a proposal calling for the revitalisation of the huge sports facility was referred to the councilrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee for further debate and analysis.Politicians are being asked to establish a development plan that will include cycling and walking trails, the provision of new sensory gardens and upgrading existing sports pitches.The suggested project board mdash comprising council officials and Downpatrick area councillors mdash is expected to focus on all options, including the potential for a new G pitch and so-called bubble facility to allow outdoor tennis to continue in all weathers.Dunleath Park has been at the heart of local sport for many decades catering for soccer, gaelic football and hockey, but little cash has been spent on it, apart from annual maintenance costs.This week, three local politicians have called for the park, which is adjacent to Downpatrickrsquos poundm ultra-modern leisure centre, to be developed as a centre of sporting excellence, insisting that the work is regarded as a priority.Cllrs John Trainor, Gareth Sharvin and Dermot Curran say they recognise Dunleathrsquos potential has been lying untapped for too long, with the trio delighted that the future of the facility has now been formally included on the local authorityrsquos agenda.On Monday night, Cllr Trainor said he was delighted that the proposal for a project board to progress the development of Dunleath Park for sporting excellence, health and wellbeing and recreation was to be discussed by the Active and Healthy Communities Committee.ldquoThis is an essential next step in the development of Dunleath and Gareth, Dermot and I are incredibly proud to lead from the front here. Dunleath Park offers much potential which must be realised, he added.Cllr Sharvin said that given that the council had committed to the proposed development being included on its agenda, it was vital that a project board was appointed to focus on the development and identy key projects for Dunleath.He said local councillors appreciated the potential redevelopment of Dunleath Park has for Downpatrick and the importance of the site for sport in the area, particularly for the Downpatrick Youth Football League and several senior clubs who use the pitches.ldquoThere can be no question that this project board must be led by Downpatrick councillors, insisted Cllr Sharvin.ldquoWe were elected by the people of this area to represent them on council and that is exactly what we have been doing and will continue to do through this board.Cllr Curran cautioned that plans to redevelop Dunleath Park would not happen overnight as there were a number of obstacles that need to overcome.ldquoWe recognise the need for flood assessment for this location but are confident that there are local wins for the community to be had in the short term, he continued.ldquoThere is no reason why we could not develop a walking and cycling path around Dunleath while plans for the larger development continue. Therefore, we will now be writing to Communities Minister Caraacutel Niacute Chuiliacuten MLA to propose this and request funding.Cllr Curran said the Downpatrick councillors looked forward to updating ratepayers about the progress of their proposal, explaining this was why they would like a working group set up as soon as possible..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th December 2020 Centres.jpg","title":"Centres could help rollout  ","story":"LOCAL leisure centres could potentially play key roles in the rollout of the Covid- vaccine across the district.Health chiefs are drawing up plans for a huge logistical operation to vaccinate people with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.It is understood that a number of vaccination centres have been earmarked to help with the rollout of the vaccination programmes, including leisure centres and hospitals.It was revealed at Monday nightrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council that senior officials are liaising with health administrators in relation to the vaccination programme.Council chief executive Marie Ward said the organisation is ready to assist the South Eastern and Southern health trusts with a vaccination programmerequired.She also confirmed that the local authority is continuing to liaise with the Public Health Agency in relation to providing coronavirus testing facilities.Rowallane councillor Terry Andrews said that given the huge amount of work required to vaccinate people, the local authority had a number of venues, including leisure centres, which could play key roles in the operation.ldquoI would be very much in favour of council buildings being used to aid the rollout programme. In addition, I would be keen to see the Covid- testing programme expanded across the district.Cllr Andrews said while a long journey lay ahead in terms of testing people and ramping up the vaccination programme, the arrival of the vaccine was good news.Even so he encouraged people to continue to socially distance, wear a mask and adhere to public health advice.With the latest two-week lockdown due to end at midnight tomorrow, health officials have suggested that the number of new infections will decline and potentially remain stable before Christmas.Council chairwoman Laura Devlin said Covid- remained at large across the community and urged people to continue to exercise caution and follow public health advice.With businesses due to reopen this Friday, she is encouraging people to shop local and support local traders, but to do so safely.ldquoWe know that there will be further relaxations around Christmas in terms of ious regulations and while we are asking people to enjoy the festive season, we want them to do safely, while adhering to the public health message, said the council chairwoman.ldquoThere is positive news of the vaccine but it is going to be some months before it is administered across a wide area, so for the sake of a few extra months, I appeal to people to please exercise that extra caution that is very much needed at this time..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th December 2020 Chef.jpg","title":"Chef Alex cooks up Christmas treats  ","story":"DUNDRUM chef Alex Greene has emerged cream of the crop as he competes in the Great British Christmas Menu competition.The  year-old mdash who is the head chef of Deanersquos EIPIC restaurant in Belfast mdash will be seen in action on BBC  tonight as he cooks against past winners of the show.Alex has already got a stunning canape and starter through to a banquet to honour NHS frontline staff and other key workers for their dedication throughout the pandemic.While he got two dishes through to this yearrsquos Great British Menu banquet to mark  years of childrenrsquos literature, he was disappointed not to have be crowned Champion of Champions at the banquet.However, his already successful appearance in the current show has helped him come to terms with it.Alex told the Recorder that he will be appearing in every episode of the show which ends on Christmas Eve.ldquoI canrsquot say what  has happened obviously, but for me itrsquos been massive, even for the fact that it has a chef winner from every show on it, he said.ldquoThe whole thing of getting two courses to the banquet for two years running has never happened before, no other chef has ever done it.Alex said that he has met so many people since May who told him he should have won the Champion of Champions title.ldquoEven Chef Niall Keating, who won the title, has said to me that on three occasions diners at his restaurant who have tried his Great British Menu dishes told him that I should have won, he said.ldquoHe and I are very good friends now and the exciting thing for viewers is that some of the biggest names in food are still to come through the programme.Alex revealed that with the reopening of EIPIC over the summer, he only had just over three weeks to prepare for the competition.ldquoI was working on the showrsquos dishes just a week after opening the restaurant so there was a lot of things to juggle and it was an absolute stressor this year.The chef, who started off his career at the Buckrsquos Head in Dundrum also confirmed he has opened up a new shop, Fish and Farm, in Newcastle.ldquoI am literally not cooking anything, Alex said of the shop. ldquoI just wanted to open something in the town at the minute as I am planning to open something there next year.ldquoItrsquos just a fishmongerrsquos but I wanted to do it as Irsquom passionate about fishing.

She was a key figure in Downrsquos success.The Portaferry ace claimed two goals and three points from play, and was a key figure in Downrsquos success.Down had too much firepower for Antrim, with Sara-Louise Graffin proving a very influential foil to Mallon. The likes of Sorcha McCartan, Lauren Clarke and Aimee McAleenan were selfless in their toil.Further back, Graffinrsquos sister Fionnuala Carr thundered into the fray in the last ten minutes of the first half.The -year-old marked her  years of representing Down at adult level in stirring fashion alongside fellow co-captain Karen McMullan.Former dual star McMullan was in Australia when Down lost the  final. However, she ed after three years away last term, when the Mourne women fell short by a point at the penultimate hurdle to subsequent victors Westmeath.They would not be denied this time around though, despite the shock of conceding a goal after less than  seconds.It took five minutes for Derek Dunnersquos side to regain their composure, but they were in front by the th minute after Mallon, McAleenan, Paula OrsquoHagan and Graffin all raised white flags.Antrimy hit four of the next five scores to establish a two-point advantage that could have been even greater had Catrine Dobbin not just dragged her ground shot wide with Catherine McGourty coming out quickly to narrow the angle.The Down response was notable. Three points came, including a wonderful effort by McCartan. Then, after Nicole OrsquoNeill pointed a free at the other end, Graffin hit the net with a goal in the third minute of first-half injury time. She showed tremendous strength to make space and finish in trademark fashion after brilliant play out wide by Clarke.That made it - to - at the interval but Paul McKillen got the ideal response from his Antrim team.Dobbin pointed early in the second half before Kelly drilled a fantastic goal home in the th minute.The -year-old took a shoulder from Dearbhla Magee with ease before unleashing a shot that was just too strong for Downrsquos custodian McGourty to repel.Drain denied McAleenan a quick riposte, but it came shortly after as Mallonrsquos piledriver ed her side to the lead. She followed up with a point, as did OrsquoHagan from a free.When Mallon concluded some deft footwork with a resounding finish after Clarke had done tremendously well to win possession, the writing was on the wall for Antrim.They continued to battle, but Down were dominant in too many sectors now.Their know-how shone through as they ensured that there would be no goals conceded, unafraid to relinquish frees to that end.

Please note that recycling bins containing wrong materials will not be collected.Workers manned pickets outside Downshire Civic Centre and the councilrsquos Strangford Road depot in Downpatrick and at sites in Newry.Administrative workers also joined in the strike and did not process any new applications for wedding or burials received that day.GMB regional organiser Alan Perry this week described the strike and its impact on ratepayers as ldquoregrettable but stressed that workers remained determined.He said: ldquoThe strike was highly successful but also highly regrettable that we have got into that situation where members have to take to the street.lsquoWe believe we can get a resolution but it takes management to engage with us. Our members are very much resolute and are quite prepared to take further days of actionrequired.Last night a council spokesperson said: Talks between Newry, Mourne and Down District Council and the joint trade unions, conciliated by the Labour Relations Agency are currently ongoing. Therefore, no further comment can be provided at this time.The strike went ahead despite the councilrsquos offer to increase pay scale of refuse workers employed by the former Down District Council to match those employed by the former Newry and Mourne District Council area.However, in a joint trade union side statement, GMB, Unite, NIPSA and SIPTU representatives laid the blame for the ldquoavoidable industrial dispute at the feet of council management.The statement said: ldquoThe trade unions engaged with the council management team in last minute and intense talks mediated by the Labour Relations Agency to seek a resolution to this dispute.ldquoWhile some progress was made in relation to job evaluation, job deions and a timetable for the completion of the negotiations, we failed to secure what was needed in relation to pay equality.ldquoThe point in contention is that for those workers whose pay grades are re-evaluated upwards, they will lose all pay progression accrued and will start at the bottom of the new grades.A statement issued last week by the council refuted that management had failed to engage and said it had met with trade unions, conciliated by the Labour Relations Agency , several times last month.It said that management presented proposals to the trade unions which would mean all refuse collection employees being employed on the same pay grades.It added: ldquoUnder the proposals, refuse workers in the former Down District Council area would increase to pay scales matching those in the former Newry and Mourne District Council area. Acceptance of these proposals could see wages for refuse workers in Downpatrick increasing from December , which has since been ratied.ldquoThe councilrsquos management also agreed to negotiate on additional payments to refuse employees in both Newry and Downpatrick for implementation of new Refuse Operating Procedures and associated practices, which would standardise working practices across the entire district. Pending negotiated agreement, existing practices and associated payments will remain unchanged.The council said that while it regretted that the trade unions were unwilling to call off the strike, it respected the right to take industrial action.The statement ended: ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down District Council remains fully committed to resolving this dispute, to ensuring fair pay, transparency and equality for all its employees and to delivering value for money for all rate payers in the Council area, especially at a time when many are experiencing signicant financial hardship.ldquoThe

We were all having a few drinks and a laugh, but then I realised she would be going home on Christmas night on her own, he explained. ldquoThat really hit hard for me, that this is the first year of her whole le that she would be alone.ldquoAnd I thought,that is what it feels like for someone to lose one person, then how must it feel for someone to lose everything Stephen started writing the new track in the lead up to last Christmas but didnrsquot want to rush it, so he put the finishing touches to it in the summer.He said he knew that he wanted to record the song and hopes that it can spark an important conversation.ldquoI know people are upset about the pubs closing or not getting to their favourite restaurant, but there are people who donrsquot have a warm home to go to at night. This song puts things into perspective, Stephen continued.ldquoA little can go a long way, especially for local, home grown charities who do amazing ground work, specically during the colder months andanyone could donate to the likes of the Simon Community, Shelter NI, Belfast Homeless Services and The Welcome Organisation in Belfast after hearing this song it would be amazing.Stephenrsquos new song was was released on November  and has had hundreds of views and downloads to date, with emotional words telling the tale of sleeping on a concrete floor during the festive period alongside a hard hitting music video have made the song a success online in just a few days.Alongside Steven Fearnley, who owns Narrow Water Studios, and Mark Nugent, who directed the music video, Stephen also worked with musicians from George Ezrarsquos brass section.He hopes to launch his new album next summer and that Covid restrictions permitting, organise a gig. He said each song on the album has its own point about mental health and is based on his own personal experiencesldquoWe are hoping that we can get the release for next summer and do a proper one with all the musicians who have been involved, he continued. ldquoHopefully, with the Covid- vaccine on the way, next year will be dferent for music events and concerts.ldquoThroughout lockdown I streamed live gigs on Facebook and they were great. The views kept growing each week and people seemed to really enjoy them. I suppose lockdown did stop a lot of things for people, so it was good to be able to bring music to peoplersquos homes.Thanking everyone who has supported him throughout his musical career, Stephen said a huge lsquothank yoursquo to his friends, family and girlfriend Aileen for their constant support.He added: ldquoI really do appreciate every person who has listened to my songs and waited for my new material to come out.

She has been cancer free now for around a year, the -year old revealed.ldquoSeeing her, and what she has come through, has encouraged me though to keep going with things. My wonderful mum is an inspiration to me and all of our family. She has fought the disease, and had a lot of treatment and has just done so, so well.Four years ago, at the Rio Paralympics, Bethany made her mark on the world stage. A series of superb displays saw her take home three gold medals and one silver. She would become Team GBrsquos most decorated athlete of the Games.In , whilst competing for Ireland in her first Paralympics, Bethany won a gold medal at the Games in London in the S  metres backstroke final. At that stage, Bethany had been swimming for only three years. She went on to win three silver medals at the  IPC Swimming World Championships.It remains to be seen whether Bethanyrsquos family will be able to go to Tokyo next year to cheer her on, just as they did in Brazil.ldquoI would love my family to be there, Bethany admitted. ldquoI remember each time before I swam in Rio, they would tell me where they were seated and I would look across and could see them. It was like that important piece of comfort because I was so far away from home.ldquoWhen you see them, it is such a great support. My family are so good. At the moment, we donrsquot knowany spectators will be at the events. Right now, we are just hoping that the Games will go ahead.ldquoIf they take place without spectators it will be hard, but at least we will be able to compete. I was in Japan in January and got to sample what the country is like out there. That has made me even hungrier to be there next year.ldquoThe facilities werenrsquot completely built, but we saw where the athletesrsquo village would be and it looked great. Japan is an amazing country with an amazing culture and I would want to be there to represent myself and my country.Should Bethany claim more medals, it would only cement her already-assured status as one of the great Paralympians.Having to wait the extra year for the Games, due to the spread of coronavirus has, however, brought its own dficulties.ldquoWhen I heard earlier this year, that the Games had been called off, it was very hard to take because it is something that you are working towards for four years, she said.ldquoWe do other competitions of course in between though they are never as big as the Paralympics.ldquoHowever to be told they were postponed was really challenging.You have to look at the positives though.ldquoIt has given me an extra year to train and to prepare. Training was probably the hardest thing.ldquoObviously, the pools closed at the start of lockdown, so it meant Ibasically had to go out into a paddling pool in my back garden and I was on a bungee chord to get a feel for the water.ldquoSport NI and the Sports Institute Northern Ireland made up a good programme of daily things to do, so I was on the bike and running. Irsquom definitely more of a pool girl, but I canrsquot run to save my le, she joked.ldquoIt was nearly the end of the first lockdown when we were allowed to train and I had to travel to Dublin three times a week.ldquoI am now training in Ards because, thankfully, elite athletes have been allowed to train here, which is a big positive.Asthose challenges were not enough, Bethany has also been on the road to recovery from injury.ldquoI had a shoulder problem, and had to go and get that injected, so that put me out of the water for a bit a few weeks ago. But I am back in now and building the work back up.ldquoMy team and I have also looked at other areas of sport science to try and help me improve, such as tracking my sleep and making sure I am always recovered between sessions.ldquoThe British trials will be held in April and that is the main event I am focusing on at the moment. In total, I could do up to six events , but I donrsquot think I will do that many. I will definitely do four, but I am not sure about the others.ldquoI have such a love for swimming and I am really excited for the Games. Hopefully I can regain some of my titles and perform strongly again.Speaking about her link-up withthe Lidl Sport for Good programme, she said: ldquoWhat Lidl are doing is fantastic. They are giving  secondary schools pound, worth of sports equipment. It is an amazing idea to get people into sport. There are so many physical and mental benefits that come from it.ldquoIt is something that benefits the whole community, and sport can make such a positive impact on peoplersquos lives.ldquoAfter the year we have had with lockdown, and people being apart, sport can undoubtedly bring people together, and I am delighted to be able to be a part of that..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/12125012.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

From January there will be an internal border between two integral parts, Great Britain and Northern Ireland, of the same state, the UK. Tarfs will be applied on goods from either crossing the border in either direction. This border will be controlled not by UK officials but by EU staff.On the island of Ireland itself, which comprises Northern Ireland and the Republic, two quite separate countries, one of which will be part of the EU and one which will not, there will be no land border, customs checks or tarfs.Clearly this will inevitably cause lots of paperwork, delays and price rises here for just about everything.And I wonder will a French trawlerman still catching UK fish in UK waters, thanks to the next inevitable concession by Boris, be able to land his catch in the Republic and get it into Northern Ireland via the open border tarf free while fish caught by a UK skipper fishing in home waters, landed in England and shipped to Northern Ireland, processed or not, vice versa attract tarf attract tarf  Dumb question  Don’t be too sure.I used to be a bit sorry for Boris when, early in his political career, to try and a bit of public exposure he played the village idiot and allowed himself to be insulted and humiliated by the snide Ian Hislop on Have I got News For You.

From a party which once boasted of its unprecedented power over the government, where there might have been humility, there was pride in place of embarrassment, there was chutzpah.The confirmation this week that the Irish Sea Border will start in just  days extinguished any lingering hope from those who believed that a year ago Boris Johnson somehow stumbled into signing an agreement which he misunderstood, rather than having betrayed the DUP in a ruthlessly calculated fashion.Read More Read MoreSam McBride: Farcically, Boris Johnson’s government is denying there will be an ...While the UK-EU deal this week reduces that border’s burden, and a possible trade deal would further soften the new border, the fact remains that it is nonetheless a new internal UK trade frontier.Northern Ireland is still a part of the United Kingdom and in a constitutional sense the Union endures. But what Brexit has wrought raises the question of what defines a country. Article VI of the Act of Union more than three centuries ago put in place a trade union alongside political union, stating that the King’s subjects in Ireland and Great Britain were to “be entitled to the same privileges, and be on the same footing...in all ports and places in the united kingdom and its dependencies”.Internal free trade is one of the defining characteristics of a country, yet here it will be constrained. A situation looms in which, as things stand, it will be unlawful for some British food to be sold in Northern Ireland.While Parliament and the Crown are nominally still sovereign in Northern Ireland, the de facto position is very dferent. What is sovereigntyanother country – or in this case  other countries – can rewrite the laws by which we are bound The fact that EU officials will be in Larne and Belfast to enforce the border, as agreed this week, is only a visual manestation of an unspinnable reality – even without their presence, it would be EU rules over which we will have no democratic say which would be enforced on the EU’s behalf.Having backed Brexit as something which would lead to a land of milk and honey, the DUP is now reduced not to selling the gains of leaving the EU but attempting to argue that it has helped to mitigate some of the most damaging possibilities.Senior DUP figures must bitterly regret having not only backed Brexit, but having done so with such zeal that it accepted the then greatest political donation in the history of Northern Irish politics so that it could campaign for Brexit in Great Britain, and then aligned themselves with an ERG suffused with English nationalism.On Thursday an audibly frustrated Nigel Dodds – who sat on the board of Vote Leave – used an interview with Good Morning Ulster to insist that in backing Brexit “our political strategy has not failed” and criticise the BBC’s questions.YetLord Dodds had heeded what the BBC was accurately reporting just over a year ago, he may have been able to avoid a move which made it easier for Mr Johnson to get the deal which creates the new border. Last September, Newsnight reported that Mr Johnson was planning for Northern Ireland to be treated very dferently to the rest of the UK. But Lord Dodds told Newsnight that he was “quite relaxed about the way things are going” and “I think Boris Johnson knows what he is about” – even though Mr Johnson had openly betrayed the DUP just months earlier.Two weeks after Newsnight’s revelation, Mr Johnson published his proposed deal for an Irish Sea regulatory border. It spelt out that agri-food goods crossing the Irish Sea from GB would have to go through a “Border Inspection Post...as required by EU law” and “be subject to identity and documentary checks and physical examination”. Similar arrangements would apply to goods due to the province aligning with “all relevant EU rules” in that area.Given Arlene Foster’s repeated insistence that an Irish Sea border was her “blood red line”, to the surprise of many observers she immediately welcomed the development, saying that “we believe it’s something that works for Northern Ireland”.What really went on inside the DUP at that point has never been publicly revealed, but it appears that the party believed it was being clever. Mr Johnson’s proposal involved a Stormont vote on the arrangements and the DUP knew – as did the PM – that it had a Stormont veto. But even that logic seemed reckless at the time because devolution was not ing and it seemed inconceivable that Sinn Féin, which had its own veto on restoring devolution, would have agreed to do sothe DUP was to immediately use that to crush the deal with the EU.Within three weeks, Mr Johnson had struck his withdrawal deal with the EU and betrayed the DUP. The deal effectively removed the DUP’s veto, instead putting in place a simple majority vote in the Assembly.In the days after that whirlwind of U-turn and betrayal, Theresa May’s former special adviser on Europe, Raoul Ruparel, told MPs that the DUP support for Mr Johnson’s offer to the EU was “a signicant change” from their past opposition to any regulatory ergence and something which crucially “gave the government more leeway to negotiate”. He said that “maybe wasn’t the right choice for them [the DUP]”.Myriad dangers for unionism, many of them still unknown, stem from how Brexit has unfolded.If, as now seems likely, the UK decides to maintain EU standards in order to soften the new border, that has the potential to anger Brexiteers and others with an interest in altering those standards. Wasn’t Brexit about taking back control, after all If Northern Ireland, rather than Brussels, is now the impediment to that control being exercised, the anger once directed at continental bureaucrats could be channelled towards Northern Ireland.On Wednesday, a fence-sitting DUP statement said: “We will want to ensure that regardless of wider circumstances there continues to be full-unfettered access for our businesses to the lucrative GB marketplace.” Yet participating in a market involves trade in two directions. Even the supposedly “unfettered” ability for Northern Ireland firms to sell to GB is more complex than it first appears.This week a senior freight industry figure explained how local manufacturers benefit signicantly from lorries coming into Northern Ireland with goods from GB, because they are ing anyway. Disrupting one route necessarily disturbs the other.Borders are complex but in Northern Ireland it might have been expected that politicians would have an intuitive understanding of their signicance.Instead, eight months after the vote for Brexit the then DUP MLA Nelson McCausland told the Nolan Show during a discussion about border arrangements: “I wouldn’t care what sort of situation I face as long as I’m out of Europe.”That glib comment summed up the constitutional flippancy of some senior DUP figures who were wallowing in simplistic nationalistic fervour, while ignorant of the complexity of the changes they were proposing and the fragility of the Union with which they were tampering.The DUP now likes to point to the absurdity of Mr Johnson’s position but its own refusal to accept its multiple mistakes is as unconvincing as the prime minister’s denial that there will even be an Irish Sea Border._____\u2028_______________A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityYsgol y Deri, a special educational needs school, is planning on expanding with a new building with space for  pupils on land near Cosmeston Country Park.While the Welsh Government is paying for most of the expansion, the Vale council will put up pound. million towards it mdash including pound million of Section  money from the Cog Road development, where hundreds of houses are planned near Sully.Section  money, paid by developers, is supposed to fund the extra pressure placed on local public services like doctorsrsquo surgeries and schools.Councillor Bob Penrose said that pound million should stay in the village and be spent on replacing Sully Primary School, instead of going towards Ysgol y Deri.He said: ldquoThe action proposed by the education department flies in the face of the democratic process, both for residents and local councillors.ldquoI find this situation totally unacceptable.ldquoIrsquom not opposed to the concept of a satellite facility for Ysgol y Deri, and I appreciate the sterling work done by the school. The objection is purely against the acquisition of pound million from Sullyrsquos Section  money.During a meeting of the full Vale council on Monday, December , Cllr Penrose proposed a motion to spend the Section  money on Sully Primary School instead of Ysgol y Deri. Opinion was split in the council:  councillors voted for and  against, with six abstaining.Supporting the motion, Cllr George Carroll, representing Llandough, said: ldquoThe role of Section  money is to compensate communities and existing residents for the impacts that developments may have on the area, particularly on public services.ldquoThis isnrsquot just an issue for Sully, even though thatrsquos the community thatrsquos being discussed. The same could end up happening to other communities across the Vale.ldquoI want to see investment in Ysgol y Deri mdash itrsquos important that happens mdash but I think the source of the money should be found where in the education budget to provide it.ldquoItrsquos absolutely right we make sure that Section  money is spent on the communities rather than for county-wide projects.The Vale council has not yet formally decided on expanding Ysgol y Deri, nor on whether to use the pound million to go towards the expansion. Sully Primary School is set for a new building in the next band of school replacements, so will see investment in a few years time.Cllr Lis Burnett, deputy leader and cabinet member for education, said the motion was ldquopremature and Sully Primary School currently has enough space for children in the local catchment area.She added the new Ysgol y Deri building is actually in the ward of Sully mdash although it will take pupils from across the Vale of Glamorgan and Cardf, too.She said: ldquoSully Primary School currently has sufficient capacity for reception intake from the catchment area, including those from the development, until at least . Currently a third of pupils from the school are outside of the catchment area.ldquoIrsquom at a loss as to why children with special needs are being singled out as not being worthy of funding. What does that say to any child or young person with special needs in Sully But the primary school does suffer with space, Cllr Penrose said, with a school hall not big enough to fit all of its pupils and a lack of enough toilets for both children and staff.The Vale council is currently consulting the public on the proposals to expand Ysgol y Deri, before applying for planning permission for the new building. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Shops, hairdressers, restaurants, places of worship and hotels are among the places that will be able to re-open from December . Pubs selling drink onlywill remain closed and an additional financial package will be put in place. The Executive has also agreed Christmas household bubbling arrangements from December -. Three households will be able to come together for this period in domestic settings, outdoor public spaces and places of worship. One of the households will be able to include their existing household bubble. First Minister Arlene Foster said: “Through our collective efforts over recent weeks we gained enough space in the transmission of the virus to relax a signicant number of restrictions, including the opening-up of non-essential retail, close contact services, sport and leisure activities and our places of worship at the end of next week. “These decisions will give families, businesses and employees some much-needed certainty and comfort in the run-up to Christmas and beyond. “This is a special time of the year and we want to support people to have a good Christmas, but also a safe one. “Signicant work has been completed with business sectors, faith groups, local government and police on new mitigation measures to reduce the risk of transmission. “I urge everyone to be Covid-aware and to make careful and sensible decisions when out and about or mixing with others. We need to make sure we continue doing all we can to protect ourselves and our loved ones.” Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said: “The Executive wants to give people as much notice as possible on what the situation will look like from next Friday when the current circuit breaker comes to an end. “We have given detailed consideration to which restrictions need tobe maintained, and what we can open up, in light of the scientic and medical advice. “A package of measures that will see signicant relaxations to the current restrictions has been agreed, with maximum mitigations in place to minimise risks to the greatest extent possible. An additional support package will be put in place for traditional drink-only pubs that unfortunately will not be able to reopen at this time. “We appreciate how important Christmas time is for many families and the Executive has agreed arrangements that will allow families and friends to come together in a limited way between  and  December. “It’s important for people to understand that with any increased contact comes increased risk. Everyone needs to think very carefully about the risks posed to them, and their loved ones, by coming together over the Christmas period, particularly to those who are vulnerable. Some may choose not to form a Christmas bubble but for those who do, we encourage them to keep their bubbles small and limit the numbers of people gathering, as much as possible.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bddbadeeded   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fcbdaddbdd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
