BA is currently fighting a class action against former staff who claim their health has been affected by continued exposure to toxic fumes or aerotoxicity. The case is being spearheaded by the family of BA pilot Richard Westgate, 43, who took his own life in 2012         His family say his ill health caused by toxic fumes led him to self medicate and contribute to his death. BA have denied any liability in Mr Westgate\u0027s death and the High Court case is ongoing         In April 2017, a coroner overseeing an inquest into Mr Westgate\u0027s (left) death ruled his overdose was accidental, but heard evidence that a post-mortem revealed damage to his heart and nervous system, which his family say were signs of his exposure to aerotoxicityIn its legal action Unite - which represents cabin crew - claims pilots and crew are exposed to frequent \u0027fume events\u0027 that can lead to chronic ill-health and life-threatening conditions.Howard Beckett, from Unite, said: \u0027The airline industry cannot continue to hide from the issue of toxic cabin air whilst placing the health and safety of aircrew at risk.\u0027The case is being spearheaded by the family of BA pilot Richard Westgate, 43, who took his own life in 2012 from an overdose of sleeping pills.His family say his ill health caused by toxic fumes led him to self medicate and contribute to his death.In April 2017, a coroner overseeing an inquest into his death ruled his overdose was accidental, but heard evidence that a post-mortem revealed damage to his heart and nervous system, which his family say were signs of his exposure to aerotoxicity.BA have denied any liability in Mr Westgate\u0027s death and the High Court case is ongoing.The BA spokesman said: \u0027We would never operate an aircraft if we believed it posed any health or safety risk to our customers or crew.          In its legal action Unite - which represents cabin crew - claims pilots and crew are exposed to frequent \u0027fume events\u0027 that can lead to chronic ill-health and life-threatening conditions         BA said: \u0027We would never operate an aircraft if we believed it posed any health or safety risk to our customers or crew. Research by the European Aviation Safety Agency concluded that the air quality on board aircraft was similar or better than that observed in normal indoor environments\u0027\u0027Research commissioned by the European Aviation Safety Agency in 2017 concluded that the air quality on board aircraft was similar or better than that observed in normal indoor environments.\u0027Safety is our first priority and every report is thoroughly investigated, with typically 151 engineering checks before an aircraft is cleared to continue flying.\u0027Fume or odour events have been found to be caused by a wide range of issues, including burnt food in the oven, aerosols and e-cigarettes, strongly-smelling food in cabin bags, and de-icing fluid.\u0027  "},{"url":null,"title":"Meghan Markle visits womens shelter Vancouver","story":"Pick a parka coat by Barbour like MeghanNow sold out - shop similar at John Lewis \u0026amp PartnersIt\u0026#39s chilly over there in Vancouver but Meghan Markle found a way to stay toasty in style thanks to her Barbour parka coat.The classic brand is also favoured by  the likes of the Duchess of Cambridge, and is the ultimate go-to when it comes to nailing an outdoor-chic vibe.A parka coat is a stalwart outerwear choice, offering practical appeal with a nod to nineties cool too.

Mr Markle gave the letter to the newspaper after unnamed friends of the duchess told the People magazine that she had written the \u0027loving\u0027 letter in an attempt to repair their relationship.Lawyers for the newspaper alleged that Meghan had \u0027knowingly\u0027 allowed her friends to leak details of the letter to the magazine – effectively that she had helped to breach her own privacy.

The Sussexes have said they will fund the legal proceedings privately. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/09/22/4BC98FDC00000578-0-image-m-265_1525900411418.jpg","title":"Super youthful Taiwanese actress amazes internet age defying looks","story":"Share this article Ms Chen, whose name is sometimes translated as Chen Meifeng, won the \u0027Knitwear Beauty Queen\u0027 competition in 1975 at the age of 19 after a friend had signed her up for the pageant. Instead of pursuing an acting career straight away, the crowned champion, from the northern Taiwanese city of Keelung, took up a part time job at a bank in Taipei - first as an operation then as an assistant accountant.The actress, now 63 years old, shot her first advertisement about three years later after being cast by a director who spotted her on a film set. She was accompanying a female friend to shoot a programme at the time.

She has been hugging Penny and is so overjoyed. \u0027You wouldn\u0027t believe how happy my daughter is – I am as well. \u0027We were so heartbroken she was taken but now so she has come home.\u0027 In the extraordinary row between the neighbours, Cookson was filmed climbing over Mr James\u0027 five-foot high fence and jumping into his back garden.         Mr Daniel said Penny\u0027s return was a \u0027happy ending\u0027 for the family and said his eight-year-old daughter is over the moon to have her beloved cocker iel home again       Mr Daniel had no idea what his neighbour had done with Penny (pictured) for four months until last week when police phoned him to say that she had been found in the south of ManchesterShe then grabbed the portable kennel Penny was kept in and jumped back into her parents\u0027 garden. Another cocker iel he owns called Molly watched the theft but was not targeted and was found running around the garden. Mr Daniel discovered the theft when he arrived home from a trip to the supermarket. Despite being caught red-handed, the teenager refused to tell police where the elusive cocker iel was being held.She ignored desperate appeals to return the dog from Mr James, leaving his daughter \u0027extremely upset\u0027. The college student was quizzed by police and said she had given Penny away to a friend as she believed the dog wasn\u0027t being looked after properly. Cookson admitted theft before magistrates and was ordered to pay £600 compensation after refusing to disclose Penny\u0027s whereabouts. She was also ordered to complete a 12 month community order and 150 hours unpaid work and was told to pay costs of £85.               The dog-napping led to a bitter fall out between father-of-two Mr Daniel and teenager Cookson as she ignored his pleas to hand back the dog, leaving his daughter incredibly upset, he says          Cookson, 19, was fined £600 at Manchester Magistrates\u0027 Court in November for taking Penny. The court was shown footage of her scaling Mr Daniel\u0027s fence and stealing the beloved puppy Penny had initially not been found despite Mr Daniel making repeated appeals to Cookson\u0027s mother and father who live next door to him. Defending Stephen Connor told the court: \u0027In interview she accepted she had taken this dog and indeed she attended the interview on a voluntary basis. \u0027Throughout the course of her interview she raised real concerns about the health of the dog that she took and the health of other puppies that she says were in the back garden. \u0027She has been open with me because she was that alarmed about the health of those dogs - the CCTV actually shows her on her phone trying to get through to the RSPCA but was being kept waiting. \u0027In hindsight she accepts she took a foolish decision and she regrets that. \u0027The dog was given to a friend the defendant is adamant that she hasn\u0027t received any financial gain - you are dealing with a 19-year-old lady who had never even troubled the courts.\u0027 Her mother Elaine told Mailonline after her conviction: \u0027She\u0027s sorry for what happened – she made a mistake. She told me she\u0027s given the dog to someone else to look after.\u0027          The family\u0027s other cocker iel Molly (pictured) was left behind by Cookson despite being in the garden with Penny at the time she was spirited awayMr Daniel said his ordeal came to a \u0027happy ending\u0027 on Friday with a call from police to say the missing dog had been located. \u0027We don\u0027t really know the circumstances of how she was found,\u0027 he said. \u0027The police just rang up and said she\u0027s been found in south Manchester.

Dorothy Perkins, Burton and Miss Selfridge shops are also set to close in the initiative.Three other stores now closing – in Carmarthen, Horsham and Blackpool – did not have their rents reduced but it is understood their leases have come to an end.A further 25 stores are likely to shut down as, at the time of its restructuring in June last year, Arcadia said it planned to put the property arms of Evans and Miss Selfridge into administration. That is yet to happen.Since Christmas, Arcadia has also been forced to close 26 outlets inside Debenhams, which this Sunday will shut the last seven of 22 department stores marked for closure as part of its own rescue plan.Signs of distress were clear when it emerged that the Topshop and Topman boss Paul Price had resigned last month after just over two years at the business. Prior to Topshop, Price was with Burberry for a decade.The Arcadia stores were caught up in a spate of heavy discounting at the end of last year as fashion retailers battled to attract shoppers more interested in spending on electronic gadgets, Netflix subscriptions and trips to restaurants and bars.Last month Green secured a last-ditch £310m mortgage deal for his flagship Topshop store on Oxford Street in London with the US private equity company Apollo Management International.Arcadia had said that difficulties in refinancing the loan could mean it would have to raise new funds to survive.The four-year agreement with Apollo should provide a firmer footing for Green’s retail empire, but the specialist lender is likely to have demanded a high rate of interest, making life tougher for the high street business."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6a55c6bae9e5275e6c2daa296cda4bf6dcf0a63/207_0_5553_3333/master/5553.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ead1f210a1f7cf5abeb3c60cdff4c5f","title":"the case for truly taking back control by reversing the privatisation of our cities","story":"From sparkling water fountains to better waste services and lower drug prices, cities are showing the benefits of remunicipalisation Cities is concluding with ‘The case for ...”, a series of opinion pieces exploring options for radical urban change. Read our editor’s farewell hereIn 2015, a strident editorial appeared in Global Water Intelligence, a trade magazine for the water industry, under the title: Exorcising the “R” word. “It would be a travesty,” the writer declared, to let “the ill-informed propaganda of a few NGOs” interfere with private sector involvement in the water business.The unspeakable “R” word that had provoked such a defensive stance? Remunicipalisation: the taking back of privatised assets and services into public ownership at a local level.This dangerous idea, the Global Water Intelligence piece said, would be “unlikely to be taken seriously by intelligent decision-makers in the industry”, because of all the “valid and rational arguments behind private sector participation” in providing water.The agency, Eau de Paris, even installed free fountains providing sparkling water – a comically French idea, perhaps, but cheap, and good for the environment, preventing thousands of plastic bottles from heading to landfill sites. It also illustrated an important point: when our urban infrastructure is owned by the public rather than profit-making corporations,  everyone – not just shareholders – can have nice things.The word remunicipalisation does not lend itself to catchy slogans. It is, perhaps, somewhat alienatingly wonkish: in-sourcing civic infrastructure is not generally thought of as sexy politics. But its popularity is on the rise worldwide. The Transnational Institute (TNI), a thinktank in Amsterdam, has been banging the drum for years. Its latest report, The Future Is Public, identifies more than 1,400 cases of remunicipalisation since the turn of the millennium, in more than 2,400 cities across 58 countries.The benefits of remunicipalisation fall into two broad categories: first, correcting what has gone wrong in our cities after decades of privatisation, profit-extraction and waste and second, forging a new sense of the public good.“The privatisation and outsourcing of the last 30-40 years has failed,” says Cat Hobbs of the Oxford-based campaigning organisation We Own It. . “It tends to cost us more, it means that we get worse services, we have less control over them, and there is less democratic accountability to us, the public.“But it’s also a moral question. We’re often talking about natural monopolies like water, where competition doesn’t make sense, and the market doesn’t really belong. When we talk about ‘people not profit’, everyone understands that.”The alternative, she argues, is one in which public ownership at the local level can ensure there are better, more stable jobs for communities, prioritising sustainability rather than idends for shareholders. From social care to libraries to refuse collection, privatisation has cut these services to the bone.Remunicipalisation could resonate particularly well in the UK, because it speaks to some of the same political shifts that led to Brexit. “We know that part of Brexit is about people wanting decisions to be taken near to where they live,” Hobbs says. “It’s about a sense of accountability and economic sovereignty, and taking back control.”Why not help people actually take back control, in a way that transcends not just the 2016 referendum vote, but also how people voted in the recent UK election? Perhaps some of the questions being asked about Labour’s “lost heartlands” – about how you rebuild a civic sphere, and a sense of local community and participation in post-industrial cities – could be answered through remunicipalisation.“Simply parcelling off public services to whichever multinational company can do it the cheapest is not a way of showing we value our communities,” says Hobbs. “This is core to a decent society.”But if remunicipalisation is a local movement, it is a global phenomenon, with the sharing of radical ideas and best practice among progressive city halls across the world. This sharing is the policy arm of the Fearless Cities organisation, and the book of the same name, which unites the growing municipalist movement.Fearless Cities is best seen as a revanchist programme, trying to claw back some of the territory taken over the by the privatisation orthodoxy that began spreading globally during the Reagan and Thatcher era. Institutions such as the IMF, WTO and the World Bank pushed outsourcing of government services, and tough conditions on loans that had the effect of encouraging privatisation and fire-sales of public assets.The 2008 global financial crisis, however, shook the assumption that the private sector would produce the best results in cities. It is telling that the first political response to the crash began in 2011 with the Occupy movement – in the public spaces of world cities such as Athens, Madrid, London and New York. These “movements of the squares” soon found political expression at a national level, via new parties like Podemos and Syriza, and in Bernie Sanders’ and Jeremy Corbyn’s political successes.“It is the best way to concretise demands to defend public services,” says TNI’s remunicipalisation guru Sol Trumbo, reflecting on the power of this kind of local action. There are a number of strategic advantages to focusing on city-level change, he says, especially for the left.“If you are confronting neoliberal thinking and dogmas, it’s much harder to find a clear position on something as complex as, say the EU, or Nato membership. But if your political debate is around questions like: ‘Are there enough parks? Is public transport working or not? Are there too many cars on the streets?’ The questions are really tangible, and close to people’s lives, and it’s easier for progressive politics to provide an answer.”They ought to become still closer. Part of the remunicipalisation ideal is that it is not simply an obscure asset transfer from private to public ownership – a change in the paperwork that will pass ordinary citizens by. Rather, it aims to increase participation in decision-making, boost local democracy and civic energy, and make services fairer and more accessible.“In these moments of political uncertainty and distrust, locality and proximity is really useful,” Trumbo says. What better way to rebuild local community, local connections, local pride? I’ll raise my free sparkling water to that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dec54b89a081b12061155faf98febc623f1b0598/0_145_6048_3628/master/6048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61dfcdb223e037f03386ce49c46feb96","title":"blackrock coal divestment regulation fund manager","story":"Let’s not beat about the bushfires. It’s not the impacts of climate breakdown on our ecosystems or the world’s poorest in the global south that worries Larry Fink, the CEO of that financial behemoth BlackRock. No, what really worries him and his shadow banking peers is the “fundamental reshaping of finance” threatened by climate protesters, and what this means for his company’s interests.BlackRock’s management of our savings takes place largely in a globalised sphere known as the shadow banking sector. In the past, most savings were placed in carefully regulated high-street banks and other savings institutions. Today, many of these functions have migrated toward shadow banking.This sector is made up of institutions (including pension funds, insurance companies and hedge funds) that use securities (a tradeable bundle of debt or equities) as collateral in a modern form of credit creation. BlackRock, backed by $7 trillion of the world’s savings, also provides traditional banking services across the international financial system. Asset management funds such as BlackRock operate beyond democratic borders and are not subject to the same regulatory oversight as traditional banks.But the “shape of finance”, especially in the shadow sector, remains essentially the same: it spews out massive quantities of credit – forms of new money – much of it aimed at speculative activity. The Financial Stability Board reckons that at the end of 2017 shadow banks generated $184tr in financial assets. This money is then used to invest in the real economy of consumption and production – and in the fossil fuel sector. As Bill McKibben, leader of the campaign group, 350.org, writes, without asset management companies such as BlackRock, “fossil-fuel companies would almost literally run out of gas” what’s more, the company is the “world’s largest investor” in coal, oil and gas companies, and in those “driving deforestation”.While it is significant that Fink has publicly acknowledged the risks that climate breakdown poses to his and other companies, that is surely not the only point. The real concern is that the world’s politicians and regulators have allowed this behemoth to scoop up our savings, while turning a blind eye to how those savings are managed. This, in turn, has fuelled the creation of vast amounts of credit and debt, which has made the global financial system unstable and fragile. The shadow banking sector is much, much larger than it was after the Lehman Brothers collapse – a collapse precipitated in part by Lehman’s activities in the shadows.If we are to save the planet, then we must begin by switching off the giant tap of unregulated credit. Fink is right: a “fundamental reshaping of finance” is what climate protesters want as the order of the day. But self-regulated estment is not enough. The “reshaping” needs to be democratically enforced and accountable. We must ensure that companies such as BlackRock are brought back down to Earth and properly regulated by public authority. We have to do this if we are to redirect investment into the transformation of economies away from their addiction to fossil fuels and into more sustainable transport, energy and land-use systems.• Ann Pettifor is director of Prime: Policy Research in Macroeconomics and a fellow of the New Economics Foundation"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6005827c89873c138c44b2db8b6ced2141ddb94/0_48_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04d498656734336f55b813700e9c2999","title":"iowa caucuses democrats us elections 2020","story":"Nobody has a clue which Democrat will win our two-year-long parlor game – but I suspect it will come down to ground gameThe plain fact is that we Iowans are having a hard time making up our minds.Our attention has been firmly fixed on a historically huge field of 25 Democratic presidential candidates since each stood on a soapbox and delivered their pitch at the state fair in August, within earshot of the butter cow.Now it appears we are down to an effective field of a half-dozen – Iowa’s function in the nomination process is to responsibly winnow the field – and the gold standard of polling told us last weekend it’s a wide-open race. And that about half of us who think we are close to decided are still sucking our thumbs and remain open to some other suitor.The old saying goes that there are three tickets out of Iowa, with its first-in-the-nation caucuses set for Monday 3 February. This time, four tickets may get punched for the next stop in New Hampshire a week later. It does not appear that there is a dominant frontrunner – Warren trails by three points and Biden by five.Still, a third of the Democrats may trudge into that cafeteria undecided. Or they realize their candidate is not viable when they get there. Speeches get under way from neighbors who are precinct captains for each campaign. Appeals are made. Musical chairs commence. Unviable camps are courted by the viable.Second choices, in this context, are as important as first.At the same time, Buttigieg’s support in the poll as a first choice plummeted nine points after having led in the last poll in November. He, like Warren when she briefly led, came under intense attack. His corporate ties and tensions with the African American community came under scrutiny as did Warren’s healthcare position. It showed in the polling. Warren took her beating earlier and since has stabilized, actually bouncing up a tad. The poll reported that while Buttigieg slid, “undecideds” rose.Buttigieg has perhaps the only paid organizing network as large as Warren’s in the Tall Corn state. The Iowa caucuses have historically served as a test of a campaign’s ability to organize and turn out voters at the precinct level. Warren set up shop statewide, with a special emphasis on rural areas so often flown over. Buttigieg reputedly caught up to her in committing resources to organizing. But she has been at it longer, especially in those forgotten rural places that could give a winner the margin they need.Sanders benefits from a core of support that has stayed in place since he virtually tied Hillary Clinton in the Iowa caucus in 2016. His indictment: Clinton supported the Iraq war. His indictment revisited: Biden supported the Iraq war – a not-inconsiderable charge in Iowa. Iowa Democrats have a strong anti-war streak that runs deep among descendants of Prussian draft-dodgers.Which all goes to say that nobody has any clue who will win our two-year-long parlor game. Probably, there will be no clear winner. Likely, there will be four viable campaigns. I suspect on-the-ground organization matters most – especially for candidates who are tied up in a congressional impeachment trial and can’t campaign. For certain, caucus night is going to be crazy. No doubt about that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/784681cbc9abaa291f70cb6d641034c353a3e2c6/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88b1d9044c2370292ee3f0a77c69b1b5","title":"what the five hottest years on earth look like in pictures","story":"The past five years – and the past decade – are the hottest in 150 years, the latest research has shown.

The centrepiece was a life size tree trunk growing up into the ceiling. Think Alice’s Wonderland circa the “drink me” scene, by way of Rene Magritte’s paintings. Some 1200 audience members – including model Bella Hadid – had already had a preview of this dreamlike mood: a wall-size clock running backwards served as their invite.This is Abloh’s fourth show for Louis Vuitton who in 2018 became the first designer of colour to be appointed at a significant luxury brand. There’s a happy disconnect between the inspiration behind his sets and most of what the models wear. If the former let Abloh’s imagination run at full tilt, the other is all business. For this collection, that was taken literally.The show began with a suit and workwear was central – albeit workwear that spells out success through conspicuous logos. The LV of Louis Vuitton as well as the famous monogram were used liberally on work bags, suits and coats. Some pieces were more statement than office. A particularly clever design was a shirt lasercut like guipure lace with the shapes of the monogram. Louis Vuitton is one of a number of luxury brands that are still not fur free. A fox fur coat with a giant LV logo on the back was straight out of a late nineties bling moment. The series of suits with cloud prints at the end of the show brought everything back full circle.Abloh’s shows are an assault on the senses and for music, the designer – who has also worked as a DJ – collaborated with Juan Atkins, the DJ and musician known for his role in the development of techno in eighties’ Detroit. Atkins brought his Cybotron project to Paris – he overlooked Abloh’s show in a booth with two other musicians, both in masks similar to those worn by French electronic duo Daft Punk. The electronic music clashed with the homespun vibe of the set but – as all things in Abloh’s world – that was probably the point.The show notes explained that a childlike perspective was part of the thinking behind the show. “Gazing at the world through the optics of a child – of an adolescent or a young man – is tantamount to first impressions”, they read. The suits are intended as a twist on corporate wear: “don’t let your day job define you”, advised Abloh.LVMH - Louis Vuitton’s parent company - will hope this show starts its new decade on a positive. The brand’s last moment in the spotlight was when LVMH president Bernard Arnault met Donald Trump for the opening of a Louis Vuitton factory in Texas in October. Thursday also featured the show for Givenchy, another storied brand owned by LVMH. The collection was inspired by India’s Yashwantrao Holkar II, the 14th Maharajah of Indore who befriended the likes of Eileen Gray and Man Ray in Paris in the thirties. It featured sharp suits, embroidery and, perhaps surprisingly for such a rarified brand, latex polonecks. Clare Waight Keller, Givenchy’s Artistic Director who designed the Duchess of Sussex’s wedding dress, said that the material appealed because, like the finest of fabrics, it has to be cut bespoke. “The fact that there is this couture element to something so perverse is so interesting,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6d5638f2813b21cca1e73a00840bfdfcb886f08/0_25_3880_2327/master/3880.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b22d91318d6431a27c055c46bba8ba5","title":"harvey weinstein trial gigi hadid juror dismissed","story":"Weinstein’s legal team wrote in a motion that the model was friends with Cara Delevingne, who has accused him of misconductGigi Hadid will not be sitting in judgment over Harvey Weinstein after the supermodel was discharged as a potential juror in the rape trial of the once powerful movie mogul.Hadid, 24, made it through the first round of culling of a giant pool of possible jurors for the New York trial. In the course of questioning in court, she revealed that she had met Weinstein personally though she said that she still felt able to be fair and impartial were she put on the jury.On Wednesday the defendant’s legal team released further details on Hadid in an 87-page motion complaining about the way the trial was being conducted in a “carnival-like atmosphere”. Weinstein’s lawyer Arthur Aidala wrote that the Victoria’s Secret model was friends with Cara Delevingne, one of 105 women who have publicly accused the film producer of various sorts of sexual misconduct towards them.In court on Thursday, it was disclosed that 62 potential jurors have been dismissed overnight. One of them is Hadid.As a further twist, Judge James Burke of the New York supreme court hauled in front of him a member of the initial jury pool who had made the rash move of tweeting about proceedings. Weinstein’s eagle-eyed attorneys have been scouring social media for signs of bias among possible jurors and caught two people in the act.One of the posts published by Weinstein’s lawyers had a member of the jury pool tweeting: “If anyone knows how a person might hypothetically leverage serving on the jury of a high-profile case to promote their new novel, dm me please.”Replies to the tweet included: “Whoever you have to sleep with to get on that jury, do it.”Burke instructed the male juror to return to court in March ready “to show cause – to tell me why – I should not hold you in contempt”. The man faces a fine and up to 30 days in jail for violating the court’s order not to discuss the proceedings on social media.Weinstein, 67, faces five counts. The two most serious counts of predatory sexual assault carry the most severe punishment of up to life in prison, and he also faces two counts of rape and one of a criminal sex act relating to two accusers. He has pleaded not guilty to these charges, which relate to incidents alleged by two female accusers in 2006 and 2013. If convicted on the most serious charge, he could face a life sentence.The trial is now entering a second, more intense phase of jury selection that will produce the final panel of 12 jurors and six alternates ahead of opening statements scheduled for next Wednesday. The overall process will take two weeks, whittling down the vast pool which began with 608 iniduals.Of those, many told the court that they felt they were unable to deliver fair and impartial justice towards Weinstein, without stipulating the reasons why. The defense team has seized on the large proportion of potential jurors who effectively recused themselves to argue that the trial is being conducted amid a “deluge” of adverse media publicity that will taint the trial.The initial filtering process has reduced the pool to 146 people who now face inidual questioning by both defense and prosecution teams – a stage known as voir dire.On Thursday Donna Rotunno, Weinstein’s leading defense lawyer, made yet another attempt to have the rules of the trial changed. The team has made multiple efforts to have it moved out of New York city on grounds that it is the “media capital of the world” and has called for jury selection to be held in private – all of which have been denied.On this occasion Rotunno argued for voir dire to be conducted with each of the 146 in isolation to avoid their answers tainting others. Burke denied that too, expressing his anger at a recent comment made by Weinstein’s lawyers that the jury selection process was being conducted as though it were “business as usual”.“Voir dire is hardly business as usual,” Burke told the four lawyers who were sitting next to Weinstein on the defense side of court. “We have determined 62 jurors who based on their questionnaires have been discharged – that means the voir dire is working and it is hardly grounds for a fairly drastic remedy of the kind you request.”To underline his chagrin, Burke added: “The manner in which we are doing this three-part, laborious, time-consuming, multiple jury panel prospective juror-devouring method is working.”Among the 146 remaining jurors there are 31 people who have indicated on questionnaires that they have some experience of sexual assault – either personally or through a friend or family member. Weinstein’s team argued that those 31 should also be discharged as they would be unable to be fair towards the defendant.But the lead prosecutor, Joan Illuzzi, robustly countered that suggestion. “I don’t think the defense could possibly say that a person who has been sexually assaulted or who knows someone who has been sexually assaulted is no longer qualified to sit on the case. That is not the law.”A total of six women are likely to testify to having been the victims of alleged sexual crimes by the defendant once the trial proper begins next week. Their stories form a tiny portion of the total of 105 women who have come forward to accuse Weinstein of sexual misconduct to a varying degree of seriousness."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84ac92a83ff94398ba278c9fcc9343f4c3457247/0_21_3008_1805/master/3008.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a49bdc2e7b8a34b004c91e62985c4a76","title":"learned worst kitchen accidents broken glass boiling water","story":"‘Unlike regular knives,” runs the press release for Viners’ new cutlery, “the pointed end has been removed, helping to tackle knife-related injuries.” And there’s a picture. They look quite silly without a pointy end, but they also call into question why this has never been done before – indeed, why kitchen knives evolved to be the shape they are. Because you never use the point, or maybe you do once every couple of years for a particularly slidey tomato. All regular chopping is done with the blade edge.I shall not be buying a pointless knife but I thought I would take the opportunity to run through the top kitchen injuries of myself and everyone I know, so that younger readers can avoid them. Note: almost all of these start with being drunk. If you’re never drunk, you could probably keep a leopard in your kitchen and get away with it.Making something as innocuous as coffee, I once spilled a kettle of boiling water on to my hand, and woke up the next day with a giant blister that ran from my wrist to the tip of each finger. I had to get it re-dressed every day by the nurse at work. It was someone different each day, and they all said: “Have you always had a mole on that finger? Because, if not, a brown or black mark beneath a blister indicates gangrene.” And I’d say, “Hang on, let me check my mole inventory … no, wait I DON’T HAVE ONE OF THOSE, BECAUSE NOBODY DOES.” And they would always look at me, like “I don’t know why you’re shouting at me, love, you’re the one who spilled boiling water on herself.” And then they would say: “You’re lucky it wasn’t oil, or you’d have definitely lost this hand.” And the moral of this story is there is nothing more dangerous in the kitchen than boiling water, except boiling oil. After that, I didn’t deep-fry for about a decade.All other burning incidents pale into insignificance besides this one indeed, your classic chef’s burn – a straight line across the forearm from the oven shelf – is a badge of honour and I feel quite chuffed when I get one of those.In the sharp sphere, the thing that’s a thousand times more dangerous than knives is glass. I once gashed myself with a broken tumbler (I’m trying to avoid saying where, because it makes me sound chaotic OK, it was my hip), and left it overnight before I went to hospital, by which time it had begun to heal, but very inelegantly, like …well, not “like” – this was exactly what it was – a gaping wound. So they had to – doctor’s own words – “rough it up” before they could stitch it, which was exactly as it sounds, very painful and also a bit surreal. A friend severed a tendon on a broken jar of pickled onions, and couldn’t work for six months. It is so incredibly perilous that my honest advice is: whatever state of clumsiness you were in when you broke the glass, you are too clumsy to clear it up, and you should go immediately to bed and do it eight hours later.There is a lot of hidden danger to be had from a mandoline, especially when you’ve just bought it. I shaved the tops off four fingers in one go, straight into a dish of potatoes, which I then had to throw away. The waste bugged me as much as the copious loss of blood, although that could have been a displacement emotion. A friend got hospitalised filleting a sea bass, whose spines are incredibly sharp. Oh, and my dad licked a knife to get chocolate mousse off it, blade edge first, and then was so surprised by the entirely predictable event of cutting his mouth open that he kind of knocked into a kitchen cabinet and broke a rib. But he was incredibly clumsy: he made me look like I’d been to finishing school.Never forget the danger of food itself, which can get all kinds of hot, and also be poisonous. I find it karmically satisfying that chickens, which alive pose the threat level of a dirty look, can nearly kill you once they’re dead, by something as simple as a cooked one being placed on a chopping board recently inhabited by a raw one. Just by being no respecter of sell-by dates or basic hygiene, I’ve got ill via sausages, bacon, oysters, rice, mince and, one time, an unknown thing I put in my mouth because I found it in my pocket.I just asked my Mr for his worst kitchen accident, and he said: “My mother’s cooking”, but he was definitely making a hilarious joke because his -reading mother is an excellent cook."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0eb9c0b248d3188a5ce9daf9aef4e4dc46db5a73/0_266_7952_4771/master/7952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4bf793d4ea0154bd8cfaa86f45fe52df","title":"mindful eating gurus silence at the table jay rayner","story":"Let’s hear it for mindless eating: for noise and clamour, for shouting and burpingAmid the blizzard of diet cobblers that fills my inbox at this time of year, generally promising to cleanse you of all evidence that you ever ate anything at all, is one email that made me roll my eyeballs with such intensity I’m sure the neighbours could hear the grinding of flesh. It proposes “mindful eating”. A few ill-advised clicks later and I land on a self-styled food guru’s manifesto. “Have you ever noticed,” it starts, “how incredibly silent it becomes at dinner as soon as the food hits the table? Then you may have experienced mindful eating.”Honestly, no. Not in my house. And long may that continue. According to our nutritional adviser too many of us eat semi-consciously. We are careless. We give no consideration to taste and texture. We are bad to the core. Part of the solution, apparently, is silence. This, she suggests, will help us towards mindful eating. It’s a new one on me. Ever the diligent reporter, I Google the term. Good God. There are more than two million references to it. Mindful eating is actually a thing.Stop. I am determined to squash this notion under my weighty heel, before it gets any further. I greet the concept of mindful eating with one big fat raspberry. Let’s hear it for mindless eating: for noise and clamour at the table, for shouting and burping and crappy jokes that do not land and interruptions through half-emptied mouths for raucous laughter and shouts of “more please” and “give me the recipe?” and “why in God’s name did you sleep with them?” Because a dining table wreathed in contemplative silence is a special kind of unmourned death.The silent dining table is the domain of the long-married couple in the overambitious, underachieving restaurant of a country house hotel the couple who scrape at their prissily garnished plates wordlessly, because they ran out of anything to say to each other 10 years ago, but can’t quite summon the will to orce because of all the admin. It’s the suffocating family home where teenage children stare at their peas and dream of escape from the disappointed husks that are their parents. It’s the vainglorious food bloggers, those grim napkin sniffers, awarding every dish a score out of 20 so that all you can hear throughout the meal is the scratch of pencil on notepad.I like lunch. And dinner. And breakfast. I’m a big fan of all these meals, and all the others in between. I care about ingredients and good cooking, and the effort put into these things by those feeding me. But I do not regard the table primarily as a place of nutrition. That’s just something which, happily, comes with the territory. It’s a place of joy, or should be. I grew up in a noisy, secular Jewish family and we were at our noisiest, the five of us, crowded around the table, fighting for attention. Making everybody else laugh was the goal. We communicated with each other through meals.There’s a serious point here. Somewhere along the line certain people have taken it upon themselves to pathologise not just what we eat but how we eat. Curiously, quite a number of them talk of their own histories of eating disorders, now vanquished. They give the impression that they think this trauma makes them more relatable, which it may well do. We can all sympathise. But does it qualify them to tell us that something that wasn’t broken for the vast majority of us needs fixing? We don’t need help and certainly not this kind of help. We don’t need silence at the table. Mindful eating needs to be put in a metaphorical burlap sack and drowned in the canal. And that’s something about which I refuse to shut up."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/995418d750a569081f5d374ae0d61b1f53521c59/0_149_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc7c12b5d3765d78c6bb2f4d27b68321","title":"share your experiences of heading footballs","story":"We would like to hear from parents, current and former football players of their experiences of heading the ball playing sportA proposed ban on children under 12 heading the ball in training is expected to be announced by the Scottish Football Association.The report by University of Glasgow researchers, released last October, found that ‘among former players, mortality with neurodegenerative disease listed as the primary or a contributory cause on the death certificate’.A similar ban has been in place in the US since 2015 but would become the first European country to impose such a restriction.Whether you are a parent of a child who plays football, play football yourself or are a former player, we would like to hear from you.

But a host of artists have recently focused their attention on the experiences of women in midlife, from Darcey Steinke’s Flash Count Diary to Susan P Matterns’ The Slow Moon Climbs.This new wave of attention is joined by photographer Elinor Carucci’s Midlife. In her introduction to the book, Kristen Roupenian writes that Carucci’s photographs invoke the “intense, exhausting self-monitoring that can feel like an inescapable part of owning a female body”.I met with Carucci in the kitchen of her lower Manhattan home, where so many of her photographs have been taken. We talked for more than two hours while her twin teenagers visited with friends in a room down the hall.Ann Neumann: What became very clear to me in menopause is how much of a woman’s value to society is determined by her appearance. Whatever currency my appearance once gave me, it was quickly changing, making room for other interests and concerns. There’s a kind of bravery to showing your true ageing body. Elinor Carucci: I don’t really see it as me being brave. I mean, I was the class clown because I wasn’t a good-looking teenager my nickname was Wall because I didn’t develop. I became really funny and I was always making fun of my body. People say the work is brave and I take the compliment but I feel it’s more like an attempt at connection.AN: But there’s also a lot of beauty in the photographs: you’re beautiful.EC: Thank you, Ann, thank you.AN: And I know that helps your career.EC: It does.AN: How do you think of your own beauty?EC: I am a feminist, but I still want to look beautiful. I still want to look younger. It’s not like you’re either a feminist who doesn’t care about the way you look, or you’re a stupid, shallow woman who does.AN: When I turned 50 last year, I realized that I was relieved of the effort to participate in all the behavior that surrounds reproduction, looking a particular kind of attractive. I was afraid of becoming invisible, but also relieved that it was approaching.EC: You really look so much younger than 50.AN: Thank you! But also think about that!EC: As a compliment that we give each other … I know. I’m thinking about it a lot, but still I had to say it.AN: Ha! And then I say: “Thank you!”EC: We all want to look beautiful and there’s a reason for it. What has to change really is the opportunities we’re given as women – professional, economic. But I will probably want to be beautiful for the rest of my life.AN: So the way we define beauty is culturally constructed.EC: Very much so.AN: Even the types of attention that women’s work and men’s work receive can be different. We receive publicity and recognition through different routes. Routes that don’t confer the same respect.EC: And don’t translate into the same amount of money. I’m sorry to talk about money.AN: No, money’s important! We’ve already talked about the attention we receive, the attention that our work is given … But what about the attention that we women give to things and how this changes?EC: I’m just speaking my mind more. I approach and talk to people more. I say to my kids: “I’m not crazy guys, I’m just reaching out to the world.” I have fewer years as I grow older. Just let me enjoy the world.AN: In the afterword to Midlife, you write that red is the color of an “angry loss” that you feel. “My blood looked the same,” despite all of the other losses: being reproductive, being needed as a mother, being attractive, being visible, being relevant. “I am unnecessary, I am a woman without a uterus.” I felt this loss too. What recourse do we have as ageing women? Is the only corrective to thinking that our lives are less valuable now to say: “No they’re not.” I’m vital, I’m doing important work?AN: I loved that about your book because it’s about these eras within our lives and how we move through them and we embody these different roles. And embodiment means so much to me as someone who writes about death and dying, to see people at the end of their lives doing this measure of who they are, and what they are, and what it all means.EC: What does it all mean, then?AN: What do I think is the meaning of life?EC: What do you feel from them at the end of their lives?AN: Oh, everything! Every emotion, so much regret, so much anger, so much love and concern and fear. Often great calmness. I think about this a lot. It’s changed me to do hospice work, to write about the dying. First of all, I think I make better decisions.EC: Because you know that you can’t afford to lose time?AN: Because the unimportant things are very much clearer now. When you see someone on their deathbed and they wish they hadn’t worked so much, they wish they hadn’t let those bad relationships fester, they wish they’d made peace with their estranged siblings, they wish they hadn’t cared so much about what people thought of them, they wish they had just tried the crazy things.EC: The hysterectomy did some of that to me. It did have some of those effects on me.AN: Whenever we’re talking about life and the beginning of life and the making of life – motherhood, essentially – we’re talking about death. We’re talking about mortality, and that has very much been brought home to me in my work. The conversations that we have about elder care and death care parallel ideas about conception or the origin of life. The two always come together.I saw my sister give birth to my nephew and I suddenly thought about my own life and time differently. It shocked me, the birth. It’s brutal and beautiful and emotionally profound: the shit, the pain, the blood, the gorgeous new life.EC: The smell. The smell!AN: Very primal. Like a death."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/612650666facab7182722f84dc82f8f4aa58003d/0_194_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16dfa16e20635af3ef17e4a7f3a02684","title":"why did former nissan boss carlos ghosn choose a life on the run podcast","story":"The former CEO of Nissan, Carlos Ghosn, was once one of Japan’s most respected business people.

Instead, the European parliament president, David Sassoli, will preside over a low-key ceremony with British MEPs on the evening of 29 January, shortly after the entire parliament votes on the Brexit withdrawal agreement.All 73 British MEPs are invited and the heads of British political party delegations will be invited to say a few words. The MEPs are not expected to get the customary medal, handed out to departing members at the end of each legislature.The Brexit party had lobbied for a flag-lowering ceremony that evoked for them the last days of the British empire. “They don’t need to do it as a big formal ceremony, they don’t need drums or whatever, but they need to bring the flag down because we are not full members,” one of its MEPs, Nathan Gill, told the  earlier this week. “It’s like that India moment, isn’t it, or Hong Kong. You know that’s the lasting image.”The MEP for Wales, who plans to be in Brussels rather than attend Nigel Farage’s Brexit singalong at Westminster, said lowering the flag would be a symbolic moment. “That is going to be the actual point that everyone in Britain and Europe accepts the fact that we are gone.”But parliament officials were reluctant to create this scene, a decision rubber-stamped by senior MEPs at a meeting on Thursday without discussion.The European parliament is also shaking up its UK work, as talks shift from the orce to the future trade relationship.The Brexit steering committee, led by the former Belgian prime minister Guy Verhofstadt, will be disbanded. A UK coordination group will be set up to keep 705 MEPs in line in negotiations over the most wide-ranging deal the EU will have ever negotiated with a foreign country.One prominent member of the committee will be Nathalie Loiseau, a close ally of Emmanuel Macron, who leads the parliament’s sub-committee on security and defence. Joining her will be David McAllister, the German centre-right MEP with Scottish roots, who leads the parliament’s foreign affairs committee, as well as Bernd Lange, the German social democrat head of the international trade committee.Earlier this week British MEPs were given the deadlines for clearing their offices, terminating staff contracts and returning equipment, such as EU passes, keys and iPads. Many British MEPs are not entitled to the European parliament’s redundancy payment, as they have served for less than a year. “People were upset,” said one source, who described the meeting as “bumpy”.The departure of British MEPs will see the parliament reduced to 705 MEPs from 751 seats, with 27 British seats redistributed to 14 other countries currently under-represented in Brussels and Strasbourg."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a3283f2241793bd3428054a9d05ddb646058324/219_573_567_340/master/567.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16eabf46b470411c30973e4c2cc6fc81","title":"sweat and the city londons best running routes","story":"Jog through the history, skyscrapers and wilder corners of the capital for the perfect combination of urban adventure and natural beautyThe beauty of leading a running community like Fly Girl Collective is the chance to turn London into our playground – whether we’re sprinting around picturesque gardens south of the river, or ambling happily past a buzzy cafe in the east before returning later for brunch. We always discover somewhere new, because if there’s anything Londoners can bank on in this mighty city, it’s plenty of wonderful places and trails to run – all offering an assortment of terrain, from knobbly hills to the smoothest footpaths.Ready? Get set, go ...Richmond ParkThe chance to watch deer roaming free is the usual draw of Richmond Park – a certified national nature reserve. Covering almost 1,000 hectares (2,500 acres), it is the largest royal park in London and feels like you’re stepping into a whole new world, especially if you hit the Tamsin Trail. At just over 7 miles (11 km), this well-trodden, gravelly path offers the kind of adventurous landscape that’ll convert even the most committed urban runner to the trail life. You get to enter the wild through woods and fields, and up a few moderate ascents.There are cafes and water fountains along the way if you’re using this as a long run and need a breather – or ert into the park’s woodland garden Isabella Plantation so you can stop and smell the flowers.South Bank and Victoria Embankment loopThis swift jaunt around the Thames reminds me why I call London home. I like to time a run early enough to avoid the tourists, who love the South Bank in particular. For a 5K loop, start at Blackfriars station, run south over the bridge, take a right on Upper Ground, then take another a quick right on to Marigold Alley. You’ll hit the riverside, so turn left to follow the Thames and you’ll get to tread along a flat path as you fly past Oxo Tower, the National Theatre and the surprisingly sandy beaches you can spot at low tide near the Royal Festival Hall. You’ll also catch the bright lights of the London Eye, before climbing the steps on to Westminster Bridge. Turn right under Big Ben so you are now going eastwards on the north bank of the Thames along Victoria Embankment. Stay on the riverside pavement, so you don’t have to stop to cross roads and you can enjoy the great views of the Thames and the City beyond. Check out Cleopatra’s Needle and – on the left – Somerset House, before crossing over the road at Temple station. Continue along the Embankment before finishing up at the peaceful Middle Temple Gardens.Hampstead HeathSimilar to Richmond Park, Hampstead Heath is a leafy, countryside-esque destination that offers escapism from the bustle of the city – but it’s especially my go-to when I’m in the mood to tackle some ruthless hills or to get a bit muddy on the heath’s countless trails. For an obstacle-filled adventure, I like to start from Hampstead Heath overground station, and venture into the heath from South End Road. Follow the path and you’ll soon spot Hampstead No 1 and No 2 ponds – in the summer, you might even be tempted to have a dip. Keep going until you see the path that runs between the No 2 pond and the mixed bathing pond the terrain will become wilder as you start to make the taxing ascent to Parliament Hill. Catch your breath as you take in an impressive view of the capital – you should be able to make out the Gherkin, the Shard and St Pauls Cathedral in the distance. I might do a few hill reps here, then seek out the stunning Hill Garden and Pergola, a hidden gem on the west side of the heath.Victoria ParkLike many runners in east London, I’m a massive fan of Victoria Park. From its vast fields and leafy avenues to the top-notch cafes and restored bandstand, Bonner Bridge, the Burdett Coutts fountain and new play areas, London’s oldest park is still going strong. The terrain’s also nice and flat, which makes knocking out a speedy run such a pleasure. Made up of two parts split by Grove Road, a full lap of the park covers just over 4km (2.7 miles) – but if you have more in your legs, slip on to the Hertford Union canal for eclectic scenes of street art and houseboats as you make your way towards the Lee Navigation. For another change of scenery, you can peel off towards the Olympic Park en route for a calisthenics gym and art installations commemorating the legacy of the 2012 Olympics.Tower Bridge to Islands Gardens via the Thames PathThe London leg of the Thames Path, a pleasant national trail that follows the river, is 79.5 miles (128km) that’s usually tackled in four sections either north or south of the water. Though the entire route is a beaut, the 5-mile (8km) passage from Tower Bridge to Island Gardens is particularly fascinating. The first time I ran along it, I was riveted by how it unveiled the capital’s Victorian past. You’ll head through St Katherine’s Dock and Wapping along cobbled lanes, fly past Execution Dock where pirates were once hung, and be tempted to swing by the Prospect of Whitby pub, once frequented by Charles Dickens. From here, you’ll soon notice how the capital has evolved as you make your way through Limehouse, the glass and steel of Canary Wharf and eventually Island Gardens, where the multi-surface path officially ends.Crystal Palace ParkThe ladies from the Fly Girl Collective ran their first ever race here, so it’ll always be remembered as “very, very hard” – but in a good way. The mixed, hilly terrain of this south-east London park is one of the reasons why it’s a big hit with trail-loving runners. It’s got everything – cheeky hills, grassy and stony paths, and muddy puddles after the rain. Another draw, of course, is the Grade I-listed Dinosaur Court – a quirky collection of more than 30 dinosaur sculptures that have resided in the park since 1854. To see them in all their glory, enter the park from Thicket Road entrance on the south side and do a half a mile (0.8km) loop around Lower Lake. Then, explore the rest of the park by taking the 2.5-mile (4km) circuit around its periphery, taking on some challenging hills, or seek out the infamous Crystal Palace Park maze for a fun ersion before heading back south past the athletic stadium, to swing by the park’s charming urban farm – the goats are particularly curious about passing runners.The Fresh Foam X Hierro v5 is designed to go the distance.

While scorpions are known to be one of the first animals to have become fully land-dwelling, experts say the two new fossils add to a growing debate about when animals made the shift.The scorpion, which is about 2.5cm in length, is thought to have lived about 437m years ago, with the fossils discovered in a quarry north of state highway 164 in Wisconsin in the 1980s.The earliest arachnid yet discovered, the creature has been named Parioscorpio venator, meaning ancestral scorpion and hunter. The creature, like modern scorpions, had two large claws and a tail with a sting at its end.But the team behind the discovery say it is the scorpion’s internal structure that is most exciting.“This scorpion had the respiratory structures that indicate it was able to live on land. It is the earliest evidence we have that an animal could do this,” said Dr Andrew J Wendruff, a palaeontologist at Otterbein University, Ohio, and co-author of the research.These structures include evidence of pulmo-pericardial sinuses that, in modern scorpions, connect the animal’s respiratory organs with its circulatory system.Wendruff added that such structures, as well as other features of the animal’s cardiovascular system, suggested the ancient animal was, like modern scorpions, able to breathe air. The team say the features are also similar to those seen in horseshoe crabs, which live in shallow coastal waters but can venture on to land for brief spells.“The fossil was found in a shallow water setting and so it is likely this animal lived in both environments,” said Wendruff, although he said the team cannot be sure it scuttled ashore.A move to terra firma would have offered advantages, said Wendruff.“Throughout all of Earth’s history there is a race to utilise resources that are not being used. Land – something we take majorly for granted – was barren by todays standards,” he said.The discovery, published in the the journal Scientific Reports, pushes back the date of the earliest known scorpion by up to three million years, with the previous record-holder a species discovered by a Victorian palaeontologist in the Pentland hills in Scotland.Dr Jason Dunlop, curator of arachnids and myriapods at the Museum of Natural History in Berlin, who was not involved in the latest research, said the preservation of some of the scorpion’s internal structures, such as the cardiovascular system, is unusual.“This is very rare in fossils of this age and suggests that in some aspects of their anatomy scorpions have hardly changed in almost 440m years,” he said.However he urged caution, noting the fossil did not show whether the scorpion had lungs or gills.“That would have been the key character, and so long as its missing I think we have to be cautious about saying whether or not it lived on land,” he said.Dr Jesus Lozano-Fernandez, a palaeobiologist at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology of Barcelona, said it was a matter of much debate whether the earliest scorpions were indeed aquatic – a theory the new discovery piled further doubt on, he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42b2ba44d76f401114fb40d361483900ec0cc8f3/31_25_4692_2817/master/4692.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ab644e0be20ef61af692e62aab3e67b","title":"how britain got the gambling bug","story":"The industry takes £14.4bn from UK punters every yearThe gambling industry has exploded over the past decade and now takes £14.4bn from UK punters every year – equal to more than £200 from every man, woman and child in the UK – with the online sector growing particularly fast.The sector’s major firms have been transformed into some of the most recognisable brands in the country and gambling is a vast business, despite mounting concern among politicians and campaigners, which has shown it is willing to fight hard to preserve its revenues."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d24dbd47e8a17c2eac031da483b447ff8bb8ad3/0_143_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=27026feb8adf6db07564649507be04c8","title":"share a pint or glass of wine to drink safely says expert","story":"Former government advisor David Nutt says alcohol is more damaging than harder drugsAlcohol is the leading cause of drug harm, outstripping even heroin and crack cocaine, according to former government adviser David Nutt.Prof Nutt, who was sacked as chair of the advisory committee on the misuse of drugs in October 2009 for his views, says studies he and colleagues have done in their independent group, Drug Science, consistently show that alcohol harm outstrips that of heroin and crack cocaine, tobacco, cannabis and ecstasy in the UK, Europe and Australia.Yet in the last decade, nothing has been done to mitigate alcohol’s effects on iniduals, families and society, said Nutt, who is launching a new edition of his book Drugs Without the Hot Air.He said the only safe way to drink is to take three straws to the pub and share a glass of wine with friends.“Alcohol doesn’t protect you,” he said. According to Nutt, the optimal dose is 5gm a day, which is about a third of a glass of wine or half a pint of light beer.Pubs do not serve 40ml measures of wine, he said, but he had a solution. “Order a pint or glass of wine and three straws and share it with two friends,” he said.Nutt argued that prohibition of drugs has frequently led to more dangerous substances arriving on the black market that kill more people, as far back as a ban on smoking opium, which led to addicts injecting heroin.“There’s never been a death in prison from cannabis, but last year there were over 60 deaths from spice,” he said. According to the former scientist, every prison now needs a team of paramedics on hand to deal with violence, seizures and heart attacks among those taking the drug.The government banned the first generation of synthetic cannabinoids, which had been developed for use in medicine and then the second generation, tested on animals. The third generation has never been tested, leading to a human experiment now taking place in prisons. The government wants to ban all chemicals that might look like synthetic cannabinoids, said Nutt, but it has been warned by pharmaceutical companies such as GlaxoSmithKline, which said it has an estimated 80,000 chemicals in its database that would become illegal.Nutt said the deadly rise of the opioid drug fentanyl was the result of an attempt by the United States to clamp down on street heroin by placing restrictions on the production of pharmaceutical heroin, believing if they capped production it would stop ersion.“So what did the black market do? It looked for alternatives,” he said. Fentanyl had been around for 30 years, but until then the black market had not worked out that it was 50 times as powerful as heroin and a third of the price to make. “So now the black market has moved into fentanyl,” he said. “Trying to stop people using heroin has led to this terrible monster of the fentanyls.”A newer form is carfentanil, which is even more deadly. Fentanyl is 50 times as potent as heroin, but carfentanil is 1,000 times as potent.Nutt also argues that the policy of banning psychoactive drugs like LSD and ecstasy has also put a block on research into their potential benefits as medicines in mental health conditions. “The only psychoactive substances allowed are alcohol, tobacco and caffeine – on the grounds of precedent, not harm,” he said.He also hit out at the “hysteria” over nitrous oxide, or laughing gas, which has an effect lasting just seconds and is much used to relieve childbirth pain. Yet the tabloids dubbed it “hippy crack”, with the result that the government has brought in a ban."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c015444f5d266c4f13cb170e86461f243ba94113/0_495_1955_1173/master/1955.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40818d56acf6fe469c80f26c3af895b8","title":"england coach lisa keightley twenty20 world cup final","story":"The new England Women’s head coach, Lisa Keightley, has challenged her players to reach the final of the ICC Twenty20 World Cup in Australia next month.The 48-year-old has replaced Mark Robinson and will not have long with the squad before she is thrust into the pressure of a major tournament.Her native Australia are hosts for the T20 World Cup, which gets under way on 21 February, and holders after they beat England in the West Indies in 2018. It was a disappointing end to the competition for Heather Knight’s side after they were all out for 105 in the final, but Keightley hopes they can match that and start to compete with Australia again after a 12-4 defeat in the multi-format Ashes series this summer.“I am planning to be in the final and I know the players are planning to be in the final,” she said. “As a coach you want to get your team as competitive and winning as many games as you can. I think Australia are really strong and in the Ashes they got on a roll and England lost key moments in the first two games.“If England had won those key moments it could have been slightly different. What I will be looking at is are the players doing their key strengths really well and are we converting? That is what we’ll need to do in the World Cup.“There will be key moments and in those moments are we really clear on what strategies and match-ups we’re going to do to give us the best chance to win those moments?”Keightley, who was the first woman to score a century at Lord’s in 1998, feels Australia are favourites to win on home turf. England will avoid them until at least the semi-finals after being placed in Group B and the former Perth Scorchers head coach knows momentum is key."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a64a31436966230bae10b9281eeb1b00893c68a9/0_493_4968_2980/master/4968.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d83b8bdfd13989a45cc54767ec53af0b","title":"england zac crawley south africa qualifies third test","story":"For Zak Crawley, after three hours and 23 minutes of hard graft in the searing Port Elizabeth heat, the disappointment at missing out on a maiden Test half-century was palpable.Yet his innings of 44 from 137 balls played a major part in helping England end the opening day of this third Test ahead of the game given the spin and variable bounce – illustrated by the Kagiso Rabada delivery that kept low to bowl the England captain, Joe Root – that this slow pitch has shown during the first 90 overs.As things stand, Crawley is his side’s top scorer even if Ollie Pope and Ben Stokes, respectively on 39 and 38 at stumps, look primed to overtake his total on the second day.“I think it was a very good day for us in the end. Popey and Stokesy played brilliantly to put us in a good position. If we can get in the late 300s that’s a very good score on this pitch. It’s only going to get worse from there and continue to spin quite a bit. Hopefully a few will go underground like Joe’s did and we can bowl last on it and bowl well.”For Crawley this series is an unexpected bonus given he is only in the team because of the freak ankle injury sustained by Rory Burns playing football on the eve of the second Test at Cape Town.In that match his scores of four and 25 were eclipsed by a stunning catch on the final evening off the bowling of Stokes – taken at the second attempt at third slip while on his backside – that captured South Africa’s ninth wicket of Anrich Nortje and hurried England to a thrilling series-levelling victory.Yet on the first day here Crawley, still just 21 and playing only his third Test, displayed the qualities to suggest he may have a long career ahead of him. With his first-class average of 30.28, the decision to pick the Kent batsman this winter was based more on a gut feeling from the national selector, Ed Smith, than on raw statistics.But his class, including a dismissive pull in the fifth over that dispatched a wide delivery from Vernon Philander to the boundary, was evident. Allied to that was the discipline, determination and patience that top-order batsmen require to prosper at the highest level.“It’s probably against my natural game, I’m quite a free-scorer usually,” the opener admitted. “If I had the choice I’d be a free-scorer but if you’re playing for England you’ve got to play the situation. I was more than happy to block a few out there today.”When Crawley finally fell six runs short of his fifty, clipping Nortje to leg gully, England had 100 on the board. Yet his dismissal was also a reminder that, for all his potential, the youngster is nowhere near the finished article just yet.He will need to convert such promising starts to ensure he remains in and around the Test team following this winter. The two Tests in Sri Lanka in March, a series Burns will miss, is likely to offer Crawley more chances before the English summer, even if the expected selection of the spin-specialist Keaton Jennings may offer him competition at the top of the order.Crawley, who made one in his only innings when debuting against New Zealand at Hamilton in November, said: “I’m definitely feeling more comfortable now. The first couple of games I was feeling very nervous and trying to find my way a bit. Now I feel I can trust my game a bit. If I can play well I know my game might be good enough for this level. I’ve got a little bit more belief in myself now.“I think I played well but it was very disappointing to get out the way I did. Once you get to 40 ideally you want to go on and get a big one. To score a hundred you need to be able to face 180-plus balls and so to face 130-140 I feel like that time at the crease has given me some confidence.“Hopefully that’s what I’ll do next time. But I thought I played quite nicely so I’ll take something from it.”Crawley’s family history suggests the ability to make the most of every opportunity may be in his DNA given his father, Terry, went from working as a carpet fitter in Bermondsey to forge such a successful career in the city he made the Sunday Times Rich List.If Zak can get anywhere close to emulating that rugs-to-riches story, he will prove extremely valuable to England over the coming years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f75b8b00c08e7c8a6eceee80a7e3464d148dd56/244_77_4571_2742/master/4571.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7bcb3cbdadfd91432deb5d36711b2ba5","title":"rugby league world cup prince harry hosts england men draw samoa","story":"A World Cup draw at Buckingham Palace was once unthinkable but Thursday’s event demonstrated rugby league’s potentialOrdinarily, the prospect of England facing Sonny Bill Williams in the opening game of the 2021 Rugby League World Cup would have been the biggest takeaway from the tournament draw on Thursday. However, bizarre circumstances meant all eyes were instead on the man tasked with drawing the balls from Pot One.Tournament organisers have promised the biggest and best World Cup in the sport’s history in October and November next year, and if the buzz surrounding the draw is even remotely matched during the tournament, they will almost certainly deliver on that promise. They will not, one suspects, have a backdrop quite as remarkable as this to build upon, though.The Rugby Football League’s patron, Prince Harry, had been pencilled in to conduct the draw weeks ago. It was seen as a major coup for the tournament then, but in light of the Duke of Sussex’s intention to step back from royal duties, the fact this was his first public engagement since that announcement handed rugby league a glorious opportunity for mainstream attention.“To have him there, front and centre in Buckingham Palace, was huge for the sport,” the RFL’s rugby director, Kevin Sinfield, said after the draw. “His involvement in our sport has been fantastic and he’s been engaging and enthusiastic.” With the RFL hopeful he will retain his patronage, this should not be the last time Harry’s profile is capitalised on before the World Cup.This was an odd day to experience first-hand. While Harry and the host broadcasters were at Buckingham Palace to conduct the draw – an event that, aesthetically speaking, looked fantastic – the rest of the dignitaries, media and big-wigs were housed 200 miles away in Manchester.The plush surroundings of the Lowry Theatre were certainly in keeping with the event, but with the tournament organisers told only a handful of VIPs could go to Buckingham Palace, it meant guests such as Rebecca Adlington were restricted to watching the draw unfold from a big screen at Salford Quays.Yet despite that, the day was well executed and there were certainly stories to digest across the men’s, women’s and wheelchair draws. Fans will watch with keen interest to see whether Williams opts for Samoa or New Zealand – a decision he is allowed to make under the international rugby league guidelines despite already playing for the Kiwis. If he opts for the former, it creates an intriguing subplot for the tournament opener in Newcastle.The overarching theme of the day, though, was one of rugby league breaking new ground. When names such as Jamaica and Greece were being drawn out, it was not too difficult to get excited about the global reach the tournament can provide for the game.England should have no problems qualifying from a group containing Samoa, France and the debuting Greeks, but their aspirations are set much higher than that. “The aim of the England Performance Unit is to win all three World Cups, and that hasn’t changed,” said Sinfield. Realistically, the semi-finals should be the first serious test for both the host nation and the other heavyweights if all goes to plan.With the world’s four best sides – England, Australia, New Zealand and Tonga – seeded into separate groups, it is difficult to imagine any other nation reaching the semi-finals. The best bet? Papua New Guinea, who beat Great Britain last autumn and were drawn in a mouthwatering group with Tonga, Wales and the Cook Islands. The holders, Australia, will play Fiji, Scotland and Italy, while New Zealand were drawn with Lebanon, Jamaica and Ireland.England versus Brazil in the opening game of the women’s tournament on 9 November could be a spectacle unlike anything seen in rugby league before, and there will be similar hopes for the wheelchair rugby, when the hosts take on Australia at London’s Copper Box Arena two days later. Whether the event itself will be able to cash in on a backdrop such as this again remains to be seen, but as Harry was drawing the balls on Thursday, it was important for the sport’s purists to perhaps take a step back and appreciate what was happening.If someone had suggested 20 years ago that a World Cup draw would be conducted by a royal at Buckingham Palace they would have been ridiculed. This day of firsts shows there is something to be excited about looking ahead."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46ac72397532a755b63412ea65a46c30fdc4bd83/0_0_2784_1671/master/2784.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7426f6a95b0943d59d3887f55d7f78e","title":"south africa england third test day one match report","story":"• England 224 for four at stumps on first day of third Test• Stokes unbeaten on 39 and Pope 38 not out overnightThis was a slow burner of a day – except for those spectators foolish enough to stay out of the shade as a fierce sun blazed out of a cloudless sky. The pitch was slow, the band was surprisingly slow to play their trademark “Stand By Me” and for much of the time the batting was slow, until Ollie Pope launched a mini-assault against the second new ball in front of an admiring Ben Stokes. Yet it would be foolish to conclude that in the 21st century it will stay as serene as this. Matches tend to accelerate on this ground. Despite a bland, innocuous-looking surface draws are now a rarity here.When the players left the field England, after winning the toss, were 224 for four and, oddly enough, both sides could feel content with their efforts. The batsmen had battled away but only the best of them, which included Pope, could score with any freedom. None of them could post a half-century but the unbeaten partnership of 76 between Pope and Stokes in the final 90 minutes gave England the edge.The South Africans were tenacious and on target. There was not much there for the pacemen. As anticipated Faf du Plessis reinforced his attack by replacing Dwaine Pretorius with another 30-year-old debutant, Dane Paterson, one of a quartet who perspired freely, mostly when bowling from the Pavilion End. Keshav Maharaj, the left-arm spinner, delivered 30 consecutive overs from the Duckpool End, finding occasional, slow turn along the way. He allowed very few liberties but the fact he bowled so many overs reflects this was no paceman’s paradise.So batting was hardly perilous but it was hard work for a new opening pair. They did not dominate the first session but they batted all the way through it, which was all that could be asked of them. This was the first time England openers had batted through all of the opening session of a Test since the Oval Test against India in 2011 when the two future knights, Alastair Cook and Andrew Strauss, were still in harness.Du Plessis opened with his slower pacemen, Vernon Philander and Paterson. Zak Crawley was given one freebie from Philander which he cut for four but there would not be many more of those. Our expectation of this embryonic opening pair is that Dom Sibley is a sticker but Crawley is no crawler. In fact Sibley proceeded more quickly in that morning session during which Du Plessis employed all five of his bowlers he had 30 to Crawley’s 20 at lunch. Even so England’s first Zak was learning fast about the peculiar rigours of Test cricket with every over he survived.After lunch both of them perished from shots off the face of their bats that were caught just behind square on the leg side, another indication of the nature of this pitch the odd outside edge was not carrying to the slip cordon. Sibley clipped a rising delivery from Kagiso Rabada off his hip towards a crowded leg-side field and Dean Elgar held a sharp chance.That brought Joe Denly to the crease and the Kent pair ground away in a manner unfamiliar to regulars at Canterbury until Crawley flicked a full-length delivery from Anrich Nortje to the leg side and this time it was a ing Rassie van der Dussen who clung on to the catch. Crawley’s 44 is his best yet for England even though this innings lacked his usual fluency.At tea England had mustered 117 for two from 58 overs – cricket for the connoisseur is the standard euphemism. The pace and intrigue of the game increased in the final session. First there was the unusual dismissal of Denly. He went back to the persevering Maharaj and the ball dribbled to extra cover obviously it had hit the bat but there was a half-hearted appeal. Had it hit the pad first? The South Africans wisely reviewed and discovered this was indeed the case and the batsman was lbw.So there was more exasperation for Denly, who had batted 100 balls for his 25. He has now made it to double figures 21 times in his 24 visits to the crease in Test cricket. This puts him in second place in a quirky list of batsmen with the highest percentage of double-figure scores among those who have played 20 Test innings (yes, the TMS scorer, Andrew Samson, has graced us with his presence for the first time in the series). The West Indian Charlie Davis is at the top of this list and after Denly comes Colin Bland, Marnus Labuschagne, Shimron Hetmyer and Jack Hobbs, a contrasting top six.Rabada then produced the most spectacular moment of the day when bowling to Joe Root, who had been the most proactive of the English batsmen, especially against Maharaj. In he sped, Root was lodged on the crease and late on the ball which crashed into his off-stump. Rabada roared in celebration a few feet from Root, who was about to begin his gloomy trek back tothe pavilion.England were faltering at 148 for four but Stokes and Pope stayed firm. Early on Stokes had a few trials against Maharaj but then he batted with easy discretion. Pope was rock-solid as well but the panache with which he struck three fours in Nortje’s first over with the new ball enhanced English expectations of what might happen when play resumes on Friday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4658d94bb11d7ae36ff1d4131b72928d1680ece/85_0_6494_3898/master/6494.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e0cacad943db231c0657dc202a0178e","title":"a dogs tale poppy hollman musical crufts","story":"A Dog’s Tale, written by cat-loving playwright Poppy Hollman, tells the story of a British institution and has a caninefeline rap battleTom Hooper’s extravagant blockbuster may have given cats all the attention but a lovably scruffy new stage musical puts their canine rivals in the spotlight. A Dog’s Tale, written by Poppy Hollman, is a story of terrors and terriers, charting the frayed nerves and fierce competition at Crufts. Hollman’s play, which will tour the UK, explores the famous dog spectacular’s origins in the Victorian era, with the ambitious Charles Cruft – who masterminded the first event in 1891 – emerging as a PT Barnum figure. It is not so much the Greatest Showman, perhaps, as the Best-in-Showman.Hollman says her “guilty secret” about the comedy, which is her first professional commission, is that she shares her family home not with dogs but cats. (Two ginger toms, one fussy and one greedy, who tend to sleep on her laptop.) But she adds that Cruft himself “always dodged the question about what dog breed he had. After he died, his wife said, ‘We had cats!’”Being a cat lover gave Hollman an outsider’s view on her two-day research trip to Crufts last year, she says. “I sat next to the breed rings, seeing all these madly different-looking dogs and secretly chatting to people, asking their opinions and listening to them bitching about who was going to win. It’s such a hilarious place, ripe for comedy, but also a really inclusive and welcoming environment with a massive spectrum of society.” After all, a quarter of the UK adult population have a dog.One of the play’s main themes is class: a Kennel Club snob calls Cruft “a jumped-up salesman. A Man with no – ahem – pedigree.” Cruft’s father was a jeweller but, as a teenager, Charles decided against a career in the family business. He began selling “dog cakes” for James Spratt’s pet food company before founding his competition. In one of Hollman’s rousing songs, entitled Be More Dog, Cruft sings: “Though you may be a mutt  When your dreams are bigger than others’  Who cares that you are not a pedigree?” Cruft, says the playwright, had a mission to take dog shows “away from the aristocrats” and open them up for all audiences. “Charging only a penny to enter was key to it becoming as huge as it is, even if it’s now owned by the Kennel Club, who were initially his rivals in the world of dog shows.”Before becoming a playwright, Hollman was head of touring exhibitions at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. She applied for Mikron theatre company’s “new writers” scheme in 2018 and was assigned the brief of writing about Crufts. Mikron specialise in what she calls “fondly irreverent” plays that explore British institutions and “gently probe” at social issues – “They’ve done the Women’s Institute, allotments, the Wrens, Butlin’s.”Hollman’s musical – composed by Rebekah Hughes – lightly touches on a range of canine welfare issues, including puppy farming and over-breeding. One of the characters is an animal rights campaigner. “It’s important to point out that there are people who fundamentally disagree with what they’d call a dog beauty pageant,” she says. “There will be people in the audience on both sides of this argument, and it’s not for me to make the judgment. They should make their own minds up.”The character list for the play includes humans and dogs, and Hollman suggests that the actors could carry “those stiff ‘invisible dog’ leads, which were used in music hall”. Actors are also called upon to mimic the voices of their invisible dogs. The tale’s canine hero, Gary the rescue dog, disgraces himself on his first entrance by humping an audience member’s handbag and relieving himself. The showstopper in the script presents a Hamilton-esque rap battle between a cat and a dog, with the moggy declaring: “Yo, I’m a feline, I’m feeling superior  You walk towards me, I show my posterior.”One line in this celebration of our canine companions claims that doggedness is good for you and it has certainly worked for Mikron, who have staged more than 60 original shows since the company was founded in 1972. They tour the UK on a narrowboat in the summer and go by road in spring and autumn, their venues including allotments, care homes, pubs and village halls. In such community settings, the company favour an upbeat performance style that Hollman says has to compete with “the noise of the bouncy castle”. A Dog’s Tale starts its tour at the Marsden Mechanics Hall in Huddersfield in May. The unconventional venues that Mikron visit means that some audiences will be able to bring along their own dogs, quite the rarity in theatre world. “How on earth are the dogs going to react?” she laughs. “It could be chaos!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2438f9b46c51c166ba0ae169a5ec5925dc1c401b/0_139_3849_2309/master/3849.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ffe05abe6b42051f3343c94a8bf7c158","title":"the strange tale of charlie chaplin and stan laurel review wiltons music hall london","story":"Wilton’s Music Hall, LondonA transatlantic voyage in 1910, with the silent stars onboard, is the basis of Told By An Idiot’s beguiling comedyCharlie Chaplin and Stan Laurel shared a boat from the UK to New York in 1910, as part of Fred Karno’s music hall troupe. Stan later understudied for Charlie – before they went their separate, and separately legendary, ways. Is that a “strange tale”? Not really – it’s just a scrap of biography, a fleeting association about which little is known. But in this silent comedy for the London international mime festival, Told By An Idiot mine it for beguiling oddity, as Chaplin, Laurel and Karno shuttle and pratfall around a transatlantic liner and episodes from their past and future vault into view like salmon from the sea.Occasionally, in a show with few spoken words and only a few more projected captions, the thread is hard to follow. But it remains a delight to submerge oneself in the wordless world Hunter and his company weave, powerfully summoning that moment when vaudeville and silent movies meet. On Ioana Curelea’s gimcrack multi-platform set – now a sea vessel, now backstage at the theatre – it opens strongly, with a madcap embarkation scene involving much business with Karno’s suitcase. (Is it heavy? Is it light?) Soon we flashback to Charlie’s childhood, a Victorian melodrama of threatening bailiffs, drunken dads and woebegone (also drunken) mums. Mum is played by Sara Alexander, who underscores and interacts with the action on piano (music by Zoe Rahman) – later recruiting audience assistance when she’s needed on stage.In the spirit of the performers it depicts, this Strange Tale isn’t shy of addressing its audience – albeit without words. One lovely interlude finds Amalia Vitale’s Chaplin distracted by an audience member, who – after a demure flirtation – she then invites on stage for a swim. It’s pulled off with such gentle grace by Vitale, who brings Chaplin – that odd rolling walk the knowingly innocent expression – to uncanny life. She performs with a featherlight touch the various tumbles, scrambles and slaps to the face required – in which the hand is conspicuously that of the great Jos Houben as “physical comedy consultant”.Jerone Marsh-Reid is a similarly endearing presence as Laurel, whose gangly physicality contrasts nicely with the pocket-sized Chaplin, on whom he dotes. But wide-eyed naivety is the only expression we see him wear – and his stories aren’t given prominence. He’s in danger of being upstaged by Nick Haverson’s Oliver Hardy, reanimated in a wonderful transformation scene, as Haverson shoves a pillow up his shirt and affixes a duct-tape moustache – before his fingers start twiddling, Hardy-like, on his chest.In a range of manic, well-defined cameos – from cigar-chewing Karno to Charlie’s raucous dad – Haverson makes Stan and Charlie’s world feel vividly alive. It may not always be clear why certain episodes – “The Death of Ollie”, say, or “The Birth of Charlie” – have been chosen for inclusion. But, taken sketch by sketch, this fantasia on Chaplin and Laurel – all at sea, but on the precipice of superstardom – is seldom less than magical."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ff0a1cc151d0406901b855e58d68de365603bcf/470_475_3968_2381/master/3968.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81cced589714d6d03adac026a2c6ec45","title":"google nest mini review bass sound smart speaker","story":"Upgrade keeps what is good and improves sound for Google’s smallest, cheapest smart speakerThe second generation of Google’s smallest smart speaker gets a new name, more eco-friendly, a little smarter and more bass.The £49 Nest Mini replaces the Google Home Mini as part of a revamped and renamed line of Google smart home products under the Nest brand, pushing its predecessor to a clearance price of only £19.From the outside you would be hard pushed to see what has changed. The Nest Mini sticks with the same pincushion design with a fabric top and nonslip rubber pad on the bottom.The top contains three far-field microphones and is touch sensitive. If music is playing, approaching the top with a hand lights up the LEDs to show you the volume and where to tap using ultrasound presence sensing.Tapping on the left or right edge adjusts the volume, while tapping on the four central LEDs pauses or plays the music.There is a mic mute switch on the bottom as well as a new hole for mounting the Nest Mini on a wall.The Nest Mini also has a new faster machine learning chip built into it, which is part of Google’s push to do more natural language processing locally for better speed and privacy. It also has a new wake word engine, which is designed to prevent accidental activation of Google Assistant while still enabling it to hear you from across the room.I certainly noticed a reduction of accidental activations in a similar to that of the recently launched Google Nest Hub Max smart display. The less smart speakers are activated the less chance that they inadvertently capture speech you’d rather they didn’t.Google has also upgraded the speaker, which it says produces twice as powerful bass. It certainly has a bit more punch in the low end and a more rounded sound than the Home Mini.Vocals are clear, Google Assistant sounds great and details only start to get lost a little bit at maximum volume.It is still a small speaker and cannot quite produce real, room-filling sound but it is pretty good for what it is – I enjoyed listening to it more than I anticipated.Google Assistant natively supports music playback from Spotify, YouTube Music, Google Play Music, Deezer, BBC and other radio stations in the UK. You can also either Chromecast to the Nest Mini or use it as a Bluetooth speaker, both of which worked well from Android devices and iPhones.Google’s voice assistant continues to lead the pack in terms of natural language understanding and capability.Teach it your voice and it can distinguish between users, giving personalised results pulling from information in your Google account such as your calendar.It will answer most questions, set timers and everything else you would expect from a voice assistant in 2020, including controlling most common smart home devices such as lights.Google recently rolled out a male voice for Assistant in the UK, allowing users to switch it over from the default female voice on a per-account basis. The UK still lags behind the US, however, in its choice of voices.The Google Nest Mini costs £49 and is available in four colours: chalk, charcoal, coral and sky. It is also frequently discounted to £34 or less.The Google Nest Mini is a future-proofing update rather than a radical change. Sure, it sounds a little better, the controls are improved and the wall-mount is nice.But it is the improved machine learning chip within it that is the real upgrade – and one that is likely to be of larger benefit as we shift more and more of processing of our voices to local devices rather than Google’s servers. It is faster and better for privacy.So the Nest Mini continues to be an excellent little smart speaker that gives the dominant Amazon Echo Dot a very good run for its money.Just do not buy it at full price, given it is likely to be frequently and heavily discounted as with its predecessor.Pros: good sound for the money, wall mount, made of recycled plastic, Google Assistant, Bluetooth 5.0, native BBC radio playbackCons: No 3.5mm input, privacy concerns of a smart speaker, not quite room-filling sound This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

It found that 16 of the top 100 videos on the first term contained misinformation, as did eight of the videos found under “climate change” and 21 of those under “climate manipulation”.“YouTube has previously taken welcome steps to protect its users from anti-vaccine and conspiracy theories,” Avaaz argued, “but has not acted with equal force against broader misinformation and disinformation content, including climate misinformation.”The group called on YouTube to implement new policies to prevent the further spread of climate misinformation on its platform. It said the site should:In a statement, YouTube said Avaaz’s report had its own transparency problems. “We can’t speak to Avaaz’s methodology or results, and our recommendations systems are not designed to filter or demote videos or channels based on specific perspectives. YouTube has strict ad policies that govern where ads are allowed to appear and we give advertisers tools to opt out of content that doesn’t align with their brand. We’ve also significantly invested in reducing recommendations of borderline content and harmful misinformation, and raising up authoritative voices on YouTube.A L’Oréal spokeswoman said: “The information promoted by these videos is in direct contradiction with L’Oréal’s commitments and the work we have been carrying out for many years to protect the environment. We are collaborating with YouTube teams asking them to use all the technological means at their disposal to better inform the platform’s users about the nature of these videos and to limit their impact.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74e83d0369fc6beeefdebbcc5eea193175340d1a/0_28_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c7f70b2aa9608bccd7bf7e9e4aaaee1","title":"from vegan sausage rolls to smart tech what britons bought in 2019","story":"Lifestyle and consumer trends experts reveal what we’ve been buying – and what it says about us as a nationSome of 2019’s most popular buys tell the story of a Britain that is actively looking to spend more time at home, achieve a better work-life balance, and take steps to be more environmentally friendly.Though evidence suggests that households have cut back on big purchases such as holidays and cars this year, Jack Duckett, associate director of consumer lifestyles research at Mintel, says research for their British lifestyles 2019 report found respondents were feeling confident about their finances on the whole. “From a consumer perspective, unemployment levels are really low in the UK and real wage growth continues to be positive,” he says.“When we asked people to look at their finances, they’re saying: ‘Actually, I’m fine. I’m in a relatively good situation and I’m not going to seize up my spending.’”So what have we been spending money on in 2019? This year, the Office for National Statistics added smart speakers, baking trays, dog treats and electric toothbrushes to the virtual shopping basket it uses to calculate the country’s annual inflation rate, making our changing shopping norms clear as day. And there are more consumer trends that refect our changing world …Vegan sausage rollsWhen vegan sausage rolls hit the high street in January, they caused something of a stir, with bakeries struggling to keep up with demand. Their success influenced supermarkets, many of whom expanded their vegan ranges. Shoppers say they’ve adopted this lifestyle in the past five years, primarily because of animal welfare concerns, health reasons and because they want to be more mindful about the environment.Hannah Elderfield, senior behavioural analyst at the consumer behavioural specialist Canvas8, says it’s part of an evolution of beauty as a sector that combines notions of self-care, wellness and health into one. “People are now looking for beauty products that boost their emotional state, rather than just buff out so-called imperfections – it’s about feeling happier, empowered and more confident,” she says. “Part of this shift is due to a rising desire for products that align more closely with people’s values. In 2019, environmental concerns and sustainability issues grew even higher on the agenda.”It’s part of a broader trend of shoppers who are investing more in their “off time” at home. Research from American Express found this extends to hobbies – 11 million adults having taken up a new one this year, with artistic interests such as painting, drawing and creative writing topping the list. The most common reason people gave for spending money on a new hobby (an average of £23.50 per month) was to find a better work-life balance. Experiences as a whole have remained a strong category in 2019 when it comes to consumer spending, whether that’s at home or elsewhere, says Duckett.“We’ve got so much stuff and no place to put it,” he says. “This has filtered down to us thinking: what else can I spend my money on that I can get more value out of. People will look for experiences in leisure, entertainment and holidays.”American Express Services Europe Limited has its registered office at Belgrave House, 76 Buckingham Palace Road, London, SW1W 9AX, UK.

I care because it’s my future.”Many young millennials and Generation Z are passionate about tackling the climate crisis, research shows. They also want to work at organisations that have a strong commitment to sustainability.Across the UK, young people like Dharni are working to create a healthier planet. For example, Sadie DeCoste, 23, is an analyst at E Co, a London-based consultancy, which works on low-carbon, climate-resilient projects. DeCoste says she’s always been interested in sustainability. “I’ve been really passionate about it since high school,” she says. “I find it meaningful and interesting.”Dharni and DeCoste both point out that young people have grown up in the internet age, seeing the impact of the climate crisis around them. “People our age care because we’re more educated on the subject,” DeCoste says. A recent report warned that 100 million more people could be driven into poverty by climate change impacts on natural disasters and agriculture by 2030 unless precautions are taken now.For this reason, many young people want to make a difference through their work. “If you’re going to spend such a big part of your life working, why wouldn’t you try to maximise your impact?” DeCoste says.McConnochie believes there’s only so much he can do as an inidual and wants to achieve more than that. “I’m a realist, I believe that as an inidual there’s only so much of an effect you can have. So taking up this role has allowed me to have the most influence outside of my personal actions. I’m able to work with some of the biggest housing associations and to start seeing some real significant change within them.”Other young people are founding their own companies or working at startups that offer alternative ways of doing things. Anna Lopez-Fujimaki, 22, works at Olio, a startup that connects neighbours with each other and with local businesses so surplus food can be shared, rather than thrown away. “I started at Olio in April and it’s been a wild ride,” she says. “I’m having my mind stretched by all these problems and solutions. I’ve been so busy – it keeps you on your toes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a05566f48a9b0e7f95e3ef0830caeba1a2e9c230/8_0_3375_2025/master/3375.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79d2cd14982d2a5f80f5657dbb5b71d6","title":"cheer netflix breathtaking bone crunching nerve racking magic","story":"Netflix’s cheerleading documentary is cracking TV. If you haven’t already front-flipped your way through the whole perfect series, do so nowIf you’re yet to watch Cheer, Netflix’s new cheerleading documentary, chances are it’s down to the subject matter. You might not understand cheerleading, or it might seem too positive for your curdled British mindset, or you might simply think you have no interest in it whatsoever. But let me tell you you are making a mistake. Cheer was created by Greg Whiteley, and that alone should be enough to make you watch.I understand your position perfectly. Whiteley’s last series was Last Chance U, which I had no intention of watching until I was forced to. “It’s about American football,” my editor told me. “You’ll love it.” I disagreed sight unseen, on the basis that I had never watched American football and didn’t follow or even understand American football.And yet Last Chance U is a flat-out masterpiece. It’s about American football, but it isn’t about American football. It’s about young people from troubled backgrounds trying to put their pasts behind them to achieve something incredible. When it works, it’s thrilling. When it doesn’t work – and it often doesn’t – it’s like watching a Shakespearean tragedy. All four seasons have been tremendous.But what’s becoming apparent now is that it was no fluke. Cheer replicates – even improves upon – the thrill of Last Chance U. It’s perfect. We’re 16 days into January, and it’s impossible to imagine that anyone else will make a documentary series as good this year.Rather than rah-rahing at the side of football matches, the subjects of Cheer take part in competitive cheerleading, which is arguably the most nerve-racking thing a person could ever watch. It’s a cross between high-level gymnastics and circus performing, with cheerleaders being flung metres into the air like rag dolls. Every time – every single time – they fell earthwards during the series, my sphincter clenched with fear. With good reason, because sometimes they land with a sickening crunch and end up horribly injured, but nevertheless that’s a lot of clenching.In time-honoured Last Chance U tradition, Cheer follows one high-ranking team – that of Navarro college in Texas – as they prepare for a nationwide competition. We see the agony of not being picked, the gruel of training, we learn the tragic backstories of some of the subjects and we become fully invested in the team as an entity.What Cheer lacks, arguably to its advantage, is the dark heart of Last Chance U. That show was underpinned by its two toxic head coaches, Buddy Stephens and Jason Brown. They were screaming, furious, too-masculine figures who tore about like a pair of sentient heart attacks destroying as much as they created. But Cheer’s head coach is Monica Aldama, who is a much more reassuring presence. Make no mistake, Aldama has a cruel streak – in one episode, she deliberately pushes a cheerleader to the brink of injury for defying her – but she proves time and time again that she isn’t like Stephens or Brown. She truly seems to care about the squad as people.This essential positivity bleeds through Cheer. Unlike many of the Last Chance U subjects, who have long since buried themselves under layers of machismo, the Cheer subjects are open and eloquent about their feelings. They pull together in times of trouble, and they’re ready to talk it out when things start to go south.Inevitably, they go south a lot. My pet theory about Whiteley documentaries is that, deep down, they’re all about parents. Last Chance U was about the moment you realise that a parental figure is mistreating you. Cheer is even more explicit. It seems like nobody at Navarro had a decent upbringing. Some have parents who are disinterested or out of their depth. Some are overbearing. Some are outright absent. All these people have broken families, and we watch as they discover that the cheer team represents an opportunity for them to build one of their own. It is an incredibly touching thing to witness.And, of course, it’s deliberate. Whiteley has an uncanny gift for knowing exactly when to drop a backstory into an episode to recalibrate our assumptions or explain a behavioural tic. He’s also able to structure the raw material of his footage into something that feels like a movie. When a catcher slips and a cheerleader smashes her head into the ground, we know objectively that it’s just a random accident. Whiteley’s gift is that he makes it seem inevitable, like it was always going to be a major plot point from the very beginning. I have no idea how he does it. It’s like a magic trick.So Last Chance U was no fluke. Cheer has proved that this is just the level Whiteley works at. If you haven’t seen Cheer, fix that immediately. If you have, you should wait with bated breath to see what Whiteley does next. I know that’s what I’ll be doing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3c1cfe6698fdbd12f7e92fa0e756aa04f5bd75f/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64511028530710a6ec99bba2afde3962","title":"sandi toksvig great british bake off contenders for new host","story":"As Sandi Toksvig bows out of Bake Off, here are all the presenters who could get her plum gigOnce again, things are going wrong for The Great British Bake Off. It only seems like yesterday that the show ditched BBC One for Channel 4, shedding its most beloved personnel in the process. And now things have taken a e once more. Sandi Toksvig, the woman brought in to shore up Bake Off in the absence of Mel and Sue, has announced that she too is leaving the series.In a statement, Toksvig said: “As my waistline will testify, Bake Off is an all-consuming show. Spending time with Prue, Paul and Noel has been one of the great pleasures of my life. These are friendships which I know will continue beyond the confines of television.” Which is nice and all, but it isn’t going to bring her back.With a new series of Bake Off set to air later this year, the clock is ticking to find her replacement. Who should it be?Even in its diminished capacity on Channel 4, Bake Off is still a plum job for a host to have. Imagine the joy of seeing, say, Claudia Winkleman step up to replace Sandi. Or Melanie Sykes, for that matter, who has been doing a terrific job on the basically identical Great Pottery Throw Down on More 4. If the channel want to keep things within its own stable, they could always pick Richard Ayoade – who has a long working history with Noel Fielding – or Davina McCall or Steph McGovern or Big Narstie. Jeremy Paxman dabbles with Channel 4 from time to time. Could this be a job for him?There is, of course, the opportunity for Bake Off to utilise its greatest asset, which is its army of former contestants. Perhaps Nadiya Hussain could bring some behind the scenes knowledge to the front of the show. Or Selasi Gbormittah. Could Rahul Mandal’s nerves hold up for long enough to keep him in front of camera? What about Candice, Tamal, Howard, Mary-Anne, or any of the others? If nothing else, they’d be much cheaper than a seasoned presenter.Remember back when the new Bake Off line-up was announced, and you saw that Noel Fielding was going to host, and you remembered the nothingy whimsy of Noel Fielding’s Luxury Comedy? Remember how appalled you were to learn that your beloved cake show was going to be presented by a man whose only contribution to culture was a kind of mindless burbling psychedelia? And then remember when you first saw Fielding presenting Bake Off? Remember how amazing he was? Remember how bad you felt for never noticing his perfectly judged sense of warmth and charm? Now ask yourself this: would it be the end of the world if Fielding presented The Great British Bake Off alone? Of course it wouldn’t. It would be excellent.The nuclear option for Bake Off, of course, would be to sack Fielding too and spend all the money on Earth to regain the services of the show’s original hosts Mel and Sue. It isn’t unthinkable that they would, nor is it unthinkable that Mel and Sue would accept. However, it is my opinion that this should not happen. Bake Off has moved on without Mel and Sue. True, the magic of the old days has started to fade, but not even Mel and Sue could revive it at this point. In this instance, we should probably let bygones be bygones."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e81efd96435facad1aa8ebdfd3b9146bcc6ba01/0_331_5505_3303/master/5505.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c92d58927c5bb6e5bed03735ad7f905","title":"senate north american trade deal usmca","story":"Trump is expected to sign the United States-Mexico-Canada pact (USMCA) next weekOne day after signing a new trade deal with China, Donald Trump received a second victory for his trade agenda as the Senate passed a new North American pact.As as lawmakers prepared to read aloud charges against Trump in his impeachment trial the Senate voted 89 to 10 pass the revised United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). Trump is expected to sign the deal next week.The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, described the pact as a major win for the Trump administration.Trump blamed the current trade pact with Canada and Mexico, the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), for sending millions of manufacturing jobs to low-wage plants south of the US border. His administration secured changes that aim to have more cars produced where workers earn an average of at least $16 an hour.It also secured changes that require Mexico to rewrite its laws to make it easier for workers to form independent unions, which should improve worker conditions and wages and reduce the incentive for US companies to relocate their plants.While the administration completed its negotiations with Canada and Mexico more than a year ago, Democrats in the House insisted on changes to the pact that they say make it more likely Mexico will follow through on its commitments. As part of those negotiations, the administration agreed to drop a provision that offered expensive biologic drugs made from living cells 10 years of protection from cheaper knockoff competition.Republicans and the president have complained about how long it took to complete the negotiations, but the talks resulted in a rare mix of support for USMCA. The AFL-CIO, an association of trade unions, endorsed the measure along with scores of business and farm groups.The biggest holdouts are environmental groups, which continue to oppose the measure because it doesn’t address climate change. Indeed, they contend the agreement would contribute to rising temperatures.Mary Lovely and Jeffrey Schott, economists at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the new deal “modestly” improved on its predecessor but remained problematic and was no guarantee of an end to trade wars.“Unfortunately, given a US president who sees tariffs as America’s main stick to ensure compliance with US demands, peace is not guaranteed,” they wrote.Senator Dick Durbin, a Democrat, marveled on Wednesday at how leaders of organized labor and farm groups in his state appeared together to support the pact.“They both agree that this USMCA trade agreement is a step forward, an improvement over the original Nafta,” Durbin said. “I think we’ve added to this process by making it truly bipartisan.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1094ffcc4666f5f0b7d787fe85e0cb6bbffca297/572_419_2727_1636/master/2727.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a2b07fc61753333b7dc5dfdd853ac941","title":"amsterdam green mayor reform red light district","story":"As an MP, Femke Halsema helped make prostitution legal in the Netherlands. So why does she now want to overhaul an area where sex workers famously ply their trade? The local football team, Ajax, had just won the championship, and as is traditional, the mayor of Amsterdam expected some abuse at the victory parade. “It is a Dutch tradition – it is usually just screaming and throwing cans of beer,”said Femke Halsema, the first woman to take the highest office in the Dutch capital.Halsema, 53, a former leader of the national Green party, though, faced a difference grade of barracking: shouts of “bitch” and “whore”, and a wall of middle fingers. “It was a moment when I was confronted by being a woman,” she said, laughing. “I think the last mayor wasn’t called a bitch.”If Halsema’s appointment by the left-led city council 18 months ago has discomfited some, it has not stood in the way of her quietly radical agenda, based on a philosophy that the longstanding Dutch tradition of tolerance could not mean turning a blind eye to the more pernicious consequences of letting the market rip.A central target of her reforms is Amsterdam’s infamous red-light district, the narrow streets that run around the city’s docks, where Dutch tolerance now risks looking more like indifference. “As Janis Joplin said, ‘Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose’,” Halsema said. “Well, that’s not the way we are going.”In recent months the mayor has asked the city’s inhabitants to at least allow themselves to consider the red-light district’s closure as the most radical option of a bundle of possible reforms. At the same time, she has defended her “edgy city” and the window brothels, insisting she will not make a “taboo of sexuality … or of a woman’s body”.It is part of a wider agenda seeking to distinguish between a laissez-faire approach and the notion of tolerating difference that includes plans to work with companies in the hope of opening the eyes of the Dutch middle classes to the consequences of their cocaine use, having admitted herself to once giving it a try.“They should know or realise that the young boy who comes and brings their pizza and their cocaine is in danger of getting into a drug environment that is very dangerous to him, that could get him killed,” she said. “I used it once – I grew up in the east of Holland and there was not much to do except smoke cannabis.”Halsema is also casting around for lessons from other cities to help solve some of Amsterdam’s most pressing problems: Barcelona on dealing with the potentially fracturing impact of tourism on neighbourhoods New York’s Brooklyn on gentrification and, after a tip from London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, during a visit to the UK, she has introduced a programme that has achieved success in Glasgow and Chicago in discouraging young men and women from being drawn into the grip of drug traffickers.But perhaps her initiative for the red-light district in Amsterdam best encapsulates her approach to dealing with the vastly changing nature of her city, where the population and economy is booming, in part due to Brexit relocations, but where seediness and criminality have also taken an unhealthy hold.Speaking in her City Hall office, Halsema said: “I am a progressive, a liberal. When I was a member of parliament ages ago, I was partly responsible for acknowledging prostitution as a legal profession in Holland.“And I am still in favour of accepting prostitution as a legal profession because I think the only way we can go to emancipate sex workers is to acknowledge that it is a market, there is supply and demand. But the red-light district has a sentimental flavour around it from the past – the idea of a sailor coming in and strong Dutch women telling him what he wants and doesn’t want.“But if you look at the actual situation in the red-light district, most women working there are foreign, in a very vulnerable legal status. And we do not know much about their backgrounds,” said Halsema.“The other big change is tourism. It is no longer an intimate district. If you walk through the very narrow streets, you see huge crowds of tourists standing in front of the windows photographing foreign women who are vulnerable and laughing at them.“As a woman, I cannot accept this kind of humiliation of women. I cannot accept it. It is against all women’s rights and against the idea that we want to empower sex workers.”The options include increasing the size of the district to deal with the overcrowding, to relocate some of the sex workers to a sex hotel, or to bring in turnstiles to force payment from those who want to walk on certain streets. As for closing the area down, she said: “I don’t think it is very realistic as it is also a very profitable district, so it would be very expensive to do that.”What she says is “non-negotiable” is that the women’s situation must be bettered, that those who live around the area are disturbed less and that criminality is not given an easy ride.“We call it brancheren – interfering with the economic branches of the city,” said Halsema. “In the last five or six years, the inner city has become an economic zone, while it is also cultural heritage. We need to rethink the main cultural significance of our inner city and what it means for the people who live in Amsterdam and Holland. We need to have the guts to interfere in the economic structures of the city. I think we are in time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe26fde4930f6c4076b43ff89e7df244d13e171c/0_27_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04a0c87f684f33e4eb1fe9fe334feac2","title":"greece first female president katerina sakellaropoulou kyriakos mitsotakis","story":"Katerina Sakellaropoulou nominated for top post as PM says ‘time has come for Greece to open up to the future’Greece is poised to get its first female president after the country’s centre-right leader Kyriakos Mitsotakis took the unprecedented step of proposing a progressive female judge to assume the role of head of state.In a move loaded with symbolism for a nation more used to the isiveness of bipartisan politics, the prime minister nominated 62-year-old Katerina Sakellaropoulou.“The time has come for Greece to open up to the future,” he said in an unexpected televised address, emphasising that the choice embodied unity and progress.The news of a cosmopolitan jurist being catapulted to the head of the republic caught many off guard – not least in Mitsotakis’ own New Democracy party. Her views have often run counter to the establishment.But less than 24 hours later, opposition parties, in a display of rare accord, also backed the proposal on Thursday. Former premier Alexis Tsipras, describing his decision as an “act of responsibility”, announced Syriza MPs will vote in favour in a parliamentary ballot on 22 January . The centre-left Kinal likewise expressed support, giving Sakellaropoulou’s election the blessing of at least 266 deputies in the 300-seat parliament. The five–round vote requires an overwhelming majority of 200 to pass initially.In style and background Greece’s new leader Kyriakos Mitsotakis could not be more different to his predecessor Alexis Tsipras.Born in 1968 into one of the country’s powerful political dynasties, his father Konstantinos Mitsotakis also held the office of prime minister. As Mitsotakis’ only son, Kyriakos seemed destined to go into politics too. After being educated at Greece’s elite Athens College, he was sent to Harvard University where he graduated with a degree in social studies in 1990.But after continuing his studies – earning an MA in international relations at Standford University and an MBA from Harvard\u0027s Business School - he took a different path. He went to London to work as a financial analyst with Chase Investment Bank, and then as a consultant with the business company McKinsey. It wasn’t until 2004, seven years after returning to Greece to continue his financial career, that he ventured into politics and ran for parliament.Like his father, Mitsotakis saw himself as a liberal centrist who cared about green issues and human rights. From 2013 to 2015 he served as minister for administrative reform in the coalition government headed by Antonis Samaras. During his tenure thousands of civil servants were laid off, igniting fierce criticism from political opponents.In January 2016, when the New Democracy party had been riven by Greece’s economic crisis, he decided to run for the leadership, but had little support and soon discovered his name was more of a hindrance than a help. He eventually won the post, but only after running what aides describe as a tough campaign. Once he assumed the leadership, his overhaul of New Democracy began, culminating with the party returning to power in 2019.The historic step would, analysts said, go some way to redressing Mitsotakis’ poor record of appointing women. Just five were given cabinet positions when his New Democracy party ousted Syriza in July, a decision for which the leader was broadly chastised both at home and abroad.“It’s inspired because he’s not only been heavily criticised for not having enough women in his cabinet but she is also very progressive,” said the prominent political commentator Pavlos Tzimas. “She belongs to a minority of judges in Greece who have always taken a courageous stance on civil rights whether that be voting against sexual discrimination, or in favour of refugee children or civil unions for same sex couples. There are many in his own party who will not be happy with this choice.”The French-educated judge broke the mould when she was elevated as the first woman to the helm of the country’s highest court in October 2018.Sakellaropoulou’s sensitivity to civil liberties, ecological issues and minority rights, prompted the then leftwing administration to propel her to the post. At a time when the climate emergency is becoming ever more apparent, aides close to Mitsotakis said her track record in protecting the environment, while also endorsing policies of growth, would be crucial as the country emerges from a period of political and economic crisis following its near brush with bankruptcy.Reacting to her nomination for the country’s highest office, Sakellaropoulou, who is orced and has one child, described it as “honouring both justice and the modern Greek woman. I accept the proposal and, if elected, will devote all my efforts to serving this high duty, as set out by the constitution”.Previously Tsipras had said he would support the re-appointment of incumbent president Prokopis Pavlopoulos, a professor of constitutional law, whose current five-year term expires in March.A veteran conservative, Pavlopoulos’ re-election would have been endorsed by many in New Democracy, a party of deeply-held traditional views.But signalling his determination to overhaul his own political group, Mitsotakis, 51, insisted that as an apolitical figure who was above party politics, Sakellaropoulou could reflect Greece’s “rebirth” as it gradually recovers from the debilitating drama of dealing solely with its debt."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63da2c6f07a7eb660906b9083541e4c6fe943484/0_80_3584_2150/master/3584.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9058caf315eef70615f8ac39b1062d0","title":"putin ministers were not told of resignation plans in advance","story":"Ministers were called into surprise meeting where they were told they would all be resigning from their jobsVladimir Putin’s plans to remake Russia’s government remained a secret kept by him and his inner circle until the very last moment, when ministers were called to a surprise meeting to be told they were all about to resign from their jobs.“It was total shock in the government,” said Konstantin Gaaze, a Moscow-based political analyst. “They didn’t know what was being prepared for them even as they were called for the meeting with the president and prime minister.”The sudden government reshuffle and planned amendments to the country’s constitution will help Putin secure a place in Russia’s government for himself after 2024, when his term ends as president.But the selection may help Putin secure another aim: managing a simmering conflict among the clans and interest groups surrounding him, including those in his inner circle, who are jockeying for influence as he plans his exit from the Kremlin in 2024.In the charged environment, taxman Mikhail Mishustin is a neutral choice for prime minister who leaves Putin’s options open for the future, said Yekaterina Schulmann, a Moscow-based political scientist.“This is a person whose appointment does not convey a political message,” said Schulmann, as opposed to others like Alexei Kudrin, a former minister of finance, who is seen as a liberal, or Nikolai Patrushev, the hawkish head of the security council. “It does not entail that he cannot become a successor. But it does not denote it either.”Vladimir Putin’s selection for Russia’s next prime minister is a loyal technocrat seen as a capable placeholder while the Russian president plans for his political succession.Mikhail Mishustin, 53, is the head of Russia’s tax service, credited with bringing digital tools to revolutionise the agency and help it crack down on tax evasion.His nomination came on Wednesday as Putin embarked on a sweeping reshuffle of the country’s leadership. Mishustin met Putin in the Kremlin where the Russian president “suggested to him that he take the post of the head of government” which he accepted, the Kremlin said.He will face a vote of approval in the Russian parliament within a week, which is almost certain to pass.Mishustin, a graduate of the Stankin Moscow State Technological University, has headed the tax service since being appointed by Putin in 2010, and also worked for the agency in the 1990s.He has also worked as the president of an investment company and as the head of a laboratory for a Moscow-based computer company.A recent profile of Mishustin in the Financial Times called him the “taxman of the future” and credited him with developing a real-time system “directed more at shopkeepers than oligarchs.”Mishustin is not thought to be among the likely candidates to be Putin’s eventual replacement, who have largely included powerful officials known to be longtime allies of the president, including city heads, members of his presidential administration, and even former bodyguards.Balancing those interests has become crucial with Putin entering the twilight of his presidency, and as the infighting has intensified. In a notable case in 2017, Igor Sechin, the head of the country’s oil giant Rosneft and a Kremlin hardliner, personally took part in a bribery sting against former economy minister Alexei Ulyukayev. Ulyukayev was sentenced to eight years in a prison colony, where he remains.Smaller-level conflicts have also emerged in Russia’s security services.“We’ve seen over the past year how conflicts have grown among the various security services and even within the FSB,” Evgeny Minchenko, a Moscow-based political analyst close to the government, said on the Echo of Moscow radio station. He described the balance of power as “complex”, with a number of interest groups.Influential figures include the defence secretary, Sergei Shoigu, the Duma head, Vyacheslav Volodin, Patrushev, the security council head, and the Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin.Sechin, the Rosneft chief and Sergei Chemezov, the Rostec CEO, are also regarded as bigger hitters.Boris Yeltsin sacks his cabinet and appoints Putin, a political neophyte who headed the main successor to the KGB, as his acting prime minister and heir apparent.Yeltsin stuns Russia and the world by using his traditional new year message to announce his resignation and hand his sweeping powers, including the nuclear suitcase, to Putin.Putin is prevented by the constitution from running for a third term as president. The First deputy prime minister Dmitry Medvedev is elected in his stead. One of his earliest moves is to appoint Putin as prime minister, leaving little doubt that the two men plan, at the very least, to run Russia in tandem.Informal advisers such as the the Putin-tied businessmen Yuri Kovalchuk, Arkady Rotenberg and Gennady Timchenko are “the heads of fairly powerful clans”, Minchenko said.“And not for the first time, in this model you have this Politburo and then a technical manager is brought in to be the head of the government,” he said, referring to Mishustin.Mishustin, who has headed Russia’s tax service for eight years, has a reputation as a loyal technocrat, an outsider whom some observers are not sure can position himself as an eventual successor.“Mishustin does not have any political experience or popularity with the electorate, and is not part of Putin’s inner circle,” wrote Tatiana Stanovaya, a Russian political scientist and the head of the R.Politik analysis firm. “It seems highly likely that Mishustin is just a technocratic placeholder.“It depends on a million circumstances,” said Andrei Kolesnikov, a political analyst and senior fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Centre. “He is the ideal pretender to fulfil the position of the digitised technocrat.”Unlikely prime ministers have had a tendency to stick around much longer than expected. Mikhail Fradkov, a former tax police official, was seen as an outsider when he was appointed by Putin in 2004, and stayed in office for three years. And Putin, of course, was seen as an unlikely choice when he was appointed prime minister by Yeltsin in 1999. Months later, he assumed power.For now, Russia must prepare for a national vote on Putin’s proposed amendments, not necessarily a referendum but a public display of support as Putin’s ambitions carry him beyond 2024.“It will be the biggest political show that Russia has ever seen,” Gaaze predicted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6300d104aa9a1a56c6da3d693f1cb2d555c3c3a9/557_22_5443_3266/master/5443.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1f07c2ff93c904e3431712de3f0d29e","title":"conga and carnival havanas jazz festival in pictures","story":"New Orleans and Cuban musicians join in Havana’s annual jazz festival, defying Trump’s efforts to weaken US-Cuba relations"},{"url":null,"title":"college","story":"Can you put the facts about yourself together to see what picture may emerge?College application process can seem intimidating and complex \u0026ndash here\u0026rsquos how to do itA reduction in the artificially inflated range of choices would lead to lower drop-out ratesEmployers will be interested in your range of problem-solving and lateral thinking skillsParents\u0026rsquo perception of the education options for their children are often outdatedAs numbers of students choosing to study abroad increase, we look at the optionsThe costs of college are particularly high for students living in rented or student accommodationPrimary and secondary school may be expensive, but costs climb sharply at third levelWhat do Ireland\u0026rsquos universities offer students by way of sports and health facilities?Download PDFs of our comprehensive list of level 8 and level 67 courses"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4142155.1579199288!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coastwatch litter survey reveals encouraging trend","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMixed marine litter washed up on Inchydoney beach in Co Cork during the 2019 Coastwatch survey. Photograph: Bernie Connolly Coastal litter caused by drinks containers like plastic bottles and aluminium cans has fallen dramatically around the Irish coastline, according to Coastwatch Ireland.The results of its annual survey of 541 coastal locations conducted last autumn show a halving of such items found, compared to 2018.This is the most positive trend achieved in 31 years of surveying conducted by volunteers of 500m-long coastal areas, according to Coastwatch director Karin Dubsky.“The turnaround is absolutely massive. We think it’s probably happening because of behavioural change mainly more and more people are aware of how drinks containers are polluting the landscape, especially our coastlines,” said Ms Dubsky.“More people carry multiuse containers and are careful not to litter,” she said. Other factors include a higher clean-up frequency on many shores, especially urban ones, and that there was no storm or flooding during the survey period.If increased clean-ups by groups taking away litter from the coastline was the main contributory factor, this would have been reflected in reduced amounts across all litter categories. But this was not the case, with increased polystyrene and wet wipes standing out in the latest figures, noted Ms Dubsky.Drinks containers remain the most widespread form of “macro litter” found, with plastic bottles recorded on 73 per cent of sites. Metal cans were recorded on 60 per cent of sites and bottle lids on 52 per cent of surveyed shores. A total of 3,333 bottles were found.\u0026nbspWhat about wet wipes?The increased presence of wet wipes was worrying, she said – one or more of which was found in 12.2 per cent of locations. Frequently they were found to be linked to raw sewage discharges nearby.Ms Dubsky said the level of wet wipes in such locations was likely to be higher “as they are not easy to identify if mixed up in seaweed”.The 2019 survey found 701 plastic shopping bags (35.5 per cent of locations), while the biggest increase was in “other items”. These include single-use cups, picked out in 6 per cent of survey units. Cotton bud plastic sticks were found in 5 per cent of places, followed closely by cigarette butts and wrappers, balloons, golf balls, farm plastic and “full dog pooh bags”.Under main categories, dumped household refuse was found in 5 per cent of locations and often in the same areas as household furnishings (6 per cent). Large aquaculture wasteabandoned fishing gear was found in 8.5 per cent of sites.Abandoned vehicles, girders and machines or large machine parts were noted on 9.2 per cent of shores. In some cases this and the occurrence of landfill materials are linked to coastal erosion.Tyres were found on 19 per cent of shores (totalling 876 tyres). This is “strongly related to areas where tyre traps are placed to catch peeler crabs, especially in counties Wexford, Waterford and Cork”.Shipwrecks were observed in 4 per cent of survey units “and may include historic boats which are now part of heritage and not really well recorded under the waste heading”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4142147.1579198980!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"muslim cultural centre for clonmel gets go ahead","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tClonmel locals claim the proposed development is a mosque as it would be used for prayers five times daily. Photograph: Nick Bradshaw Planning permission has been granted for a new cultural centre, including prayer rooms, for Muslims living in Clonmel, Co Tipperary, despite strong opposition from a large group of local residents.Locals claimed the proposed development should more correctly be described as a mosque as it would be used between 6am and 10pm with prayers five times daily.However, the TICC said a building had to have certain requirements to be classified as a mosque under Islamic sacred law which excluded other activities taking place inside it.“A building is not a mosque simply because five daily prayers are performed in it,” the TICC said.An inspector with An Bord Pleanála said the building was not a traditional mosque and its description as a cultural centre was “accurate and acceptable”.The plans provide for the demolition of an existing derelict building and the construction of a new two-storey centre which will provide for a number of activities including prayers, mother and toddler groups, breastfeeding facilities, a library, canteen and youth club.The board ruled that the centre, subject to a number of planning conditions, would not seriously injure residential or visual amenities of adjoining properties.Congested areaIt claimed the proposed building represented “an appropriate type and scale of development at this location and would be acceptable in terms of pedestrian and traffic safety and convenience”.Residents from Irishtown, Albert Street and St Mary’s Place in Clonmel complained the centre including the prayer rooms would generate a lot of additional noise and disturbance as well as traffic in an already congested area.More than 200 local residents had signed submissions which also raised concern that the new building would overshadow other houses.They claimed older people living in Irishtown would be nervous that people would be in their area late at night or in the early hours of the morning.The objectors said the council’s decision to approve the project was “outrageous” and “absolutely mind-boggling”, especially as it had refused planning permission for four two-bed townhouses a short distance away because it would create a traffic hazard.“There are so many more suitable sites in Clonmel where overdevelopment, overpopulation, traffic hazard and public safety are not an issue,” said the main appellant, Bernie Reidy. The TICC, a registered charity, which is currently based at a smaller premises in Clonmel, provided reassurance to the planning authorities that there would be no amplified call to prayer from the new centre.Potential misunderstandingsIt claimed the largest number attending prayers would be up to 50 on a Friday afternoon.The centre pointed out that half the Muslim community in Clonmel consisted of doctors working in South Tipperary General Hospital where there was also a room for prayer.The TICC said there were a number of potential misunderstandings about the sort of activities that would be carried out in the centre and concerns that there would be hordes of people accessing the building throughout the night were “incorrect and unfounded”.It claimed two-thirds of people using the facility were living within one mile of the site, which would eliminate the need for them to use carsThe TICC said the centre would generate significantly fewer vehicles than when the building was the location for a large car showroom.It also noted the height of the cultural centre would only be slightly higher than the existing building on the site."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4141108.1579125400!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tributes paid to kilkenny man who ran new york s oldest irish pub","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe funeral of Matty Maher, the Kilkenny-born proprietor of McSorley’s Old Ale House in New York City, who died on January 11th, aged 80. The funeral was held at the Holy Trinity church in Whitestone, New York. Photograph: Lauren CrothersMcSorley’s Old Ale House, opened by Irish immigrant John McSorley in 1854, is the oldest Irish pub in New York, where sawdust on the floor provides a comforting crunch underfoot and walls are decked with mementos of yesteryear.The chair Abraham Lincoln is alleged to have sat on looks down over the bar, along with dusty fire helmets and the turkey wishbones eaten by men who never returned from war.This week, however, the mood in the popular East Village haunt in Manhattan is sombre, following the passing of its beloved long-time owner, Kilkenny-born Matty Maher, who was buried on Wednesday.His funeral on a bright, crisp morning on Wednesday was attended by hundreds of family and friends. His casket was escorted by two pipers from the New York fire department, and carried under an arch of hurleys.Mr Maher’s daughter, Andrea spoke of a man who loved “laughter, stories and song”.“Nothing ever held him down. He saw good in any situation,” she said.Paying tribute, Fr Tom Brosnan said tombstones usually have a hyphen between the deceased’s dates of birth and death: “Matty’s hyphen should be very long not because of the years he lived, but because of the things he accomplished in those years.”Mr Maher’s move to New York and eventual ownership of the bar was serendipitous, following a chance meeting in 1964 when he was just 25 with its then-owner, Harry Kirwan after Kirwan’s car broke down during a holiday in Ireland.The young Maher came to his aid, and the older publican promised the young Kilkenny man a job should he ever find himself in New York. Mr Kirwan was true to his word.Stepping into those shoes years later, one of Mr Maher’s greatest gifts was in knowing “all the regulars”, who included second World War veterans, but also in remembering people he’d only met once.Recalling his employer, the pub’s longest-serving barman, Jeff Bartholomew, hired by Mr Maher in 1972 when the latter was the manager, said: “He ran the taps. He was the nexus for the whole place.“He was one of those guys you’d really want to be in a foxhole with. He could see what was going on and he knew what was going on,” Mr Bartholomew, said on Tuesday before leaving for his old boss’s wake.‘Traditional Irish publican’Remembering one of Mr Maher’s final visits to the pub, fellow bartender and family relative, Shane Buggy said he had been “a true, traditional Irish publican” right to the end.Encountering a group he had not seen for 15 years, the elderly landlord “walked over to the bar, got a fistful of ale and just dropped it down and said, ‘Welcome back, lads.’ He was always like that. His generosity knew no bounds.”His passing shocked family and friends, said Buggy, remembering his last meeting with him a week ago, where his boss left him parting advice.“Ah you’re doing a great job down there, lads, keep it going,” Mr Maher had said. “Keep those doors open and keep the fire lit and you’ll have a crowd there this afternoon.”In its own message on Facebook, McSorley’s said: “When he started working at the bar, McSorley’s was still a men-only establishment with dozens of flophouses within blocks from 15 East 7th Street. When they had to let women in by court order on August 11th, 1970, the bar’s future was uncertain.“And when Matty purchased the place in 1977, the city was near bankrupt and the neighbourhood’s future uncertain. Landlords were just walking away from their buildings, heroin was rampant, cars had to wait in lines that extended for blocks just to get gas, crime, and grime everywhere.“But Matty left poverty back in Ireland and he was determined to leave it behind for good. He saw an opportunity and believed in the American Dream. And he loved history and all things Irish and knew McSorley’s and the city could survive when so many others told him he was absolutely nuts.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4141889.1579182304!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dominic cummings tries to reinvent politics now that brexit is done","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDominic Cummings: His new focus reflects the passions developed in his bunker: putting science at the heart of government and ensuring that the government machine delivers what the politicians promise. Photograph: Chris J RatcliffeGetty ImagesWhen Boris Johnson walked through the front door of Number 10 on July 26th, 2019, the British political system was in a state of Brexit-induced paralysis. But in a small room upstairs, arguably the second most powerful man in Britain was already issuing new instructions to demoralised staffers: “Don’t be shit.”A dishevelled figure with a soft voice and the appearance of an eccentric scientist, Dominic Cummings explained to his political team – largely inherited from a broken Theresa May – that from now on Number 10 would be run like Nasa, with him at Mission Control. There was one single objective: delivering Brexit.“It was genuinely jaw-dropping,” says one of those present. At times, in what a staffer said was a 90-minute diatribe, Cummings started waving his pen around so frantically that they feared he would deface the oil painting behind him.“The overriding sense was we had wasted the last three years,” says another witness. “He said bad performance wouldn’t be tolerated. Then he invited everyone next door for some drinks – it was so different to the old regime. It was genuinely quite inspiring.”Jason Stein, an adviser who attended the meeting, noted at the time: “Astonishing meeting. He says the last government made a total mess of this and we won’t mess it up again. He says unlike the last government, decisions are going to be rapid and final. It’s absolute Darwinism in there. Titles don’t matter.”Six months later, Cummings is still in Downing Street, presiding over a new political landscape that he has helped shape. The man who directed the 2016 campaign to take Britain out of the EU is chief adviser to Johnson, a prime minister who used the promise “Get Brexit Done” to secure an 80-strong House of Commons majority.On January 31st, Britain will formally leave the EU – although the challenge of agreeing a trade deal with the bloc will be just beginning.Cummings, who gave Britain Brexit, is leaving the tricky details of delivering it to others. The 48-year-old is moving on to a new agenda, in which he hopes to remake the civil service, put money into Britain’s “left-behind” regions and turn the country into a leading centre for science, putting it at the cutting edge of artificial intelligence, robotics and climate change. This month, he published a blog post that went viral, inviting “weirdos and misfits” to join him at the heart of government.Those who see him in Number 10 meetings with Johnson detect no deference towards the prime minister. “He sits there, leaning back in his chair – they act as though they are equals,” says one senior government figure. “There’s no doubt about that.”For now, Johnson embraces Cummings, who is seen by friends as a “Renaissance man” with rare skills ning campaigning, policy, communications and project delivery. To his enemies he is vicious, unscrupulous and an intellectual showboater who is riding for a fall.For all his successes in plotting election strategies, the pressure is now on to deliver his highly ambitious agenda. One government insider says: “He’s all-powerful and he’s running the country. But nobody ever dies in a ditch for an adviser. Of course he’s expendable.”Cummings, who declined to be interviewed for this article but responded to fact-checking queries, tells people he will quit long before he is fired. He likes to give the impression that he is just passing through, moving from one project to the next, and that he could happily walk away at any time and return to his “bunker” at his parents’ farm in County Durham.When he joined the Vote Leave campaign in October 2015, Cummings insisted he would only be the “acting” campaign director, but went on to lead it to victory. Similarly, he predicted in November 2019 that he would soon quit Number 10: “There’s a reasonable chance I won’t be around any more. As you know, I strongly ­dislike Westminster, so I’m reluctant to return,” he told colleagues.But Cummings did come back after Johnson’s victory in December and immediately announced plans to create his dream Downing Street operation, inhabited by data scientists, policy experts, project managers and people with “odd skills”. Uri Geller, the celebrity spoonbender, has applied.Even Cummings’s appearance is seen by some as an outward symbol of his avowed contempt for Whitehall tradition. His sartorial standards have deteriorated the closer he has got to the centre of power. Some see it as insolent and disrespectful. Cummings argues, however, that it is simply that he has “always been a scruffy bastard”.Nor is he the first dishevelled iconoclast to operate in Number 10: Steve Hilton, who padded barefoot around Downing Street as David Cameron’s “blue-sky thinking” adviser, quit after becoming frustrated at his ability to achieve change.But Cummings’ style has become increasingly idiosyncratic over the years. His “low-riding”, loose-fitting trousers are usually accompanied by threadbare shirts, often open to the chest and covered in biro marks. Cummings likes to set off this ensemble with a bulldog clip, attached to his shirt.Freddy Gray, deputy editor of The Spectator and a friend of Cummings and his wife Mary Wakefield, another senior journalist on the magazine, says: “On occasions, Dom has come into the office with two pairs of tracksuit bottoms on and Mary’s looked up and thought that he was one of the homeless people she helps to look after.”His friends say he is not planning to be in Downing Street in the long term. “He doesn’t dream of some permanent Metternich or Talleyrand continuance in office,” says one. But they also agree that now Cummings is installed, he wants to get big things done quickly. The country is in for an interesting ride.Cummings was born in Durham, a cathedral city in the northeast of England, in 1971. His father was a construction manager on oil rigs and his mother a special educational needs teacher. Although his upbringing was geographically distant from the gilded world inhabited by the Eton-educated Johnson and David Cameron, Cummings nevertheless attended Durham School, a prestigious fee-paying establishment founded in 1414, and Exeter College, Oxford.In spite of railing in this month’s unorthodox Downing Street job ad against the “blah blah” spoken by Oxbridge humanities graduates, Cummings himself studied ancient and modern history.Robin Lane Fox, his tutor in ancient history (and the FT Weekend gardening columnist), says: “He got a very good First in both parts in three years,” adding that Cummings was “a whole class better” at the subject than Boris Johnson, who studied classics at Oxford some years earlier.Critics argue that Cummings is a poseur, name-dropping Thucydides and Bismarck – later broadening his repertoire to include physicists and data scientists – to claim intellectual superiority. But Lane Fox disagrees: “Dominic is not a pseud.”At Oxford, Cummings was also highly influenced by the late Norman Stone, his tutor in modern history and an adviser to Margaret Thatcher, who encouraged him to travel to Moscow in 1994 to witness the new world being created behind the old iron curtain.Liam Halligan, a  journalist who was then working as an academic at the London School of Economics and writing columns for the Moscow Times, offered Cummings somewhere to stay.“A lot of smart young westerners were going to Moscow at the time,” Halligan recalls. “Norman Stone asked if I could help him out. There was a little sofa in the hallway and he slept on that. He was intense, very clever, socially a little bit awkward. He didn’t initially have a job but wanted to see what was going on. Later, he worked on a bond desk. There were lots of investment projects coming and going.”Cummings helped to set up an airline flying from Samara on the Volga to Vienna, but it was spectacularly unsuccessful. “It once took off forgetting its only passenger,” he once recalled.Halligan says he could see why people thought that some of the bright young Brits arriving in Moscow were security service “assets”. “The whole atmosphere was like a Graham Greene novel,” he says. Conspiracy theories have been built around Cummings’s time in Russia, a country that 20 years later celebrated Britain’s departure from the EU. “It’s utter b****cks,” says Halligan.Back in the UK in the late 1990s, Cummings entered the world of right-wing pressure groups, becoming campaign director for Business for Sterling, a group campaigning to stop Britain joining the euro. Again, Stone helped with the introductions. Cummings believed the euro was a doomed project and the EU was a lumbering behemoth, but he has never actually been a member of the Conservative party.Instead, his instinctive view that politicians are squanderers of public cash and his dislike of big bureaucracies – including the one based in Brussels – were fused in 2004 in the referendum campaign in which he made his name: an often-forgotten vote on Tony Blair’s plan to create a regional assembly in the northeast of England.Blair wanted to decentralise power to the English regions and saw the northeast as a good place to start. He had reckoned without Cummings, who helped to campaign against the new regional assembly with the aid of a giant inflatable white elephant and the slogan: “Politicians talk, you pay.”County Durham manufacturer John Elliot, who chaired the campaign, says that when they met every morning to plan the day’s events, Cummings was highly important. “He was not the most talkative but he was probably the most influential.” He adds: “He was quite single-minded. He wanted to keep things simple. He kept on message.” The No side won 78:22.Some 12 years later, Cummings deployed the same simple messages, visual stunts and a focus on “waste” in the 2016 Brexit referendum. But first, he retreated to the three-room outhouse at his parents’ farm near Durham. One visitor says: “It’s what you’d expect – quite ramshackle, packed with books.”He disappeared from the scene for over two years, reading history and developing his growing passion for science, which he believed held the key to understanding and solving public policy problems.He also immersed himself in the art of campaigning. Elliott says Blair’s polling guru, the late Philip Gould, and Bill Clinton’s adviser James Carville, an abrasive Washington outsider from Louisiana, are among his heroes. Carville mastered the three-word campaign slogan “The economy, stupid”. Cummings later came up with “Take Back Control” and “Get Brexit Done”.In 2007, Cummings caught the eye of Michael Gove, a fast-rising Tory shadow minister, who made him his special adviser for seven years and brought him into David Cameron’s new coalition government to overhaul England’s education system and take on what Gove liked to call “the blob” – the teaching establishment, which he blamed for accepting low standards.By now, Cummings had started writing down his thoughts, expounding in sprawling online tracts how a more rigorous education system could help to solve the country’s ills. “We need what Murray Gell Mann, the discoverer of the quark, calls ‘an Odyssean education’ that integrates knowledge from maths and science, the humanities and social sciences, and training in effective action,” he wrote in 2014.In 2011, Cummings married Mary Wakefield, having met at a mutual friend’s party. “He was already friends with my brother Jack,” Wakefield says. “Anyone who’s friends with Jack is okay by me.” They have one son, Alexander Cedd, known by family as “Ceddy” and named after the Northumbrian saint. Friends say Cummings is a doting father.Wakefield’s father owns Chillingham castle in Northumberland but friends say the couple, who own a house in Islington, do not enjoy a lavish lifestyle. “Typically English – asset rich, cash poor,” says one. “Mary has to earn a living.”Cummings, who has long railed against officials earning six-figure salaries, earns just under £100,000 (€117,000), less than other senior Number 10 staff.The couple’s relationship was depicted in a Channel 4 film on the Brexit referendum, in which Cummings is sympathetically played by Benedict Cumberbatch, a remainer who spent an increasingly bibulous evening with the couple, noting Cummings’ mannerisms. “Because of the film, people see Mary as the sweet one,” says Freddy Gray. “She hates that. If either of them is Machiavellian, it’s her.”Cameron initially blocked Cummings from entering government on the grounds he was too confrontational. Gray says Cummings’ parents had excitedly texted their son when they saw television pictures of him entering Number 10 on the first day of the new government, only to be told he wasn’t wanted.“I think that cemented his and Mary’s deep dislike of Dave and the gang. I remember thinking the day after the referendum, ‘Well, that’s what happens if you f**k with Mary and Dom.’”Cameron later relented and allowed Cummings to join Gove, but he came to regret it. David Laws, a former Liberal Democrat minister who worked with Cummings at the education department, witnessed the abrasive style that he would eventually take into Downing Street.“He can be unnecessarily rude, hectoring and create a climate of fear, which isn’t generally conducive to good government,” Laws says. “I think he’s genuinely interested in serious policy issues rather than ‘spin’, but whether he engages at a level where he actually delivers is another matter.”By 2014, Cameron was tiring of the fact that his flagship education reforms – which sought to toughen up exams and curriculums – had become “toxic” with voters, partly thanks to Cummings waging war with the teaching profession.Cummings jumped first in 2014 – Cameron later labelled him a “career psychopath” – and returned to his bunker, while Gove was shuffled out of the department.Two years later, Cummings would return as the prime minister’s nemesis, working with Boris Johnson and Michael Gove to deliver Brexit in the 2016 referendum, campaigning on EU “waste” and ruthlessly exploiting fears about immigration with a false claim that Turkey was about to join the EU and that millions of Turks would soon be heading for Dover.“What he is brilliant at doing is creating a kind of guerrilla warfare against the establishment,” says Craig Oliver, who helped to run the Remain campaign. “He found the weak spots and probed them relentlessly. He understood how to get into the psychology of discontent and leverage and used that against the establishment. Can he maintain that in government?”Dominic Cummings barely knew Boris Johnson when the two linked up in the 2016 referendum campaign but the adviser was immediately impressed: “He thought people were wrong not to take Boris seriously – he thought he had an extra gear,” says one friend.Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Vote Leave, says they went on to forge a formidable and close partnership, which has been carried into Downing Street. “They admire each other’s strengths,” Elliott says. “Boris is funny, witty, charismatic, intelligent and brings the television cameras out. Dom is massively bright, can bring a team together and drive things.”Cummings, who had spent the previous 20 years dreaming about what he might do if he found himself running Number 10, moved to a completely new level when he walked in there with the new prime minister.Nominally Johnson’s “assistant”, in reality he acts as his chief adviser and chief enforcer. He hires and fires staff and set the tone of the new government, focusing on delivering Brexit and the three things he says people actually care about: the NHS, tackling crime and ending austerity. But his arrival in Number 10 also highlighted some paradoxes.Wakefield says that her husband is “extremely kind” but some see Cummings as ruthless and vindictive in securing his objectives. He summarily sacked a young treasury adviser, Sonia Khan, for alleged disloyalty and had her marched off the premises by armed police.“He ruined a young woman’s life,” says one Tory insider. In his most recent blog post, Cummings fulminated against “the horror of human resources”.On the other hand, Cummings’ urgency and drive have inspired loyalty among many colleagues. Sir Mark Sedwill, cabinet secretary and Britain’s top civil servant, has put off a plan to become Britain’s ambassador to Washington to help deliver Cummings’ civil service reforms. “They have a good relationship,” says one Downing Street insider.A Tory official adds: “Dom is genuinely open about things. He’s keen to hear criticism. But he’ll also tell you that if you don’t like it, ‘F**k off – there’s the door.’”Cummings is often seen as a revolutionary who wants to kick down bastions of the establishment – he has loudly criticised the civil service, the supreme court, parliamentary “lobby” journalists and the BBC – yet he retains a remarkable conviction that the state can be a force for good. Provided it is run on his terms.His strategy of closing down parliament last October to try to force through a no-deal Brexit was blocked by the supreme court and could have been disastrous for Johnson, had the Lib Dems and Scottish National Party not obliged the prime minister by agreeing to a snap election.“He’s not a soothsayer,” says one government insider. “He spent ages telling us that we would be toast if we didn’t deliver Brexit on October 31st. In fact, he was completely wrong: the ‘Get Brexit Done’ message won us the election. If he had delivered Brexit, the election would have been totally different.”Meanwhile, Cummings recently lost a battle with the treasury when he proposed that chancellor Sajid Javid should embark on a massive pre-election spree of tax cuts and spending. Javid said it would be folly to engage in a spending race with Labour and was ultimately backed by Johnson.Although Cummings advises Johnson across all aspects of government, those inside Number 10 say it is important to strip away the “myth” and recognise that in some areas he is much less influential than others. Since his run-in with Javid, Cummings has taken a lower profile on the economy, while the former chief of the Vote Leave campaign is increasingly letting others sort out the details after Britain formally leaves the EU on January 31st.A complex post-Brexit trade deal with the EU is being run by Johnson’s Europe adviser David Frost. When Ursula von der Leyen, European Commission president, visited Number 10 this month, Cummings did not ask to attend. “There were six places at the table but he didn’t want to come,” says one person briefed on the meeting.Cummings recognises there is a danger of spreading himself too thin and failing to deliver. His new focus reflects the passions developed in his bunker: putting science at the heart of government and ensuring that the government machine delivers what the politicians promise.His inspiration is the US government’s Manhattan Project, which created the first atomic bomb, and – as he put it in his blog – “the way in which George Mueller turned the failing Nasa bureaucracy into an organisation that could put man on the moon”.He wants to set up a civilian version of the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (formerly known as Arpa), pursuing “high-risk, high-return projects that markets won’t fund – ie failure is normal”. His WhatsApp profile says: “Get Brexit done, then Arpa”.But Cummings risks making enemies by denouncing some officials as work-shy, knocking off at 4pm and leaving their minister to take the flak for their mistakes. Oliver notes: “The danger for Dominic is there are an awful lot of civil servants and not many people in Number 10.”Cummings recognises that his abrasive and relentless style has a time limit. He suffers from a much-discussed mystery ailment that causes pain in his abdominal area, and often has to stand in meetings, grimacing with pain. He says he will have a long-delayed medical operation after January 31st, and tells colleagues that he will then find out if “Mary and the PM agree on a job for me”.Everyone in Number 10 assumes he will carry on. In his ad inviting “wild cards” to work in Downing Street and improve the advice given to Johnson, he suggested he might stay for a year and then quit: “We want to improve performance and make me much less important – and within a year largely redundant.”Matthew Elliott believes Cummings can change the country and that he is doing it with the best of intentions: “He’s not a partisan person. He’s there to represent people who live outside London and people living in the northeast, where he comes from. That’s quite a pure motive.”But Steve Bannon’s defenestration from Trump’s White House is a reminder of the danger that advisers face, especially when they become public figures in their own right. Cummings could hardly complain this month he told potential applicants to join his team in Number 10: “I’ll bin you within weeks if you don’t fit.”Jonathan Powell, Blair’s former chief of staff, wishes Cummings well in his efforts to overhaul the state but fears that he is on course for a spectacular crash. “On the basis of my experience, the sensible thing for an unelected official in Number 10 to do is keep a low profile,” he says.“I give him 12 months max. If you try to be in the papers every day your political life expectancy is short – and like Rasputin, you end up on the bottom of the River Neva in chains.” – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Will he stay or will he go? It seems that we now have clarity – Putin is here to stay.In a country where major policy speeches are often tedious even when at their most exciting, Putin used a televised address yesterday to announce a radical re-shaping of Russia’s political system. Government and ministerial accountability would move from the presidency to the Duma, the country’s parliament. The Duma would select the prime minister and approve most ministers, and the president would be obliged to appoint them. The powers of the State Council, an advisory body, would be strengthened.These sweeping constitutional reforms set the stage for Putin to rule for life. The reforms will be put to a nationwide referendum – a “people’s vote” in Putin’s words – in due course. But there is little reason to doubt the outcome. Over his 20 years in power, Putin has created a kleptocracy. It is a system that mocks and mimics democracy but which is authoritarian in its nature. Elections and political institutions have been hollowed. The judiciary is supine. Political opponents and critical journalists live in fear of being assassinated by the regime.The system has worked for many Russians, or at least it did in its first decade. Average salaries grew eight-fold between 2000 and 2010, and the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) increased on average 5 per cent annually over the same period. But over the past half-a-decade the economy has stagnated, a result of Western sanctions and a fall in the global price of oil. A harsh austerity campaign was introduced in 2014. Incomes have declined for five straight years. One-seventh of the population, or some 20 million people, live below the poverty line, defined as an income of about £150 a month.Twenty years of PutinPutin has spoken regularly over the last two years about the need to return Russia to economic growth. He has implemented a highly ambitious six-year programme through to 2024, of state-led and state-financed national projects. But in a system that is based on massive predation, this has already run into difficulties. In 2017, the “shadow economy” was estimated to account for more than one-third of Russia’s GDP, or around $615 billion. This is greater than the entire GDP of Poland or Taiwan.There are already signs that Putin’s system is starting to come apart. Despite draconian restrictions on freedom of assembly, last year saw protests in all-but-two of Russia’s regions. Grass-roots activism is on the rise. Russians now take to the streets to voice grievances about deteriorating public services, from rubbish disposal to hospital closures. And the situation could get worse: a recent public opinion poll suggested that one in four Russians is prepared to take part in mass protests over falling incomes.This may explain why Putin has acted now. For the last two years, large-scale policymaking has been paralysed, with each move interpreted as a signal of Putin’s plans for the future. Another four years of paralysis – and economic stagnation – could be ruinous, both for Putin and his system. In reality, in order to achieve meaningful change and economic growth, it would be necessary to undertake systemic reform. But that is seen as a threat to the country’s stability and Putin’s hold on power, and so is out of the question.Yesterday’s changes throw up questions of their own: Will Putin take over the role of prime minister in 2024? Will he become head of the State Council, or Speaker of the Duma? But these questions do not really matter. Putin has spent his two decades in power telling Russians that there is no alternative to his system – or to him. And after yesterday’s announcement, there will not be for the foreseeable future.Dr Andrew Foxall is Director of the Russia and Eurasia Studies Centre at the Henry Jackson Society, the London-based international affairs think tankThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

The latest show had a peak of 6.9 million. In it, she writes: When stepping down from a job, it is quite common for people to say they are doing so in order to spend more time with their family.Unusually I am departing from The Great British Bake Off so I can spend more time with my other work. As my waistline will testify, Bake Off is an all-consuming show.Spending time with Prue, Paul and Noel has been one of the great pleasures of my life. These are friendships which I know will continue beyond the confines of television.Bake Off is a wonderful programme which has already proved it can happily withstand a change of hosting personnel.The reason for that, of course, is that the true stars of the show are the bakers themselves. I wish everyone well.Prue Leith, who presents the show, noted that the comedian had been juggling so many different projects.She said: I have absolutely loved working with Sandi, she\u0027s been a brilliant host and enormous fun and I am in awe of how hard she works juggling so many different projects. We shall be lifelong friends\u0027 way beyond the tent.Paul Hollywood, her co-presenter, added: I will miss Sandi, she has done an amazing job in the tent, much loved by all who met her. I wish Sandi continued success in all that she does.Noel Fielding said: I feel like Tom without Jerry ! Mick without a Keef :( gonna miss yooooooooooooooooo and the wonderful times we got to play together in the tent ! Double acts are rare and magical beast and working with you was a pleasure x x x all my love Mr Noel.Former contestants said they would miss her. Henry Bird, from last year\u0027s series said: What an absolute gem, Sandi Toksvig  was one of the best things about the tent, and what a fabulous host she was. Any captions for the photo below welcome, as what was actually said wasn’t quite pre-watershed material.Her final appearance will be on the  upcoming series of The Great Stand Up To Cancer Bake Off, which features celebrities.Toksvig has fronted the programme alongside Fielding and judges Paul Hollywood and Prue Leith since 2017 after it moved to Channel 4 from BBC One.Ian Katz, director of programmes at Channel 4, said: Sandi is a huge part of why Bake Off\u0027s move to Channel 4 has been such a success and we are immensely grateful for her contribution to the show.We will miss her warmth and wit, not to mention her endless willingness to be the butt of jokes about being the least tall person.Ms Toksvig has many other presenting and writing commitments, including fronting the BBC quiz show QI, and will host a forthcoming series for Channel 4, about illiterate adults taking part in a spelling bee. The show has already faced a change in presenters, with Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins fronting the programme along with Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood when it was on the BBC.Channel 4 said they are currently looking for a replacement for Toksvig to join Fielding, and that potential candidates must have experience of mopping up spills and the occasional tear, making tea and keeping the amateur bakers to time.Comment: Liberal Amsterdam is recognising that there are downsides to its famous toleranceLabour leadership latest: Momentum promises to \u0026#39mobilise thousands\u0026#39 for Rebecca Long-Bailey after members overwhelmingly back herFootball fan who attacked Owen Jones denies homophobia and claims the left-wing campaigner \u0026#39spilled his pint\u0026#39Comment: This farcical row in the EU Parliament summed up why Brexit is happeningEgypt and Ethiopia reach deal on Nile \u0026#39mega dam\u0026#39 that brought threats of warFormer EU diplomat \u0026#34among three Germans suspected of spying for China\u0026#34Farmers could be paid for worm-filled soil under post-Brexit agriculture planBBC affirms reduced flights plan as it unveils shows shot around the world covering climate change Comment: Rebecca Long-Bailey\u0026#39s lead is the latest grim twist in a dire Labour leadership contest   Comment: As America shows, legalising cannabis doesn\u0026#39t get rid of criminalsWolves playing ball reveals truth about \u0026#39go fetch\u0026#39 in dogsBritish flag outside European Parliament to be displayed in EU museum after BrexitComment: It would be \u0026#39bongkers\u0026#39 to ignore the British people by not letting Big Ben bong for BrexitItalian towns vie to lure Jennifer Lopez after she reveals she hankers for quiet lifeTwo children found alive after 18 hours buried in Kashmir avalanchesGovernment appears to pull plug on Big Ben Brexit bongs despite Boris Johnson\u0026#39s crowdfunding supportWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/01/08/13/istock-1160205101.jpg","title":"food waste 20 pledges sustainable ways to eat","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.‘I am forced to look at the piles of food I’ve wasted, it’s not a pretty picture. How did things get so bad in my kitchen?’ asks food writer Julia Platt LeonardI avoid cleaning my refrigerator like other people put off doing their taxes. I wait until it’s a sea of plastic containers, cling-film-wrapped onion halves, teetering jars – until I can’t find the mayonnaise or remember where the parmesan cheese is. Only then, when I can’t fit another thing inside, do I take it all out.\u0026nbspI throw out the piece of salmon skin I was going to give to the dogs. I toss out something spore-covered (carrots? meatballs?) and another item I think used to be a solid but is now liquid. Judging by the amount of mould, you’d think I was starting up a penicillin laboratory.And each time I chuck out an uneaten leftover or a floppy cucumber I feel ashamed – ashamed at the waste. As a food writer, I know better.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, about one third of the food produced in the world – a whopping 1.3 billion tonnes – is wasted or lost. In richer countries we waste as much food as sub-Saharan Africa produces. I’ve interviewed farmers, written about food policy and yet I’m part of the problem.I see myself standing before a food waste deity (picture Greta Thunberg with a white beard) and am forced to look at the piles of food I’ve wasted. It’s not a pretty picture. How did things get so bad in my kitchen?Why I’ve decided to start cycling to workI went to cooking school and worked in professional kitchens so FIFO – “first-in, first-out” – was my mantra. Food came in and we prepared and served it to ensure that waste was kept to a minimum. We labelled containers and made prep lists so nothing was missed. The walk-in fridge was kept clean, for hygiene reasons of course, but also so we knew what we had and ordered accordingly. My fridge? A disaster zone.I wasn’t raised to waste. My maternal grandparents came from western Kentucky, got married during the depression, and would no sooner have wasted a morsel of food than they would have walked down the street naked. When things were really tight, my grandmother reused coffee grounds and gave cucina povera a decidedly southern twist. My mother was the same, serving a meal one night, leftovers the next, and if necessary ‘must-go’ servings on the third.Food that’s not eaten either goes down the drain, is incinerated or ends up on a landfill where greenhouse gases are generated. That’s waste. But it’s also a waste because land, water, labour and energy were spent to create the food I binned. It’s also food that could have fed other people.My food waste, whether it’s the mystery container wedged in the back of the fridge or the past-sell-by date beans on my cupboard shelves, must stop. That’s why I’ve committed to reducing my food waste in 2020.Why I\u0027m making my home more eco-friendlyThat means getting a handle on what comes in my kitchen and what goes back out. It also means taking a critical look at the food choices I’m making. If I want my kitchen to be more sustainable then it’s time to ask some tough questions. Where do the foods I eat come from? What impact do they make on the earth? Can I justify eating avocados or pouring almond milk on my cereal? And the elephant – scratch that, cow – in the room, can I be an ethical omnivore?I’m going to learn more about food labelling to find out what it tells us, and what it doesn’t. I’ll figure out how to cut down on plastic in my kitchen and waste in my cooking. I’ll embrace my leftovers and think before I buy.I’ll make my kitchen and my cooking more sustainable in 2020, one meal at a time.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It has since been suggested that they may instead be formed by flowing sand NasaJPLUniversity of ArizonaMorning Aurora: Nasa astronaut Scott Kelly captured this photograph of the green lights of the aurora from the International Space Station in October 2015These orbits are also a lot longer than the 365 days Earth takes to move around our sun, ranging from about 100 to 1,000 years.Researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles, have fittingly named the newcomers G3, G4, G5 and G6.Scientists spot stellar black hole much bigger than thought possibleWriting in the Nature journal, the group explained its belief that all six were once binary stars - a pair of stars which orbit each other - later merging as one due to the supermassive black hole\u0027s powerful gravitational force.However, this merging process is not done overnight - it takes more than one million years to complete, said co-author Andrea Ghez.Mergers of stars may be happening in the universe more often than we thought, and likely are quite common, she explained.Black holes may be driving binary stars to merge. It\u0027s possible that many of the stars we\u0027ve been watching and not understanding may be the end product of mergers that are calm now.We are learning how galaxies and black holes evolve. The way binary stars interact with each other and with the black hole is very different from how single stars interact with other single stars and with the black hole.The team is already looking into other potential objects that may be part of the same family.It says the research will help shine a light on what is happening in the majority of galaxies in our universe - though Earth is quite a distance from the action, in the suburbs compared to the centre of the galaxy, Ms Ghez added.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Meanwhile the official rate of inflation fell to 1.3 per cent increasing the chances of an interest rate cutGood news for savers? The headline rate of inflation fell to 1.3 per cent in December, so it might look like that.\u0026nbspThat is,\u0026nbspuntil you take into account that the already high chances of an interest rate cut just increased. That number puts it well below the Bank of England’s 2 per cent target.\u0026nbspOne place where prices are showing some signs of life is the housing market.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesHouse prices rise at fastest monthly rate since 2013London house price fall offset by strong rises in the northUK inflation slows in temporary respite for consumersOn the same day, the official numbers from the Land Registry showed a 0.4 per cent increase since October and a 2.2 per cent increase in the year to November, bringing the average UK property price to £235,298.\u0026nbspAs ever, the data is quite spotty. The closely watched London market has, for example, been torpid of late and that hasn’t changed. A 0.5 per cent fall since October was recorded with the annual rise coming in at just 0.2 per cent.\u0026nbspCompare that to the situation in Wales where the market is hotter than a packet of Scotch Bonnet chilli peppers. Annual growth came in at an eye popping 7.8 per cent.\u0026nbspThe general expectation is that prices will continue on an upward trajectory. There is a caveat. This assumes Boris Johnson and his merry men don’t muck things up by bringing in the no deal Brexit by the back door some of the frothing extremists on the benches behind him still crave.\u0026nbspBut that’ll muck up more than just a few house prices.\u0026nbspFor now, it’s good news for those already on the ladder, not so much fun for those trying to work out how to on earth they’re supposed to get on to the first rung. That is if they can’t call upon the Bank of Mum and Dad.\u0026nbspWage rises are, it’s true, running comfortably ahead of consumer prices. But they’ve started to come off, further strengthening the hand of the doves on the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee. \u0026nbspIt bears repeating that they spent several years lagging behind prices.

Borrowing excluding mortgages was 15 per cent of total income last year, compared to 19 per cent in 2008.But the average hides varying experiences with debt for different income groups over the past 12 years.For instance, comparing the 2006-2008 period to 2016-2019, there was a 13 percentage point rise in the share of lower-income households (defined as the bottom fifth of earners) using a credit card. Among those in the middle there was a 4-point rise\u0026nbspand in the top fifth only a 2-point increase.There was also a 4 percentage point rise in the share of households in the bottom income quintile using overdrafts as compared to a 2 point rise among those in the middle and a 1 point fall among those at the top.\u0026nbspThe rise has coincided with an unprecedented period of stagnant wages, alongside dwindling savings, suggesting that low-income households have topped up their income with expensive debt.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

An “unprecedented” 46 per cent of homeowner wealth is now in the hands of the over 65s, Savills said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

November\u0027s dismal weather will finally change, with drier and colder conditions coming for the start of December, forecasters have saidThere are currently 76 balance-transfer deals available, compared to 122 in January 2017, while the longest interest-free period on the market has dropped from 43 months to 29 months. The fees lenders charge to move debt have also increased.“Those consumers who used a credit card to pay for some of the festive season may be looking to acquire a 0 per cent balance transfer card, but if they do then they would be wise to make fixed repayments,” said Rachel Springall, a finance expert at Moneyfacts.“For instance, someone with a £3,000 debt that paid £150 back as a minimum per month would clear the debt in 20 months, but there are cards that can default to a repayment of just 1 per cent plus monthly interest — so their debt would hang overhead for much longer on this basis.The changes have come partly in response to a crackdown by the Financial Conduct Authority on lenders profiting from customers who are in\u0026nbsppersistent debt and have no plan in place to pay it off.Credit card gambling ban does not go far enough, say campaignersUnder rules announced in 2017, the watchdog required credit card companies\u0026nbspto take steps to help customers repay their balances more quickly and to offer further assistance to those who can’t.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailSarah Coles, a personal finance analyst with Hargreaves Lansdown, said: If you’re a committed ‘rate tart’, regularly shifting balances when the 0 per cent introductory period runs out, you might fall foul of this tightened criteria, and struggle to get another deal.If you apply for cards and get turned down, this will damage your credit score further, so it’s worth using an online eligibility calculator, which only does a soft search of your credit record so won’t affect your score.\u0026nbspIf you can’t get a long 0 per cent introductory period, you may want to consider a card that targets borrowers with less impressive scores — which tend to offer less than six months interest-free.\u0026nbspHowever, it pays to take stock more generally. Shifting from one 0 per cent deal to another risks racking up transfer fees. And unless you’re very disciplined it can tempt to you keep building more and more debt. If instead of gradually paying the debt down, you’re seeing the balances increase, you need to make a change, and reconsider your spending habits so you can start paying it back — before your debt becomes a problem.\u0026nbspFather in credit card debt jumps off roof with daughter, wife followsBritish Airways fined £183m for data breachSales surge as shoppers defy Brexit woes but credit card defaults soarOnce you’ve drawn up a budget, you can tinker with the spending figures to free up cash to pay down your debts each month. Don’t rely on being committed to manually making the payments though, it tends to be much more effective to set up a direct debit to repay it straight after pay day so you don’t get a chance to spend it.While you’re repaying your debts, you should try to pay as little interest on your debts as possible. One option is to find a low-interest loan. This has the advantage of being for a fixed sum, so you’re not tempted to dip in over and over again when you’re meant to be paying it off.The latest figures come\u0026nbspas the government was urged to tackle a sharp rise in the use of expensive consumers credit among lower-income households.The Resolution Foundation think tank found that low-income households have racked up borrowing on loans, credit cards and other consumer debt faster than any other group since the financial crisis, leaving them over-exposed to another economic shock.Much of the rise in consumer credit since the financial crash has been on high-interest products including store cards and overdrafts charging rates averaging 20 per cent.There were some signs earlier this month that the boom in consumer lending may be drawing to a close. Separate research by the Bank of England showed UK borrowers made net repayments on their credit cards for the first time since July 2013. The total amount borrowed on credit cards dropped by £600m to £72.1bn. Overall consumer lending is at £225bn.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

New enquires from potential buyers increased, while the number of sellers putting their homes on the market also rose.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“The signals from the latest survey provide\u0026nbspfurther evidence that the housing market is seeing some benefit from the greater clarity provided by the decisive election outcome,” said Simon Rubinsohn, the chief economist at RICS.But he warned that because affordability remained a key issue in many parts of the country, the shift in “mood music” on prices was a concern, particularly with signs of a revival of optimism in London after a period of falling prices.Created with Sketch.UK Housing Crisis: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Members of ‘generation rent’, as the younger generation is often known, are finding it far more difficult to get on the housing market than previous generationsThen chancellor George Osborne visits a Help to Buy housing development in Lewisham in 2014.

It held numerous government construction and maintenance contracts, for many of which the future is still uncertain“This highlights the critical importance of the government addressing the challenge around housing supply, particularly with the gradual phasing out of the Help to Buy incentive,” he added.The RICS survey, based on the opinions of surveyors up and down the country, found that 17 per cent more respondents saw a rise rather than a fall in enquiries from new buyers last month, up from minus 5 per cent in the previous month.Most regions saw interest from new buyers increase, with respondents in Wales and the north east reporting solid growth while enquiries rose in London and the south east after negative results in November.The housing get-rich-quick scheme is dead. And not a moment too soonThe number of transactions also increased, with 9 per cent more respondents seeing a rise than a fall. While a net balance of 9 per cent also reported an increase in new instructions offering some relief from the price pressure, this was concentrated in London and the south, while the rest of the country was flat.A net balance of 61 per cent said they expected prices to increase over the coming 12 months, almost double the 33 per cent balance a month earlier.The upbeat tone will add to the dilemma the Bank of England faces when it decides on interest rates at the end of the month.Earlier this week,\u0026nbspHalifax said house prices rose sharply in December, increasing by 1.7 per cent from the previous month to push the annual increase to 4 per cent. Official figures released on Wednesday showed that prices rose by 2.2 per cent in the year to November, up from 1.3 per cent in October.However, this has been offset by a slew of downbeat data, including a drop in the annual inflation rate to 1.3 per cent from 1.5 per cent last month, taking it further below the bank’s 2 per cent target. The economy contracted by 0.3 per cent in November to leave annual growth at zero.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Borrowing excluding mortgages was 15 per cent of total income last year, compared to 19 per cent in 2008.But the average hides varying experiences with debt for different income groups over the past 12 years.For instance, comparing the 2006-2008 period to 2016-2019, there was a 13 percentage point rise in the share of lower-income households (defined as the bottom fifth of earners) using a credit card. Among those in the middle there was a 4-point rise\u0026nbspand in the top fifth only a 2-point increase.There was also a 4 percentage point rise in the share of households in the bottom income quintile using overdrafts as compared to a 2 point rise among those in the middle and a 1 point fall among those at the top.\u0026nbspThe rise has coincided with an unprecedented period of stagnant wages, alongside dwindling savings, suggesting that low-income households have topped up their income with expensive debt.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

An “unprecedented” 46 per cent of homeowner wealth is now in the hands of the over 65s, Savills said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

November\u0027s dismal weather will finally change, with drier and colder conditions coming for the start of December, forecasters have saidThere are currently 76 balance-transfer deals available, compared to 122 in January 2017, while the longest interest-free period on the market has dropped from 43 months to 29 months. The fees lenders charge to move debt have also increased.“Those consumers who used a credit card to pay for some of the festive season may be looking to acquire a 0 per cent balance transfer card, but if they do then they would be wise to make fixed repayments,” said Rachel Springall, a finance expert at Moneyfacts.“For instance, someone with a £3,000 debt that paid £150 back as a minimum per month would clear the debt in 20 months, but there are cards that can default to a repayment of just 1 per cent plus monthly interest — so their debt would hang overhead for much longer on this basis.The changes have come partly in response to a crackdown by the Financial Conduct Authority on lenders profiting from customers who are in\u0026nbsppersistent debt and have no plan in place to pay it off.Credit card gambling ban does not go far enough, say campaignersUnder rules announced in 2017, the watchdog required credit card companies\u0026nbspto take steps to help customers repay their balances more quickly and to offer further assistance to those who can’t.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Shifting from one 0 per cent deal to another risks racking up transfer fees. And unless you’re very disciplined it can tempt to you keep building more and more debt. If instead of gradually paying the debt down, you’re seeing the balances increase, you need to make a change, and reconsider your spending habits so you can start paying it back — before your debt becomes a problem.\u0026nbspFather in credit card debt jumps off roof with daughter, wife followsBritish Airways fined £183m for data breachSales surge as shoppers defy Brexit woes but credit card defaults soarOnce you’ve drawn up a budget, you can tinker with the spending figures to free up cash to pay down your debts each month. Don’t rely on being committed to manually making the payments though, it tends to be much more effective to set up a direct debit to repay it straight after pay day so you don’t get a chance to spend it.While you’re repaying your debts, you should try to pay as little interest on your debts as possible. One option is to find a low-interest loan. This has the advantage of being for a fixed sum, so you’re not tempted to dip in over and over again when you’re meant to be paying it off.The latest figures come\u0026nbspas the government was urged to tackle a sharp rise in the use of expensive consumers credit among lower-income households.The Resolution Foundation think tank found that low-income households have racked up borrowing on loans, credit cards and other consumer debt faster than any other group since the financial crisis, leaving them over-exposed to another economic shock.Much of the rise in consumer credit since the financial crash has been on high-interest products including store cards and overdrafts charging rates averaging 20 per cent.There were some signs earlier this month that the boom in consumer lending may be drawing to a close. Separate research by the Bank of England showed UK borrowers made net repayments on their credit cards for the first time since July 2013. The total amount borrowed on credit cards dropped by £600m to £72.1bn. Overall consumer lending is at £225bn.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

New enquires from potential buyers increased, while the number of sellers putting their homes on the market also rose.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“The signals from the latest survey provide\u0026nbspfurther evidence that the housing market is seeing some benefit from the greater clarity provided by the decisive election outcome,” said Simon Rubinsohn, the chief economist at RICS.But he warned that because affordability remained a key issue in many parts of the country, the shift in “mood music” on prices was a concern, particularly with signs of a revival of optimism in London after a period of falling prices.Created with Sketch.UK Housing Crisis: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Members of ‘generation rent’, as the younger generation is often known, are finding it far more difficult to get on the housing market than previous generationsThen chancellor George Osborne visits a Help to Buy housing development in Lewisham in 2014.

It held numerous government construction and maintenance contracts, for many of which the future is still uncertain“This highlights the critical importance of the government addressing the challenge around housing supply, particularly with the gradual phasing out of the Help to Buy incentive,” he added.The RICS survey, based on the opinions of surveyors up and down the country, found that 17 per cent more respondents saw a rise rather than a fall in enquiries from new buyers last month, up from minus 5 per cent in the previous month.Most regions saw interest from new buyers increase, with respondents in Wales and the north east reporting solid growth while enquiries rose in London and the south east after negative results in November.The housing get-rich-quick scheme is dead. And not a moment too soonThe number of transactions also increased, with 9 per cent more respondents seeing a rise than a fall. While a net balance of 9 per cent also reported an increase in new instructions offering some relief from the price pressure, this was concentrated in London and the south, while the rest of the country was flat.A net balance of 61 per cent said they expected prices to increase over the coming 12 months, almost double the 33 per cent balance a month earlier.The upbeat tone will add to the dilemma the Bank of England faces when it decides on interest rates at the end of the month.Earlier this week,\u0026nbspHalifax said house prices rose sharply in December, increasing by 1.7 per cent from the previous month to push the annual increase to 4 per cent. Official figures released on Wednesday showed that prices rose by 2.2 per cent in the year to November, up from 1.3 per cent in October.However, this has been offset by a slew of downbeat data, including a drop in the annual inflation rate to 1.3 per cent from 1.5 per cent last month, taking it further below the bank’s 2 per cent target. The economy contracted by 0.3 per cent in November to leave annual growth at zero.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We wanted to preserve that vibe, that feeling, in the early days.”Created with Sketch.11 useful Twitter features you might not know about Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.111 Turn on Night ModeTwitter’s dark blue Night Mode is a lot easier on your eyes than its regular, vibrant theme.

The 43-year-old reiterated previous concerns about how an edit button would work if content is retweeted, completely changing the meaning of what was originally shared.Mr Dorsey said the company had “considered” a one-minute or 30-second window to allow people to amend any spelling mistakes or broken links, but this would mean delaying tweets from being sent, which it is reluctant to do.“These are all the considerations, it’s just work, but we’ll probably never do it,” he explained.This comes after Twitter executive Kayvon Beykpour said last year that an edit feature was not “near the top of our priorities”.Twitter changes how replies workEarlier this month, the tech giant announced plans to test a feature allowing users greater control over who can reply to their tweets, even blocking responses completely.Another feature being considered by Twitter is a metric on each tweet that reveals how many times the link to the tweet has been copied and shared externally.During the\u0026nbspWired\u0026nbspQ\u0026ampA, a Twitter user asked: Instead of an edit feature, Twitter should allow users to see how many times a tweet link has been copied. Because we all send tweets with a \u0027did you see this one?!\u0027 message.Mr Dorsey replied: I agree that is a pretty good idea. We\u0027ll look at that one.Additional reporting by agencies.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And it is currently under review by the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC), due to report to Boris Johnson’s government by the end of this month.If lower-paid EU workers miss the deadline to apply for the new status, they may never be allowed to work in the UK again, as they would be treated as new migrants below the salary threshold, said Mr Evans.Created with Sketch. Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.His warning came as a senior cancer researcher said scientific support staff from EU nations were already being put off applying for jobs in the UK because they fear they will be caught by the salary requirement.“One of the first questions they ask me is ‘Is the UK still open to immigration?’” said Cancer Research chief clinician Prof Charles Swanton, describing the loss of skilled EU workers as “potentially catastrophic” to scientific work.EU Parliament has ‘grave concerns’ about Home Office settlement schemeCurbs on legal challenges to be fast-tracked ‘in revenge for Brexit’EU confirms there will be border checks inside UK under Brexit dealPM condemned by peers over plans to let courts overrule EU lawHe told BBC Radio 4’s Today: “I see no justification for a salary threshold for highly skilled workers. We have some incredibly skilled workers who are paid a lot less than £30,000 a year.”Speaking on the eve of Thursday’s publication of new Home Office statistics on the processing of applications for settled status, Mr Evans called on businesses to ensure that staff are helped to obtain settled status, which will allow people with more than five years’ residence in the UK to continue to live and work in the country after June 2021.He warned of a “forgotten Brexit” for EU nationals who fail to register for the new status and are forced to leave the country or fall into a precarious life of undocumented work in the black economy.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by email“Businesses have an obligation to support their workforces and reach out through their supply chains to ensure that any EU staff and their dependants are helped through the scheme,” Mr Evans told a seminar in London. “The damage to British industry and the risks of thousands being forced into unemployment, or undocumented work and possibly modern slavery must not become the forgotten Brexit.”And he added: “Brexit must not become this generation’s Windrush. History has shown us that promises made now are not always upheld later and we must act now to ensure EU nationals continue to be protected by their fundamental rights.”The most recent Home Office statistics, released last month, showed nearly 2.6 million EU, EEA and Swiss citizens had applied for settled status by the end of November.More than 2.2 million of the claims have been completed, with 59 per cent receiving settled status and 41 per cent “pre-settled status”, which allows them to remain in the UK until they have totted up a full five years’ residence before applying to switch to full settlement.Despite a success rate of almost 100 per cent for those whose applications have been processed, Mr Evans said many EU nationals were believed to be putting off filling in their forms or to be unaware of what they need to do, with the vast majority thought to be in employment in the UK.“The future salary threshold for EU nationals coming to work in post-Brexit Britain has been well publicised at a possible £30,000,” he said.“For many, their income will fall below this level and understandably, they are worried about completing their applications for fear of being rejected. It is vital we debunk this myth, and employers take action to ensure their workers are guided through the settled status process to secure the status and rights that they are eligible for and to prevent disruption to business operations.”With the future supply of EU workers at risk, the Aire Centre said it was even more vital for\u0026nbspbusinesses to hold on to their current workforce, particularly as iniduals from EU nations are likely to be over-qualified for the roles they have in the UK.According to figures from Oxford University’s Migration Observatory, EU nationals make up 7 per cent of the UK labour market, with the figure rising to 21 per cent among low-skilled jobs in the factory and construction sectors. Retail and manufacturing are also particularly dependent on European staff, with 50 per cent of all EU nationals in the UK working in these industries.Susan Banister of the Slave-Free Alliance warned that many people from mainland Europe are working in conditions of modern slavery in the UK, trying to pay off debts to organised crime groups, and risk missing out on settled status because they are unaware of their rights.“It is in the gangs’ interests to not tell these people about their rights, especially the need to apply for EU settled status,” she told the meeting. “If they lost their legal status this makes them more vulnerable and more reliant on the traffickers. They are truly trapped in modern slavery.”The Migration Observatory’s director Madeleine Sumption, said: “EU workers are employed right across the UK labour market, from science and research positions to low-wage factory jobs.“More than half of highly-educated workers born in new EU member states were in low and medium low-skilled jobs in 2018. This means they are more likely to work in jobs for which they are over-qualified, one of the reasons EU citizens have been so attractive to UK employers. A range of industries have become quite dependent on this workforce. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“The government faces a big challenge getting all EU citizens through the settlement scheme.“Regardless of how easy it is to apply and how well the scheme is communicated, there will inevitably be people who simply don’t realise that they have to do it.“This challenge is compounded by the fact that there are no accurate figures on how many people are eligible to apply: the most commonly used estimate of 3.4 million is almost certainly too low. So it’s possible that hundreds of thousands of EU citizens could fail to apply without this being clear from the data.“One of the big questions for the next couple of years will therefore be whether the deadline is extended or, as some have suggested, removed entirely.”Mr Evans said: “The contribution EU workers make to the UK economy and to business is unquestioned, but many are put off by the red tape and complicated process.

Visas and other bureaucracy were also streamlined.Notably the Portuguese government has also promised a 50 per cent income tax cut until 2023 to tempt back Portuguese emigrants who have left the country for at least three years.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Taiwanese soldiers operate a CM-11 battle tank during an exercise at a military base in Kaohsiung, southern TaiwanA resident who briefly returned home to retrieve belongings carries figurines of Jesus Christ and Mother Mary in Laurel, Batangas province, Philippines.

He added that 12 existing reserves will also be expanded, including Qumran, where the Dead Sea Scrolls were fdiscovered in caves 70 years ago.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Bennett, who heads\u0026nbspthe pro-settlement New Right party, said the reserves will be located in Area C, which makes up 61 per cent of the West Bank and is under total Israeli control.The lands will include the Jordan Valley, which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he planned to annex ​in September.Israeli settlements in the West Bank are considered illegal under international law and detrimental to a widely accepted two-state solution to the decades-long Israeli-Palestine conflict.Created with Sketch.Trump backs Israel’s annexation of Golan Heights Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An Israeli soldier stands next to signs pointing out distances to different cities on Mount Bental, an observation post in the Israeli-occupied Golan HeightsDruze people take part in a rally in Majdal Shams near the ceasefire line between Israel and SyriaIsraeli Druzes sit together watching the Syrian side of the Israel-Syria border on the Israeli-occupied Golan HeightsA European member of the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) using binoculars to look towards the Syrian side of the Golan HeightsA file photo taken on October 19, 1973 shows Israeli Defence Minister General Moshe Dayan (R) looking towards the Syrian side of the Golan Heights, four days after the beginning of the Yom Kippur WarA file photo taken on the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on September 5, 2014 shows members of the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force Zone (UNDOF) using binoculars to look towards the Syrian side of the Golan HeightsMembers of the United Nations peacekeepers standing on a watch tower during a visit by the Israeli Defence Minister in 2018An Israeli soldier stands next to signs pointing out distances to different cities on Mount Bental, an observation post in the Israeli-occupied Golan HeightsDruze people take part in a rally in Majdal Shams near the ceasefire line between Israel and SyriaIsraeli Druzes sit together watching the Syrian side of the Israel-Syria border on the Israeli-occupied Golan HeightsA European member of the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) using binoculars to look towards the Syrian side of the Golan HeightsA file photo taken on October 19, 1973 shows Israeli Defence Minister General Moshe Dayan (R) looking towards the Syrian side of the Golan Heights, four days after the beginning of the Yom Kippur WarA file photo taken on the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on September 5, 2014 shows members of the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force Zone (UNDOF) using binoculars to look towards the Syrian side of the Golan HeightsMembers of the United Nations peacekeepers standing on a watch tower during a visit by the Israeli Defence Minister in 2018According to Israeli rights group Peace Now, which monitors settlement expansion, more than a third of the proposed location of the new reserves is on private Palestinian land, making it illegal even under Israeli law.Mr Bennett was quoted as saying:\u0026nbsp“Today we provide a big boost for the land of Israel and will continue to develop the Jewish communities in Area C\u0026nbspwith actions, not with words.\u0026nbspMr Bennett said it would be the first time such a decision was taken since the Oslo Accords were signed in the 1990s.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Nature reserves and national parks have also been used to prevent Palestinian construction,” Mr Reeves told The Independent.“Under international law, any Israeli building or designation in the West Bank is illegal. But 38 per cent of these lands are on private Palestinian land adding a second layer of illegality under Israel’s own laws.“They are trying to slowly take over Area C as if this wasn’t occupied territory. No two-state solution could envision 61 per cent of the West Bank being part of Israel.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

She askedthey wanted to join her in the “mile-high club”, then attacked cabin crew who refused her more alcohol.Demi Burton tried to headbutt and kick six crew members and passengers who tried to restrain her before she was arrested when the plane landed.In court, the -year-old claimed she had been drinking because she has a fear of flying and said this behaviour is out of character, which may be true.Her defence lawyer Martin Callery said: “She is thoroughly ashamed of herself . . .  and utterly embarrassed at the way she behaved.”But that is certainly not the impression she conveyed outside court, where she gleefully flicked obscene hand gestures at photographers.No doubt she stopped smiling when she heard she had been sentenced to six months in prison. Personally, I’m not sure how effective prison is. But the problem with reckless behaviour is that you have to face the consequences.And I really hope for Demi, this is the moment she gets her le back on track. We all make mistakes. It’s what we do afterwards that defines us.It would be easy to assume that Demi is a hopeless case. But she is young enough to turn her le around, to work hard, do better and see this rock-bottom moment as a catalyst for change.And then something good will come from what is a very low moment in her le. We don’t have to look far for examples of people who have overcome lapses or mistakes before going on to succeed.Take Robert Downey Jr, who went from drug addict to one of Hollywood’s highest-paid actors. Or Elton John and Robbie Williams, both of whom have overcome major drug issues before enjoying renewed stardom, fatherhood and, more importantly, a good le.While it is not the same as a drunken mistake, anyone who has made it in business will have a good few failures under their belt — whether it is a dodgy commercial decision, plain bad luck or a company that has gone bust.It is not what happens to us in le but what we do next that counts. So I am guessing that, from her cell, Demi might be reflecting on what she might do dferently when she gets out. Andshe isn’t, she should be.Because it is the getting back on the horse that counts, evenit means resisting the urge to go back to bed to hide. No one is perfect. No one gets through le without messing up or things going wrong.Before success, you will get temporary defeat or total failure. The key to getting through it is resilience. And one of the best gts you can give a child is to encourage them not to give up.By the way, I speak here from experience. Like any businesswoman, I’ve made some mistakes and had my fair share of knocks.There are some that I have managed to turn to my advantage and others that I have had to chalk up to experience.The key thing is that I have learned from what went wrong, then moved on. That experience has allowed me to create a mini-manesto on how to fail how to respond to setbacks and failure, which I’ll share here now:Give yourself time to recover and reflect. Force yourself to take small steps to get back on the horse. Do not accept failure. See it as a step on the journey towards success.Remember that challenging and dficult moments are what help you grow bigger or better. Without them, you would stay the same.The only people who haven’t experienced setbacks are people who are too scared to try. So “failure” is often a sign of bravery. Hold your head up high at all times.Try your best and be proud to do so, eventhings don’t always work out the way you want them to. Remind yourself: “Where there is a will, there’s a way.” And as they say, the best thing about the future is it comes one day at a time.ANOTHER new year, another month of looking at photos of scantily clad people on beaches in sunnier climes and asking myselfI am the only person who is not on the beach.This is the time of year for massive bikini-body and holiday FOMO.But let us all take heart that it is also, oh joy, the time of year for elasticated waists hidden under chunky knitwear.Personally, I am more than happy to swap the beach for nothing to shave and no stomach to suck in. Bliss.I’M sure parents everywhere were shocked to read the story of the son who bullied his mother and stepfather so viciously he has been jailed for three years for his controlling and coercive behaviour.When Nicholas Hazell, , of County Durham, went back to live with Judith Ridley, , and her reverend husband Stephen, , after losing his job, he made their lives hell.Hazell, above, created a “horrendous atmosphere” at the family home and flew into a petulant ragehe didn’t get his own way, Durham Crown Court heard.Among his worst outbursts were when Hazell threw his mother into a chair and spat at her while holding a screwdriver to his stepfather’s throat. He also told them: “I am a master of bullying.”It sounds horric.I feel so sorry for his mum, who must be devastated that her little boy turned into a cruel bully as an adult.I dont do needles when it comes to my face.  Lasers, facials, peels . . .  sure. But needles are another story entirely.If you are willing to take the chance of injecting poison into your face, at the very least you want a predictable result. And in my experience, you don’t get it.Who wants eyebrows at the top of their head, lips that come into the room before you do, or a forehead that doesn’t move  Not me, that’s for sure. However . . .This week I read that not only is the gorgeous Abbey Clancy having micro-Botox injections, hyaluronic acid fillers and vitamins, she is doing it with TWENTY needles at once.Abbey, , is having something called an aquagold facial, so called because each needle is covered in -carat gold. The marketing blurb claims this treatment will reduce pores, blur out fine lines and leave your skin with a vibrant glow.Some might say this is a slippery slope to the stronger stuff but Abbey looks amazing.  So it has to be worth a try, don’t you think I HAD to laugh at the photos of the BBC newsreader whose dress, which had burst open minutes before going on air, was cobbled together from behind by quick-thinking colleagues.  Liz Beacon’s outfit was patched up with gaffer tape and bulldog clips.I used to believe what I saw on TV. But since filming The Apprentice, I know all too well that all is not necessarily what it seems.Two examples spring to mind. First, the countless times I have been filmed in the boardroom with a smart jacket on top and leggings or even pyjama bottoms and slippers under the boardroom table.Second, and worse, the time I somehow forgot to bring a bra on a day I was wearing a white blouse.Luckily, a kind crew member who is roughly the same size as me lent me hers.  And the show, as it always seems to do, went on.I WAS appalled to read about the private Islamic secondary school that has been “unlawfully segregating” boys and girls for all activities except weekly assemblies, according to a stinging Ofsted report.One of the teachers theretold pupils “university is not for females”, according to the report. Which begs the question of where, then, is the best place for females  The kitchen Inspectors who visited Birmingham’s Redstone Educational Academy in November last year also found male students were given privileges and treated more favourably than their female counterparts when it came to sports, school trips and work experience.That was something disputed by the headteacher.That’s not good enough. There can be no place for a school like this and it should be closed down.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Perhaps this explains why his Wikipedia entry has just been doctored to delete his status as a “millionaire”. Not me, guv, protests Starmer.He is also weirdly reluctant to declare where he stands on the political spectrum. Is he a Corbynite or a Blairite or a bit of both  “I don’t have the names of former leaders tattooed on my head,” snfs the man named at birth after the first leader of the Labour Party.This knight of the realm, who played violin at fee-paying Reigate Grammar School alongside Fatboy Slim, claims a humble background as the son of a toolmaker.“I know what it’s like,” he insists, asraised in a cardboard box.Well, I went to the same school when it was a “bog-standard” state grammar. My father was a journeyman upholsterer. It didn’t give me any special insights.Starmer boasts in his new campaign video about picket-line stints alongside down- trodden Wapping printworkers — against my boss, Rupert Murdoch, a hate figure on the Left.This chameleon politician was dubbed a “Sir” on the recommendation of Gordon Brown, a title he discourteously declines to use because it invites contempt among those with a vote.His citation was for “services to law and criminal justice”, after a five-year term as DPP.At about the same time he was parachuted into Parliament as MP for rock-solid Labour Holborn and St Pancras, in London.It is here that self-respecting Labour voters should pause and reflect.Many believe these political plums were reward for the longest, costliest and perhaps most spiteful criminal persecution in history — ordered by Sir Keir Starmer.His new leadership video slyly refers to this time, apparently to boost his scourge-of-capitalism image among the “comrades” — even though politics should play no part in a DPP’s decision-making. In a travesty of justice, he rammed two dozen innocent journalists through Old Bailey trials on trumped-up conspiracy charges — a medieval catch-all which even the Crown Prosecution Service admitted was “an extremely dficult and rarely visited area of the law”.The prosecuting counsel was given a flea in his ear for “chopping and changing”, the charges against the journalists.The trials ended with acquittals all round, an admission that “no crime may have been committed” and this rebuke from the Lord Chief Justice:“What concerns me is the freedom of the Press and the desire of officials to contain information.“We must ensure the Press is protected — we can’t use criminal sanctions to undermine their position.”The defendants were all journalists on The Sun or the News of the World — then seen by the Left as fair game.The trials followed The Sun’s decision to switch its support from Gordon Brown’s floundering regime to David Cameron’s Tories.Some believe the two were linked — but surely that’s just a conspiracy theory.What is absolutely clear to those who care about the issue is Starmer’s readiness to use his power to curb Press freedom.As citizens of totalitarian regimes rapidly learn to their cost, without a free Press there is no such thing as free speech.IT’S win-win for the Sussexes and losses all round for the House of Windsor.Meghan’s first kiss-and-tell will be a bestseller, with all the gossip on Randy Andy and those secret royal scandals.Harry’s right-on charities will be milked for millions.Once our revered Queen has departed, the monarchy will dwindle to a sideshow on the US celebrity circuit.Charles is too old to compete and William is too dull, despite Kate’s best efforts.Hero Harry will emerge as victor in this grotesque civil war. I predict he will live to regret it. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are rich beyond the wildest dreams of almost everyone in the UK.They are more than capable of paying for a few bodyguards. Andthey find themselves struggling, they could always cut down on the private jets.The Queen, Charles and Wills must be firm: the Sussexes have made their bed. Now they’ve got to lie in it.A CIVILISED nation treats its veterans with respect.Which is why we were delighted when Boris Johnson won the election on a manesto promising to end witch hunt prosecutions against ageing former soldiers who served in Northern Ireland.But to get Stormont up and running, the Prime Minister has brokered a deal with Sinn Fein which risks opening up new probes into thousands of Troubles veterans. This would be morally indefensible and politically mad.Yes, a working government in Northern Ireland would be a good thing. But the safety and wellbeing of our elderly veterans is too big a price tag.And given Boris won the election by being a proud patriot, it makes political sense for him to stand by the armed forces through thick and thin.If the PM is to hold the hard-earned trust of new Conservative voters, he must never give way to those who would put our old soldiers in the dock.IT would be fair to assume that anyone injecting plastic into someone’s face should have some qualications to do so.But a strange loophole in the law means that though Botox is classied as a medicine in Britain, dermal fillers aren’t covered by any regulation.A staggering  per cent of facial fillers are performed by people with no medical training, often in unsanitary conditions — with devastating results.Which is why The Sun’s Fabulous brand is launching the Had Our Fill campaign, urging for a crackdown on unregulated cosmetic fillers, and raising awareness to help women make safer, more informed choices.We’ve had our fill of dodgy fillers.

Letting them keep their titles to amass a Kardashian-sized fortune cashing in on their royal status will be a grotesque abuse of the monarchy and taxpayers who fund it.What will the public get in   Nothing.Meanwhile this revered ,-year-old institution will be reduced to an Instagram marketing tool for one jaw- droppingly self-centred young couple.We never really thought this scandal could threaten the monarchy.But its image looks in mortal danger and its finances may have to be rapidly reviewedHarry and Meghan still receive seven-figure sums from Charles despite having £million in the bank.We appreciate the Queen’s plight, at  and wanting only the best for the grandson she loves.But this was a moment not for a fudge but for ruthlessness to secure the monarchy’s future: No money, no titles, no using the royal name.Do your duty, in full, or go it alone, in full, as private citizens.At least we heard one dose of sound sense — when Home Secretary Priti Patel angrily rubbished leftie claims that the Press, and Britain, is “racist” towards Meghan.It is fact-free drivel.And this is just about the LEAST prejudiced nation on Earth.This couple have simply raised the bar for self-obsessed, arrogant entitlement.WE sympathise with Labour members ­having to feign enthusiasm for the remaining contenders for Jeremy Corbyn’s job.Mind you, the five finalists could barely do worse than Jezza, possibly except his naive disciple Rebecca Long-Bailey, the Tories’ dream candidate.The rest include sneering Islington lawyer Emily Thornberry, whose loathing of working-class Britain is mutual. And gobby Jess Phillips, who thinks insulting Boris alone will win her power.There’s Lisa Nandy, almost certainly too sensible. And then there’s millionaire QC Sir Keir Starmer, the favourite and the only bloke left, which means Labour is almost sure to pick him since its “ersity” is a pose.But let’s shatter one Labour delusion.None of these scares the Tories. The election’s over. The Government has an -seat majority and five years in power.So we have three suggestions for Labour: bin Twitter, which has been disastrously discombobulating for the party.Forget your juvenile morality war against Boris. It has already failed.Then work out how to persuade voters in  you won’t turn Britain into Venezuela. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridLOADEDcustomwww.thesuncustom%Fwp-admin%Fpost.phpcustomlinkangoodt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridBEFORE_OPTOUT_REQt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridFINISHEDcustomwww.thesunt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridOPTOUT_RESPONSE_OKt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\" Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Why let reality spoil the narrative These claims made about the “racist” treatment of Meghan at the hands of the British Press are incredibly thin.The same non-examples are recycled over and over again. You have probably seen them quoteda thousand times.There is that Mail Online piece from , when Harry and Meghan were first dating, that said she was “ straight outta Compton”.At the time, Meghan’s mother Doria Ragland lived in nearby Crenshaw, LA.Hirsch says this was an attempt to link Meghan with “racialised forms of crime”, meaning gangs.That is one hell of a reach. The piece was clearly just playing on the dference in Harry and Meghan’s social backgrounds.If Harry had been dating a white, working-class woman from Manchester’s Moss Side, I dare say the Mail would have done something similarly silly.Another favourite is that weird throwaway line Boris Johnson’s sister Rachel wrote, in a laudatory piece on Meghan, about the mixed-race American actress bringing some “rich and exotic DNA” to the pale Windsor bloodline. That is more cringey than racist.Several pieces have cited a single phrase in a Sarah Vine column for the Mail — she said she had a “niggling worry” about the royal couple’s engagement photo — as a bigoted dog whistle. That is, quite frankly, mental.Such is the lack of actual examples of the Press being racist about Meghan.The only leg this argument has left to stand on is that the sheer volume of criticism sent Meghan’s way was disproportionate.Racism is the only explanation for it. It’s an argument based purely on unveriable speculation and imputing motives. It is also b*****ks.When the couple first got together, the coverage was gushing across the board.It was only when Meghan and Harry started on their ious virtue-signalling cru-sades — such as jetting around to lecture on climate change — that people’s backs went up.That the couple had already been beefing with the Press probably didn’t help either.In , way before Meghan became a figure in our culture wars, Harry issued a remarkable statement rebuking journalists for the “racial undertones” of their pieces.That these privileged royals, kept in the lap of luxury at taxpayers’ expense, began to develop a deep-seated victim complex only heightened the resentment towards them.Last year, Meghan told ITV public le was a “struggle” and she was shocked that “not many people have askedI’m OK”. Poor princess.This picture of privilege is who the liberal Left has spent the best part of three years defending.Even supposed republicans have — after a bit of anti-royal throat-clearing — defended Harry and Meghan to the hilt and helped con- struct this absurd narrative that they are the victims of establishment racism.This says far more about the prejudices of liberal-Left commentators than it does about the tabloid Press. They routinely suggest Meghan’s supposed mistreatment in Brexit Britain is no coincidence.They think Britain is a foul place full of foul people, brainwashed by foul news- papers to hate the wonderful Duchess of Sussex and the brilliant European Union.What the liberal elite’s Meghanmania shows us is that, for all their posturing against right-wingers, monarchy and the old aristocracy, they are comfortable with the plebs being led, instructed and hectored by our betters.They would just rather it was woke people doing it, like Harry and Meghan. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridLOADEDcustomwww.thesuncustom%Fwp-admin%Fpost.phpcustomlinkangoodt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridBEFORE_OPTOUT_REQt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridFINISHEDcustomwww.thesunt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridOPTOUT_RESPONSE_OKt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\" Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

For how much did they really know about each other before walking down the aisle Prince William apparently advised his more impetuous brother to wait so he could really get to know his American bride first, but Harry took umbrage and didn’t listen.Perhapshe had, he might have worked out in advance that an independent spirit joining such a restrictive institution wasn’t going to end well.Instead, they leapt before they looked and, with the “-month bride” having packed her bags already, have saddled the -year-old Queen with yet another constitutional crisis.Back in , I wrote a piece defending Meghan after she was criticised by old school friend Ninaki Priddy for being “calculated in the way she handled people and relationships” and a “curator of a beautul le”.But following the lavish baby shower, the jet-setting with A-listers and the swt jettisoning of inconveniently outspoken family members, the latter sentiment now rings true.And, of course, becoming a member of the most famous royal family in the world was the cherry on the top of that beautul le.But Meghan soon discovered it was nothing like the membership of her beloved Soho House.The rooms are draughty, the decor chintzy and, instead of reading the morning papers in your cashmere loungewear, you have to rise early, put on a frock and make your way to some rain-lashed outpost to open the new wing of a community centre where “live your best le” sentiments, however well-meaning, aren’t required.Here’s what is required as a member of the British Royal Family: Turn up on time, shake hands, smile, say little more than “have you come far ” Repeat.Not because the royals don’t have anything to say. They do, and air their views in private.But in public, their job is to shine a light on whatever project they’re visiting, not themselves. To show — via action, not virtue-signalling statements — a strong sense of duty.And inthey get to keep their ious mansions, hundreds of staff, personal bodyguards etc without any whf of civil unrest.That’s the deal.But those still in Meghan’s social circle glowingly describe her as organised, focused, and opinionated — very much an independent woman used to having her voice heard.As Prince Harry told courtiers just before their wedding: “What Meghan wants, Meghan gets.”An admirable quality when it comes to breaking through the glass ceiling of corporate le or securing the best table in the best restaurant, perhaps.But the monarchy is an institution steeped in hundreds of years of tradition, and Meghan — who claimed she “didn’t know much” about Harry when they first met — clearly thought she’d mould it to her way of thinking . . . then rapidly discovered that it ain’t for turning.Not that The Queen didn’t try very hard to accommodate the wants and needs of the newly anointed Duke and Duchess of Sussex.Contrary to royal tradition, they were permitted to keep the christening of baby Archie as a private affair and, despite there being a perfectly nice home at Kensington Palace they could have used, a publicly funded, £.million renovation of Frogmore Cottage was authorised.A “cottage” I might add, that used to be five homes but has now been knocked in to one because they managed to dodge the usual ban that prevents such moves because of the UK’s housing crisis.Shortly after, Prince Charles launched his blueprint to try to solve the dilemma faced by millions of young people struggling to find a home of their own. Oh the irony. And after all that, they now want to use it part-time as they flit back and forth across the Atlantic.Meghan is feeling disillusioned and homesick. We get it, and sympathise.But let’s not pretend, as some claim, that she’s been practically pitchforked off this island by racist bigots.This is not a racist country and, besides, the British public initially greeted her engagement and later marriage to Harry with unbridled joy.We love Harry. He’s a thoroughly decent person and deserves particular praise for the work he’s done with the Armed Forces, both while serving and afterwards.No, the disconnect has come from the fact that Meghan is still a Hollywood celebrity at heart and, consequently, never truly settled in her often boring and restrictive new role.She misses the relative freedom of her old le, not to mention her family and friends.Again, we get it. But was it really necessary to flee these shores asescaping for her le Clearly besotted with her, Harry faces the stark decision of giving her what she wants or losing her for ever. Or perhaps he’s genuinely sick of royal le and wants out too.If so, let’s wave goodbye and wish them luck.But. The have-cake-and-eat-it plan to stop being a “senior royal” and just dip in and out of duties that suit them simply isn’t going to work.SussexRoyal — which Harry and Meghan have registered as an official trademark for everything from “emotional support services” to clothing and magazines — is a title and privilege that comes with duties and conditions attached, not a brand, be it charitable or otherwise.The future of the monarchy depends on the goodwill, support and interest level of the public, and a recent survey showed that, while the majority have no issue with their decision to go, they were strongly against any continued taxpayer funding of their lavish lestyle.So— as early indicators go — The Queen allows Harry and Meghan to call the shots while keeping their royal titles, their taxpayer-funded security and an allowance from the Duchy of Cornwall, then one suspects this will be discussed by students for centuries to come as the turning point at which the British monarchy began its steady decline to irrelevance and, ultimately, abolition.MOVIE mega-star Will Smith popped in to the retirement party of a woman he last met  years ago.Anita Scipio was the receptionist at a US radio station when Will arrived for one of his first interviews as a young actor and he’s never forgotten how nice she was to him.“My favorite moments on the road are the ones where I can connect with people like @anitascipio,” -year-old Will told his Instagram followers before he walked in to the station to give her a hug.In the days before social media, someone who worked at his record company Sony told me that whenever he was in town, Will would tour the building, from post room to boardroom, giving time to everyone.He’s that rare creature, a star on screen and off.Some of today’s petulant slebs should watch and learn.FORMER psychiatric nurse Susan Evans is launching a landmark legal case to challenge consent issues around the provision of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones for under-s.She argues that children should be protected from “experimental” and “invasive medical treatment”, not least because “some children are referred despite having autism, being homosexual or suffering some form of trauma or sexual abuse”.Speaking on Radio , she added that children as young as nine were being asked to consent “to a completely experimental treatment for which long-term consequences are not known”.But gender ersity advocates warn that “a loss to trans youth is a loss to all”.Time will tell the outcome of her case but, meanwhile, in unrelated comments, I note that the actor Rupert Everett says he spent most of his early childhood wanting “to be a girl”.He adored his mother, aunt and grandmother, didn’t like men, and adds: “I loved necklaces and bras and all those kinds of things.”Then, when he reached , he “didn’t want to be a girl any more. I really enjoyed being a homosexual”.The case in point, perhaps, for treading very carefully indeed with pre-teens.POLICE officers will be required to have degrees from this year – a move that could remove , recruits from the front line while they complete their studies.Sigh.

While I have bought several mobile phones, I have never gone shopping for an entire telecoms network.But surely there must be other potential contractors. Don’t we have a telecoms industry of our own It doesn’t say much for the Government’s privatisation of BTit is not in the running for this sort of work.What about our own Vodafone, which I thought was one of the world leaders in mobile phone technology Evendepriving Huawei of the work meant we had to wait a little longer or pay a little extra to download a movie to our phones, that would surely be a reasonable price to pay for protecting national security.And national security policy really is at stake.Yesterday the US reaffirmed that allowing Huawei to build our G network — even parts of it which are deemed to be low- risk — would be “madness” and could compromise the willingness of the US to share vital intelligence with Britain in future.This didn’t come in one of Donald Trump’s notorious am tweets but from officials working for Matt Pottinger, the US deputy national security adviser, and Robert Blair, special representative for international telecommunications policy.That they took the trouble to visit London to warn of the dangers we could be getting ourselves into ought to be seen as a red flag on Huawei’s involvement in our G network.Surely, the importance of being able to share intelligence with our most important ally should rank above pure considerations of cost.Australia has already blocked the Chinese firm from its G network.Yet here, the head of MI Sir Andrew Parker said he had “no reason” to think Britain’s intelligence partnership with the US would sufferinvolvement from the Chinese firm was given the green light.But Defence Secretary Ben Wallace underlined at the weekend that the US administration has threatened to cut off some intelligenceBritain approves Huawei’s involvement in G.He said: “Those things will be taken into account when the Government collectively decides to make a decision on it.”Our own Government — as it has been doing since Theresa May’s day — insists that only parts of the G contract would be awarded to Huawei.It would not be allowed to work on security-critical areas.But that isn’t good enough. Such is the complexity of modern telecommunications networks that it would be impossible to be sure that systems installed in one part of the network were not enabling data to be obtained from another.Whoever designs and builds a telecommunications system gains the power to interfere with it, or even switch it off, should it feel inclined.Of course, with modern communications a huge amount of damage can be done from afar.Evenwe are confident our broadband network is secure now, we can’t be certain that would remain the case.A company which installs a telecommunications network will necessarily continue to be involved in maintaining and upgrading the network it had designed and installed.We have to be absolutely sure the network is not being used for some underhand purpose.Huawei denies that it is controlled by the Chinese state, and has threatened to sue commentators in France whom it alleges have made that claim.But the precise relationship between Huawei and the Chinese state is hardly the point.What is certain is that China is not a democracy and there is always going to be a security issue when it comes to involving its industrial giants in sensitive work here.We would not allow a Chinese company, say, to build fighter jets for the RAF or to construct our radar defence system.This kind of work is rightly the preserve of contractors on whom we can rely totally, even in times of international conflict.Such is the importance of telecommunications in military and civil defence that we now have to think of mobile networks in the same light.The Government has been warning for years that cyber warfare is the big coming threat.In  it published a Strategic Defence Review which defined cyber attack as a “Tier One” threat alongside terrorism.Last November, the US and Taiwanese held a joint exercise in fending off a major cyber attack on Taiwan.At the time the Taiwanese Cyber Security Agency said it was the subject of an astonishing million cyber attacks every month, half of which came from the Chinese mainland.So why, then, is our own Government even considering commissioning a Chinese company to install a telecommunications network Of course, Boris Johnson is right to make it clear he is not Donald Trump’s poodle.We don’t have to take notice of everything the Americans say, on defence, trade or anything .But when it comes to our closest ally warning us that it might not want to share intelligence with us in futurewe let a Chinese company build our G network, we very much do need to take notice.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Harry and Meghan have said they wish to be “independent”. A lot of time has been spent working out how that independence can be achieved.Well, here’s the thing. I have a cunning plan for the Sussexes as to how they might be “independent”.What you need to do is get something called a “job”.If you get one of those they give you money which you can use to buy things — a house, some Pot Noodles, a Hot Wheels car racing set — anything, really, within reason.  Remarkable, isn’t it It probably wouldn’t pay for the £million Canadian mansion Meghan is holed up in right now — but they can always ponce a few freebies off their mega-rich friends.It might not quite cover the legal costs Meghan may incur from her upcoming court case. She’s suing a newspaper and her dad is set to testy AGAINST her.You have to say she has a knack, this lass, of getting on the wrong side of quite a few people.I think it’s fair to guess that the Royal Family are not entirely happy with her right now. So she’s hacked off her new family much as she’s hacked off her own one.It’s no huge surprise they’re both heading off to “Canada” .Meghan seems not to like the UK very much. She doesn’t spend much time in it and my suspicion is that the local people haven’t entirely taken to her.We had a bit of time for Harry, once. He seemed an amiably thick rugger-bugger with a mischievous sense of humour. Not any more, sadly.He seems to spend half of his time crying. And he also seems to have swallowed whole the air-headed, ultra-woke, touchy-feely drivel his we has imported from the United States.Still, we were happy to spend an extortionate sum doing up their “cottage” with the most expensive materials money could buy. And we were delighted to see photographs of young Archie — once we were allowed to by madam.For someone who dislikes the starchy formality of the Royal Family, Meghan displays quite a few airs and graces, doesn’t she Hates being photographed and gets her bullying minders to stop people taking snaps. Loves being photographed when she’s promoting herself or her vacuous ideas.But hey, they love each other and that’s the important thing.Let them move to Canada or LA, where they can jabber to each other about climate change and how everyone who doesn’t like her is racist, until the cows come home.But let them do it entirely independently. No money from the Duchy of Cornwall Estate. No royal stipend. No security staff paid for by the taxpayers, either here or there.Let them be truly independent, which is what they seem to wish for.Maybe they’ll find it liberating. Or maybe in a year or two Prince Harry will wake up and think: Crikey, what have I done.DO you remember when you first had a McDonald’s  I remember very well. I was  and had just come down to London from Middlesbrough.My girlfriend told me about these wonderful things called Big Macs. I tried one – couldn’t believe how delicious it was. So I bought another, and then another.Stood there, stuffing my fat face, eyes wide with delight.As the years go by, the pleasure diminishes a little – there’s nothing better than tasting something delicious for the first time.So lucky, lucky people of Rutland. The UK’s smallest county is to have its first ever McDonald’s.A lot of poncey residents opposed this happening because they said it would “lower the tone” of the county.Now the snobs can find out what they’ve been missing all these years.RIVETED with excitement by the Labour leadership contest  It’s a real humdinger, isn’t it I had rather hoped David Lammy would stand, just to give us all a laugh. Sadly, he’s not going to.Ultra Trot Clive Lewis has pulled out. But Emily Thornberry, above – Lady Nugee to you, you lowly serf – is through to the next round.If she wins it will be the final nail in the coffin of this once-great party.SO, Manchester City’s underperforming stars hired a whole bunch of Instagram “models” to attend a party at some posh place in Cheshire.Flew them over from Italy, shoved them in a hotel, Bob’s yer uncle.The wives and girlfriends of the players were not invited to this party. Lovely bunch, footballers, aren’t they And was all of this sanctioned by the supposedly progressive and right-on manager, Pep Guardiola “That was not what I meant, Senor Aguero, when I said you had to get in the box more often.” HERE is yet another Re-moaner head case for you. Liberal Democrat peer Lord Greaves.He has said he fears Britain will be reminiscent of Nazi Germany when we finally leave the European Union. Yup, that’s a sane and rational judgment, you bearded loon.He added: “People are crying when they go to sleep at night and when they wake up in the morning, and all they get from the unfeeling, hard-headed Tories is moans.“They are feeling a sense of loss which is akin to bereavement, and a grieving process has only just begun.“In these circumstances, triumphalistic behaviour, festivals of Brexit and all the rest will simply make things worse.”Who is crying  What bereavement process  What kind of drugs is Lord Greaves taking Let’s all go round to his gaff on January  with a few cans of Stella and try to cheer him up.A BRITISH mum is leading a fightback against the drive to make our children cretins.The unnamed woman went on Mumsnet to explain that she turns the house wi off at .pm every night.And tells her three kids – the oldest is  – to read a book instead. Good for her. Children seem to use the internet for just three things.Bitching about thots in their school. And sending snap-shots of their genitals to -year-old men who are pretending to be teenagers.THERE was a rather cheering plan to ring out the church bells across the land to mark our escape from the European Union at the end of the month.But a bunch of bishops have said we shouldn’t do that because the bells should only be used to summon the faithful to worship.With the greatest of respect, your reverend, b*****ks. You can tell it’s nothing to do with that by their comments.One said: “Two thirds of the population never voted for Brexit in the first place. It’s deeply isive to ring church bells for something like this.”Yeah, Bish – we have a habit in this country of only counting the votes of people who voted, you mimsy frock-wearing halfwit.Another said: “I think we should be ringing bells on February , not to celebrate Brexit but to call people together to pray for our nation at this critical time.”Ah, go shove your bells up your cassock, you miserable Remoaner God-bothering bores.A UKRAINIAN bloke woke up one morning to discover a large metal nut around his old fella.His we had placed it there during the night to stop him shagging other women. And presumably her.It seems to have worked. He couldn’t get the thing off. So he went to hospital where they removed it with a circular saw which spat out sparks as it tore through the metal.I don’t think his todger will be doing very much at all for the foreseeable future.He should have kept the thing on.

The distinctive peal from its massive, .-ton bell is a part of the soundtrack of our public le.But sadly, it now seems likely that the advent of Brexit will be met by silence from Big Ben.If the parliamentary authorities have their way, no sound will echo from the clock tower on that momentous night.Since , the building has been undergoing a major renovation programme, including the installation of a lt, resurfacing of the dials, and restoration of the clock mechanism.According to the House of Commons Commission, which oversees the Westminster estate, the cost of interrupting this work to enable Big Ben to chime for Brexit would be more than £,.We are told this huge bill arises because of the need to install a temporary floor in the belfry to support the chiming equipment — as well as the impact of delays, for up to four weeks, in the renovation project.In the view of pessimistic officialdom, the whole idea of the Brexit chimes is just too expensive.As Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the new Speaker of the Commons, put it this week, “You are talking about £, a bong.”The arch-Remainers have, predictably, seized on the problem with glee.For them, the entire business is just like Brexit itself — a pointless, costly distraction.That negativity is shared by large parts of the civil service and Westminster establishment.Viewing Brexit with horror, they seek to prevent any inspirational commemoration of the event.So the supposed heavy costs give them the perfect excuse to do nothing, just as they used bureaucratic stalemate to thwart Brexit for years.Indeed, the Big Ben dficulty can be seen as ato Project Fear, once more, where dire financial warnings are deployed to frighten the public into inaction.But the British people did not give in to Project Fear , and they should not be cowered by more alarmism this time.The shrill negative voice of Remainers had dominated for too long.After the decisive General Election last month, that is the noise that should be hushed, not the chimes of Big Ben.Expressions of national pride are a force for benevolence and unity, as we witnessed in the recent cricket World Cup triumph.Despite all the Remainer gloom, there is a tremendous yearning to celebrate British-ness.That spirit can also be seen in the broad popular support for the idea of a new Festival of Britain, in , to extol the values of our nation.Once again, just as with their negativity over Big Ben, the pro-EU brigade sneered at the concept as nothing more than a Festival of Brexit, which could only enshrine entrenched isions.But in reality, just like the successful post-war Festival of Britain in , the  Festival could achieve the very opposite, by enabling us to reconnect with our identity, heritage and future.The same can be true of the Brexit chimes on January . It can be an occasion for joy and openness, not misery and fearfulness.Boris Johnson’s suggestion that the £, bill could be met by an appeal to the public is being scuppered by senior officials.In his usual inimitable style, Boris had asked for crowd-funding citizens to “bung a bob for a Big Ben bong”. There were signs the campaign could be taking off.The passionate Euro-sceptic MP Mark Francois pledged £,, while there was also speculation that millionaires such as Lord Ashcroft and Wetherspoon pub chain boss Tim Martin could make large donations.Officials yesterday said there was “no legal basis” for using public donations. So why shouldn’t the Government chip in  After all, the state is used to bankrolling exceptional national events, often at a far bigger cost.A reported £million went on Meghan and Harry’s wedding in .Most of that was swallowed up by security, but £, alone went on her bridal dress — which is not far off the cost of the Big Ben bongs.Similarly, the bill for the chimes is barely a quarter of the more than £million estimated to be spent on the official London fireworks display on New Year’s Eve.But before any money is handed over by the public or Treasury, the huge potential bill — £, to get the bell to chime, plus the £, cost of delays to the tower’s repair — must be challenged.In all kinds of major projects, because of weak management, contractors and consultants often expand the budgets for their own interests.We have seen that process with the HS rail link, now on course to cost over £billion, while even with the renovation of Big Ben the project’s bill has risen from an original £million to £million.On Tuesday night, one former project manager in Parliament said the estimate for the chimes had been absurdly inflated.“I cannot believe the costs you’re talking about,” he told LBC radio.The can-do, anti-establishment outlook ensured the victory of Brexit. With the same imagination and drive, the campaign for the Big Ben chimes can succeed.In fact, it could be the cue for a string of other celeb-rations across our land on January , like bonfires, fire-work displays or big screen-ings in city squares.But at the centre of it all has to be the Westminster clock tower. As Nigel Farage put it, “If Big Ben doesn’t sound, our country looks like a joke.”The miserabilists and pessimists must not get their way.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The mum-of-two was breastfeeding her baby when she was forced to run into the garden to rescue her dog and chase off the driver. Eilis, , has since received a box full of food treats from Amazon which came with the message: Not in the dog house. The delivery driver, who is understood to have become irritated by the presence of the dog, has been fired, according to the mum.  On Monday, Eilis complained about the incident on Facebook , writing: Disgusted with your carriers.Delivered my order and kicked my chihuahua six times before I chased the man out of my garden. Referring to a bone disorder which affects her petaposs hips, she added:having to take him to the vets as he already has Perthaposs disease and is seriously limping from this attack.  If he could do this to a dog, what could he do to a child  Eilis, who ordered the item on eBay but had it delivered by Amazon, expressed happiness that the driver had lost his job. She said: Iaposm happy he was sacked.  Iaposve never had anyone have a problem with a chihuahua. Crash was running around his feet barking. I think he thought it was acceptable to stand still and attempt to kick him instead of walking out of the gate. I had to leave the kids in the living room and try get my dogs away from him but because he was kicking them they obviously were running and barking more.  I had to run down the garden path in my dressing gown, no shoes to chase him away. Thataposs when he called me a b***h. I have a three-year-old and -month-old and my three-year old was upset and confused why I was running after a man in the garden.  Eilis later shared a photograph showing a box of crisps, fudge, popcorn, cookies and honeycomb dips Amazon had sent her in a box with the words not in the dog house. A gt note from Amazon read: Thank you for allowing us to work through your recent concerns. Kind regards Amazon Executive Customer Relations.  Eilis thanked the company in her reply and said that Crash was doing well, despite being a bit scared of outside.

A poll of , adults revealed the popular naturalist beat close rivals Stephen Fry and Richard Branson to be named the premier and move in to  Downing Street. Attenboroughaposs calming tones, love for the environment and popularity with people of all ages, saw him win more than a fth of the vote. Ant and Dec - doing the job together - also featured in the top  list, along with JK Rowling, Adele and Stormzy. The study, commissioned by Sky to launch its new action-packed political drama, COBRA, also saw England football manager Gareth Southgate and actress Helen Mirren among the top choices.  COBRA, airing on Sky One today , is set in the heart of government during a time of national crisis. It stars Robert Carlyle as Prime Minister Robert Sutherland, and Victoria Hamilton as his Chief of Staff, Anna Marshall, who must contend with impossible political decisions as they deal with a national emergency threatening the very stability of the UK. A spokesperson for Sky said: As a much loved and trusted figure, itaposs not a surprise that David Attenborough topped the poll for PM. As we have Robert Carlyle playing the Prime Minister in our new series COBRA we thought it would be fun to find out which celebrities the public thought would be best running the country.  Jeremy Clarkson came fourth in the poll, followed by Hugh Grant, who played a popular Prime Minister in  classic Love Actually. Piers Morgan, Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp and Harry Potter star Emma Watson were also among the popular candidates for the top job.

Hundreds of people joined a search to track down Pablo, Maggie, Charlie, Ralph and Jack but they were never found. Suspicious owners said they contacted police after Lawford, , stopped taking their calls.  Police said following an investigation there was insufficient evidence to charge her with theft. However, it emerged today that Lawford will be hauled before a court after Birmingham City Council accused of a string of animal welfare offences. Lawford, who ran Pawford Paws in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, will appear before Birmingham Magistratesapos Court next Thursday.She is accused of nine animal welfare offences, including five counts of undertaking group walks without insuring each dog had been vaccinated, allowing dogs off the lead without written consent and failing to contact the owners or dog warden immediately when dogs were lost.She also faces three counts of breaching conditions of the licence to operate a business providing home boarding for dogs and a charge of failing to provide veterinary treatment for a skin infection for a dog.The city council also confirmed Lawford, of Erdington, Birmingham, had her dog boarding licence revoked on June .

I actually can’t believe it’s actually happening. Michael and me have been together for over  years. He took his sweet time… over half of our relationship has been spent living with cancer. We’ve seen the absolute best and the absolute worst of each other. He’s been my nurse, I’ve been his reassurance when his strength dwindled. He’s been my psychologist, we’ve been each other’s laughter. We’ve lived apart and we’ve lived in each others pockets. He drives me absolutely mental sometimes and I know I do the same. But my god, I have never loved another boy man superhuman as much as I love my Michael Brown and I cannot wait until the day I walk dance skip run down the aisle and straight into his arms forever and ever. Amen. But now, we save, we diet, we plan. It’s bloody hard work. Now we’re parents of two . We’re skintand we’re trying to balance chemo cancer children and no financial help from the government. I’m not entitled to adoption pay because I haven’t earned enough in the last year . The only financial help our good old government has ever given us started last year which was a whopping £ per week. I’m due for my PIPS assessment again soon and the idea of it is making me ill. Last time, I was asked questions along the lines of aposdo you need someone to help you to wipe after you’ve been to the toiletapos. Just to make you feel all the more degraded. The bastards. I went for a job interview last week . Although I desperately need the job, I’m so worried about how I’m going to juggle it all too - chemo, children, saving for a wedding, bills, appointments, the school run, childcare etc and on top of this, the stress of the cancer coming back. I was copied into a letter this week from my wonderful consultant who is helping with my PIPS assessment. I saw the words incurable metastatic breast cancer and I felt sick. It’s just feeling too much at the mo. There are more pressures but I can’t talk about those just yet but they are having such a big impact on us. All I can say is roll on three months time. Sigh. Aaanyway, bloody hell, enough of all that negativity. Here I am, LIVING my le, planning a wedding and looking for jobs. I am bloody LUCKY! I know people who would give anything to have the secondchances I’ve been given. I’m testing out lots of products to use for our wedding. Tans, hair extensions because I want long hair for the big day. In the meantime, someone recommended Waterman’s for helping with hairgrowth. I started using it last week so I’ll let you know how I get on with it and anything I can get my hands on to help firm up my ageing skin . I read somewhere that chemotherapy ages you at twice the rate of a ‘normal’ person. So by rights, I’m . I’ve got my hands on some deeeelicious Coco  Eve tan and OMG I swear to you, I have never smelt anything so absolutely ine. I’m trying it out this week because tomorrow I’m trying on a dress that I’m hoping will be THE ONE. I’ve had a nightmare with the dress, which I won’t bore you with but I’m hoping - thanks to the power of Instagram that I’ve got quite a few options. I’ll be letting you all know what my favourite products are so keep your eyes peeled. And I was even featured in Cheshire Bride this month.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailCanadaaposs biggest newspaper has warned Meghan Markle and Prince Harry that they are not welcome to live there as a aposhalfway houseapos. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced last week they plan to quit the royal family and split their time between Britain and North America in a move which has sent shock waves through the monarchy. And with Harry likely to fly back to be with his we and son Archie on Vancouver Island before the end of the week, the Globe and Mail has dealt them a sucker punch. The scathing column, published on Monday, said Canada is not open to anyone looking to get out of Britain while remaining a royal. While Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted over Christmas the pair were always welcome as they spent the festive period in Vancouver, the newspaper has said the governmentaposs response should be a simple and succinct: No. The Globe and Mail went on to describe the Sussexesapos plans to move as vague and evolving and not something that Canada can allow. But this countryaposs unique monarchy, and its delicate yet essential place in our constitutional system, means that a royal resident – the prince is sixth in the line of succession – is not something that Canada can allow. It breaks an unspoken constitutional taboo, the article said.  And while the piece admitted Canadians like their own monarchy, with visits tending to produce outpourings of public enthusiasm no royals should set up a home on the premises. Instead, they prefer members of the Canadian firm to kept at armsand reign from a distance, adding: Close to our hearts, far from our hearths. Princes are not shipped over here when no useful duties can be found for them on the other side of the Atlantic, it continued. Canada welcomes people of all faiths, nationalities and races, butyouaposre a senior member of our Royal Family, this country cannot become your home.  There has been much debate about how the Sussexesapos plan to become financially independent will work, particularly when it comes to personal security. The editorial was adamant Canadaaposs issue with the move was not about the feds having to find a few million extra bucks to accommodate the couple. Instead it suggests Canadians are ided on the royal issue itself, but reports the government has offered to pay for Meghan and Harryaposs security at a cost of millions a year have angered many citizens. The Duke and Duchess removed a line from their new website claiming they are internationally protected people entitled to personal security wherever they go. One of the key points of discussion at Mondayaposs crisis summit at Sandringham was the Sussexesapos annual security bill, which is understood to be paid for by the taxpayer. Launched last Wednesday, the rebellious Duke and Duchessapos new official website Sussexroyal initially included the controversial phrasing about their security entitlement. But this was deleted in a matter of hours of it going live, reports the Mail Online .  The new website also states that  per cent of their annual funding comes from the Duchy of Cornwall, the Prince of Wales’s private estate, estimated at around £billion. And with their intention to relinquish the Sovereign Grant, it is understood Prince Charles made it clear he does not have unlimited funds. Harry and Meghanaposs wedding, as well as fitting out Frogmore cottage, all cost millions and it is unclear how far the Prince of Wales is willing to bankroll the pair. Any future funding is likely to impose firm rules on their commercial ventures, with the couple expected to look to make millions abroad. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said thereaposs still much to discuss over the Sussexesapos proposed move to Canada. The Sussexesapos desire to move has raised questions over the costs of the coupleaposs security during their time in North America and who would foot the bill.  Asked during an interview with Global News on Monday whether Canadian taxpayers would have to pay, Mr Trudeau said: That is part of the reflection that needs to be had and there are discussions going on. Weaposre not entirely sure what the final decisions will be, what the dispositions are and those are decisions for them. I think most Canadians are very supportive of having royals be here, but how that looks and what kind of costs are involved, there are still lots of discussions to have. He said the federal Canadian government had not been involved up until this point about what the coupleaposs move to the country will involve.

This morning the Duke arrived at Buckingham Palace, the week after he announced his plans step back from his senior role in the royal family. He met school children and delegates from all  of the  Rugby League World Cup nations. At pm he joined rugby legend Jason Robinson and Great Britainaposs most decorated female Olympian Katherine Grainger to make the draw. While the Prince was busy choosing Englandaposs opponents in the opening game, body language expert Judi James was paying close attention to the royalaposs every move. Harryaposs thumbs-up gesture says it all here, Judi explained.used as a confirmation signal that everything is okay. The thumb is erect, showing an emphatic emphasis on resilience and reassurance, and his arm is extended to make sure the gesture is meant and also seen by all.  As for the Dukeaposs facial expressions, the overall impression was slightly less clear. But withcomes an incongruent facial expression, with his smile suffering from signs of tension around the lower jaw, which also seems to jut slightly, hinting at bravado, Judi continued. The thumbs up might be used by Harry as much to boost his own confidence as to signal to his guests here. It seems that Harry rose to the occasion on what could have been a dficult day, exhibiting a positive and cheerful demeanour. However, one small gesture suggested not all of the Princeaposs thoughts were focused on the dayaposs events.  Judi continued: Overall this very active and jaunty-looking appearance did show several signs of an optimistic and energised approach, although when his right hand is engaged in a confident gesticulation the left is seen performing a slightly anxious finger-pick. Harryaposs two handed cupping gesture or even what looks like air-quotes gesture suggest heaposs in a dominant but playful mood, but his trait of touching his wedding ring reveals where his inner thoughts and emotions might lie too. Harryaposs appearance today was his first since he and Meghan announced their intentions to step back from their senior roles in the royal family.  The Sussexes said they wanted to become financially independent and intended to split their time between Britain and Canada. The bombshell announcement led to a two-hour Sandringham summit, after which the Queen released a rare statement saying she would have preferred the pair to remain as full-time royals. She referred to the couple simply as Harry and Meghan and “the Sussexes”, instead of using their formal titles.

A shock report in the respected Lancet journal reveals the UK fared worse than all EU nations apart from Portugal and the Ukraine. The study found we had more cases per , of the population than Vietnam, Kazakhstan and Iran. Experts warn infections are more likely as record numbers of NHS patients are having to be cared for in corridors. UK sepsis rates were th worst out of  nations, compared to Romania in th place, Germany in th, Ireland in th and Iceland in th. The analysis suggests that the horrying infection claimed , lives here in . Dr Ron Daniels, chief executive of the UK Sepsis Trust, said: “This is an enormously prevalent and deadly condition that we need to take more seriously. “With increasing stress on healthcare systems in which patients might be cared for in corridors away from the most hygienic clinical areas, then the risk of sepsis increases. “As the NHS is increasingly under pressure to discharge patients then people first develop symptoms when they are at home. “This data confirms sepsis is as common as heart attacks and more deadly than any cancer.” AEs have faced their worst month on record with more than , patients facing  hour trolley waits in Decembner.  Almost , sick patients faced waiting more than four hours from a decision to admit to eventually being given a ward bed over Christmas. Both are the worst since records began. Four in every five sepsis develop in patients outside of hospitals. If often develops after patients have been discharged following surgery. Campaigners are demanding that the NHS starts routinely recording sepsis deaths as current data on lives lost is based on estimates. Infections are often triggered by hospital superbugs. The international review found there was an estimated , UK cases of sepsis over the year, or  cases per , of the population. Globally it has become a bigger killer than cancer. The study estimated there are more than double the number of deaths than previously thought, many in developing countries. Their Global Burden Of Disease Reporton sepsis estimates there were . million cases in , and  million deaths, across  countries and territories. This equates to just under a fthof all global deaths that year. ■ Sepsis affects , people in the UK and kills , per year. That’s more than bowel, breast and prostate cancer and road accidents combined. ■ Sepsis is the body’s often deadly response to an infection. ■ Initially, it can look like flu or a chest infection, but it can swtly get serious. ■ Seek medical help urgentlyyou develop any one of the following… – are lethargic or dficult to wake – feel abnormally cold to touch – the skin looks mottled, bluish or pale – are breathing very fast – have a rash that does not fade when you press it – have a fit or convulsion The UK was ranked  out of the  countries listed by their estimated death rates from highest to lowest, with an estimated . deaths per , people. Study author Dr Mohsen Naghavi, of Washington University, said: “We are alarmed to find sepsis deaths are much higher than previously estimated, especially as the condition is both preventable and treatable. “We need renewed focus on sepsis prevention among newborns and on tackling antimicrobial resistance, an important driver of the condition.” The researchers acknowledge their estimates may be conservative, due to reliance on death certicates which may not explicitly list sepsis as a contributing factor. The  countries with the highest death rates were all in Africa, with the Central African Republic leading the survey. On the other end of the scale, those with the lowest death rates were mainly Middle Eastern and wealthier countries. What is sepsis  Sepsis is a form of blood poisoning when the immune system overreacts to an infection or injury. It can result in organ failure and death and often affects babies. Patients who survive often have to have limbs amputated. How do you get it  Sepsis can arise as a consequence of any infection but most commonly following pneumonia, water infections, bites, cuts or burns.

Their historical decision - which they reportedly didnapost consult the rest of The Firm on - has sent shockwaves through the Palace and resulted in a number of highly unusual statements. But they are not the first Royals to make the radical decision to change their lives forever, and they could look to Swedenaposs Princess Madeleine as they start to plan their future. The mum-of-three is the daughter of the King of Sweden King Carl XVI Gustaf and grew up third in line to the throne, under her older sister Crown Princess Victoria.The sisters are two of the most stylish royals in Europe , but they lead very, very dferent lives after Madeleine stepped back from her duties to live in New York.She moved to America to mend a broken heart after breaking up with her lawyer fiance Jonas Bergström. She started working for one of her mother Queen Silviaaposs charities and ended up falling in love with British-American financier Chris O’Neill who she met through a mutual friend. So she decided to stay. The couple married in Stockholm in , with Prince Edward and his we Sophie Wessex among the guests. The reception was held at Drottningholm Palace, the royal familyaposs private residence.  Despite Madeleineaposs position in the line of succession, O’Neill didnapost get a title when he joined the family. Speaking in an interview in , he said: “I’ve met the woman of my le, the woman I love. But it is clear that it has its challenging sides to be married to a princess. Of course, it has complicated my le, for obvious reasons.” The couple have since welcomed three children - Leonore, Nicolas and Adrienne The family have lived outside of Sweden for nine of the past  years, buthome for important royal events.  Sheaposs given a number of magazine interviews and is a regular on social media, sharing sweet photos of her day-to-day le, work and family. Her page is far more personal than any members of the British Royal Family, featuring holiday snaps and private family photos alongside cute captions. Last year King Carl XVI Gustaf stripped Madeleineaposs three children and two of their cousins of their HRH titles in a bid to slim down their Royal Family - not too dissimilar from Prince Charlesaposs vision for the British family. This means they will no longer perform any royal duties and will not get any taxpayer money.  Their titles - which they shall retain - will not be passed on to their future spouses or children. They themselves are still in the line of succession to the Swedish throne. The Deputy Marshal of the Realm, Fredrik Wersäll, gave a press conference and said the whole royal family had been involved in the decision. Debate about the issue has been ongoing for several years and itaposs believed the desire was to provide a a better idea of the future roles of the children of the two younger children of the king. Madeleine took to Instagram as the announcement was made, explaining her thoughts on the decision.Alongside a gorgeous family photo, she wrote: This change has been planned for a long time. Chris and I think it is good that our children now have a greater opportunity to shape their own lives in the future as iniduals.

The forecast suggested a polar freeze is on its way, with snow hitting the north-east, Ireland and Wales in late January before making its way to eastern parts of Britain and Scotland. But Met Office meteorologist Bonnie Diamond that the reports are based on a  weather forecast for two weeks ahead, which is too far away to make an accurate predictions. Ms Diamond told the Daily Star thereaposs no sign of oncoming snow in the Met Officeaposs forecasting system.  And while thereaposs always a chance of snow showers in winter, it will likely only affect high ground in the northern parts of the country, which is pretty normal for January. While the winter has been relatively mild for much of the UK, a high pressure system will see temperatures drop this weekend, unlikely to rise above °C. She added that there could also be icy conditions in some parts of the country. Snow charts by WXCharts, which they say look at the probability of snowfall, show the entire country covered in the white stuff on Tuesday, January  and Wednesday, January . Netweather also predicts a likely chance of snow hitting the entire country on Tuesday, January . It appears to hit in a southeasterly direction, before engulfing all of the UK.  The Met Office forecast for the end of January and start of February reads: “Through the end of January into February, we are likely to have higher pressure across the UK than during previous weeks. “The northwest will probably see the wettest and windiest weather whilst further south and southeast it should be drier and brighter with an increased risk of frost and fog.

The -year-old was hit by a vehicle speeding through a car park on the last day of her holiday with her aunts, uncles and cousins in August .Despite being told she was paralysed from the neck down and only had a tiny chance of ever walking again, Chanelle has defied all odds and walked down the aisle on her wedding day.She said that because of her faith she was able to accept what happened. I prayed and read positive books and poems knowing that I couldnapost change what had happened but that I could learn to live my best le despite with the injury, she said. Chanelle, a clinical research associate from College Park, Maryland in the US sustained a T- spinal cord injury after being hit. She spent ten weeks in hospital before being discharged to continue her physical therapy at home and get used to le in a wheelchair. Chanelle was determined to focus on learning to walk again. When, just five months after her injury, she was able to wiggle her toes, she was thrown into aggressive gait training to be able to walk. Her dad lived with her at the start to help her learn to use braces and a walker at home and a wheelchair outside, but she was living independently again by April . Motivated to still love le, Chanelle also took up swimming and racing in her wheelchair, even trialling for the  US Paralympic swim team. Then in April  her le changed again when she met her now-husband Brennan, . The couple go engaged in February , and it was then that Chanelle set herself the goal of walking down the aisle with two crutches.  She even managed to surpass this, walking down with just one crutch on her wedding day, in front of all her loved ones. Chanelle had persevered with two hours of intense therapy a week for six months before her big day.A keen advocate for wheelchair users, Chanelle has shared every step of her story on Instagram .The day I was hit by a car was my last day of vacation with aunts, uncles, and cousins in Virginia Beach, Virginia, USA, she said. I was out with my cousins that night and walking in a parking garage when I was hit by a car driving fast. I donapost remember being hit per se, but remember being on top of the hood of the car and then I blacked out after hitting the ground. I then remember one of my cousins standing over me while I was laying on the ground, telling me to hold on, the ambulance was coming. I then remember hearing the ambulance approaching, then I woke up in the emergency room with my aunt by my side. I remember some things from that night I was in the ER, most specically the doctor coming in to tell me the diagnosis - I was paralysed from the chest down and had a spinal cord injuryand that is why I couldnapost feel or move anything below my chest. He also stated that I would need quite a serious surgery to repair my crushed spinal cord. When they told me that I had just a three per cent chance of walking again, it really didnapost faze me. I knew that was an arbitrary number and being a scientist myself understood that all bodies heal and recovery is dferent and that my outcome after SCI couldnapost be predicted.  Mentally, I thought, ok time to focus on physical therapy and taking it day by day in learning to get back to as close to where I was before my injury - living independently, working, traveling and swimming. Because of my faith, I was able to accept what happened. I prayed and read positive books and poems knowing that I couldnapost change what had happened but that I could learn to live my best le despite with the injury. The turning point for me was when a friend told me just weeks after my injury that I needed to focus on getting better and the long road of rehab and recovery ahead of me and not consume myself with why me and who did this  I have always been an athlete and loved sports, so naturally when I was looking to go back to living as close to as I was before my injury, working out and swimming was a priority. These things were just done dferently now. This was easy to do because of National Rehabilitation Hospitalthat had ious adaptive sports and a gym that was accessible for persons who use wheelchairs. Being able to work out and stay active has helped my mind heal and to keep me healthy living with an SCI which often comes with many other medical issues. So when Chanelle walked down that aisle on her wedding day her loved ones were over the moon. The reaction was tears and awe! All my family that was there that night with me in the hospital after my injury, were there to watch me walk down the aisle, she said.  My wedding day or walking down the aisle, or swimming were not even a thought when I was first paralysed - I knew I needed to focus on doing the simplest of things and figuring out how to move around in a wheelchair. After about six months of being paralysed, that is when I thought about swimming again and my physical therapist got me back in the pool, although a small therapy pool at the outpatient rehab centre in Washington, DC, USA, when I was discharged from the hospital in Virginia, with all sorts of flotation devices on my legs. To be able to swim again, is freeing. Itaposs one of the few things I get to do without my wheelchair and the physical identity of the woman in a wheelchair. Being in a pool with others makes you forget that you are living with this le changing injury that comes with almost daily chronic pains and discomforts. Walking down the aisle is by far the biggest achievement for me that I am so very proud of myself for the work I put in for those six months.

Remains of Keane Mulready-Woods were found in a sports bag on a Dublin estate on Monday. Two days later, his head was recovered from a burning car, while his torso is yet to be found. Gardaí, Irish Police, received intelligence that Keane had been murdered and mutilated by sick gang rivals - with speculation his head was to be delivered to gang boss Cornelius Price as a major warning. He is the bitter rival of a -year-old chief suspect in the case, reports the Irish Independent. Keane was said to have links to both sides of the ide in Drogheda and also associated with an infamous north Dublin group. Sources have claimed Keane had got in way above his head in relation to his criminal associations. He was due to turn  next month. Last year, he was given a suspended four-month jail sentence for a terrying campaign of intimidation and harassment against a local family .  He was also known to gardaí for minor drugs and road traffic offences. Confirming the human remains were those of Keane, Droghedaaposs Garda Chief Christy Mangan said: This is a brutal and savage attack on a child - it is completely unacceptable in any normal democratic society. It is important to remember that Keane was a child, a young boy trying to find his way of le. He has now lost his le and his family have lost their loving son.Weaposre there to protect and serve the public, but there are a number of groups who are interested in controlling certain parts of society and their own lestyles through drugs and intimidation.

The -year-old man, whose name has not been identied, claimed he learned about the self-cure tip from a folk remedy and ingested the eels last week. He was rushed to Jiangsu Provincial Chinese Medicine Hospital, east China, the following day after his family found him having an apparent seizure and intense stomach ache. Dr Sun Haijian, deputy head of general surgery, told The Paper that the patient showed symptoms of ruptured bowels and acute peritonitis. The two eels have tore through the manaposs intestines and flooded his abdomen with faeces, which triggered a serious infection. CT scans revealed the locations of the two eels where they curled up among his vital organs around the digestive tract. Video shows the doctors removing the eels, measuring around  inches long, from the manaposs body. As the surgeon place them on a tray, one of them is seen wriggling while the other one has its head severed from its body.Dr Sun added: We opened him up and noticed a large amount of faecal water mixed with blood. There was severe swelling, and we found two very thick swamp eels at the bottom of his abdominal cavity. There was also a perforation in his colon measuring about  cm . It caused the infection and sent his body into shock.

The Japanese woman was told by staff of low-cost carrier Hong Kong Express that she had to take a aposfit-to-flyapos assessment, which included a pregnancy test. The incident unfolded as she was boarding a flight at Hong Kong International Airport bound for the US Pacic island of Saipan.It was very humiliating and frustrating, the -year-old told the  Wall Street Journal .She added that the airline indicated the test was required for women who were observed to have a body size or shape resembling a pregnant woman. The woman was then escorted to a washroom by staff and handed a pregnancy test, she claimed. She was then barred from boarding until she completed the test and it came back negative. The airline said that they had immediately suspended the pregnancy checking practice following the incident. We would like to apologize for the distress caused, a spokesperson told CNN. We took actions on flights to Saipan from February  to help ensure US immigration laws were not being undermined.  Under our new management, we recognize the signicant concerns this practice has caused. We have immediately suspended the practice while we review it. Sapain is a huge destination for pregnant women.

I like watching them when they go forward but we need to find a way to hurt them with our style of play as well.“It should be a good game for people to watch.”Saturday’s visitors Motherwell have enjoyed an impressive season in the top flight, sitting in the best-of-the-rest position in third behind the runaway top two of Rangers and Celtic.Stephen Robinson has been in charge at Fir Park for almost three years now and has overseen an upwards trajectory of the club.Dens boss James, though, isn’t shocked to see the Steelmen flying high this term, however.He added: “No, it hasn’t surprised me.“You can see why the manager has been successful with his recruitment and the way they play.“They can beat any team in that league from what I’ve seen of them this season.”This season is Motherwell’s th in the top-flight after last playing in the second tier in .And that sort of longevity at the top table of Scottish football is something Dundee should be enjoying, according to their manager. vw, px\"  James added: “They have been in that league for as long as I can remember.“I said this at the start of the season – five years isn’t long enough for a club like ours to be in the Premiership .“People were saying we had a good run at it but no we didn’t.“We should be in it every year – as should our neighbours.“When you look at Scottish football, you want the derbies.“It was horrible when Hearts and Hibs weren’t in the same league so you didn’t have the Edinburgh derbies and it was the same when Rangers and Celtic weren’t in the same league.“The Dundee one is all right just now because we are both in the Championship.“But, for me, you want the better games in your top league.“But going back to that question, yes, we want to be a club that can sustain a position in the top league for  years or beyond.“Looking back at Motherwell, to be there from  is a long time staying in a league.“We did five – it is not enough.“We need to get back up and stay there.“The problem is, there are loads of teams saying that.“Not many can do it so credit to Motherwell.”Kick off on Saturday is .pm at Dens Park with the match shown live on BBC Scotland."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/01/5e1ee386761c51.80867316-e1579104702563-940x564.jpg ","title":"dens gaffer we wont be bullied","story":"James McPake admits there has been “loads of interest” in attacking midfielder Josh Todd.However, the Dundee boss won’t be allowing any player to leave unless he gets players in the door first.And he insists the club won’t “be bullied” into paying over the odds for players.The Tele revealed this week Greenock Morton and Falkirk had expressed interest in the -year-old former Queen of the South man.James said: “There is loads of interest in Josh.“I have had a few phone calls about him.“But nothing will happen until I sit down and have a proper conversation with him.“He did great in a bounce game on Tuesday and attitude-wise he has been great.“He doesn’t look like a player who wants to leave.“Maybe he has been saying that he has not been getting the game time but he needs to ask himself why that’s the case.“Can he get himself into the team or is he looking to go where  I don’t know. Anyway, nobody will be going anywhere unless I get someone in.”The Dens gaffer admits that hasn’t been easy to do, however.The Dark Blues have been heavily linked with a move to bring Craig Wighton back to the club as well as St Johnstone midfielder Ross Callachan, with a deal for the latter apparently rubber stamped.“We are trying to get people in but it is proving to be dficult,” added James.“I can see now why, when the question is asked about this transfer window, people say it’s more dficult to deal in.“It is a lot harder and teams are digging their heels in a lot more.Teams are trying to bully us because it’s Dundee.

the paper with no clues as to its origin.And, not for the first time, Argyllshire Advertiser readers have come up trumps and we now know a little more about the boat#s owner, named only as RG Mowat in the log book.The  log book gives an account of the voyages of the -foot gaff cutter #Fulmar# and the adventures of her colourful crew. Its dog-eared pages contain neatly-typed records, precise drawings and fascinating photographs.The log#s mystery is deepened by the fact no names are given other than the nicknames #Tanky#, #Bosun#, #Skipper# and #Pilot#. The only crew member named is pet dachshund #Major#.The log does record the Fulmar#s home port was Tighnabruaich and the owner was RG Mowat, but few details on Mr Mowat could be found.Lord Weir of Lochhead, Achahoish, contacted the newspaper to pass on information on Commander Ralph G Mowat.During the Second World War, Commander Mowat was a Royal Navy Captain, latterly in command of a cruiser. At the end of the war, he and his ship entered Copenhagen, where he took the surrender of the German troops.Clive Brown from Ardfern added some post-war detail. He revealed: #Commander Ralph G Mowat, RN , was a distinguished member of Clyde Cruising Clubbest known as being, for  years, the honorary editor of the CCC Sailing Directions . These were # and indeed remain # a #must have# for everyone who navigates their way among the many lochs and islands of Scotland#s west coast. They were colloquially known as the #Blue Book# and published at that time as a hardback. He also served as CCC Rear Commodore -.#Mr Brown also provided an extract from the book #Clyde Cruising Club, The First One Hundred Years -# which states Ralph Mowat received an RYA Award for services to yachting in  but refused to accept honorary membership of the club. In recompense, his widow Mary was elected an honorary member in , after his death.Tighnabruaich man Alan Wilson contacted Clyde sailing legend Ian Nicolson, who was fairly sure he recalled racing against the #Fulmar# in the s.Mr Nicolson said:#Old Man Mowat, as I remember him, was a typical ex Royal Navy officer. He treated me as a young upstart, which I was, but we got on well because I wrote a bit for Clyde Cruising Club publications. He lived in Clarkston on the edge of Glasgow.#Clyde Cruising Club itself cannot help with information on the Fulmar. Club secretary Jenner Rollands contacted the Advertiser and confirmed CCC sadly lost all its records when the Carrick, moored on the River Clyde, sank in . At the time, the club#s office was aboard her.Closer to home, Ardrishaig man Billy Paterson called into the Advertiser offices to say his father, Ardrishaig Primary School headmaster Gilbert Paterson, had crewed the yacht Fulmar.Mr Paterson still has mementoes from his father#s trips in the form of gts from Commander Mowat, including a paperweight from , a copper and brass barrel ashtray dated  and a brass model yacht with #Fulmar # engraved on it.Thanks to everyone who contacted the Advertiser with their memories.We now know a little more about Commander Ralph G Mowat, RN , owner of the Fulmar.Details about the crew of #Tanky#, #Bosun# and #Pilot# remain, however, sketchy, soanyone out there knows any more#"},{"url":null,"title":"plenty of christmas room at the inn","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowInveraray Senior Citizens committee hosted its annual Christmas lunch in the Inveraray Inn.The event, on Sunday December  for senior citizens of Inveraray, was well attended with everyone enjoying a delicious meal and musical entertainment provided by Lochgilphead#s Easy Club.During the festivities, the committee presented flowers to Diane MacDonald, who is retiring from the committee after nine years."},{"url":null,"title":"a mid argyll rugby blast from the past","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTayvallich reader Donald Carmichael handed in this black and white photograph of a Mid Argyll Rugby Club team of many decades ago.But can our readers name the players  And what background can you give us about this photograph and Mid Argyll Rugby club at the time Contact the Argyllshire Advertiser by email: editor@argyllshireadvertiser with any information."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 27 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLooking back over the last  months, no single story has dominated the headlines in these pages, but there have been important themes.There are the negative trends, of course.

Three events all within a stones throw of Mid Argyll.Jamie Miller was the only local to enter this event, starting his Scottish Tarmac Rally Championshipcampaign for the year in the rapid  Citroen CR. Paul Hunter, swapping his pacenotes for spanners, was on hand to assist Jamie throughout the season. Conditions were said to have been tricky as Knockhill has its own micro-climate, which consists purely of rain, wind, snow, ice, wind and wind. Sadly it wasn#t to be at Knockhill for the team with mechanical failure ending their day after stage two.The first closed road event to take place in England, after the approval of closed road rallying for the UK, was the first event for the famousGTi. Unfortunately for Kirsty Mochrie her licence can only be upgraded to stage events from single venue use when she turns , so it was theof the pairing of Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter to represent Mid Argyll south of the border. The pair, finding the conditions tricky in the narrow lanes after the top seed cars had been pulling mud from verges and ditches, managed to bounce the wee metro over the first loop of four stages until the gearbox had enough on the fth test.Following the cancelling of Inverness# Snowman Rally earlier in the year, this was now first round of the Scottish Rally Championshipfor Dougie Watt and Ian Parker, and it was interesting to say the least. A glance outside in the morning to see about four inches of snow lying on the roof of the MK Escort was a surprise for a start. A very wet and muddy day saw the pair make it to the finish in one piece which is more than can be said for the clutch cable that snapped about one mile into the final stage, however clinching their first class win of the season was the best start to the championship.With Kirsty #Wee Mo# Mochrie in the co-drivers seat in the rapid Corsa of Steven Hay , a fair pace was set by the pair throughout the day sitting as high as th until they unfortunately had to take a split early to save damaging the car. Back out the next stage and still setting a blistering top  pace in the Corsa, including some hang time on both the jumps.Jamie, back out in the fit C, had bad luck once again. This time an overshoot on a square right and a struggle to get the car started again after a stall sadly earned him a stage max on stage two. Still setting top  times on the day he ended nd which was a fair effort when you include a stage maximum time.Ian was out this time with Fraser #Flat oot Fraz# Smithafter winning an entry to the rally at the STRC Awards in January. Flying out the gates and onto their second lap on the first stage then pop, driveshaft burst. Towed in and sorted, both covered in CV Grease, they made it back out for a skid around and on a mission to tear up some old tarmac tyres.The Granite Stages, now held at RAF Leuchars would see Eoghan Anderson make ato the passenger seat for a hurl in the immaculate MK Escort of Martin Murray. Smiling ear to ear all day, with Bill eagerly awaiting histo the service area for the stage report, they finished th overall.Ian was out with Greg Inglisin his fluorescent Orange Lotus Exige and it was eyes on the prize for STRC points for Greg. A clean day saw Greg really getting to grips with the car on some surprisingly fast stages including a tickle of the limiter in fth saw the pair finish third overall.Back together and with the small repairs from the Speyside done it was time for the Furnace MK toto the woods. A steady run over the opening two stages, Dougie and Ian found their feet after the #off# at the Speyside sent them into service lying th. From seeing their overall position they knew they had to get back into it on the next stage, however on the road section to start stage three there was issues selecting gear and the pair decided to call it a day # damage limitation was the right call, as the input shaft was on its last legs.Jamie was back on the pace for this one, setting a th fastest stage time on the opening test. Sitting th overall heading into stage five was impressive given the competition on the day. Bad luck unfortunately, however, was to .Eoghan was again out with Martin in the MK for a blast. Sadly it was an early bath, retired after stage two but again, as always, enjoying every minute while it lasted.The Argyll rally had been known to have rough and challenging stages the previous two years. Not this time. Ian and Dougie couldn#t believe how good the stages were in comparison to previous years, an absolute joy of an event with the Escort not missing a beat all day on its #shakedown# for the big one. Valuable class points added to the scorecard too, with them ending the event nd overall. The rally had struggled with entries this year and will now run in  as a closed road rally, run by Mull Car Club.Team Mochrie were back together for this one in the Mightyagain and Innes was cutting some questionable shapes in the garage, performing his annual Mach rain dance. Taking chunks of time from his first passes of the stages would see them ring the #s neck and clinch th.Jamie#s luck had finally turned, the C singing all weekend and netting him a topper of th overall and th fastest over the final stage too.Duncan Maclean was back in the driving seat with Ian alongside, giving himself and the car a shakedown before Mull. The freshly rebuilt #blue bullet# was looking superb and managed to finish looking just as sweet. A couple of small teething problems were sorted on the day and the new main focus was to have power steering fitted before Mull # poor Dochy lost about a stone over two days with the effort needed to swing the wee pug around the #s and chicanes.In August Dougie and Ian competed on the Vetomies Rally. A national grade event run alongside the WRC Rally Finland event. Three other crews from Scotland also headed over to sample #the fastest rally in the world#. The stages were unbelievable. Fast, cresty, wide, flowing with a brilliantly smooth surface. The whole event was just surreal. The duo finished the event th overall and more importantly the fastest Scottish crew.Once the car had ed from Finland it was quickly jacked up, checked and loaded onto the trailer the same day for the journey north. Due to two DNFson the Speyside and Scottish, Dougie and Ian had to make the trip to be in with any chance of regaining their class lead in the SRC. Ending the day first in the class meant they were heading into the final round with the lead.Jamie was back out for another counting round of the STRC. Enjoying his day and pushing the wee C on in the blistering heat netted Jamie and co-driver Ian Mccullochrd overall. He must have been relaxed in the heat as in between stages he was off with the overalls and on with the baby lotion, topping up the tan.Ian was back out with Greg in the Lotus. Another fantastic drive from Greg, finishing ninth with the championship title race firmly the primary goal.The final round for the MK and an important one # a DNF here could see Dougie and Ian losing the class lead in the championship. A battle with their rival who they had been chasing all season, Paddy Munro, would come down to the last stage, as the pair were six seconds down on Paddy heading into the final test. Probably one of the duo#s best stages all year, the final push to claim the class honours came down to the finish of the last stage on the last rally of the year. One second! They had taken the class win and the championship.The first event this year for Craig Callander and son Ross would see them prepare Craig#s gravel spec Subaru Impreza at the last minute to take on their favourite event. The #Japanese Tractor# was a fair handful, a light steering alignment issue and a boost problem gave the pair some trouble although finishing th overall made up for the hassle. A fair result given Craig#s absence from tarmac for four years.Returning from the shed with his freshly painted Sunbeam was Alister Macarthur, this time with Claire Tilleyalongside. The freshly fettled #beam was looking and sounding good # crossing the finish th overall after two years out of the seat.Dochy and Ian were back out in the #blue bullet.# All was going well until they had a spin coming over a crest into a square left, losing the bumper and damaging the gear linkage. They managed to get the car back to the end of the Saturday afternoon leg to repair the gear linkage and almost stole the yellow bumper from the recce car until some legends appeared with the duo#s bumper in the back of their Land Rover. Back out onto the  mile #long one# on Saturday night and they had an issue # after a heavy landing over a crest the rear shocker bolt broke, making the car a handful to keep in a straight line. They had to finish another two stages before they could make it back to service, so a finish was all they wanted at this point # th overall and Dochys fourth finish in a row on Mull.Without doubt the driver to watch was Innes and his newly acquired co-driver Lewis Grfiths . The Mightywas spotted airborne at any chance, with the hydro can suspension screaming for a break at each service halt. It was almost all over as the nearside cv joint sheared and the car took a wild turn to the left # both Innes and Lewis thought they would end up IN the Belachroy pub. They managed to make it over the Lochs to the end of the final stage, claiming st overall.Eoghan was back out with Martin to settle the score from the DNF at the summer stages. Sadly a stage maximum time on stage two scuppered their chances of the overall result they were hoping for, however they did set some impressive times, clocking a th fastest time on the final stage.Jamie, back out for the final round of the STRC, was looking to continue his good run from the Pendragon and set a seventh fastest time on stage three in the extremely wet and tricky conditions. Trying to get his money#s worth from his entry fee Jamie, however, decided to take an extra couple of miles on the penultimate stage. Still, the C ran well all day and the conditions suited the car perfectly.Ian was back out with Greg and this time he was aiming to become the Scottish Tarmac Rally Champion for . They set off with five cars in the same class and they had to win the class to get Greg the honours. Setting the pace early they were leading throughout the event. Finishing the event first in their class and third overall meant the job was done # Greg claimed the championship win.The last event of the year saw Kirsty back in the co-drivers seat, gaining even more experience on her path to upgrading her licence. Some typical Knockhill weather was in store as Kirsty had her first taste of RWD rallying in the Mazda MX of Paul Sheard. Kirsty guided Paul around the very wet stages to claim th overall and some valuable points on the board for Paul#s Motorsport News Championship campaign.Special thanks to Alasdair MacConnell who has travelled many miles to don an orange bib and stand in the rain, wind and heat, all to show his support and play a vital part in any event. And to Gavin #Top Tog# Brown, who has been an avid rally man for years and continued to watch us all through the lens, capturing some of our most heroic moments. was a busy year, with a few of us still tinkering away in sheds.  will hopefully see theof Ally and Del Galbraith in their #new# MK Escort and Donald Bowness in the giant killing Nova making aafter some time out.PICS:Dougie Watt and Ian Parker flying in Finland before winning in Aberdeen Photo: Jii Pihlaja. no_a_RallyFinlandFather and son duo Craig and Ross Callendar came in th overall at this year#s Mull Rally.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert club on target for 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first competition of the new year at Tarbert Gun Club also served as the January leg of the club#s winter league.A full house of  teams turned out on Sunday January , and the early shooters had to put up eith windy conditions which made the clays dance.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

Scotlandrsquos train operator, Abellio, has posted losses for a third consecutive year. Prior to Christmas, I made it clear in Holyrood that delays and cancellations on the Borders Railway were unacceptable and I questioned the Scottish Governmentrsquos decision to terminate Abellio ScotRailrsquos contract early in .I believe the move will cause disruption to passengers and puts into question job security for current employees. Even Dominic Booth, Abellio UKrsquos managing director, said: lsquoScotlandrsquos railway needs stability, not the upheaval a change in the franchise would bring aboutrsquo. I completely agree, and I hope that investment in our railway isnrsquot halted as a result.More fuel to the fire came over Christmas, when it was revealed that Abellio ScotRail said it had ended the past financial year pound million in the red, owing pound million to its owner, the nationalised railway of the Netherlands. It now seems that Dutch taxpayers are subsidising our failing train services. This is on top of the Scottish Government subsidies, which make up about half of its pound billion revenues.We need a viable solution to ScotRailrsquos woes, and terminating franchises early or nationalisation is not the answer. We need better accountability and long-term planning to ensure we see the fortunes of ScotRail turn around.The Borders tourism can offer a more peaceful alternative to bustling CapitalI was not surprised to see that Edinburgh was revealed as having the fourth highest ratio of tourists to locals in the world. This is after Miami, Las Vegas and Dubai, and it sits well above th placed London. Statistics show there are nearly  tourists for every  residents in Edinburgh, and it begs the question, are we really managing the impact of tourism well Annually our Capital city is influxed with tourists for the Hogmanay celebrations and the Fringe. Whilst it great to see tourism booming in Edinburgh, we need to see more affirmative action to encourage tourists to see more of Scotland, including the Borders. We are located only an hour south of Edinburgh, yet we see very little of the footfall.We need to see incentives and drivers for visitors to explore outside of Edinburgh. Encouraging rural tourism is at the top of my list, and I believe the Scottish Government need to make it a priority to ensure that our overcrowded capital does not suffer, when rural areas have a more peaceful and less stressful visitor experience on offer."},{"url":null,"title":"polar-bear-expert-deliver-talk-galashiels","story":"THE Arctic is ground-zero for climate change, and polar bears are on the front line.Yet, therersquos still a whole lot to learn about these magnicent animals.

The existing junction in front of QMU would also be modied from a give-way ghost island T-junction to a signalised junction with greater capacity to hold turning traffic.The proposed scheme would, through the provision of an underpass beneath the A and slip roads to the northbound carriageway of the A, enable traffic movement from QMU and the new development to access the A northbound directly.Street lighting is proposed to be installed extended to include the new section of Queen Margaret Drive which would be provided under the A to the proposed roundabout junction. Street lighting would also be provided on the new slip roads.The proposals also include foot and cycle paths, two SUDS ponds, mitigation planting of native woodland to the main junction, structure tree planting, marginal planting to the proposed SUDS areas, and more ornamental planting to the areas near the QMU campus.Colin Beattie, Musselburgh MSP, said: ldquoWhile I welcome improvements to the road system which will accommodate the exciting new business developments around QMU, I am less enthusiastic about the huge expansion of housing, albeit much-needed, adjacent to QMU.ldquoThey will substantially increase the traffic on that stretch of road. Hopefully the improvements will manage that well.ldquoI continue to have concerns about developments being put in place with inadequate attention to overall infrastructure needs and the impact on surrounding residents.Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, added: ldquoThough we do not want this amount of housing in this location, we hope that the improved junction will channel much of the traffic generated onto the A and away from Musselburgh.ldquoThere are already serious traffic problems at the bottom end of Monktonhall Road and at the Tesco roundabout. Evenjust some of the traffic from the development around QMU comes this way to access facilities in Musselburgh, we fear the road system will clog up totally.ldquoWe have no problem with the junction improvements. Our issue is with the amount of housing proposed, which is totally inappropriate.Councillor John Williamson added: ldquoThe planned developments will technically be part of Musselburgh, although the vast majority of the new housing will be on the western side of the A with the only direct access to Musselburgh itself, as far as Irsquom aware, restricted to public transport and cycle pedestrian access.ldquoThe only full vehicle access will be via Newcraighall or Old Craighall Roundabout, which means that it will be dficult for the new communities to feel an integral part of Musselburgh.A spokesperson for QMU said: ldquoWe welcome news of the approval of planning permission for the A QMU road junction which will help unlock the full potential of the site for the development of the Innovation Park.ldquoQMU chose to move to East Lothian partly because of the opportunities to work with employers to develop the land immediately adjacent to the new campus.ldquoThe decision is the latest in a series of important milestones that have brought us a step closer to progressing plans for sustainable economic development."},{"url":null,"title":"busy-programme-hogmanay-events-musselburgh","story":"The day-long programme include performances, workshops and events including ceilidhs, lantern making, drumming workshops, storytelling and puppetry with Itrsquos In The Bag and Clydebuilt Puppets at The Brunton.Additional art and craft activities, face painting and balloon modelling can also be paid for on the day.The event ends with a lantern parade and firework display, lighting up the sky along the Musselburgh coastline.Afterwards, The Brunton hosts Hogmania!, a family-friendly party with live band, piper and Hogmanay snacks.Ticketed activities and events run am-.pm.The free evening event starts at .pm as people gather at The Brunton for the lantern parade, which sets off at pm led by the Edinburgh Samba Band, Apus walkabout illuminated birds and Jacks of Frost.The procession makes its way to Fisherrow Links for a fireworks display from .pm to pm.Hogmanay celebrations in the Honest Toun are delivered by East Lothian Council and The Brunton, with support received as part of Scotlandrsquos Winter Festivals.A council spokesperson said: ldquoFamily Hogmanay in the Honest Toun is a fantastic way to celebrate  and look forward to the beginning of a new year, bringing together families and friends of all ages with lots of activities under one roof.ldquoScotland is world-renowned for celebrating Hogmanay and our Family Hogmanay event is a truly appealing event for both locals and visitors alike.Paul Bush, director of events at VisitScotland, said: ldquoScotland offers the perfect stage to celebrate the New Year and we are pleased to be supporting Family Hogmanay in Musselburgh as part of Scotlandrsquos Winter Festivals.ldquoThe Honest Tounrsquos vibrant events programme has the local community at its heart, with a wide range of activities for all ages.The full programme is:For information, booking and prices, visit thebrunton or call   ."},{"url":null,"title":"former-depute-lord-lieutenant-receives-telegram-queen-diamond-wedding","story":"Marlene, , and Stan, , married in  and have four children together ndash now aged between  and .

I was alone and deep in thought. I cannot remember now exactly what the issue was, but something had happened that seemed to be unfair, and it had made me angry.It was a windy and cold day. The tide was in and the waves rolling and crashing created a kind of meditative sound. I donrsquot know how long I sat there, as time seemed to dissolve as I listened to the sea, and smelt the salt air.Later I walked by the shore, again alone, and I remember how my mood had changed.My memory of that day fades at this point: I cannot recall what happened as I ed home. But clearly the sea had done its job in calming my emotional state.Memories are not like books on a shelf which we can take out and look at, and then . Our memories are really about emotions rather than happenings. We connect to the emotions first, our brain then does a search for the events associated with the emotion. Songs, smell, sounds and places can trigger emotion which then leads to associations with actual events.So itrsquos the emotion attached to events which will mark it as signicant. Thatrsquos why we remember the unusual moments more than the everyday ones. We remember the events when our emotions were aroused, either positively or negatively.That day I was angry. The sea was pretty much on our doorstep, so it was probably an obvious place to go to be alone, away from my siblings, to rage at the injustice I felt. But it was a good choice, because the sea has a powerful ability to heal.There seems to be a sense by some that the sea is a place to go only when itrsquos sunny and warm. In fact, the gts of the sea are given all year round, and it is winter time, or a time of storm and wind, that the sea becomes a powerful place to find naturersquos healing.How lucky we are to live in a county where we have  miles of coastline, much of it close to communities and accessible. Those with a sense of adventure and physical ability to do so can find parts of the coast to themselves, even in busy times.But as I learnt all those years ago, the sea can speak to us directly. Simply sitting by it, or walking along the shore while sharing our thoughts, can be a powerful form of mental as well as physical healing.Some take this a step further by bathing in the sea on a regular basis ndash yes, even in the winter. There are real benefits to swimming in a cold sea, both in terms of mental and physical health. But I think it helpsothers do it with you, as an encouragement! The Loony Dooks which take place at North Berwick, Dunbar and where around the coast should be a weekly event, not a yearly one!But we donrsquot need to be in the sea to feel its benefits, just by it and connected to it mentally, and yes, spiritually. This is a serious point. We have an epidemic of mental health issues, and while there is no one simple explanation or solution, we need to understand the signicance of our disconnection from nature and its impact on our mental health. Spending time by the sea is a tonic for body and mind.I think we felt this last week when we headed for the rocks at North Berwick on Boxing Day. It was here that Robert Louis Stevenson played as a boy and discovered a small cave in which he imagined tales of pirates and smugglers. The island of Fidra, said to be his inspiration for Treasure Island, can be seen further along the coast.The tide was in, so it wasnrsquot possible to see the cave. But in scrambling over the rocks, discovering other things and sitting by the waves, the sea did its magic for our family and myself. The waves were crashing andyou studied how they hit the rocks you could see how the hand of the sea had carved them in certain ways.We sat and explored there ndash not noticing the nippy wind ndash for a good hour. It was an overcast afternoon and darkness fell soon. But the walk along the beach to the town for a hot chocolate was the final part of the therapy!Our coastline is a gt for us and we need to use it, and respect it, more. The beaches, coves and clfs of our county are a true treasure. Try spending more time with them, listening and experiencing the sea, walking or sitting with it.I promise you, you will feel better, and have a story to tell.Happy New Year."},{"url":null,"title":"new-mcbrave-games-event-held-musselburgh","story":"The action-packed event, called McBrave Games, promises participants a uniquely Scottish experience with events such as tug orsquo war, tossing the caber, putting the shot, the hill race, weechinrsquo the welly and a Highland fling.There will also be a Scottish twist on challenges along the km obstacle course to test participants.The event takes place on Saturday, May , at Newhailes House.Participants can take on the challenge as a solo entrant or enter as a clan of four with colleagues or friends to battle it out to become the laddie or lassie of McBrave Games.Co-founders Jo Dytch and Andrew Hastings are confident the creativity and innovation behind the event will encourage entrants to try something new in .Jo and Andrew bring with them more than  yearsrsquo combined experience in the mass participation space on large-scale events such as Race for Le, Tough Mudder and the -mile Cateran Yomp.Commenting on the inspiration behind the event, Jo said: ldquoScotland is an inspiring and magical place.

This is a fascinating and picturesque structure from the th century, which lies semi-hidden amongst the trees that cling onto the steep sides of the slope.Dunglass is such a beautul area, and the ancient Dunglass Collegiate Church, dating from the th century, is one of its architectural jewels. Itrsquos open to the elements now, but well preserved and a popular place for weddings.The castle that once stood nearby is long gone. A more modern house sits on the spot where a mansion once stood, and before that the castle. Being on the main route south, the castle inevitably saw action during the ious times of war with England, being burned and damaged on a number of occasions in the s.But in August , the castle was effectively blown up in a huge explosion, and a version of events emerged which placed the blame on a vengeful servant called Edward Paris.It was a time of war and religious rage. Thomas the nd Earl of Haddington was leading a Covenanting force charged with defending this important route from the south, as the Covenanting army had entered England a few days earlier. He had established his force at Dunglass Castle, an obvious strategic location, to defend the armyrsquos rear.On that fateful day, August , , he was said to be in conversation with some fellow nobles when a huge explosion erupted from the vaults, instantly demolishing the central part of the castle which became little more than a pile of debris.Thomas and many others were killed, their bodies pulled from the rubble. They had been crushed by the collapse of the walls in the explosion.History has repeatedly recorded the names of the nobles killed on that day, but there were many others, as the castle was busy and full of people. Fty-four unnamed lsquocommon servantsrsquo were killed, and more than  other people badly injured, some later dying of their injuries.Edward Paris was Thomasrsquos servant and he has been blamed for this tragedy. The th-century writer Andrew Stevenson claimed Edward had the keys to the vault in which huge amounts of gunpowder had been stored, and he had been ldquoseduced by the enemies of the covenant to commit this act. He was an Englishman and another account says he was incensed at derogatory remarks made by Thomas about his countrymen.Irsquove always thought this explanation never really had the ring of truth. It was initially deemed an accident, and the story of Edwardrsquos role emerged later, instigated by a writer called William Lithgow, a man who had certain axes to grind. In one account, Edward is said to have thrust a hot poker into the gunpowder or set fire to it. The detail of this is suspect in itself, for who survived as a witness to this act  I suspect that a dreadful accident, possibly caused by incompetence and carelessness, was turned into a deliberate act of vengeance as it made a more useful explanation.Of course, it is very possible that Edward was offended or annoyed at things said by his master, and perhaps he mentioned this at some stage, later to be used as evidence of his guilt. But in truth, most servants will have seen or heard things which will have offended them, it was a part of their job.Imagineservants had been able to write and publish the things they had overheard and seen, what dferent historical narratives we would have!Motives for wanting to interpret the cause of the explosion in this way can be guessed at. It was a time of atrocity and massacre, with religious, political and national hatreds. Who was responsible for the dangerous stockpiling of the gunpowder in such a manner  It seems just too easy to blame a disgruntled servant. Even later, when writing up this period, religious and political loyalties influenced interpretation.If Edward Paris really did venture down to the vaults of Dunglass Castle on that fateful day, with the intention of committing suicide in order to kill his master, along with dozens of others, then he must have been infected with a deep hatred, as well as a total disregard for the lives of his fellow servants and his own.The truth is we will never know what really happened. But Edward Paris is a servant whose name we know. Countless numbers of so-called lsquocommon servantsrsquo whose lives and fates are deemed unimportant by history remain unrecorded just as the things they witnessed remain absent from our history books.Irsquove often thought it would be fascinating to meet Edwardrsquos ghost and ask him what really happened on that day.Silly idea, of course, but you never know."},{"url":null,"title":"public-exhibition-held-plans-revive-dunbars-east-beach","story":"Dunbarrsquos East Beach, which hosts the townrsquos annual Loony Dook, was once a magnet for tourists but the disappearance of its golden sands over the years due to coastal erosion has led to fewer visitors.East Lothian Council has already been given permission for the first phase of work on the beach, which it is hoped will help sandwhile also protecting the shore.A public exhibition detailing plans for a second phase of work ndash and the project overall ndash takes place in Dunbarrsquos Bleachingfield Centre on Monday afternoon.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, explained the desire to see the beach restored to how it was previously.She said: ldquoIt has been a long-held ambition.ldquoPeople reminisce about how wonderful the beach was and there has been a lot of disappointment that it has been so rocky for so long.Dave Northcott, East Lothian Council structural engineer and project leader, visited the community council shortly before Christmas to outline the plans.Consent is already in place for the construction of a breakwater at the southern end of East Beach.Refurbishment of the existing groyne at the same end of the beach has also been approved, alongside the placement of rock armour at the toe of the seawall.

He was said to have been martyred at sea with an anchor round his neck and was therefore regarded as the patron saint of sailors. The cult of Clement spread to Scandinavia in about the th century and then to Britain.ldquoSt Clements Wells were probably named by Scandinavians living in the Tranent area.ldquoWe know they were here because of the presence of a powerful landholder of likely Scandinavian descent, Thor of Tranent, son of Swain, who is mentioned in many th-century charters. He held extensive lands in the area and granted the church of Tranent to Holyrood Abbey.Mr Hadden said: ldquoI am sure the new stone sculptures will add another piece of culture to our area when in place to the east and west sides of Wallyford alongside those we have already.ldquoThese include the mining memorial stone and coal hutches located at St Clements Housing estate just off Salters Road, the  mining stones at the Wallyford Bing, a community woodland depicting dferent mining scenes, and also the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh memorial at the west side of Wallyford.The shapes and patterns proposed relate to the themes of the wells, water, ripples, distilling, agriculture and the sense of space and open skies of the site as it is now.

Stephen sat with a full set of teeth on display, his smile was stretched broad.On the other side, Jonathans mouth was in an appalled downward twist, his head occasionally in his hands.Finally, I have seen Cats, and friends... I loved it.In general, I believe musicals to be artistic atrocities. Singing, I like. Acting, I like. Singing and acting combined  No, thank you anyway.So I had no impetus to go and see Cats the film. I have, full disclosure, seen Cats on the stage and it was tolerable because the characters sang and danced and barely talked so it wasnt a musical of the traditional, \"Im inappropriately bursting in to song instead of finishing this sentence,\" iety.The only thing that drew me to Cats the movie was the promise of two hours of atrocious film making.Im a member of a Bad Movie Club and we thrive on this stuff.

A motion picture horror piece with the added trauma of James Corden. What could be gloriously worse Well, much, it turned out. Off we went, actors in fur CGI creeping and crawling through the streets of London, their digitally enhanced ears twitching as they moved through the Jellicle Songs for Jellicle Cats.Nothing grating so far.This, in fact, was a delight. Even the dancing cockroaches had a certain charm. Yes, at points seeing Judi Dench with a lionesque ring of long fur framing her face felt a little fever-dreamish but she pulled it off with a certain twinkling gravitas.What are the complaints  Viewers twisted their knickers over scale - in some parts the cats are as big as cutlery in other parts they fill window frames.Two women in my screening couldnt move past the fact that Jennyanydots unzips her own skin to reveal a new outfit underneath. Others have been upset that Old Deuteronomy wears a fur coat... on top of her own coat of fur.Yet more whiny babies emphasised distress that the cats had fingers. Yes, it certainly would lt the whole film to make the singing, dancing, talking cats more realistic.Bizarrely, no one seemed bothered by Bombalurinas high heels or Taylor Swts horric faux-British accent. These were the only downsides.Lack of a plot has been another incoherent grumble  Too much plot would be a more sensible complaint. Cats is a back-to-back collection of little stand alone stories. It heaves with plots, drips with them.The inidual stories of the cats are marvellous.

She is actually a fairly conventional right-wing Labour politician with a Brummie gloss. ldquoWe want to bring people together, not ide them, she said yesterday,because our compassion doesnrsquot end at an imaginary line on a map.Well, what does end at that line on the map is Labour MPs ndash the party only has one left, Edinburgh Southrsquos Ian Murray.

Labour is all for multiculturalism, but finds it hard in practice, even with racial identity. As the Labour leadership candidates lined up in all their glory yesterday, I was tempted to say, as Jon Snow of Channel  News said of that Brexit march last year: ldquoIrsquove never seen so many white faces.Only Lisa Nandy can legitimately claim ethnic descent from her father. Such a visual contrast to all those United Colours of Corbyn photo ops during the election.A party which has made a religion of ersity seems set to hand the leadership to Sir Keir Starmer, a wealthy North London barrister, who looks the very image of ldquowhite male privilege that Labour supporters on Twitter love to loathe.For a party that lectures the media, business and academia on gender, the leadership is turning into an intersectional embarrassment. Labour has never had a woman leader, and doesnrsquot seem likely to get one this time. Four out of the five candidates to replace Jeremy Corbyn are female, but the straight white guy is ahead by a mile.Mind you, Mr Starmer, as he would like us to call him, has been given a free pass by some feminists on the grounds that he is the ldquohot ticket. According to commentators like Zoe Williams in the , Sir Keir bears a striking resemblance to Marc Drsquoarcy, the austere-but-sexy human rights lawyer played by Colin Firth in the Bridget Jonesrsquos Diary film franchise.In the salons of North London, this apparently makes the Labour MP less pale, male and stale, and more pale, male and phooar. Mind you, I donrsquot think his looks will set many hearts a-throbbing in the pubs and clubs of Workington and Bolsover.As Shadow Brexit Secretary, Sir Keir was largely responsible for turning Labour into the Remain Party before the General Election. He made clear he would never support even a Labour Brexit. That convinced tens of thousands of le-long Labour voters to turn to Mr Johnson on the grounds that only the Tories were listening to them.But thatrsquos all water under the bridge now. Itrsquos time to ldquomove on. Forget Brexit. After all, Labour won the argument, didnrsquot they Aware of the Islington millionaire tag, Sir Keir has been trying to burnish his working class image.

Labour should be choosing the candidate best able to lead the party to victory, on merit, rather than someone who fits a hackneyed image of proletarian virtue. Race should be irrelevant in a party that believes in equality.But of course in the Labour Party of today it so obviously does matter. Labour has been hypnotised by identity politics and sees everything through racial and gender eyeglasses. It requires of other organisations that ious minority and gender boxes are ticked. But when it comes to their own leader, well, itrsquos complicated. And when it comes to Scotland, itrsquos more complicated still.Ms Phillips is essentially standing as the only leadership candidate who speaks the language of the working class. ldquoI love the people I grew up among, she says, ldquoand I think that they can tell. The implication is that other candidates donrsquot have this relationship with the voters.Mind you, Irsquom not sure that applies to the  per cent of her constituents in Birmingham Yardley who voted for Brexit.

- and the same body has been tasked by ministers with carrying out a review of the senior phase of schooling.She also insisted all the \"evidence\" points to improvements in the Scottish education system.:Labour leadership hopeful Lisa Nandy suggests Scotland should look to Catalonia to deal with independenceThe First Minister said: \"Looking at Highers, when we took office less than half of pupils left school with a Higher, the percentage was .%, today almost two-thirds, .%, of pupils leave school with a Higher.\"In , the percentage of pupils leaving school with five passes or better, was .%, today that is more than %.\"So I readily accept further improvement is required, that is why we are taking the action that we are taking.\"What would be good once in a while is for Jackson Carlaw to accept the progress these statistics say has taken place in Scottish education.\""},{"url":null,"title":"legal-advice-suggests-holyrood-legislate-second-referendum-without-pms-consent","story":"Forward As One had set up a crowdfunder to instruct counsel to explore a possible legal challenge to Boris Johnsons refusal of a Section  request by the Scottish Government to stage a vote.In his opinion, Aidan ONeill QC of law firm Balfour and Manson said the Scotland Act could allow for the Scottish Parliament to legislate for another independence referendum - however he said his conclusion would need to be tested in court.The document, paid for by the group after raising pound,, said MPs or MSPs could seek a \"declarator\" from the Court of Session on the issue.Mr ONeill wrote: \"I consider there to be good arguments to the effect that the Scottish Parliament have the power, under the provisions of the Scotland Act  as they currently stand, to legislate for the holding of a referendum on Scottish independence.\"The matter has never been the subject of authoritative legal decision and is not, however, free from academic controversy .\"It is in principle open - even before any such legislation is laid before or passed by the Scottish Parliament - for persons with recognised legal standingto seek a declarator from the Court of Session on the issue of whether the Scottish Parliament already has the power to legislate for the holding of a referendum on Scottish independence.\"The opinion also states that, regardless of the outcome, a court action will \"provide legal clarity in which political decisions can be made and in so doing ensure the clearer and proper working of the UK constitution\".First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has repeatedly insisted the Scottish Government would seek the powers from Westminster to hold another referendum in a way that is above legal challenge.However, some in her party have called for a referendum to be held within the power of the Scottish Parliament, or even to begin negotiations for independence after a win for the SNP at the Westminster election - which was dubbed Plan B and rejected by party members at its autumn conference.The Prime Minister this week rejected the First Ministers request for powers to be handed to Holyrood to hold a second vote - a decision Ms Sturgeon condemned as an affront to democracy.Following publication of the legal advice, a spokesman for Ms Sturgeon said: \"First and foremost this is an issue of democracy and respecting democracy. Respecting peoples votes in elections.\"Ultimately this has to be settled by respecting democracy, respecting election results, and the position the UK Government are taking, we believe, is pretty unsustainable.\"The onus shouldnt be on us to come up with a Plan B or a Plan C or a Plan Z, there is a perfectly well understood political and democratic precedent for how this is done, and that is the basis on which we published in December, following the precedent of .\"We shouldnt have to look for all sorts of alternative plans when there is a perfectly good one in front of us.\""},{"url":null,"title":"3k funding boost for after school club","story":"The Morrisons Foundation has donated #, to Monymusk-Cluny After School Club.The club is a small community-run charity which is based at Monymusk Primary School.The support from the Morrisons Foundation will enable the charity to update and refresh its craft activities, as well as replace scooters and bicycles foruse by the children that attend the club.In addition to this, the grant will help fund the creation of a sensory area - a special quiet area for children with additional needs.Club chairperson Gillian Murray said: “We are honoured and delighted to be provided this support by the Morrisons Foundation.“It will make a massive dference to our small club.”Community Champion at the Inverurie Morrisons store, Suzanne Hyde, said: “Being able to support such a great local charity really does make me proud.“It’s great to know that our support will make a genuine dference to the children who rely on the services provided by the club.”She added: “One of the aims of the Morrisons Foundation is being able to help smaller local charities that may otherwise be overlooked, so being able to support the After School Club is at the heart of what the Foundation is all about.“I’m so happy that we can provide this grant to help local children.”Local charites are encouraged to visit www.morrisonsfoundation for more information and how to apply for a grant.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..!

But despite the growing impact of this crisis, there has been little meaningful action from the Scottish Government.“One strand of attracting talented doctors to the region will be ensuring that our medical schools are better linked to our communities.

Orkney has the highest incidence of MS anywhere in Scotland and indeed worldwide.Commenting on the announcement, Mr McArthur said: “MS is a devastating condition that can cause serious pain and discomfort to those affected, seriously impacting upon their lives and those around them.“This decision by the Scottish Medicines Consortium to allow Ocrelizumab to be used in the treatment of early primary progressive MS is therefore excellent news. It is something I know that many constituents, as well as the MS Society, have been calling for over many month. Hopefully, it will help improve treatment and provide a signicant step forward in the fight against this debilitating condition.“Scotland is currently home to world class research that is looking into more ways that people can manage the symptoms of MS, with a view to eventually finding a cure. By sanctioning the use of Ocrelizumab, the SMC is helping encourage further breakthroughs in this research.“Meantime, organisations such as MS Society Orkney do extraordinary work to support those with MS and their families.

Let nationalists make the case for nationalism, we should make the make the argument for solidarity and internationalism.”So make that argument – where is it  This kind of comment sounds tired to anyone who has taken the scantest interest in Scottish politics at any point in the past decade. Not only does it prop up a topsy-turvy Brexiteer conception of the UK as some beguiling beacon of internationalism while in real time we can see the country floundering for a foothold post-Brexit, but it’s particularly grating in light of Scotland’s voting preference to remain within the EU, demonstrated not only at the time of the EU referendum but in subsequently voting in tranches of strongly pro-EU parliamentarians. : Labour leadership: Jess Philips says Scottish independence is ‘threat’ to working people: Why Labour MP Jess Phillips is obvious choice for next leader – Susan DalgetyAlso stale is the reductive framing of any and all support for Scottish independence as “nationalism”, while pretending “passionate” unionism is anything but an emotive appeal to patriotism and a refusal to grasp and discuss why so many Scots, including Labour members past and present, are drawn to self-governance. And yet, this is surely exactly the area where a savvier candidate might make headway, and demonstrate their understanding of the terrain. If Phillips wants to talk about other issues that matter, there’s nothing stopping her.Echo of Better TogetherWhile Philips was in Glasgow on Tuesday, reiterating her unyielding belief Scotland should remain in the UK, Johnson had just denied another Scottish independence referendum in a letter to Nicola Sturgeon. The parallel was likely unintended by the Phillips camp, but in an echo of ’s ill-advised Better Together partnership, such singing from the same song sheet only reiterates for cynical Scottish voters how close Labour’s position on independence is to that of the Tories. The tack Phillips took is less surprising with the realisation Blair McDougall is one of her advisors, as reported this week in the National, having already left Scottish Labour’s historic and staggering loss of  seats in his wake as well as Jim Murphy’s political career in tatters.With Labour trailing in the polls, and having done so for some time, Phillips is ultimately, in her advocacy for the United Kingdom, telling Scots we should endure a Tory Government until Labour can get into power – but the problem is, Scotland didn’t vote for Labour to represent them at Westminster either. The Johnson letter bluntly underscores the democratic indignity in the constitutional status quo. With support for unionism flying full mast on the same day and at the same time, Philips might as well have plugged Boris’ Big Ben bung for him too while she was here.Speaking to EnglandSo why take a hardline stance on unionism at all, when a signicant chunk of Scottish Labour voters are open to independence  It might be a signature McDougall manoeuvre, but it appears Phillips’ words aren’t really about or even for Scotland but setting herself apart from fellow candidates, Rebecca Long-Bailey and others who’ve expressed openness to the idea of another Scottish independence referendum. By comparison, they appear reasonable and supportive of democratic principles, while also having a little more insight into why Labour has fared so badly in Scotland in recent years. They personally might not desire independence, but have a base-line level of political depth in their ability to discuss it, rather than blurting discussion-blocking soundbites about ision, and it’s in that mould a more convincing candidate might build on ideas Corbyn stirred membership interest in, but sketched out too weakly in federal terms, and ultimately couldn’t deliver.Philips’ comments the week prior were that she “couldn’t understand” independence support “up there”. Clearly. We can learn something from how each candidate deals with the Scotland question – or, really, problem. There is the sense that when Phillips speaks about Scotland, she is really speaking to England, and specically to voters likely to be won over by patriotic displays. Labour’s unequivocable unionism has not been a vote winner in Scotland in recent years. Going so heavy handed on it at all while doing the Scottish press circuit seems both unnecessary and foolish.Solidarity in suffering Tory ruleBy the time she appeared on Scotland Tonight on Tuesday evening, at what would be ten-and-a-half Big Ben bongs, even Phillips seemed tired by her own argument, as reductivist as the campaign leaflets nobody has glanced twice at for years. But what even is her argument Does she have plans for how to bridge the electoral schism, and deal with the Scottish voters who’ve abandoned Labour in droves, other than by simply panning them outright when she states that she cares about kids in Birmingham and Glasgow, as through they’d leave them to starve  Does she have any more detail on this declaration of “solidarity” and what that means other than suffering the Tories together  What does she propose for Scottish industries particularly at risk of Brexit instability  Perhaps those parts haven’t been strategised yet.

Ms Sturgeon added: \"Scotland deserves the right to decide its own future and theres a really fundamental issue at stake in Scotland.\"Its not actually about whether or not Scotland should be independent - its about who gets to decide.

It is directly democratically accountable to the people of Scotland, over whom it exercises its legislative power.\"He continued: \"On specic issues of political or constitutional moment, however, it might be more appropriate for the legislature to make provision for direct consultation with, and voting by, the people on a specied single issue by way of a referendum. Regular elections and occasional referendums may be seen to be among the measures required to ensure continued democratic accountability in and legitimacy of a polity.\"Against that background, it would be surprising indeedthe Scottish Parliament were deprived of the power to hold referendums in Scotland. But the Scottish Parliament does indeed have power under the Scotland Act , to hold referendums.\"Academic opinion on the subject is ided.Aileen McHarg, a Professor of Public Law at Strathclyde University told The Scotsman last year that the position on Holyrood staging its own vote is “genuinely unclear”.“Quite a lot of people are saying it’s definitely unlawful,\" she said. \"I think those people are overstating their case because there is a plausible argument to be made that it is lawful, but there is a plausible argument that it’s not.”The Scotland Act which brought about the creation of the Scottish Parliament  years ago set out the areas which were reserved to Westminster. The ability to stage referendums is not listed among them. The debate hinges on the impact this has on the Union.In a legal sense, both the Brexit vote and  Scottish referendum were only “advisory”. So simply asking the question of Scots may not be seen as affecting the Union.Can we distinguish it as something that would directly affect the Union ” added McHarg. “That’s the point on which there is no clarity and it can only really be resolved by the courts.”The Edinburgh Agreement signed by Alex Salmond and David Cameron in  was seen as the “gold standard” of staging referendums in the UK and Sturgeon has said she would want to secure this again.Edinburgh University academic Dr Elisenda Casanas Adam told the paper in : “The question of whether the Scottish Parliament would have competence to legislate for an independence referendum was left open.

While it is widely accepted that modernisation of air traffic control infrastructure is needed across the region, Ms Wishart says Hial’s own consultants have acknowledged that the ‘remote tower’ model was the most ‘costly’ and ‘risky’ of the options available.The Liberal Democrat MSP has now lodged a motion in parliament that will see a debate on the issue take place later this month.“It now appears clear that Hial’s management is intent on pressing ahead with their plans to centralise air traffic control services.#This is deeply worrying given the serious questions that still hang over these proposals and the level of concern amongst ATC staff.“Hial has been intent on pursuing this option from the outset, despite its own consultants identying the ‘remote tower’ model as the most costly and risky option. Since then, there has been a desperate attempt to get the evidence to fit the desired outcome.“That is simply not acceptable, particularly given the leline nature of these air services. No-one disputes the need to modernise and invest in the current infrastructure. However, this must be balanced with the safety of passengers, reliability of services and the benefits of sustaining high-skilled jobs in our island communities.“To date, the Scottish government has been happy to wave through Hial’s proposals with little evidence of robust scrutiny. I hope this debate will force the Transport Minister to think again and begin asking serious questions about these latest centralisation plans.”Highlands and Islands MSP Jamie Halcro Johnston has added his voice to calls for a debate in Parliament on HIAL’s plans to centralise air traffic control in the region.Mr Halcro Johnston, an Orkney resident and regular user of Hial services, said: “I share the concern of many people over Hial’s plans to centralise air traffic control services in Inverness.“There is real concern amongst Hial employees that they don’t feel that they have been properly consulted, particularly amongst those living in the islands. Hial should reflect on the feedback they are receiving and review their options before they commit to the approach they are advocating.“I am yet to be convinced that these proposals from Hial aren’t more about saving money than providing a better service. Given how important our vital leline air-links are, that would focusing on the wrong priority from Hial. “I would welcome the opportunity to see the issue debated at Holyrood and, with Hial entirely owned by the Scottish government, to hear the Minister’s justication for Hial’s plans.# It is understood that Hial is planning to update staff and stakeholders on the air traffic controllers issue later this week. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"high tides lead to dramatic photos ","story":"The Aith leboat station was surrounded by water earlier this afternoon.

Participants have been assigned to a team and are following a six week programme of activity.

This programme is about far more than that as Club Chairman Jim Brady elaborates: “Our annual programme places its emphasis clearly on the achievement of personal goals for all involved. “For some that might be simply getting out of the house for an activity at a time of the year when the long nights and inclement weather may put you off leaving home. “For others it may be an opportunity to meet new people, to try something new or indeed … to lose some weight.“Whatever the goal, the programme seems to have captured the imagination of local people in great numbers since it started four years ago with some  people in total taking part. “As well as providing the participants with a range of activities to undertake we offer mental wellness sessions, a range of social events to attend and many opportunities to step outside of their comfort zone. “All of our fitness tutors are locally based and that means that as well as channelling funding towards them during the programme they also get a chance to show off their product and attract spin-off business as a result throughout the remainder of the year”.In  the programme was recognised at the Irish News Club  Volunteer Awards when it was awarded the prestigious award for best Club Health  Well Being initiative.

A sum of over poundk was raised principally through the team “Spinathon” at the Harmony Hub in the centre of Ballymena in February.

I am still weak but you can imagine what it is going to do for me when I fully recover.“I want to thank so many people, including my amazing CF team at Belfast City Hospital who pushed behind the scenes without me knowing, and the amazing staff on Level  South Transplant Ward who have become my second family.

As British citizens living in the United Kingdom, we have a complex and multi-layered identity which in many areas is wider than simply Ulster-Scots. We remain unconvinced that the cultural traditions and identity of the Orange family will be meaningfully promoted or safeguarded by these proposal.#Earlier Conradh na Gaeilge had branded the proposals an #historic advancement# for the Irish language but ones which fell #far short# of previous government commitments by the Irish and British governments.The deal includes a number of provisions for the language including the appointment of a Irish Language Commissioner.Dr Niall Comer, President of Conradh na Gaeilge, said that deal was #undoubtedly historic#, however, the organisation highlighted the absence of an Irish Language Act as promised in the  St Andrew#s Agreement. #This legislation is undoubtedly an historic advancement for our community, and for those who wish to use the language, by providing historic official status, legal protection and an Irish language Commissioner for the first time in the history of the state,# Dr Comer said.#This has only come about as the result of a tireless, inspirational and bottom up campaign which has transformed how people here now view the language and ultimately how the state will interact with our community and shared language moving forward.#Ciarán Mac Giolla Bhéin of Conradh na Gaeilge added: #This protection comes in the form of an Irish language Bill being pasted into the GFA, independent from the other language legislation, as new, separate parts of that agreement. If passed, we will hold any new power-sharing executive fully to account on the full implementation of these proposals and will tirelessly test and expose the weaknesses and glaring omissions in the coming days, weeks and months. #There are some huge question marks here. These proposals fall far short of the commitments made in the  St Andrew’s Agreement, which promised an Irish language Act based on the Welsh legislation and does not contain provisions that are made for language in Wales or in the south, as was explicitly committed to by both Governments. #The complete omission of visibility and signage is hugely frustrating and will undoubtedly be a source of tension and will expose major fault-lines on contested cases of signage in the coming period. However, the possibility of the delivery of signage through language standards will be rigorously and immediately tested by our community. #The role and remit of the commissioner being left to the sign-off of OFMDFM leaves us at the whim of a veto being used against core components of the legislation and drafting and delivery of services. The use of any veto to limit, obstruct or frustrate delivery of services and rights would undoubtedly erode trust and could be potentially catastrophic for any incoming Executive.#We welcome the adoption of recommendations included in our consultation document for the centuries long overdue repeal of the final remaining  Penal Law, that will now facilitate the use of Irish in Courts the new central translations hub the right to use Irish in the Assembly, where it was previously sneered at and belittled, which includes a provision for simultaneous translation. Finally, the commitment to an Irish language Strategy has the potential to transform our community in the coming years. #We will now work diligently towards testing the glaring gaps in the legislation that prevent us from playing a fair and equal role in our society. Legal advice is being sought on several of the provisions, including the ‘official status’ provision. The devil is not only in the detail of the legislation, but in the implementation of that legislation.#"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"o theanga leipreachain go dti acht ghaeilge","story":"I , caitheadh amach as mo chéad chruinniú den Chomhairle i mBéal Feirste mé as Gaeilge a labhairt.Nó “teanga leipreacháin” mar bhaist Sammy Wilson uirthi.Mhuscail mé inniu agus Acht Ghaeilge ar an táirseach againn.Moill ró-fhada ach d’éirigh linn mar phobal Gaeilge ó Thuaidh tabhairt ar na húdaráis an tAcht a bhí geallta ó  a ghéillstin.Tá na heilimintí tábhachtacha atá de dhíth in aon Acht ansin:Stádas oigiúil.Coimisinéir Teanga.Caighdeáin seachas scéimeanna.Agus ar ndóighe tá ríméad ar leith orm go bhfuil aistriúchán comhuaineach le bheith curtha ar fáil sa Tionól féin agus comhaltaí ag caint Gaeilge.

Topping the bill at the London Palladium in the s she remains the only artist in history to have five records in the UK top twenty in the same week.

The passing of a mutual friend brought artist and writer in contact, which spurred Michael to research Ruby’s le. The play was developed with access and support from Ruby’s immediate family including her first husband Bernie Burgess, their son Tim Murray as well as creative support from, the late, well-known writer, director and actor Sam McCready.Looking forward to reviving her role as Ruby, actress Libby Smyth added: “It’s been a privilege for me to bring Ruby’s story to a wider audience and also to meet her family and hear their stories at first hand.

With the invaluable assistance of Martin McGuinness, he brought the Provisional IRA to not only lay down its arms, but to decommission them, without ending partition.As Leo Varadkar dissolved the Dail yesterday, an emotional Adams was telling a party meeting in Dundalk he would not be seeking re-election as the Louth TD. He can take pride in utterly transforming Sinn Fein, bringing it from the far-flung margins to the centre-stage of Irish politics. He made it into a formidable electoral machine - although as he bows out, the partys fortunes do not look as bright as they did not so long ago.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetAdams has said he was never \"caught up in the notions of leadership\" but you dont remain at the top of the republican movement for four decades without ruthless ambition.He first saw the electoral potential for Sinn Fein during the  hunger strike when Bobby Sands was elected MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone.It is sometimes presented as a case of John Hume and Dublin convincing him of the merits of constitutionalism or half-dragging him along. But former senior IRA colleagues insist that he had long been set on that destination.As a former Army Council member, he may have sanctioned some of the worst atrocities of the conflict - yet without him the current peace would not be in place.Yet while McGuinness won the grudging respect even of those who despised his paramilitary past, Adams is universally disliked outside the nationalist community.As he stepped down from frontline politics, he celebrated theof power-sharing here last week. In the corridors of Stormont, where he served as an MLA for  years, there is little warmth for him beyond the Sinn Fein team. He lacked McGuinness easy charm. He always came across as too aloof and calculating. It is Adams strategising that saw him not only survive so long, but prosper. He played the long game while those around him were caught up in the day-to-day realities of the conflict.His two closest comrades back in the s had very dferent experiences. Ivor Bell was cleared two months ago of soliciting the murder of mother-of- Jean McConville. It was the end of a five-year legal battle for the -year-old who is in ill health. Former Belfast Brigade commander, the late Brendan Hughes, knew Gerry Adams intimately. A photo on his living-room wall showed two tanned, smiling young men in Long Kesh with their arms wrapped around each other - Adams and Hughes.In , two years before he died, Hughes told me: \"Gerry wasnt trusted bygrassroots and I was. He used me to up his own status. I had % faith in him. I defended him so many times when I shouldnt have.\"I never saw his agenda. He was far too shrewd, which is why he is where he is today. He was charismatic like Mick Collins but at least Mick Collins didnt just give orders, he fired shots himself. Gerry never did, not even at training camps in the South.Hughes said: \"I thought the struggle was about improving le for the community, not about certain people climbing up the ladder. It was never about glory for me. There is no glory in war, there is no glory in killing people. But for Gerry it was about using people to get glory and power.

We have been there to help, but in six weeks time, unless things change, thats going to end.\"She added: \"The longer we all sit back and talk around the mental health problem, the more people are going to suffer.

Last week they were stunned to receive a report of a dog matching Moses description at Wood Green Animal Sanctuary. The charity at Godmanchester in Cambridge recently featured in a Channel Four series called The Dog House.As Moses boarded the overnight boat back to Belfast yesterday - this time as a fully paid passenger - the family recalled the extraordinary tale of his misadventure.Carol made the -hour-journey to Cambridge with her daughters Julie and Joan Hill overnight on Tuesday. But being reunited with Moses was not all plain sailing. \"We were made aware that a very matted poodle was found in not great condition in Godmanchester, when the girl who found him put up a post on Facebook,\" said Carol.\"This was a week ago and when we first contacted the rescue shelter they wouldnt accept that it could be our dog because he had come from Northern Ireland.\"They initially refused to let us visit and it was only on Monday that they finally agreed and we booked the next boat to Liverpool which was Tuesday night.\"During his long journey from Belfast to the south of England Moses suffered terribly.\"When rescued his coat was completely matted, he had lost some teeth and he was riddled with fleas. The rescue centre shaved his matted hair and started to nurse him back to good health.Joan said: \"I knew straight away that it was Moses and I just fell to the floor and cried. He was always a very happy, bouncy dog but he is very timid and scared. He is going to need a lot of cuddles and love.\"She added: \"It would appear that Moses was on board a shipping container and was shipped to England. If he was on this shipping container before Christmas, and we think he was, then he may have been in England for several weeks surviving on what he could.\"It is a four-hour drive from Liverpool to Godmanchester and it doesnt bear thinking about that he made that journey on foot.\""},{"url":null,"title":"lights from medical marijuana farm turn sky purple in arizona town","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Former Derry minors Jamie Dugganand Ronan McFaulwere missing through injury. Maghera had use of the breeze in the opening half but failed to take full advantage and only went in level at the break, - to - with Sean Kearneys equalising point after Conor McGillions th minute goal. googletag.cmd.push Fullerton, recently awarded an Ulster Schools All-Star, rounded Pauidie McLaughlin to blast home Omaghs second goal after just  seconds of the second-half. From then, the Derry men were chasing the game. Fullerton called an attacking mark from McGillions long ball before slotting home Omaghs third goal in the st minute to open a - to - lead.  Two goals inside as many minutes from Cahir Higgins had Maghera levelby the th minute before they emptied the bench. Matthew Downey, Shea Cassidy, Liam Downey and James McGurk were all introduced at once but it was Fullerton who took over again. He kicked two points, including an eye-catching effort from a sideline, to put Omagh on the front foot again. googletag.cmd.push In the last play of the game, Fullerton got on the end of All-Star goalkeeper Oran Grimes  before tucking home a fourth Omagh goal to seal a final spot against the winners of Fridays clash of St Colmans and St Patricks Dungannon.

John Dallats introduction to politics came quite by chance.An invitation to join a new branch of the SDLP was sent to his brother, but John went instead and almost got selected to run for council.He declined, pleading that he was living and teaching in Donegal.Four years later, after ing to Kilrea to take up a teaching post at St Paul’s College, he was chosen to run and so began a letime of council work which culminated in John becoming the first ever nationalist mayor in Coleraine.This period also represented his involvement in rejuvenating the local Credit Union which was in danger of closingA new Conference of Saint Vincent de Paulwas also being set up in Kilrea which would do amazing things for people.Around the same time, the man who was about to become one of Ulsters most hated sectarian killers, was placed by the Probation Service in the very town John lived, and worked in.Just before committing the Castlerock and Greysteel atrocities, UFF murdererTorrens Knight was placed on a local community employment scheme in Kilrea.He left without completing the year of work he was ordered to do by the courts.“The rest is, of course history,” said John. “He and his cronies murdered my friend Gerry Dalrymple, who was in my house the night before the Castlerock murder of four workmen.“His last advice to me was to pull my curtains.“The following morning, he was dead and so too were three of his workmates.“These were dark and dangerous times with armed cops sitting outside the council chamber.“In the beginning I thought they were protecting unionists but when I complained that they could be better used other places I was told by the Divisional Commander it was me they were looking after because I had no control over my mouth!“Yes, Ulster Resistance had brought in guns which were ided among the UDA and UVF and in the future innocent people would die at Castlerock, Greysteel and where.“Among those in the security forces to die was Bertie Gilmore who lived in the same lane as me.“We played together, grew up together and Bertie joined the UDR and I the SDLP. googletag.cmd.push  John Dallat ready for the road in his beloved Morris Minor car. Photo: Mary K Burke “He had retired three years and was recovering from a severe heart attack when he and his we were riddled with gunfire beside the retirement site he was going to build.“Today his daughter is among those who have helped me in challenging times.”Johnwas born and bred in Rasharkin, Co Antrim.“On reflectionI was asked to be born into a dferent house in a dferent place I would turn it down.“I was happy growing up by a Tilley Lamp, carrying water from the well and waking up in the morning with ice on the inside of the windows.“Later on I loved the ‘put-put’ of our ‘Start-o-matic’ generator and Peeke my pet pigeon was never from my side.“She had fallen out of the nest and my mother nursed her back to le while she grew the most beautul brown and white feathers.“An amazing creature of God. I knew why we couldn’t get a council house and I know it was more than just because we were Catholics. “Poor Protestants didn’t get council houses either because they might also be unable to pay the council rent.“Anyway, we kept a goat for the milk which was good for my wee brother Gerard who was special needs both physically and mentally.“He died when he was  and part of my mother and father died too.”John said that being the “underdog” was second nature to him growing up.And it was something he carried with him into his politics career.“It just seemed right and at times didn’t go down well, especially when I sided with the travellers when they came to town but the travellers were good people and attitudes changed,” he said.“When a young girl from a dferent part of the world suffered horric le-changing injuries after losing her job and was left homeless, it seemed right to have her for Christmas in our home and it was one of our best and happiest times ever.“Today she and her family are our best friends and we love them to bits.“When an African student was going to be deported because her visa ran out and her sponsor died suddenly it seemed only right to bring her home and set about stopping her going back to a country where she had only a blind grandmother and no one .“Luck had it I met the head of the Border Agency in Stormont on the corridor and he extended her stay for two years.“In the meantime, she met an amazing husband, married and is among our best friends.“Brian Kennedy played at the wedding and we dressed up in African traditional dress!There is one battle, not yet won, which has had the most impact on John in his role as a public representative.He said: “Perhaps the one story which doesn’t have a good ending just yet is the dreadful murder of Inga-Maria Hauser whose mutilated body was found in Ballypatrick Forest  days after her neck was broken in an attempted rape.“Early next year I will meet her only sister Frederika at a special conference in Queen’s University.“That will be an amazing occasion and hopefully the prelude to her murderer being brought before the courts for one of the most brutal killings I have ever read about.”At the heart of it all has been one thing, John’s family.“Politics had its mixed blessings. I got to see places in the world that I could never have been but it also brought its problems – searching under the car for booby traps, bullet-proof windows and doors and a gun that I know I would never have used.“But politics also gave me the most incredible family.“My poor we Anne was parachuted into the north at the height of the Troubles to a small town which was bombed from one end to the other.“Our daughter, Helena, now a councillor, became the youngest detainee when we were arrested by the British army in Derry shortly after crossing the border.“She was ten days old and our mission was simply showing her off to her Donegal grandparents.“Sixteen years later as a member of the Foyle Harp School she played for President Bill Clinton when he first made that history-making appearance in Mackey’s Foundry.“Later, she would entertain other leaders including President Robinson and McAleese as well as John Major and member of the Royal Family.“I felt honoured when she was invited to play in the Russian Embassy in Washington on Saint Patrick’s Day.“Today the same harp is never out of sight but not played in public anymore.”John added: “Our two sons, Ronan and Diarmuid have been amazing and in one dficult and dangerous year we were on the Aran Islands three times for our safety.“For  years Inishmore, the largest of the three Aran Islands has been our refuge, our safety valve and our friend.“Two weeks ago when I was in hospital after breaking my arm while canvassing, Vincent Mc Carron, one of our friends, left the island during a storm, drove to Kilrea to collect Anne, go to Derry to collect me from hospital and bring me home. He stayed for several days helping with my recovery.”In , one week after his mother sadly passed away, John became Deputy Speaker, a post he held for ten years.“I found it a strange place and certainly not reflecting my background where the term ’Mister’ was hardly order of the day.“In time I persuaded the doorkeepers and others to call me by my first name and I felt comfortable about that.“I felt I was dismantling a bit of the old Stormont that was in danger of being rejuvenated!“All these people were my friends by simply showing them a bit of respect, nothing more and I have missed them dearly over the last three years when I see little of them anymore.”Reflecting on challenges and achievements in his political career, Mr Dallat spoke about stopping the closure or the Belfast-Derry railway north of Ballymena.”The twenty-year project nearly went off the rails several times,” he said.“The Civil Service had a plan to save money by closing the railway north of Ballymena and use the savings to make a start on the A roadway though Toome.“Today the Belfast-Derry railway carries many more passengers than the Belfast-Dublin Enterprise service, but still needs connected to the Irish Rail network and that is a priority for me.John added: “Stopping the closure of the Irish Coastguard Radio Station at Malin Head, announced by Leo Varadkar when he was Minister for Transport.“I gave evidence to a Dail committee with two of my councillors and told the TD’s this was one of the best examples of cross-border bodies, seamless, transcending partition and two world wars, costing very little and actually working! Varadkar had to back down.”As vice-chair of the Public Accounts Committee I exposed wanton waste of public money and brought about important changes which the civil service didn’t like.“Effort to cover up who was responsible for bad mistakes and neglect were strenuously resisted.“Later I was invited to Georgia and Armenia to share my experiences and I felt so honoured and privileged.“I just couldn’t believe that a boy that grew up in a house with no electricity, no running water could be involved in helping democracy grow in two of Russia’s former territories.”With the Assembly back up and running, John says he has great hope for the future.“I have been through the best and the worst of times and see an amazing future for this part of Ireland.“I see wonderful people all around me in both communities and I want to be part of that community for the sake of future generations that will create a new Ireland and one we can all celebrate.“I would encourage every young person to do likewise.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

John Dallats introduction to politics came quite by chance.An invitation to join a new branch of the SDLP was sent to his brother, but John went instead and almost got selected to run for council.He declined, pleading that he was living and teaching in Donegal.Four years later, after ing to Kilrea to take up a teaching post at St Paul’s College, he was chosen to run and so began a letime of council work which culminated in John becoming the first ever nationalist mayor in Coleraine.This period also represented his involvement in rejuvenating the local Credit Union which was in danger of closingA new Conference of Saint Vincent de Paulwas also being set up in Kilrea which would do amazing things for people.Around the same time, the man who was about to become one of Ulsters most hated sectarian killers, was placed by the Probation Service in the very town John lived, and worked in.Just before committing the Castlerock and Greysteel atrocities, UFF murdererTorrens Knight was placed on a local community employment scheme in Kilrea.He left without completing the year of work he was ordered to do by the courts.“The rest is, of course history,” said John. “He and his cronies murdered my friend Gerry Dalrymple, who was in my house the night before the Castlerock murder of four workmen.“His last advice to me was to pull my curtains.“The following morning, he was dead and so too were three of his workmates.“These were dark and dangerous times with armed cops sitting outside the council chamber.“In the beginning I thought they were protecting unionists but when I complained that they could be better used other places I was told by the Divisional Commander it was me they were looking after because I had no control over my mouth!“Yes, Ulster Resistance had brought in guns which were ided among the UDA and UVF and in the future innocent people would die at Castlerock, Greysteel and where.“Among those in the security forces to die was Bertie Gilmore who lived in the same lane as me.“We played together, grew up together and Bertie joined the UDR and I the SDLP. googletag.cmd.push  John Dallat ready for the road in his beloved Morris Minor car. Photo: Mary K Burke “He had retired three years and was recovering from a severe heart attack when he and his we were riddled with gunfire beside the retirement site he was going to build.“Today his daughter is among those who have helped me in challenging times.”Johnwas born and bred in Rasharkin, Co Antrim.“On reflectionI was asked to be born into a dferent house in a dferent place I would turn it down.“I was happy growing up by a Tilley Lamp, carrying water from the well and waking up in the morning with ice on the inside of the windows.“Later on I loved the ‘put-put’ of our ‘Start-o-matic’ generator and Peeke my pet pigeon was never from my side.“She had fallen out of the nest and my mother nursed her back to le while she grew the most beautul brown and white feathers.“An amazing creature of God. I knew why we couldn’t get a council house and I know it was more than just because we were Catholics. “Poor Protestants didn’t get council houses either because they might also be unable to pay the council rent.“Anyway, we kept a goat for the milk which was good for my wee brother Gerard who was special needs both physically and mentally.“He died when he was  and part of my mother and father died too.”John said that being the “underdog” was second nature to him growing up.And it was something he carried with him into his politics career.“It just seemed right and at times didn’t go down well, especially when I sided with the travellers when they came to town but the travellers were good people and attitudes changed,” he said.“When a young girl from a dferent part of the world suffered horric le-changing injuries after losing her job and was left homeless, it seemed right to have her for Christmas in our home and it was one of our best and happiest times ever.“Today she and her family are our best friends and we love them to bits.“When an African student was going to be deported because her visa ran out and her sponsor died suddenly it seemed only right to bring her home and set about stopping her going back to a country where she had only a blind grandmother and no one .“Luck had it I met the head of the Border Agency in Stormont on the corridor and he extended her stay for two years.“In the meantime, she met an amazing husband, married and is among our best friends.“Brian Kennedy played at the wedding and we dressed up in African traditional dress!There is one battle, not yet won, which has had the most impact on John in his role as a public representative.He said: “Perhaps the one story which doesn’t have a good ending just yet is the dreadful murder of Inga-Maria Hauser whose mutilated body was found in Ballypatrick Forest  days after her neck was broken in an attempted rape.“Early next year I will meet her only sister Frederika at a special conference in Queen’s University.“That will be an amazing occasion and hopefully the prelude to her murderer being brought before the courts for one of the most brutal killings I have ever read about.”At the heart of it all has been one thing, John’s family.“Politics had its mixed blessings. I got to see places in the world that I could never have been but it also brought its problems – searching under the car for booby traps, bullet-proof windows and doors and a gun that I know I would never have used.“But politics also gave me the most incredible family.“My poor we Anne was parachuted into the north at the height of the Troubles to a small town which was bombed from one end to the other.“Our daughter, Helena, now a councillor, became the youngest detainee when we were arrested by the British army in Derry shortly after crossing the border.“She was ten days old and our mission was simply showing her off to her Donegal grandparents.“Sixteen years later as a member of the Foyle Harp School she played for President Bill Clinton when he first made that history-making appearance in Mackey’s Foundry.“Later, she would entertain other leaders including President Robinson and McAleese as well as John Major and member of the Royal Family.“I felt honoured when she was invited to play in the Russian Embassy in Washington on Saint Patrick’s Day.“Today the same harp is never out of sight but not played in public anymore.”John added: “Our two sons, Ronan and Diarmuid have been amazing and in one dficult and dangerous year we were on the Aran Islands three times for our safety.“For  years Inishmore, the largest of the three Aran Islands has been our refuge, our safety valve and our friend.“Two weeks ago when I was in hospital after breaking my arm while canvassing, Vincent Mc Carron, one of our friends, left the island during a storm, drove to Kilrea to collect Anne, go to Derry to collect me from hospital and bring me home. He stayed for several days helping with my recovery.”In , one week after his mother sadly passed away, John became Deputy Speaker, a post he held for ten years.“I found it a strange place and certainly not reflecting my background where the term ’Mister’ was hardly order of the day.“In time I persuaded the doorkeepers and others to call me by my first name and I felt comfortable about that.“I felt I was dismantling a bit of the old Stormont that was in danger of being rejuvenated!“All these people were my friends by simply showing them a bit of respect, nothing more and I have missed them dearly over the last three years when I see little of them anymore.”Reflecting on challenges and achievements in his political career, Mr Dallat spoke about stopping the closure or the Belfast-Derry railway north of Ballymena.”The twenty-year project nearly went off the rails several times,” he said.“The Civil Service had a plan to save money by closing the railway north of Ballymena and use the savings to make a start on the A roadway though Toome.“Today the Belfast-Derry railway carries many more passengers than the Belfast-Dublin Enterprise service, but still needs connected to the Irish Rail network and that is a priority for me.John added: “Stopping the closure of the Irish Coastguard Radio Station at Malin Head, announced by Leo Varadkar when he was Minister for Transport.“I gave evidence to a Dail committee with two of my councillors and told the TD’s this was one of the best examples of cross-border bodies, seamless, transcending partition and two world wars, costing very little and actually working! Varadkar had to back down.”As vice-chair of the Public Accounts Committee I exposed wanton waste of public money and brought about important changes which the civil service didn’t like.“Effort to cover up who was responsible for bad mistakes and neglect were strenuously resisted.“Later I was invited to Georgia and Armenia to share my experiences and I felt so honoured and privileged.“I just couldn’t believe that a boy that grew up in a house with no electricity, no running water could be involved in helping democracy grow in two of Russia’s former territories.”With the Assembly back up and running, John says he has great hope for the future.“I have been through the best and the worst of times and see an amazing future for this part of Ireland.“I see wonderful people all around me in both communities and I want to be part of that community for the sake of future generations that will create a new Ireland and one we can all celebrate.“I would encourage every young person to do likewise.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Nurses and health care workers have been stagingindustrial action in protest against pay and staffing levels which they say are unsafe.On Tuesday, Mr Swann announced a plan in the Northern Ireland Assembly chamber to add an extra pound million to previous available funding to bring wages for health care workers here up to the same level as England, Scotland and Wales.On the issue of staffing, he said safe staffing would not be achievable immediately but that he would work with his staff to draw up a workable plan.Healthcare unions, the RCN Sinn Feacutein health spokesperson on Derry City and Strabane District Council, Councillor Sandra Duffy, has welcomed Mr Swanns plans.“I am delighted that health and social care workers in the North will achieve pay parity.Health workers are the backbone of our health and social care system.“People working at all levels of the health service consistently deliver high-quality and compas- sionate care in extremely dficult situations.Councillor Duffy said she supported the health workers strike action.“It is unfortunate that over recent months our health workers have been left with no option but to strike and I commend the work of trade unions who have stood up for pay justice for HSC workers and safe staffing levels.“I also welcome the commitment from the Health Minister to produce a costed implementation plan for safe staffing levels in the near future.This must be done in close co-operation with the health trade unions.“There is an onus on the British Government to deliver upon their commitment to provide the necessary finances.”She concluded: “Sinn Feacutein will continue to support our health staff in the time ahead and hold the Minister and the Department of Health to account to ensure these commitments are lived up to.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In November a lorry travelling from the cityside to the Waterside got stuck on the lower deck for several hours.SDLP Councillor for the Waterside, Martin Reilly, said Tuesdays incident caused widespread traffic dis- ruption. There was an issue with a lorry stuck on the approach to Waterside end of the lower deck of the Craigavon Bridge on Tuesday afternoon and it caused signicant traffic delays, he said.Councillor Reilly said road signage at Fountain Hill - the steepest street in the North - should also be reviewed. A coach got stuck last week while in May a bus blocked the street for six hours, before it was removed by crane. Long vehicles are unable to turn out of Fountain Hill onto Spencer Road, which is a busy commercial area, said Councillor Reilly.I will be contacting SDLP MLA Nicola Mallon who is the new Minister for Infrastructure to ask for the road signage on the approach to both ends of the Craigavon Bridge and Fountain Hill to be reviewed.”Councillor Reilly concluded: When vehicles get stuck it has ramications for traffic flow on all the surrounding roads and it can cause signicant delays. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Candystripes travel to Drogheda United tomorrow for their first pre-season friendly game, before hosting Finn Harps at the Brandywell, next Wednesday, January . Declan Devines team then host Institute on Tuesday, January  before facing Portadown at the Brandywell on Friday, January , just two weeks before the new season opener at Dundalk. Given what hes experienced in the past fortnight, Clford has no doubt that he and the players will be ready when the time comes.“Every pre-season is tough,” he admitted. “Ive done a right few in my career but this one has been right up there with the toughest Ive done. I was training hard in the off-season and preparing myself but its been really tough. “We have been in nearly two weeks now and every day theres been double and treble sessions and weve been flat out doing dferent things. We did something there in the swimming pool the other day and Ive never done anything like it. You feel great after its over and done with but its really tough.”The games are now set to come thick and fast as City prepare to visit the champions on the opening day of the  League of Ireland season, and Clford agrees that hard work now could pay idends at Oriel Park on February . “Doing all the running is one thing but the best part is when the matches come because thats what you want to be doing,” he stated. “You cant wait to get out and play so were all looking forward to the games coming now. “Its going to come quickly now. “Theres only six or seven weeks of hard pre-season training then the games come thick and fast. We start the season at Dundalk and its going to be a great occasion.” googletag.cmd.push Eager to impressClford is eager to impress at his new club, and having left St. Patricks Athletic after  months at Inchicore, the former Cha youngster is hoping to establish himself at the Brandywell. “I felt that last year was a good season for me because I played in every game and scored four or five goals and played and scored in Europe,” he explained. “The change of manager and the finances was out of my control but then I came here. “Derry showed an interest and they are a massive club in Ireland and I think we can really do well this year. Europe is something to look forward to as well. Im hoping that I can have a good season, Im in good nick at the minute and theres a few weeks to go and Im raring to go and I cant wait to get started.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I enjoyed it up here the last time so it was a but of a no brainer to come back and Im happy with my decision because things are going well.”McCormack and his new team mates have been in pre-season training for almost two weeks now and the midfielder agrees the team will be ready for the big kick off at Dundalk on February .“Training has been very good,” he acknowledged. “Theres a lot of players in there and the staff have us right on it. This week we have had a lot of sessions and a lot of changing up of sessions – weve had swimming, yoga, spinning and running sessions as well so its all been mixed up so its been a good iety. It has been very interesting very good and we are all enjoying working very hard.City will travel to Drogheda United tomorrow for their first pre-season friendly game and McCormack is looking forward to seeing the squad take shape over the coming weeks. “It will be good to get the first pre-season game out of the way and get the cobwebs off and the shackles off and prepare us then for the first game at Dundalk,” he said. “The quality is around the group and Declan will bring in two or three more to build around the squad. There are some good young lads coming through as well.” googletag.cmd.push MallonMeanwhile, another new Candystripe is hoping to make an immediate impact in the coming weeks. Stephen Mallon took the advice of friend and Sheffield United team mate David Parkhouse before agreeing to come to the Brandywell and is hoping to be just as successful.“I’ve already had a word with him and told him I’m going to try and do a bit better, maybe go one step further,” he explained.“One thing I promise is I will give  per cent to the badge very week. I’ll work my socks off and hopefully I can get a few goals and assists and help the team and maybe even get some silverware at the end.“It was actually David who came up with the idea of me coming here and when I talked to him he spoke very highly of the club of the league, the staff and the players, so it was just something I thought was a great idea and so far I’m enjoying it here.City fans will likely get their first glimpse of Mallon when Derry City face Finn Harps next Wednesday, January , the first pre-season friendly game at home and Mallon himself cannot wait to get started.“I’m looking forward to it,” he added. “It’s an opportunity for me to go and get games, get playing and get that experience I’ve needed this past couple of years. I’m not coming over here with the mindset that it’s a backward move becauseI thought that I probably wouldn’t have come,” he said.“I know this league has got some talented players and the tempo and everything just suits me. I can come here, work hard, get games and put myself in the shop window to kick on from here.“Everyone saw what ‘Parky’ did last year and he’s put himself in a miles better position than what he was in before he came here.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Bangor attacker played in Kurtis Bell, who slotted the ball into the inside side-netting after Saintfield were dispossessed at the edge of their own box.Saintfield raised it a few gears and struck three times in the  minutes before half-time.The first came from Andrew Clarke after James Sofley was played down the line. After beating two defenders, James played in Andrew, who passed the ball into the bottom right-hand corner past the lsquokeeper.It took less than five minutes for left back Oliver Duff to score Saintfieldrsquos third. A long ball found Adam Childs on the left wing.He played it back to the edge of the box for Duff. He took one touch to set himself before striking a powerful left-footed shot into the bottom right corner.The Saints scored one more goal before the break with Andrew Clarke playing the ball across the face of goal for Tony Liken to finish at the back post. Saintfield went into half-time in the driving seat and - up.The second half started much like the first ended with Saintfield scoring an early goal.Ryan Sofley was the supplier of an own goal after bombing into the box and fizzing a cross into the near post which ricocheted off the Bangor defender into the net.At - up, the Saints took their foot off the gas and conceded just over five minutes after scoring.Bangor gained possession from a loose ball in midfield and played it into Matty Hall, who turned well to beat the Saintfield defender before striking the ball low and hard into the bottom corner.The Saints were again quick to respond with Andrew Clarke getting his hat-trick with half an hour still to go.Clarke started the move in midfield and finished it expertly after James Sofleyrsquos effort was parried by the lsquokeeper.Saintfield had a penalty and rebound saved less than two minutes later after James Sofley was brought down in the box.However, the Saints werenrsquot finished yet and Clarke had one more goal left in them with  minutes left to go. Possibly the best goal of the game, as he showed real determination and skill to score his fourth. Another counter-attacking goal from the Saints as they broke fast from a Bangor corner.Clarke received the ball just inside the Bangor half and stood tall after several attempts to bring him down. He beat three defenders before slotting home a cool finish into the bottom corner.This goal also signalled the end of the goalkeeperrsquos game after he strongly disagreed with the refereersquos decision to allow the goal to stand. Bangor had one more chance before the end of the game when they were also awarded a penalty, but David Harper kept the Saintsrsquo five-goal lead intact and made it a penalty saved for both teams.A great performance for Saintfield who progress to the next round of the cup and a fantastic performance from  year-old Andrew Clarke who relished his role as an attacking midfielder.Saintfield United Bangor Young Men CLARENCE CUP ND ROUND.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th January 2020 Call.jpg","title":"Call to begin work on Ballynahinch bypass  ","story":"THE re-establishment of the Stormont Executive has led to fresh calls for work to start on Ballynahinchrsquos proposed multi-million pound bypass.Newly appointed Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon is being urged to signal the start of construction work on the scheme which is estimated to cost in excess of poundm.South Down MP Chris Hazzard mdash a former roads minister in a previous Executive who signed off the eagerly-awaited bypass in December  mdash has written to Ms Mallon seeking an assurance that the Ballynahinch scheme remains a priority for her department and that construction work will start as soon as possible.In addition, Rowallane councillor Billy Walker is tabling a notice of motion at the February meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council seeking across-the-board political support to seek an urgent meeting with Ms Mallon discuss the next step in the construction of the bypass.He also confirmed that Strangford MP, Jim Shannon, has written to Ms Mallon on the issue and is seeking a meeting with her to discuss the issue.There has been major progress on work on the near two-mile scheme to link the Newcastle and Saintfield roads, with work already completed on a major archaeological investigation along parts of the route.Work was due to complete on the schemersquos economic appraisal before the end of last year, with roads engineers confirming recently that in order to advance the bypass schemersquos state of readiness, preparatory work on contract documents was ongoing to ldquominimise the time required to initiate a procurement competition, should funding become available for construction.The by-pass, which would be the single biggest road scheme ever constructed in the district, is expected to take in excess of  months to build, with roads officials insisting that it will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety.They are also confident that the schemersquos economic assessment demonstrates the by-pass would provide a good economic .The scheme is designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town.Major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road, with a new bridge constructed over the Moss Road.It is also proposed that a section of the bypass will pass under part of the Crossgar Road with a  metre long bridge constructed to take traffic over Ballynahinch River.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the bypass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.Mr Hazzard said that following his decision to formally sign off the scheme at the end of , the government department had been working through ious legal stages to ensure the scheme could commence as soon as possible.ldquoA programme of geotechnical investigation works on lands along theof the scheme was completed in  with advanced archeological investigation works completed last year, he confirmed.ldquoThis allowed the Department to move ahead with the final stage of preparing contract documentation in readiness of funding becoming available to construct the scheme.Mr Hazzard added: ldquoWith an Infrastructure Minister now in place following the restoration of Stormont this week, funding should now be signed off and construction allowed to commence as soon as possible.Cllr Walker said it was the view of many, including senior roads engineers, that the multi-million pound scheme was vital to the survival of Ballynahinch town centre and will play a signicant role in helping boost the wider South Down economy.He said given that the project is shovel ready, it is essential that the cash is earmarked to allow construction work to start this year is forthcoming.ldquoMoving forward what is now required is the finance to build this scheme, continued Cllr Walker.ldquoIt is clear to me that when you look at other parts of Northern Ireland that Down District has consistently missed out on major roads funding. That must change and the cash needed to build Ballynahinchrsquos new bypass must be made available.The Rowallane councillor said that the bypass can help kick-start the economic regeneration of Ballynahinch town centre and act as a catalyst to encourage new investment.Cllr Walker added: ldquoThe eagerly-awaited scheme can address town centre gridlock and along the main approach roads.

Lidl, which currently employs  staff, claims its proposal will create  new jobs.In late November, the local council confirmed that outline permission granted in March for the multi-million pound development was to be quashed as a result of a judicial review brought by developer Don Holdings Ltd.However, days later, the agenda for the December meeting of the Planning Committee included a plannersrsquo recommendation to approve the new store proposal.

The cabinet was later found along the side of the Carrickmannon Road, near Ballygowan.The drugs taken included heroin and cocaine, both of which are dangerous even in small doses. They are types of hard drug in big demand on the black market. Additives like glucose are used by drug pushers to multiply the volume and increase profits. Other drugs, including morphine and strychnine, were also taken.The raid was the latest in a spate across the province and police fear that the addiction problem could be more serious than previously realised.Police chiefs have backed chemists pressing for an urgent review of the Home Office regulations about the keeping of prescribed drugs in steel cabinets.The present procedure is making things too easy for the thieves. It has meant that the hard drugs are all kept in the same place and the professional thief knows that.Before  regulations, chemists had better safeguards, evenit meant hiding the hard drugs on the general drugs shelves. It meant that thieves could not go straight to the security cabinet and other break it open or take it with them.The head of the RUCrsquos drugs squad, Chief Inspective George McBride, said he agreed that there was an urgent need to re-examine safety procedures for storage of dangerous drugs.DOWNPATRICK mdash Compensation for the destruction of St Patrickrsquos Hall in Downpatrick has been agreed mdash almost six years after it was destroyed by fire.The trustees of St Patrickrsquos Parish were awarded pound, at Downpatrick Crown Court last Friday after a two-hour hearing.The award was made in four parts, the bulkbeing attributable to physical damage and the remainder split between loss of profits , contentsand site value pound,.The claim had been before the court for over a year and was held up after the Northern Ireland Office disputed the amount of the parishrsquos claim for loss of profits.On Friday counsel for the Northern Ireland Office argued that the hall trustees had not made a big enough effort to reduce lost profits.

The Ballynahinch venture was unique in having a large amount of surviving documentation.Mr Reid says it is clear from these papers that the scheme organised by the First Presbyterian Church was sophisticated, comprehensive, self-funded, and cradle-to-grave in scope. It included widowsrsquo and old age pensions, end of le and burial grants, and support for orphans.Finance allocated to the project was known as lsquoThe Poorrsquos Moneyrsquo. The scheme operated late in the reign of William III and was continued into the time of Queen Anne, George I and George II.Nowadays benefit claimants unable to work through illness or injury, are paid Employment Support Allowance, .In  a similar scheme was obviously operating in Ballynahinch. The church carpenter at that time was John Gough, and that year he suffered a signicant injury, perhaps a broken arm or leg. He was unable to work or to earn a living for over a year.John had been married six years earlier in , in his home congregation by Rev James McAlpine. His we was Elizabeth, neacutee Ferguson. Their children soon followed mdash Christine, who was five in  Rebecca, who was four, and their twin boys, George and James, who were just one year and one month.With four young children and no income, John and Elizabeth were soon struggling financially. But in April the church stepped in immediately, with payments for an initial three-month period, at six shillings per instalment. In August John tried to resume work, but couldnrsquot. The church continued payments, but now at a reduced rate of d. Another attempt at work in October  failed again, and again payments resumed.John eventually recovered and ed to work permanently in August , having received a total of  support payments from First Presbyterian. He resumed his valuable role in maintenance of the fabric, receiving church contracts in ,  and .The problem of unwed mothers and absent fathers is one that troubles every age and every generation. Back in the early s, the Ballynahinch Session took a stern approach to fire-and-forget fatherhood.Their starting point was an interview with the expectant mother to ascertain the identity of her co-responsible male partner. If she proved uncompliant, exclusion from church attendance was then threatened. Faced with resultant near-total social ostracism, the mother-to-be soon cooperated.The next stage involved the errant couple appearing some Sunday morning before the entire congregation, kneeling on the Stool of Repentance and confessing their extramarital transgression. After that they were received back into the congregation. Their child was baptised and recognised as a church member.In a -year period the Ballynahinch Session dealt with  such cases. In six, they identied both parents. In six other cases only the mother was identied in seven, only the father. In one case the origins and surname of a lsquofoundlingrsquo child were known, but neither parent actually came forward.By st century standards, these church procedures sound draconian. But they had the purpose of protecting the rights of the child and of offering an opportunity to the parents for their reputations to be salvaged,possible.The alternatives were a lot worse. It was common in the s for the sexton at Magheradroll Parish Church to discover live newborns abandoned overnight on his church doorstep, ordead through neglect or infanticide, to find their bodies surreptitiously concealed in adjacent graves.In Ireland such surviving infants were sent in large numbers to the Foundling Hospital in Dublin, which who received between ,-, orphans annually. The hospitalrsquos mortality rate was some %.In Ballynahinch, under Presbyterian auspices, some such infants were spared this grisly fate. The lives of a number of potential orphans were actively protected by the church in their home town.Under the Welfare Reform Act of , Disabled Living Allowance was controversially replaced with Personal Independence Payment. DLA payments were made to claimants who often had long term medical conditions. The amount of the award ied according to the degree of disability.Interestingly, in Ballynahinch in the early s, First Presbyterian made a number of long-term DLA-type awards to some lsquosupplicantsrsquo.Ms Grissel Foreman was on such a benefit from -. Some financial records of the Poorrsquos Money still exist. But all its other documentation is lost, so we donrsquot know what Grisselrsquos ailment actually was. It was obviously slow and progressive, perhaps something like tuberculosis, or multiple sclerosis, or Parkinsonrsquos.As her condition deteriorated, the church increased its amount of financial support. In  she received seven payments totalling s d. By  this had escalated to  payments totalling pound s d.She died in  and was buried at church expense. Over  years, amounts paid to her totalled pound s d. This was an enormous sum, considering the church ministerrsquos annual stipend at the time was pound.These and many other such stories will be outlined on Monday night at Down Museum.

We all have a duty to work together to secure it. I believe we need new hotels and there is a need for such a facility in the Downpatrick area and hope see progress on this issue in the near future.Cllr Curran is particularly keen to see the proposed commercial development at the site of the former Irish Street police station in Downpatrick and a number of adjacent derelict buildings progressed this year.ldquoThis exciting proposal has the potential to restore Downpatrickrsquos economic heart, create jobs and, most importantly, provide a boost for existing businesses via increased footfall, he said.Cllr Curran also warned that while attracting new investment is crucial, cracking Downpatrickrsquos traffic congestion problem is also essential.ldquoGridlock continues to stle town centre investment and we need to act quickly. While expensive schemes have been proposed in the past, nothing has happened. We must see progress in  and ensure roads officials deliver.ldquoWork was completed recently on a major upgrade of the Collinsrsquo Corner junction and while welcome, I and others remain to be convinced that it will address congestion problems in the heart of the town.Cllr Curran said roads officials also deserve praise for the improvement scheme in Fountain Street and hopes that in  efforts will be made by the Department for Infrastructure to improve Edward Street.He added: ldquoThis is a real problem area which has not been addressed. The presence of a busy primary school should ensure that roads officials redouble their efforts to improve driver and pedestrian safety. In addition, urgent action is needed to ban large vehicles, especially lorries, from this built-up area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th January 2020 Looking.jpg","title":"Looking back at end of steam railways  ","story":"SEVENTY years ago today, the first part of Northern Irelandrsquos railway network literally came to the end of the line, with the axe falling on a large part of the old Belfast and County Down Railway, marking the end of  years of railway transport in East Down.On January , , railway stations south of Comber fell quiet and an eerie silence descended upon mile after mile of what had once been a key transport corridor.No longer would the rumble of trains and passenger-filled carriages pass through on their way to Castlewellan or Newcastle, stopping at Ballygowan, Saintfield, Ballynahinch junction, Crossgar, or Dundrum on the way, or perhaps branching off after Downpatrick for Ardglass.Later, on April , , services from Belfast to Comber - with stops at Bloomfield, Neillrsquos Hill, Knock, Dundonald and on to Donaghadee also ceased.Robert Gardiner, chairman of the Downpatrick and County Down Railway, a heritage railway set up on the former Downpatrick BCDR terminus, states that had the line survived to today, it would form a vital transport link between the commuter belt into the Northern Irish capital.ldquoIt seems incredible today to think that such a vital transport link could be easily discarded, he says. ldquoBut in  the ministers in the devolved Stormont Government took the view that railways were as obsolete as the stagecoach.ldquoIn a way, they were right that the lines were Edwardian relics mdash and the BCDR in particular still operated obsolete Victorian carriages mdash but investment since then in new technologies in track, signalling and rolling stock have shown what we could have had throughout Northern Ireland.ldquoBut even then, in  an express train from Comber to Belfast could get you into the old Queenrsquos Quay station near the Odyssey area in  minutes ndash despite the investment in the Glider and other public transport initiatives nothing has come close to replicating that speed and efficiency.Up to the s, the main railway network in Northern Ireland was operated by three major railway companies mdash the London Midland and Scottish Railwayrsquos Northern Counties lines, which operated out of York Road Station to Larne and Londonderry the Great Northern Railway of Ireland, which operated out of Great Victoria Street Station to places like Dungannon, Armagh, as well as Dublin and the Belfast and County Down Railway, based at Queenrsquos Quay Station.In , the Stormont government decided to nationalise the network and amalgamate the LMS and BCDR with the bus operator, the Northern Ireland Road Transport Board, to form the Ulster Transport Authority, a predecessor to Translink.Mr Gardiner explains, ldquoA tribunal was set up to consider how this could be best achieved and provide an integrated transport system. Rail chiefs, who had been hoping for investment after the railways had proved so crucial to the war effort a few years earlier and that the buses would be barred from competing with the trains and instead provide a feeder service to stations, were devastated at the outcome.ldquoThe recommendation, accepted by Stormont, was that the entire Belfast and County Down Railway main line from Belfast to Newcastle, including the branches to Donaghadee, Ballynahinch and Ardglass, should be closed.The only route to be saved was the Belfast to Bangor connection, which continues operating successfully to this day.Mr Gardiner continued: ldquoThe attitude of Stormont was that it would be cheaper to move everything to the roads than to invest in railways that had been run down during the Second World War. People would use the buses instead. They developed huge road building schemes mdash most were never completed mdash but closed the railways first before these were even started. It seems incredible today.ldquoThe most puzzling element of the decision was the axing of the Belfast to Newtownards line, which served the east of the city mdash Dundonald, Knock and Comber areas in which the suburbs were developing and likely to provide increased commuter traffic had they been spared.ldquoIndeed, there were more than enough new diesel trains ordered to operate both the Bangor and Newtownards lines mdash and evidence suggests that the Transport Tribunal expected Stormont to spare the Comber line as a compromise option and as late as , before the tracks were lted, they were calling on the minister responsible to reverse the decision and trial these new diesel trains on this section of track mdash a call that fell on deaf ears.The  closures were the first steps in a plan which was to see the reduction of the Northern Irelandrsquos railway network from  miles to  miles mdash a decrease of  per cent.A decade later, the Great Northern Railway was ided between the UTA and its counterpart in the Republic, CIE, and further closures to lines to Armagh, Dungannon, Omagh and Strabane occurred.Willie Watterson and James Magill, who were porters and ticket clerks at Newcastle and Tullymurry stations, recalled their memories of the last train in an interview recorded for the BBC documentary lsquoRaising Steamrsquo in ldquoThe last train was a Sunday night. It was a cold winter night, January , , said Willie. There was twelve coaches, and two engines and two guards. She was packed. Packed to the doors. So I lit all the lamps, and put detonators on the line to give her a send-off.James added: ldquoI think every station did the same thing, so when the train came in there was a salute of bangs. I felt terrible about it, terribly terribly sad. I still felt it couldnrsquot happen. Still felt theyrsquoll come back, theyrsquoll run again. I couldnrsquot believe therersquod be no more railways, after working on them so hard.Adam Hamilton, who was a fireman mdash the person who stoked the fire on the steam locomotives mdash said: ldquoIt broke my heart, because the railways were in my blood. I still hear the sound of the steam still running on a clear night puffing away.Today, the Downpatrick and County Down Railway keeps the memory alive through its reconstruction of two miles of the former main line, as well as restored carriages rescued from their fate as hen houses.As part of its commemorations of the BCDRrsquos demise, it is keen to make contact with anyone who had any connection with the network, including former employees or their families, or people in possession of railway memorabilia such as photographs, tickets, timetables or even carriages.Mr Gardiner added: ldquoOne thing we would love for the museum is a BCDR unorm or tunic. So far we have been unable to track one down. Perhaps you have something in your loft And what of the future of the line  In November  the section of the BCDRrsquos former main line from Holywood Arches to Comber was opened as the Comber Greenway, whilst other sections have been used for roads as well as the section around Downpatrick being used by the DCDR.In the early s Northern Ireland Railways prepared a feasibility study into reopening the line to Newtownards, but this was not taken further by the Direct Rule administration.In May , the Department for Regional Development published its Railway Investment Prioritisation Strategy, which promised feasibility studies into the reopening of closed railway routes to Armagh, Dungannon and Castledawson by , but not including the Comber Newtownards route.However, maybe  years after the first railway closure in Northern Ireland, the new Minister for Infrastructure in the restored Stormont Government might see the first of those historic mistakes rectied.The Downpatrick Railway Museum can be contacted via email at info@downrail or message at www.facebook downrail..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th January 2020 Mickey.jpg","title":"Mickey ‘magic’ to help Magpies lift cup  ","story":"KILCOOrsquoS tearaways may hold the key to success in Sundayrsquos All-Ireland Club SFC final at Croke Park.The ability of their six forwards to win dirty ball and turnovers could dismantle the perceived invincibility of Corofinrsquos much-vaunted defensive system.Corofin, described in many quarters as the best club team ever, have an enviable set of defenders who squeeze the le out of the opposition.However, they have never encountered a team like Kilcoo before that has  attackers and  defenders.Conor Laverty, the three Johnston brothers mdash Ryan, Jerome and Shealan mdash Paul Devlin and Ryan McEvoy fight tooth and nail for every ball.They are the clubrsquos first line of defence and are not afraid to go where angels fear to tread, but can then turn into a snatch squad with the blink of an eye.Kilcoo will have to be at their bestthey are to cause an upset as the Galway and Connacht champions are sizzling hot favourites at   to win the Andy Merrigan Cup for an unprecedented third year in a row and the fourth time in six years.Certainly, Kilcoo have it all to do, but they fear no side.Manager Mickey Moran has twice taken Slaughtneil to All-Ireland finals day and few would begrudge the Derry man a first title with Kilcoo.He has transformed the Magpies into a ruthless, disciplined machine in a quiet, unobtrusive way and has won many admirers for his style of play.He started out in management in  when he took over the reins at Derry, the first of three separate spells in charge of the county team.

Maybe its just a bit of magic dust, but itrsquos definitely a unique ability to get players to play for him.ldquoIt doesnrsquot matter what age you are. If you are good enough, he will give you a chance, he added.ldquoDonrsquot forget we won the Ulster League last season with five or six minors starting regularly every week.ldquoThat injection of youth sure helped the lads get a great start to the season and everything fell into place after that, he continued.Gilligan also believes that Moranrsquos love for the game and the way it should be played has rubbed off on the players.ldquoMickey is extremely keen on discipline. He insists the players play the game and let the referee do his thing without being shouted at.ldquoHe doesnrsquot rant or rave from the sidelines and expects that same response from the players and gets it, he added.Dedication and team structure are what he has instilled at Eoghan Rua Parc and a love for the game along with a winning environment.Kilcoo have been the benchmark in Down football for the past decade, but Moran has taken them a stage further in just  months.Corofin may be blessed with several players who have turned out regularly for Galway and in Kieran Fitzgerald, Liam Silke, Kieran McGrath, Gary Sice and Ian and Daithi Burke they have the nucleus of a talented outfit.However, Kilcoo believe they bigger they are, the harder they fall..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th January 2020 Minister.jpg","title":"Minister vows to end strikes with pay deal  ","story":"HEALTH staff across the district were yesterday digesting the news that new Stormont Health Minister Robin Swann had confirmed that pay parity with their colleagues in England can now be restored.He told the Assembly that it would cost an extra poundm that would come from within existing Stormont finances.Mr Swann met with representatives from a number of leading health trade unions to brief them on the decision, describing the talks as ldquoconstructive.The new man in charge of the Provincersquos health portfolio said the ldquobreakthrough that we all wanted has been achieved this isa good day after some very dficult days.Mr Swann announced that the Department of Health had already gathered together poundm to increase pay for health workers, with an extra poundm being pulled from existing finances at Stormont.His decision to address the pay issue came after a series of strikes involving staff across the health and social services sector over pay and staffing levels.Nurses and other health workers in Northern Ireland have been taking industrial action over pay and staffing levels, with Mr Swann confirming that his officials would work with the unions on the issue of safe staffing levels in the health service and hopes a plan can be drawn up to establish such levels ldquowithin a reasonable period of time.Today, representatives from trade unions representing nurses and all health and social services staff will meet with Department of Health officials, with Mr Swann hoping for a ldquoswt end to their industrial action.He added: ldquoOur nurses and great social care workers can come off the picket-line.Prior to yesterdayrsquos announcement, local nurses said that they hoped that theof Stormont would pave the way for the pay parity and staffing issues to be finally addressed.Ahead of yesterdayrsquos meeting, the RCN said while welcoming the restoration of the Stormont administration, nurses had been made many promises.The RCNrsquos Northern Ireland Director, Pat Cullen, said nurses wanted to see those promises converted into action.Last Wednesday and Friday, nurses based at the Downpatrick hospitals took part in the latest round of stoppages and were buoyed by the support of passing motorists and others as they manned the picket-line at the entrance to the Downshire Civic Centre.Braving bitterly cold conditions last Friday morning, nurses were hoping for positive news from Stormont, hours after Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney had published the New Decade New Approach document.Nurses, who had sacriced another dayrsquos pay, were joined at one stage on the picket-line by South Eastern Trust interim chief executive Seamus McGoran and Roisin Coulter, the organisationrsquos director of planning.Nurses said that they hoped that the political parties would go back into government and that their demands for pay parity and safe staffing levels would be met.ldquoWe believe that the collective pressure of health service staff has ensured that politicians know that they must get back to Stormont, said nurse Irene Murray.ldquoWe do not want to be used as political pawns and hope that there is cross-party agreement for politicians to get back to work. While pay parity and safe services are key issues for us, the key thing is that there are enough recurrent resources in place to deliver this now and in the future.Irene said the RCN is about putting patients first, describing the scale of the hospital waiting list issue as ldquounacceptable.She added: ldquoEmploying more nurses can help bring waiting lists down. This is not a new phenomena. It is tough to work as a nurse and it is not an easy job. But we currently have a situation where some nurses are taking on extra shts to earn more money, but that is just an unacceptable way to live.Alison Megarry said patients are nursesrsquo primary concern and at the heart of what they do, highlighting the need to keep staff working in Northern Ireland to ensure they donrsquot go across the water and donrsquot come back.She revealed that she was talking to a nursing sister last week who was working on international recruitment for nurses in Mumbai to work in Northern Ireland.ldquoThe nurses in India said why would they come here when the pay is less than it is in England, Scotland and Wales. I believe thatwe can keep our nurses here, it will help to tackle the waiting list issue, she said. ldquoThe big issue we have is that the population is ageing and people are living longer which therefore impacts on waiting lists.Nurse Sonia McCoubrey said that while pay parity is one issue, additional nurses are also required. She said many newly qualied nurses are choosing to go to England, Scotland or Wales because the money is better.She also said she worries about the safety of newly qualied nurses managing dficult situations and the patients they are caring for.ldquoYou have trolley waits and people lying in corridors. There is no privacy, no dignity and the situation is appalling. You go home at night after a sht burnt out and worried about what you have seen, the nurse added.Nurse Donna Boyd also expressed concern about waiting lists and said she fears that the situation is going to get worse, forcing many people to go private.ldquoIf more money is put into the system nurses are quite happy to do even more to help reduce waiting lists. All nurses go and above what is required of them when they are working, often staying after their scheduled quitting time which is unpaid work, she said.ldquoWith more people going private because of y waiting lists, a lot of the doctors and consultants are taking on private lists which then impacts on the NHS list. I have friends who were nurses who have left the profession to work in supermarkets because they have burnt themselves out. They canrsquot cope with the demands being made on them, she added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th January 2020 Now.jpg","title":"Now is the time for delivery – McGrath  ","story":"THE restoration of the Assembly and Northern Ireland Executive should herald delivery for people at the start of a new decade, according to South Down SDLP MLA Colin McGrath.Mr McGrath was able to take his seat in the Assembly chamber for the first time in three years last Saturday, an occasion which he described as a ldquomomentous day for Northern Ireland and its future.He said that with so many issues staring people in the face including Brexit, y hospital waiting times, workersrsquo rights and wages, welfare issues and an education system in crisis, Northern Ireland needed a restored and fully ing Assembly and Executive to deal with these mammoth issues.The Assemblyman described his partyrsquos decision to re-enter the Executive as an act of ldquotrust and goodwill.He continued: ldquoWe all know the reasons why the last Executive failed and these have been well covered.

Across the resort,  street lights are not working.The figures are available on the NI Direct website under the reporting fault problems menu with other districthot-spots including Ballynahinch where  street lights are currently out of order.Elsewhere,  faults have been reported in Killyleagh, with  brought to the government departmentrsquos attention in Castlewellan and Crossgar. In Saintfield,  faults have been reported.In Ballygowan,  street lights are currently out of order with  and  faults reported in Ardglass and Killough respectively.Sixteen street lights are out of order in Dundrum with  faults reported in Drumaness. The figures for the Spa and Clough are  and nine respectively.Last month, the Department for Infrastructure confirmed that its current budget for street lighting repairs was approximately poundm, explaining that the figure was much lower than the pound.m needed to provide a full street lighting repair service.It also revealed that repairs are now generally limited to those that can be carried out by the departmentrsquos internal street lighting workforce which only consists of five full and three part time electricians.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran described the number of reported street light faults across large parts of East Down as ldquoalarming and hopes that the money to expedite much-needed repairs will be earmarked by the new Stormont Executive.He said broken street lights in many areas represent a health and safety issue, explaining that an examination of every town and village across the district will reveal a signicant number of faults.Cllr Curran described faulty street lights as a ldquohot topic with politicians being contacted about the issue on all almost daily basis. He said the legacy of underfunding the roads department has experienced is now clear for all to see.The politician said many will be concerned that the Department for Infrastructure does not have the money it requires to carry out much-needed repairs.ldquoWhile I understand the decision to prioritise emergency repairs, there is no doubt that the alarming figure of almost  faulty street lights across East Down is simply going to increase. Clearly the issue is going to get a lot worse before it gets better, he said.ldquoStreet lights which are not working in areas where elderly people and indeed young families live poses a major problem. A fully working street lighting system provides residents with a sense of security and helps deter would-be criminals.Cllr Curran said that while the new Stormont Executive will inevitably face calls for investment in many key areas including health and education, the Department of Infrastructure also required an injection of funding.He added: ldquoWhile the focus for some will be on major new roads schemes which is understandable, it is clear that the creaking infrastructure the government department is responsible for, including street lighting, requires major cash injection.ldquoThe street lighting issues requires immediate attention.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is events like this in the very heart of Penarth which demonstrate how lucky we are to have such a ying and vibrant collection of businesses, which are so accessible.It was great to witness how the streets opened up to more traditional businesses of selling hand-crafted Christmas gts and roasted chestnuts, adding to the selection of businesses we already have on offer.Many of you will be aware of Small Business Saturday, which this year falls on December . The campaign aims to encourage people to ldquoshop local and to support small businesses in their communities.For me, one of the highlights of living in Penarth is access to a vibrant High Street. The street, and town as a whole, provides such a iety there really isnrsquot any need to go anywhere .I regularly make use of shops on the High Street, particularly the greengrocers and butchers, while my we, Michelle, makes use of others. Shopping locally you are almost always guaranteed to receive a first-class service with a smile, and it is that welcome, as well as the quality of the product or service, that keeps customers coming back ndash these are the reasons I always make thattrip.Thatrsquos why Irsquove got behind our local shops for this yearrsquos Small Business Saturday. In the run up to Small Business Saturday I have been visiting businesses across the constituency to talk to local business owners about them, their staff, what they enjoy about running their own business and the challenges that they face.On Friday December  I will be visiting businesses across Penarth. If you would like me to visit your business then please get in touch with my office on    or by emailing vaughan.gething@assembly.wales.Irsquod like to take this opportunity to thank the town council, as well as all its partners in organising the lights switch-on this year.

While policy decisions have yet to be made, heat pumps are the indicated preference.ldquoOver % of oil heated homes in Great Britain fall into EPC bands D to G ndash meaning they are poorly insulated and so unsuited for heat pumps without costly insulation work.ldquoFinancial support to help the poorest families switch heating systems would most likely be made available but many households will be expected to fund the work themselves.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Diverging substantiallywill bring in the requirement for inspections at the border for customs. “That hasn’t been agreed formally. That is quite a lot for UK and NI operators to deal with – haulage and freight movers, to get to grips with that. There are major operational challenges.“Northern Ireland also leave the customs union with GB, but there will be a customs border will between GB and NI to continue to essentially allow freight and good to travel.”Since Boris Johnson’s deal was floated, it’s understood the shipping industry is now drawing up plans for EU border checks in Britain for trade bound for Northern Ireland.According to the BBC, freight could be erted through ports with space for inspections at areas such as Liverpool and Stranraer.Richard says checks are likely to be carried out at the ports. The issue  He says backlogs, queues and congestion. “ to queueing back on to ferries and ships, which may miss or mess up timetables,” he says. He says while “many wouldn’t welcome new formalities”, a lot of cargo – such as dry bulk, fuel, aggregates and containerised products –  will find it reasonably easy to deal with. The main concern is around ‘roll on, roll off’, where the containers or lorries are driven on board a ship.“Those modes are where it could be the most problematic, as it’s based on a fluid process,” he says.“I think there is a definite concern from ports and shipping industries that businesses may be impacted negatively, and may reassess business operations.“I wouldn’t say it’s a doomsday scenario but it’s a real challenge for the sector to overcome. Politicians will have to make sure that with any kind of arrangements, there will be a good solution. This is a new proposal, so we are unsure what the details will be.”Brexit aside, Richard says the industry as a whole is that while the largely commercial and independent ports aren’t in need of ‘hand outs’ from the public sector, areas such as connectivity, roads and planning are key to their success.“It’s about making sure the planning system works, and is swt, and responsive,” he said. “They can be agile, for example, building a new shed, terminal or quay, or new developments in the water.“Where there are environmental sensitivities it can sometimes slow down the planning regimes so we are keen to see them not slow down. We welcome environmental policies but we want a scheme that will work and doesn’t have unintended consequences.“Shipping, although not perfect, is one of the most clean and efficient methods of transport. It’s a balance between environmental protection, but enabling ports and regions to grow.“If there are schemes, ports can find there are investors willing to come in, but they do rely on government – local or national – to finance road and rail connectivity.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/year1.jpg","title":"yearbook a look back at ","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business It was another year shaped by political turmoil and the loss of some giants of industry, but it was also a period which saw great opportunity and growth.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/234234343334.jpg","title":"stormont deal business back new assembly","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith and Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Pic Kelvin Boyes Northern Ireland’s business community has given its support for a deal which has seen the Assembly up-and-running after a three year stasis. The Northern Ireland Assembly couldon Fridaypolitical parties back a deal tabled by the UK and Irish Governments. DUP leader Arlene Foster has indicated that her party will back the deal, while Sinn Fein said its leadership will meet to discuss it on Friday. The UUP has said they will consider the deal, but are willing to attend the Assemblyit sits. In a joint statement urging politicians to accept the ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal, NI Chamber president John Healy, vice president Ian Henry, and chief executive Ann McGregor, said: “After three years of paralysis, we now have a workable deal that will allow an Executive to start addressing the problems within our health service and education system. They will also be able to take action to grow our economy and support the community and voluntary sector. “We therefore encourage the five main political parties to progress it urgently. Business, health and education cannot wait any longer - failure is not an option. “Now is the time for our politicians to show mature leadership and help navigate a path to the future by accepting this deal.” Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney published the New Decade, New Approach deal on Thursday evening and urged parties to back it andto Stormont on Friday. Reacting to the news, Trade NI – the alliance of Retail NI, Manufacturing NI and Hospitality Ulster – said: “We welcome the draft deal published by the British and Irish Governments in the final round of talks to restore devolution. We strongly encourage all the main parties of Northern Ireland to sign the deal today and get the Assembly back up and running.” “As our three organisations represent the majority of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland, we are cautiously hopeful that the deal and aof the Assembly will see the development of policies and legislation at devolved level and the kick start that our economy desperately needs. The clear prioritisation of the Northern Ireland economy highlights the many challenges that businesses have faced over the past three years and our message to the parties is that we support you in your endeavours to secure this deal.” “While this is a good start, improvements are still needed to drive the economy forward and support the growth of business across Northern Ireland. As stated in our Vision  document, Northern Ireland’s potential is signicant but reform and growth is needed to create the modern economy we are capable of and deserve.” FSB NI policy chair, Tina McKenzie, said: “Businesses will welcome the agreement published last night as a step forward towards restoring devolved government, something for which FSB has been calling since the collapse of the institutions three years ago. “The draft agreement contains some positive commitments to bolster the local economy, on issues like skills, infrastructure and Brexit. However, theof devolution is by no means a panacea it just means that at long last we have elected representatives in place to tackle a very dficult task. “The next Executive must move quickly to deliver on the myriad issues which have been left unaddressed for far too long. While the health service will be high on the agenda, we must not lose sight of the need to bolster our SME economy, which is the absolute bedrock on which the first-class public services to which we all aspire are built. “Ministers must move swtly to support our economy at one of the most turbulent times for many decades, starting by lowering the rates burden on small businesses, whilst also moving forward rapidly with key infrastructure projects which have stalled and ensuring that our schools, colleges, and universities are providing students with the skills they need for the jobs of the future. “In order to begin to address these issues, the parties must put pragmatism first and get back round the Executive table.” Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster, said: “We encourage all parties to seize this opportunity and sign up to the deal published late last night to get the Assembly and Executive back as quickly as possible.” “This is the best chance to bring the devolved government back to le. Our message to the party leaders is clear, we support you in your endeavours and encourage you to get the New Decade, New Approach agreement over the line today. Redmond McFadden, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce said: “The Londonderry Chamber as well as other representatives of business, education, health, trade unions and civic organisations, held a meeting with the five main political parties at Stormont last night. “At that meeting we pressed the urgent need for the parties to agree the draft deal which was published by the British and Irish Governments. Three years without Ministers making local decisions has had an enormous impact on our economy and wider society. A lack of effective and meaningful representation here is curtailing investment in our region, stling job creation and driving our young people away. Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, said: “Belfast Chamber welcomes progress towards the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and encourages the local political parties to reach agreement. For the last three years, our members have seen how an absence of decision making has stunted growth and stled investment. The proposed priorities for the Executive contain some issues which Belfast Chamber has been supportive of for some time. “Other policies which could boost our economy are noticeably missing but we look forward to joining with our colleagues across the business community to ensure that the new Executive pursues an agenda that grows jobs and boosts our economy.” Northern Ireland Local Government Association chief executive, Derek McCallan said: “I am very pleased that the British and Irish governments have tabled a draft deal on restoring the NI Executive. I hope that an agreement can be reached quickly to get the Stormont institutions back up and running immediately. For three years, our eleven local councils have been the only ing form of democratically elected government in Northern Ireland. Local government has been a vital democratic anchor during this period and ensured the provision of crucial public services for local citizens. “It’s time to bridge the democratic deficit and unlock the potential of local government in Northern Ireland by investing in our local councils. An Executive commitment to a devolution bill and greater financial powers and resources will drive a transformation in Northern Ireland’s democratic governance and help create a more sustainable democracy, environment and economy for Northern Ireland.” Kirsty McManus, national director, IoD NI, said: “The ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal is to be welcomed, filled with ambition that,fulfilled, can deliver real improvements for the people and businesses of Northern Ireland. “We would therefore urge all parties to get behind the deal to enable the speedy restoration of the Executive. “Commitments from the British and Irish governments for some crucial pieces of infrastructure such as the York Street Interchange, upgrades to the A and A road and Northern Ireland’s wastewater network are particularly pleasing. “The expansion of university provision at the Magee campus in Derry meanwhile will go some way to rebalancing the regional economy. “Plans for multi-year budgets and increased civic engagement will also improve overall governance. “From a business perspective however, we would have liked to have seen more around a new skills agenda, which urgently require focus alongside a renewed look at the Apprenticeship Levy which is not included in this deal. “On behalf of our members, we will also monitor closely commitments to bring forward legislation that will allow unfettered access to the Great Britain market for local business following Brexit.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_Abacus-Grand-Central-1--1-.jpg","title":"belfastforlife expo bringing together ni diaspora","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by Ulster Business A new event will bring together the Northern Ireland diaspora and business community in a bid to promote and develop the region.
