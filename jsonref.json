But it’s a sad reality of being a priest in London that I have to be ready with the last rites at all times.’Mr Lee, who appeared on last week’s Question Time to condemn the failure of politicians to get to grips with the knife-crime crisis, said he believes putting a stop to low-level crime would be a good start.‘I look around London and I see Sadiq Khan – who seems to be more focused on what Donald Trump is saying – and a lot of other politicians squabbling over Brexit, and it’s not surprising knife crime is as bad as it is,’ he said.‘I’m a firm believer that we need to take a stronger stance on low-level crime. If we can stop the littering and the loitering, people will start to be proud of themselves and of the area they live in.‘That kind of attitude will help curb violent crime in this country.’         Mr Lee, who took over the tough inner-city parish in August last year, said that his parents had been uneasy about his move to Tottenham with his wife and two young children because of London’s knife crime epidemicMr Lee, who is also a county commissioner for Greater London North East Scouts, revealed that he once met the murdered schoolgirl Jodie Chesney.The 17-year-old Explorer Scout was stabbed to death in an East London park in March. ‘I wouldn’t want to overstate my relationship with Jodie but I did meet her and she was, by all accounts, an extraordinary young woman with everything ahead of her,’ he said.‘Scouting is the kind of pursuit that gives skills for life. I’ve met so many incredible people who are involved with the Scouts and it’s horrifying to think a Scout could be caught up in knife crime in such a tragic way.’The vicar, who grew up in Ilford, East London, left school at 16 with only four GCSEs and few prospects, but said he pulled himself up by his bootstraps and believes the same mentality could help young people today.‘My teenage years were very wayward, to say the least,’ he added. ‘I always joke that I left school with hardly anything to show for myself but ended up studying at Oxford, which is where I did my priest training. If I can turn things around then anyone can.’Of the dangers he and his family face in Tottenham, Mr Lee said: ‘My wife thinks I can be cavalier because of what this area is like, but I have a job to do and I feel I need to get out and talk to people.‘It’s no good pointing the finger at others if I’m not willing to do everything I can to turn knife crime around.’"},{"url":null,"title":"After 4 000 years scientists set unlock secrets Bronze Age dagger covered gold shards","story":"Share this article Experts believe only children aged no more than ten would have been capable of such delicate handicraft.

Sue will then downsize to a house she can afford outright.         Lauren Marshall, pictured with her father Jim, 75, built a two-bedroom annex on the grounds of her Hampshire home. Lauren\u0027s husband Malcolm, 35, left, who runs a building company, said the new home was a thank you to Jim for everything he has done for his daughterIronically, this gesture has prevented Rachael from buying her own home. Since taking over the mortgage, her wages have increased substantially which could have enabled her and fiance Jamie, a 37-year-old bespoke furniture-maker, to get on the property ladder.But as a co-owner of a house, any ‘second’ home she buys will be liable for nine per cent stamp duty.‘It’s pricing us out of the market,’ Rachael admits. ‘It’s a frustrating situation, but Mum is such a kind person who has always helped Cathy and me that it feels really good to have done this for her.‘We can’t put a price on seeing Mum look so much more relaxed and happy, with time to spend doing things she enjoys such as swimming, reading and catching up with her friends.‘She’s been on her own since we were in our early teens and has never missed a key moment in our lives, including school plays, sports days and university graduations.‘When I was at university, she used to give me £150 a month spending money and doesn’t let Cathy contribute much towards household bills. It’s time for us to take care of her.’For Rachael and Cathy that means continuing to pay off student loans and not being able to save as much as they would like, while being frugal about clothes and socialising.But by doing so, they’ve turned their mother’s life around.‘They got me out of a bit of a hole and I’m really grateful to them,’ says Sue, now 61. ‘Being able to semi-retire has given me the time to do more of the things I love, plus I’m not so tired any more.‘They really wanted to do this for me – I can’t explain what a difference it’s made to my life.’         Akshay Tandon, 31, pictured with his wife Alpna, centre gave his parents Arun, left, and Shikha, right a three-bedroom apartment he had bought initially as an investment property in India, so they could have a perfect holiday homeRachael and Cathy aren’t the only ones making this kind of sacrifice. But why has there been such a change in the financial dynamic of families?Liz Palmer, head of private wealth at Howard Kennedy, a London-based law firm, believes several factors could be at play.‘Over the past 20 years, we’ve seen more people obtain university degrees which might mean millennials’ earning power is greater, making them more able to help out financially,’ she says.‘There’s also the notion that millennials have a freer attitude to disposable income.‘At their age, their parents would have been saving for the future, but millennials don’t seem to do so in the same way, which makes them more predisposed to helping out.’The fact that we’re living much longer could also be a factor.Ms Palmer adds: ‘People are waiting longer to inherit and, as grandparents are spending more of their money because they’re living so long, there’s less to hand down, so parents might be feeling the pinch.‘Not to mention the fact that many more young people are still living in the family home until their 30s and feel the need to contribute more.’For Lauren Marshall, she simply wanted to give back to her beloved father. Two months ago, 75-year-old Jim moved into a two-bedroom annexe specially built for him in the grounds of his 32-year-old daughter’s Hampshire home.It was constructed by Lauren’s husband Malcolm, 35, who runs a roofing and building company, as a thank you to Jim for everything he has done for his daughter.‘Dad had been in the pub trade for 20 years but with failing health it was unthinkable to let him continue as a publican any longer,’ says Lauren, a full-time mother to Cody, six.‘He was so stressed and has had heart problems and operations on his back. When he came to a barbecue at our house last summer, we could see how stressed he was and told him enough was enough.‘Malcolm kindly offered to convert a garage and outbuilding at the side of our house into a two-storey home for Dad.‘It really was as instantaneous a decision as it sounds because we’d seen how increasingly stressed and unwell Dad was becoming, and had talked about doing something with our outbuilding.’Four days later, Malcolm started ripping out the garage of their four-bedroom detached home to start the project. They won’t reveal the exact cost – suffice to say it was substantial – but it was worth every penny.‘The moment Dad moved into the annexe in April, his stress visibly ebbed away – it’s like having my old, chirpy dad back,’ says Lauren.‘I pop over every morning for a cup of tea and a chat, and Malcolm has even built a firepit in the garden where the two of them like to sit and have a beer in an evening.‘Dad keeps saying that he can’t thank us enough and offers us money but we won’t hear of it. He’s a terrific cook so we’re happy for him to make us one of his incredible curries now and again instead.‘It’s a lovely feeling to have done this for him. I had an amazing childhood and as far as I’m concerned he looked after my siblings and me when we were young so it’s only right that we look after him now.’Meanwhile, Jim, who’s orced, admits he’s still pinching himself.‘I was too old and immobile to be in the pub trade any longer, but I was so worried about money and how I was going to live when I retired,’ he says.‘I’d used all my money to try to keep the pub going. Then I was at Lauren’s last summer and she told me, “Malcolm’s going to convert the garage into a home for you!” I burst into tears on their driveway. What Malcolm has done is absolutely amazing – there aren’t many people who’d want one of their in-laws living next door.‘I can’t give him enough credit. All my stress vanished the day I moved in here two months ago. Lauren even put a big bow on my front door. It’s wonderful.’ Other parents who are eternally grateful to their generous children include Arun and Shikha Tandon.When 65-year-old Arun retired from his job as a council director in 2014, he and Shikha celebrated with a £1,400 holiday in Kerala, southern India – paid for by their only son, 30-year-old retail manager Akshay.As well as paying for his parents to travel to India and the Scottish Highlands last year, Akshay gave the couple £2,000 to pay off a loan to stop them dipping into their savings.But perhaps the biggest gift of all was a holiday home in the beautiful Indian province of Rajasthan.‘It’s a three-bedroom apartment I bought as an investment for £60,000 in 2014 having saved really hard,’ says Akshay, who lives in a rented house in Aberdeen with his wife Alpna, 29, an account manager.‘But I can’t use it very often because I’m working and have a busy life.‘In 2016, I decided that I’d give it to my parents as a gift because I knew how much enjoyment they’d get from it now they’re retired.‘People might question why I didn’t just tell my parents that they could use it, but buying them a holiday home was something I’d wanted to do since I was young, watching how selflessly they sacrificed their needs to provide me with everything I wanted.‘They worked and saved hard all their lives to give me a good upbringing and covered my living costs when I did my degree and then an MBA at university.‘They also helped me to pay off my student loan when I got my first job after graduating. I love them dearly and it feels good to be able to treat them and make their lives a little easier.’Their son’s generosity has made his parents extremely proud.‘It gives us joy and satisfaction when we see a reflection of our values in him,’ Arun says.‘We are also thankful for the support – financial and otherwise – that we get from Akshay, who is our pillar at this stage of our lives.’And their son doesn’t begrudge a penny of it. ‘When I paid for Mum and Dad to go to Kerala, they hadn’t had a holiday in more than two years,’ he says.‘Spending all that money on them meant that I couldn’t afford to go away myself, but sometimes seeing your parents happy is even better than being happy yourself.’Who’d ever have thought they’d hear a millennial say those words? "},{"url":null,"title":"Pioneering six minute cornea transplant surgery spell end reading glasses","story":"Share this article ‘I’ve lost count of how many pairs of glasses I’ve damaged or lost, but I now have 20-20 vision in both eyes which is better than I had before.’The procedure, conducted at the private Centre for Sight clinic in East Grinstead, West Sussex, involved Mr Daya cutting a thin flap in the top of Mr Parkes’s cornea – the clear surface of the eye that allows in light – with a low-powered laser.He then inserted a 3mm dot of corneal tissue – a quarter as thick as a strand of human hair – and closed up the tiny incision.The transplant sufficiently changed the direction of light rays entering Mr Parkes’s eye for the previously long-sighted patient to be able to focus on nearby objects again.         The new surgical technique could eliminate the need for reading glasses among some peopleLong-sightedness is progressive and caused by the gradual stiffening of the natural lenses in eyes as people age. It makes it harder for the eye muscles to pull the lenses into a rounder shape, which is required to focus properly on nearby objects.However, the addition of a convex layer in the form of the corneal transplant ‘fattens’ the focusing equipment and solves the problem. Laser eye surgery, which reshapes the cornea, produces a similar result but unlike the transplant is irreversible.While laser surgery is popular and usually successful, Mr Daya said results could be variable. ‘The beauty of this procedure is you are adding material, not taking it away,’ he said. ‘If it doesn’t work for some reason, it can be removed and you can add in a different sized corneal inlay.’A patient has only one eye treated, even if they are long-sighted in both because the brain is able to create a ‘blended vision’ giving the impression of almost perfect distance and near sight.Mr Parkes’s operation was part of a global trial of 100 patients sponsored by US firm Allotex which ‘makes’ the corneal implants. The corneas come from willing donors after their deaths.If the trials are successful, the procedure is likely to become available to patients prepared to pay several thousands pounds from next year.It is thought unlikely to be offered by the NHS, at least in the near future. "},{"url":null,"title":"Budget airlines charging fly cases passengers","story":"Share this article Our reporters found shocking examples on five different airlines providing flights across Europe. If holidaymakers want to buy a £48.57 return flight to Faro from London Southend on the easyJet website, they would be recommended a \u0027luggage selection\u0027 that cost them £69.23. The cost of a £29.98 trip to Copenhagen with Ryanair from London Stansted was significantly increased when our reporters were charged £50 to check in a 20kg suitcase.

Last year, airlines took a staggering £22.2 billion in fees.The amount they are cashing in from luggage charges has also increased as a percentage of their overall revenue – almost doubling in the past four years.Naomi Leach, of consumer association Which?, said: \u0027While the headline price of a flight might seem eye-catchingly low, there could be a number of extra costs that are difficult to avoid.          Airlines must be completely upfront and transparent, as constant tinkering with baggage allowances and charges risks confusing even the savviest traveller.\u0027 A spokesman for easyJet said: \u0027The fact that a hold bag can be more than the fare is more reflective of the great-value fares that are available.\u0027A Ryanair spokesman said: \u0027Our baggage policy is transparent and beneficial to customers.\u0027Level Airlines added: \u0027Our economy cabin is excellent value for money, with affordable fares so that our clients can explore the world.

Her plight is harder to bear because her elder sister Kemi, with whom she lives in East London, has always been a British citizen as she was born before the changes to the Act. Ms Thomas believes she is a victim of the Home Office becoming over-zealous after then Home Secretary Theresa May introduced a ‘hostile environment’ towards illegal migrants in 2012.The policy resulted in the Windrush scandal, which saw dozens of long-standing British citizens deported because they lacked papers proving their right to be in the country.Ms Thomas, 36, who has performed on the BBC, said: ‘My parents came here at the end of the Windrush era.‘I had a National Insurance number, I had my birth certificate, I’d got a driving licence, a bank account, I went to college. At no point during that process was there any indication I was doing anything incorrectly. I believe that I am British.’Although she was born in Scotland, Ms Thomas lived with her father in Nigeria between the ages of three and 18. She thought she had dual British-Nigerian nationality when she returned to Britain. She applied for a UK passport when she was 25 but she was refused. She was granted temporary discretionary leave to remain and told she could apply for permanent residency.But two weeks ago, Ms Thomas received a letter saying her application had been unsuccessful, and that she had to leave within 14 days or appeal, or face detention and deportation without notice.         New rules require documentary evidence of the right to be here, which many Windrush children do not have as anyone who arrived in the UK from a Commonwealth country before 1971 was given indefinite leave to remain, meaning many did not apply for a British passportThe letter revealed her right to remain had been granted only because she had been in a long-term relationship with a British citizen. It went on to explain that her right was withdrawn after she told the Home Office that the relationship had ended.She said: ‘I thought it was about my own situation having been born here and spent all my adult life here, but they weren’t interested in that.’She has chosen to appeal on human rights grounds and her case has been taken up by Liberal Democrat peer Lord Roberts, who intends to bring up her case with a Home Office Minister. But Ms Thomas remains in limbo as her case could take up to eight months to reach its conclusion. Her US performing debut at the Ford Theatre in Los Angeles in October is now in doubt and she estimates that fighting her case so far has cost £7,000 in legal fees.Ms Thomas’s lawyer, Fahad Ahmed, said she missed out on automatic citizenship by a matter of months and added: ‘Courts take a less harsh view than the Home Office, and if someone can prove their life is here, the courts will use their discretion.’The Home Office said: ‘All immigration applications are considered on their inidual merits.’Ironically, Ms Thomas’s story emerged as the first National Windrush Day was held yesterday – and as Mrs May announced that a memorial to the Windrush Generation will be built at Waterloo Station in London as a legacy to ‘their tremendous contribution’ to Britain. "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30f1ab8cd114751c846e085a9353cb64f8c9e437/0_196_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=737f49d07af926953c12be003055ceb3","title":"buy a classic guardian photograph dawn at glastonbury festival june 2017","story":"This week in our  Print Shop series, photographer David Levene captures festival-goers greeting the dawn at GlastonburyDawn breaks at Glastonbury festival’s stone circle in June 2017, as captured by the  photographer David Levene.

They were fully reinstalled in May.“It was a privilege to make these works for Edinburgh and now they are coming back to stay – I’m delighted,” Gormley said last month.Simon Groom, the director of modern and contemporary art at the National Galleries of Scotland, said at the time that they were thrilled to be reinstalling the artwork.“We are extremely grateful to Antony, his studio, Edinburgh city council and everyone else who has played such an active part in ensuring the success of the project,” he said.“This is a meditative and reflective work, which brings art out into the wider community along Edinburgh’s beautiful Water of Leith.”Locals and visitors have reportedly mistaken the cast-iron pieces for imperilled walkers, and police and ambulance services were notified of their reintroduction.It is believed that the pants were put on the sculpture as a practical joke. It is not the first time a Gormley sculpture has been dressed up in such fashion.On Christmas Eve last year, a group of pranksters scaled the Angel of the North outside Gateshead and placed a giant Santa hat on its head.Days later, a member of the group dressed as the Grinch removed the headwear."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a997120c1969d13821f4319adac6b5edc0a41b37/0_0_5184_3456/master/5184.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=8384c3f1fbeb020d3a55678e8695ac6c 2020w","title":"book clinic what can i read to de stress tim lott","story":"Q: What can I read to help me de-stress after a bad day at work?Health worker at a regional trauma centre, 63A: Novelist Tim Lott, whose latest book, When We Were Rich (Scribner, £16.99), will be published on 27 June, writes:You do not want anything that requires too much mental effort. So avoid grabbing, if you possibly can, the nearest Thomas Pynchon or Virginia Woolf. On the other hand, something overly dumb or badly written is also off the cards as it can be too aesthetically upsetting – no Jeffrey Archer or EL James (or The Little Book of Calm for that matter).Historical fiction is a great way to de-stress. I read Golden Hill by Francis Spufford last year and as intelligent a book I have rarely read. Or try JG Farrell’s great The Siege of Krishnapur. A short thriller is also a lovely way to relax – try Crooked Letter, Crooked Letter by Tom Franklin for a masterclass in absorption. And, of course, How to Be Idle by Tom Hodgkinson if you’re in the habit of working too hard.I find short stories unsatisfying, so I stick to essays by Tom Wolfe or John Steinbeck for a brief dip before I fall asleep. Wolfe’s Radical Chic and Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers is my favourite, an extended essay way ahead of its time. Steinbeck’s best collection is Of Men and Their Making.You could try laughing yourself back to sanity. Anything by PG Wodehouse, of course – The Code of the Woosters is as good as any, and early William Boyds are witty without being trite. Anne Tyler’s The Accidental Tourist is a great book about recovering from trauma (if you think you’ve had a bad day, you’ve nothing on Macon Leary).If you want a new worldview to help you think about stress in the long term, read some Zen texts – Alan Watts’s The Meaning of Happiness – is a masterpiece of de-stressing in 120 pages, and Lin Yutang’s The Importance of Living has the advantage of being funny as well as wise.Submit your question for book clinic below or email bookclinic@observer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e22a67f99ec346fbb3ec35e171b19ca509ab893e/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=945f033a83e2cbab2f4b4de7bcf15645","title":"ethics fly out window oxford university when big donors come calling","story":"What do we know about Stephen Schwarzman, the US financier whose name, following his £150m donation to the University of Oxford, is destined to become synonymous – as the Schwarzman Centre – with the humanities, the study of ethics in particular?Much of Oxford’s press release introducing him to British audiences dwells on the philanthropy evidenced in already-colonised academic zones: the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing the Schwarzman Scholars programme at Schwarzman College (in China) the Stephen A Schwarzman Building (formerly known as New York Public Library) Yale’s Stephen A Schwarzman Center, Yale protesters having had less success, to date, than angry parents at Schwarzman’s old school, Abington. For a donation of $25m, he had wanted it renamed after himself, with separate spaces going to his twin brothers, Mark and Warren.But it would be mistaken, it turns out, to conclude from the university’s reverent summary of Schwarzman’s academy-naming frenzy that the donor is concerned only with scholarship. For those in private equity, where he made his estimated $11.6bn fortune, Schwarzman needs no introduction others might find it more illuminating to situate him within Philip Green’s aesthetic movement.The men’s extreme experiments in partying, in different countries but with a similar disregard for either taste or national adversity, must add weight to the theory that some great innovations are, as Malcolm Gladwell once put it, “in the air”.Consider that, when he had friends, Green flew them around the world for celebrations featuring, for instance (for his Nero-themed 50th) Rod Stewart. In 2007, a £6m party for which 200 guests were transported to the Males and entertained by George Michael and fireworks, engendered further disgust.That same year, shortly before he made £4.62bn from the flotation of Blackstone, a private equity behemoth, Schwarzman held a 60th birthday party so costly and vulgar that it still symbolises for some US analysts the depths of pre-crash excess. Party planners transformed one of the biggest spaces in New York City, the Park Avenue Armory, into a scaled-up replica of his vast apartment. Rod Stewart sang, for a reported £1m. Donald Trump attended.Schwarzman’s 70th in 2017, staged at his Palm Beach estate, offered acrobats, Mongolian soldiers, fireworks, Gwen Stefani and – ethicists still debate the intentionality of the scripture reference – two camels. Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner stood proxy for the new president, who was detained nearby, introducing the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, to Mar-a-Lago.In yet another uncanny similarity, both Green and Schwarzman were made unelected “tsars”: the now disgraced Green by David Cameron, as an “efficiency tsar”, Schwarzman by Trump, as a “job czar”.For universities such as Yale, MIT and Oxford, the Trump donor’s valued support for a semi-literate liar, racist, molester of women and threat to international security hardly constitutes grounds – being so much less directly compromising than the rapacious business model, criticised for associated redundancies and cuts, that contributed to Schwarzman’s riches – for squeamishness. Oxford will be aware, no doubt, of the time, during the 2008 financial crisis, when he publicly hoped it would worsen. “The real golden age,” he told Robert Peston (then at the BBC), “comes when you have a mess. You have economies that are on their back.”Since then, Blackstone has become further associated with the misery of families forced out by its financial model, as a landlord, of huge rent hikes. When she established the case for a new predator-funded ethics centre, Oxford’s vice-chancellor, Louise Richardson, will have studied a recent report from the UN special rapporteur Leilani Farha, in which Blackstone is identified as a lead contributor to the global housing crisis. “Properties,” Farha explains, “are being purchased en masse, renovated and then offered at a higher rental rate, pricing tenants out of their own homes and communities.”But challenged, last week, on Schwarzman’s connections, Richardson confirmed, reassuringly for potential donors, that Oxford has left behind the judginess that refused Margaret Thatcher an honorary degree. “I’d imagine there would be very few people who would feel that way,” she said, you might think unimaginatively. “Do you really think we should turn down the biggest gift in modern times, which will enable hundreds of academics, thousands of students to do cutting-edge work in the humanities?”If Oxford, given its established reputation and assets, is arguably the joint-least-deserving destination, nationally, for such new investment, which was possibly its main attraction to Schwarzman, once Richardson had reeled him in.Blackstone is negatively associated with ersity. His chosen institution required the reputational substance permanently to obliterate less edifying aspects of the Stephen A Schwarzman story. Such as his complaint, after Obama proposed more taxes on private equity: “It’s like when Hitler invaded Poland in 1939.” His praise for Saudi Arabia’s “intelligent, reform-oriented” government. And before that, his James Bond party, with models dressed as Bond girls.That ethical quibbles about the Schwarzman alliance have been settled to Richardson’s complete satisfaction may not, inevitably, be a precursor to similar insults: Foxtons College, the George G Osborne Centre, Arron Banks Hall, the Boris and Carrie Johnson Professor of Conflict Resolution.Actually, with the Sacklers’ latest donation rejected by the V\u0026ampA, BP sponsorship increasingly targeted, the (ex-) director of the Serpentine Gallery pressured on business connections and escalating demands for renaming, there are increasing signs of respect for Nan Goldin’s proposal that cultural institutions should have some principles. “We have to hold museums to a higher standard,” the artist says. “They are supposed to be a repository of the best of humanity, a repository of learning and culture.”If such thinking catches on, it may not surprise Schwarzman’s admirers to find that he has once again, amid fast-rising caution about risky-name refreshment, grabbed himself a bargain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed5be6183a442ed57653e379cd110501ce33953a/203_192_1692_1015/master/1692.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=584ac3f947d2a7bd55b4cc703823a08b","title":"sapped by brexit little wonder we dream of doing a nick clegg","story":"Our decaying political system makes even the most ardent activist yearn to pack it all inYou may not know it but you are about to become Nick Clegg. I don’t want to become Nick Clegg, I hear you protest. The idea is not only repellent but ridiculous. Facebook won’t offer me £1m-plus a year and a Silicon Valley mansion if I sell out. I agree that it won’t. But opting out is far more common than selling out and Clegg is the market leader in both.I called him in October 2018 to check a point in a piece I was writing. I should have paid more attention to the note of alarm when he realised that a journalist was on the phone. He told me he was in Sheffield. Ah, I said, you are preparing to fight Sheffield Hallam again. He lost the seat to a mentally troubled Labour candidate, who poured out levels of abuse against women, gay people and his own constituents that were too much even for Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party. Clegg could have retaken the constituency with ease and gone back to Westminster to champion the Remain cause. He almost laughed at my quaint suggestion. No, he wasn’t thinking of returning to politics. Two days later, I learned why when news broke of his new career. Technology specialists can describe the awfulness of a Liberal Democrat accepting the position of vice-president at a rapacious wannabe monopoly that has facilitated the corruption of liberal democracy by Putin and the super-rich and allowed the mass murder of Myanmar’s Rohingya Muslims to be incited on its site.I am struck by Clegg’s decision to walk away from the gravest political crisis of his life. Because the Labour leadership failed to oppose Brexit, the “minor” parties increased in significance, as did politicians such as Clegg and Tony Blair, whose sell-by date seemed long passed. Say what you liked about them, but at least they were fighting back. Clegg said Brexit was a battle that had to be won, then fled the field as the struggle began.The same temptation in a different form erts people who see themselves as committed activists. If they but realised it, they would understand that they too are opting out of necessary fights and making a nonsense of their professed principles. They say Brexit is a calamity, but their behaviour shows they don’t believe it. They say they oppose an archaic first-past-the-post system that forces the public to choose between two discredited parties. But they do nothing to overcome its biases.It makes no sense for the Lib Dems to fight the Greens. The Green vote is concentrated in Brighton, Norwich and parts of London and Manchester where the Liberal Democrats are weak. If the pattern of continental politics is repeated, and one of the paradoxes of Brexit is that it is making Britain resemble the rest of Europe, the Greens will fight Labour in the cosmopolitan cities, as they fight the socialists and social democrats in France and Germany, and the Liberal Democrats will fight the Tories in the shires.Explain the need for Remainer co-operation and activists shudder. They prefer the purity of failure to the compromises that breaking out of our decaying system entails. I am sure they think of themselves as his moral superiors, but they are not so different to Clegg.Ed Davey is running for leader of the Lib Dems on a sectarian ticket. He won’t contemplate a Remain alliance. “A pact doesn’t cut it,” he told the Observer and anyone who says otherwise is “selling the Liberal Democrats short”. Green leaders say they are more open-minded, but add that their activists hate the idea of deals with MPs who worked with the Conservatives. The protests become louder as co-operation with Welsh and Scottish nationalists is discussed. For how can unionists work with separatists? As the triumphs of Boris Johnson and Corbyn are teaching us, activists are cursed by tribalism and an overweening vanity that makes them believe the country must want what they want.Can they break out of their silos and understand the wisdom of Benjamin Franklin’s line: “We must, indeed, all hang together or, most assuredly, we shall all hang separately”? If they do not, another future beckons for England. A hard Brexit leads to a country ided between an ugly nationalist right and an abusive hard left. If they see no way of breaking through, voters who oppose both will give up.I saw apathy set in during the 18 years of Conservative rule from 1979 to 1997. People who were full of fight were worn down by four election defeats. I see it now when I visit liberals in the authoritarian states of Hungary and the Czech Republic. They can protest occasionally and laugh at edgy comedians, but the knowledge that their protests can never hurt those in power weighs them down.Millions are now bouncing between parties, looking for leaders who can provide a credible opposition. If they can’t find them, they will retreat into private life and do their best to ignore Brexit Britain. If the choice continues to be between Johnson and Corbyn, they will suffer the worst fate of all: they will opt out and become Nick Clegg – but without the money. They will carry on opting out until our spluttering politics finally manages to cough up an alternative that works."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4113e2c97d344ff76e34b8be2357a3a2d26df98b/0_81_2340_1404/master/2340.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b81c396ff6955492956b5ad11a4f029e","title":"on my radar lolita chakrabarti life of pi invisible cities chernobyl capernaum rambert","story":"Playwright and actor Lolita Chakrabarti was born in Hull in 1969. In 2012, she was named most promising playwright at the Evening Standard awards for Red Velvet, which later transferred to the West End. Her adaptation of Life of Pi is at Sheffield Crucible from Friday-20 July, and she’s written Invisible Cities, inspired by Italo Calvino’s novel, for Manchester International festival (2-14 July). She is also currently in Sky Atlantic’s Riviera. She lives in London with her husband, the actor Adrian Lester, and their two children.I recently turned 50. My husband, Adrian, and I have been together for 32 years, so it’s very hard to surprise each other after all that time but he did! He and our teenage girls planned many surprises throughout the day and then in the evening he took me to Aqua Shard for dinner. It is on the 31st floor of the Shard, near London Bridge. The views were spectacular. We had a very private table between mirrored pillars that looked out over London. The food was delicious. It was a very good birthday indeed.When I saw this, luckily I knew nothing about it so I could discover the story as it unfolded. It is a beautiful film, directed and co-written by Nadine Labaki. Set in an inner city in Lebanon, it follows a young boy whose family fail to look after him, so he has to survive alone on the streets. He befriends an Ethiopian woman with a baby and when she is locked up for being an illegal immigrant, he takes care of her baby as best as he can. The story is surprising and heartbreaking. The performances are excellent – very natural and truthful.Published in 1998, this is about the truth and reconciliation commission in South Africa after apartheid was dismantled. It’s an extraordinary and very difficult book of real testimony and soul-searching questions for everyone involved. It moved me in a way other books have not. I read it because I’m adapting The Elephant Whisperer by Lawrence Anthony for the stage. It’s about a conservationist, a herd of wild elephants and is set in South Africa in the late 90s. So the political situation of the time is essential to the story.This felt like old-school television – detailed characters, long scenes, less action, more acting. I was struck by the quality of the writing and how it didn’t cower from the very technical aspects of the story. It explained nuclear power to a non-nuclear-literate audience. It felt visceral and stark, with focused and deeply committed performances. It was devastating, top-grade television.I went to see this at Sadler’s Wells because I was about to start working with Rambert on a new project. Each piece was the vision of a different choreographer – Wayne McGregor and Hofesh Shechter’s pieces were being produced after many years and Marion Motin’s piece was a debut. The skill of the dancers and the ideas in each piece were breathtaking. It made me very excited to be working with them.This is about Quincy Jones, the legendary music maestro and producer. Made by his daughter Rashida Jones, it follows him, now in his 80s, while looking back at where he began and what he has achieved. He knew Sarah Vaughn and Duke Ellington. He produced Off the Wall, the album that relaunched Michael Jackson. He produced Thriller. I was 14 when the video for Thriller was released in 1983. I stayed up till midnight to watch it. It was all any of us could talk about at school the next day. This was way before the documentary Leaving Neverland. It was when Michael Jackson was groundbreaking on so many levels. And behind it was Quincy Jones. This documentary gave a complete portrait and left me wanting more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d78961f8d86e92a13aeb182857491e95332ae53b/370_191_2762_1657/master/2762.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dba2e70aab1d5ae8408bb44aa5e702fd","title":"what oil companies knew the great climate cover up podcast","story":"Oil firms are said to have known for decades of the link between burning fossil fuels and climate breakdown.

Last year Missguided sponsored the show and the few clothes worn by the contestants were all from its ranges.The black bikini did indeed cause the expected internet sensation, but not for its sex appeal. Fast fashion critics took to social media to label it a symbol of a throwaway fashion culture that now sees British shoppers throw away a million tonnes of clothing each year.The outrage was heightened by the government’s decision on Tuesday to reject plans for a 1p fashion tax that had been proposed following an investigation by MPs on the Commons environmental audit committee (EAC). Until then, Missguided’s biggest problem had been keeping up with customer demand: the bikini was selling out in every size – from 4 to 24 – within 45 minutes after each restock.Founded a decade ago by Nitin Passi, Missguided is among a small number of internet fashion brands to have enjoyed success at a time when the traditional high street is on its knees.While big names like Marks \u0026amp Spencer (M\u0026ampS), Topshop and Monsoon are struggling to hang on to their ageing customer bases, Missguided and online rivals Asos, Boohoo and PrettyLittleThing have cleaned up, selling inexpensive fashion to young women in their teens and twenties who shop online rather than on the high street.Passi told the Observer that despite the furore, the company was not embarrassed about the £1 bikini as it was being sold at a loss as a marketing stunt – designed to pull in the punters to sell them other items at the same time.“I think we have to careful not to confuse the symbolism of totems with real issues,” says Passi. “The £1 bikini was priced to generate interest and we’re not embarrassed about it. We’ve always lived close to the edge when it comes to marketing, but we’re comfortable with that because there are never shortcuts when it comes to the product.”The 36-year-old entrepreneur, who started Missguided in 2009, accepts that it was perhaps “inevitable” that the product would be judged in the context of the government’s response to the EAC. But he adds: “Our £1 bikini was sourced no differently to anything else we offer. It was made by one of our audited supplier partners and with the same meticulous attention to detail as every item on our site, whether it’s £20 or £200.”With the exuberance of a dotcom-era startup, Missguided’s headquarters in Salford Quays – sandwiched between the Manchester United stadium and the BBC’s Media City – feature a “selfie tunnel” and a meeting room with swings instead of chairs. In one YouTube video the former Cranleigh schoolboy conducts a tour of the HQ he refers to as a “crib” while riding a hoverboard.Britons buy more new clothes than any other country in Europe, with high-street clothing chains in thrall to a fast-fashion model that demands new products arrive in store every week – rather than at the start of each season – to satisfy shoppers’ insatiable appetite for novelty.Missguided claims that it goes one better than fast fashion by offering “rapid” fashion, with 1,000 new products landing on the site every week: dresses start at £8 and you can buy a pair of jeans and a T-shirt for around £20. By last year the business had shifted more than £200m worth of clothes, although it is still a minnow compared to market leader M\u0026ampS, which has a clothing business worth more than £3bn.Those huge sales uplifts are coming in a £48bn clothing and footwear market that has been shrinking for several years – as, despite the shocking picture of waste revealed by the EAC inquiry, Britons are buying fewer clothes and choosing to spend their disposable income on other things.“I would argue that what consumers say and do are in reality two different things,” says Retail Economics’ chief executive, Richard Lim, who points to the huge success story that is Primark, despite its historical connection to the Rana Plaza factory disaster in Bangladesh.The Missguided stores failed to cover their costly rent bills and Passi, who had ceded some control to senior management, was forced to retake the reins and lead a turnaround. The business is now in a “much better place”, he says.Like Umar Kamani, the larger-than-life 31-year-old boss of PrettyLittleThing, Passi has created a brand that resonates with a new generation of shoppers which marketers say are hard to reach. The Missguided brand is all about “babe power”: its customer base are all “babes” and the website featuring a “babeZine” where they can read about everything from “WTF do I wear for massive boobs?” to working in social media.Passi insists the business is not built on his family connections – his father is a successful clothing supplier – since their expertise is in dressing a different demographic: “I borrowed £50,000 from my dad in 2009 and paid him back in 2010,” he says.Missguided is based in Manchester mainly because Passi’s uncle offered him free office space at the back of one of his factories to get started.He attributes its success to a nimble business model that is able to react to what its customers are talking about on social media. “It’s about the speed of what we offer,” Passi says. “Talking to them where they are through social.”The rise of internet shopping has been a major factor in the current high-street crisis: online marketplaces such as Amazon and Asos have altered the way many Britons shop forever. This shift has contributed to the financial collapse of the Debenhams and House of Fraser department store chains but also smaller brands at all price points, from upmarket kitten-heel seller LK Bennett to inexpensive clothing chain Select.A new report on the UK shopping market by global real estate adviser Colliers International makes the case that the “golden age” of online retailing could be coming to an end as websites start facing up to the shortcomings of their own business models – not least the cost of processing their daily mountain of returns.“People are realising that there’s no such thing as truly ‘free delivery’,” says Watson, who points to the prospect of suburban roads clogged with delivery vans. “The upcoming generation of shoppers is questioning the wisdom of items travelling huge distances – only for them to be returned and rack up more ‘product miles’.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e2b3f9392ea8975e8db413159feee4130852d5d/0_0_900_540/master/900.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b41cf1b57d0576c92a8ec97eac841196","title":"the edit summer sandals","story":"Geometric heels give this season’s sandals an arty edge, while flatties step out in style.

Aidy Boothroyd vowed not to quit following the team’s elimination on Friday, insisting he needed to reflect on a campaign that has seen England – unbeaten in 10 qualifiers – concede six goals, give away three penalties and receive a damaging red card, with Monday’s dead game against Croatia to come. On Saturday the head coach faced up to England’s latest disappointment on the international stage. Here, in his own words, Boothroyd defends his strategy, his record – and his players.What was going through your mind last night?I didn’t sleep. You always think to yourself: “What could I have done differently? What could I have done better?” Any half-decent coach asks themselves those questions when they are picking the bones out of something like that.And what conclusions did you draw?But it was a must-win game. Surely you start your best player?Well, you do, but if your best player has a really strong chance of getting injured because of the work that he has done then no, you don’t. I think the fact that Sess pulled his hamstring is a testament to the fine line you walk.Were you over-confident? Even after the Romania defeat you had players claiming England were still the best team in the tournament. Do they need to learn a bit of humility?They are young, fit guys and I think that was just a reaction. I don’t think we took anybody lightly. Maybe you guys did. Ultimately we made mistakes. We planned for months in advance, we knew what we were doing and we were really happy with everything around it. We have not been clinical. We have made inidual errors towards the end of games. We were just not as good as we should have been.I’m not sure it was an anomaly. I look at it like a club – the senior team is the most important. The reserve-team coach – me – his job is to get players into that team and to try to win football matches. Because the under-20s, under-19s and under-18s have done well their players have been hoiked up to me. Gareth has obviously taken the best players that he wants and needs. A lot of thought goes into it. We have to push people and stretch them and think about the longer‑term pressure. What I think has happened, to answer your question, is Gareth has taken players into the senior team, which is brilliant. I have taken players into the under-21s, and because of that everyone is a little bit weaker but the system is stronger.Do we need to be more realistic about these tournaments? It seems that you might have been hemmed in by the playing style and Romania’s superior ring-craft.Ring-craft is a great phrase and I’m going to steal it because it’s right. We get into positions where we think: “We’ve played some really good stuff.” But we’re scratching our heads on the way home after getting beaten. It’s a key thing for us – managing momentum, match management, ring-craft. These are areas that we should be aware of, because we’ve got a younger group, and be better at it.This line about “the best team here” is a recurring theme among your players. Is there a problem that, because of having great contracts with famous football clubs, many of them are suffering delusions of grandeur?That might be a bit of bravado. The boys are not daft. They will hurt and they do hurt. They will reflect and that will start today. We think we’re the best team but we’re going home, why? The important thing is we don’t brush anything under the carpet. We front it up. I honestly don’t think we have got delusions of grandeur. We know what we are. Yes, we’ve got a talented pool but looking at the longer term this talented pool, to be the best they can be, need to have these experiences and straight talking. It’s not a question of pointing fingers and digging people out. It’s a question of: “Right, you play for England now.” These are the key things we need to improve if we are going to get to the final stages of senior tournaments.You likened yourself to a reserve‑team coach but a reserve‑team coach doesn’t face the pressure or scrutiny you are now under for going out of a tournament. Would you have wanted more established players here like Trent Alexander-Arnold and Joe Gomez or is winning at this level not the priority for the FA?I could do no wrong if everyone thought that. It is a fair point. This is pressure but a privilege. As disappointing as it is, we want players from here into the senior team. Hopefully in five or six years some of them will be excelling in the seniors and doing well at tournaments.How long do you think it will be before Foden is ready for the seniors?I think his next six months will be an indicator of where he gets to and what he is ready for internationally. But, thinking about September time, I’d imagine he will be with me."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e54f60048e6b44c702afad7a6bf6d15f2f2d2850/0_71_4700_2820/master/4700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de6c01de57a066a3e9502e1d4b96a0d0","title":"why are the best footballers in the world suing their bosses","story":"The Women’s World Cup is nearing the knockout stages, with the tournament favourites, the US, in blistering form.

According to a report from the Bumblebee Conservation Trust, they could face long-term problems from future heatwaves. But we can give them a helping hand.You don’t need to keep honeybees to help bees – in fact, a 2018 study commissioned by Cambridge University suggests that this can harm wild bees. It’s thought that the more bees there are in an area, the more competition there is for nectar and pollen if every shopping centre has three or four hives on the roof, what does that mean for the wild bees?It would be easy to assume that our built-up towns and cities are deserts for pollinators. Yet among the grey is also green: parks, gardens, balconies, doorsteps and window boxes, each with the potential to feed a city of bees. In fact, urban spaces can, in some instances, be better for bees and other pollinators than the countryside, where wildlife has largely been pushed out to make space for more crops and livestock. Gardens and parks are home to a greater variety of flowering plants than in the wild, and for a longer season, too. What’s more, we’re less likely to use pesticides in them, enabling bees and other pollinators to feed safely. Indeed, a study published last summer in the journal Proceedings Of The Royal Society B found that bumblebee colonies in urban areas were actually stronger than those in the wild. Most bees are solitary: in the British Isles there are about 267 species of bee of those, 220 species of wild bee are solitary. These nest inidually the male and female mate then the female finds somewhere to lay her eggs. She makes a series of cells, in which she lays an egg on a “cake” of pollen and nectar, and then, coming to the end of her life cycle, she dies, leaving her young to feed themselves on the stores she has left for them. Some nest in the ground, in lawns or sandy borders. Others nest in cavities, such as walls, old plant stems and holes in dead wood. Many survive in urban areas.Wild bees include 25 species of bumblebee, which, like the honeybee, live in a colony led by a queen: she largely stays in the nest while her workers forage for nectar and pollen to feed the grubs. Nests are annual, and you may be lucky enough to find one beneath a shed or hedge. The tree bumblebee nests in bird boxes.To help wild bees, you don’t need to buy loads of kit. You don’t even need a garden. The first thing to do is grow as many flowering plants as you can cram into your outdoor space. All bees need nectar and pollen, both to feed themselves and their young. Some emerge from hibernation as early as February, while others wait until September. Therefore, growing flowering plants from February to November is key. Grow crocus and primrose in spring, lavender in summer, and Verbena bonariensis and echinacea in autumn.The second thing to do is to create nesting habitats. If you have a garden, start a compost heap, or let an area of grass grow long, and leave twigs and leaf litter to accumulate at the back of your borders. Bumblebees might make a nest or even hibernate here. You could also erect a bee hotel – a box designed to mimic the cavities in which some solitary bees nest – in a garden, balcony or doorstep.If we make all our green spaces bee friendly, we will help tackle the extinction crisis head on.This distinctive bee (Anthidium manicatum) has black with yellow spots down each side of its abdomen. The female nests in bee hotels higher up than other species, so you may entice them in if you live in a high rise. The female lines her nests with hairs from furry leaves, such as lambs’ ear. Grow these and mullein to attract them. Flies June to August.Another cavity nester, this rusty orange bee (Osmia bicornis) lines its nest cells with mud. It’s thought to be about 125 times more efficient at pollinating apple blossom than the honey bee. Grow fruit trees and catmint to attract them. Flies April to early July.This large, black and yellow species (Bombus terrestris) with a buff or white tail nests underground in old mouse holes, beneath sheds. Nests are annual and founded by the queen, who might have about 150 workers in summer. Grow lavender, alliums and cornflowers to attract them. Flies March to November.Ginger, white and black, the tree bumblebee (Bombus hypnorum) specialises in nesting high up, and seems to have a preference for bird boxes. Grow daisy-type flowers, such as single dahlias or chamomile to attract them.

Her 18th-century townhouse in Chelsea is an atmospheric case in point. Narrow passageways lead to panelled rooms where marble fireplaces are illuminated by lamplight. Gappy floorboards are split with the fissures of three centuries vertiginous stairs plunge towards the dark basement kitchen. Sometimes, says Braine, she can hear the spectral “twangings” of the ghost that flits benignly through the grid of stucco-fronted houses bordered by the inky wash of the Thames.Braine, a ceramicist whose fantastical forms spring from the “accidents and surprises” of experimentation, feels particularly at home here because the area has a history of innovation in design and art. From her roof terrace she can see where William de Morgan, the 19th-century potter renowned for wares adorned with fantastical beasts in lustrous glazes, had his workshop on the corner. A few doors down Josiah Wedgwood set up his decorating studio, luring other artists such as Dante Gabriel Rossetti and James McNeill Whistler, who turned this quiet backwater into a busy bohemia of studios and factories.At some point in the 19th century, an artist also lived in Braine’s house and built the double-height studio at the back. Once pungent with turpentine and linseed oil, it is now a grand sitting room, the Edwardian coffered ceiling and parquet floors untouched. “Some friends say it’s the sort of room their grandparents might have had,” says Braine, who has lived here for 20 years with her two children. She added the salvaged William III fireplace (the house has 11 grates), as well as the suite of Bergère furniture inherited from her parents. A small, whimsical table is by the Italian designer Carlo Bugatti (father of the car-builder Ettore). A set of antique lamps came from Venice, while the fresco-effect walls are a recent addition. “It reminds me of a palazzo somewhere in northern Italy,” she says.By coincidence, Braine’s predecessor was a “chic” Italian with flamboyant tastes. She installed the panelling and painted the floors to mimic inlaid wood. Over the years, Braine has tweaked the decoration “as I find things that appeal to my imagination”. A threadbare 1930s stair runner, an auction buy, snakes up to the top floor. In the bathroom, an armoire from France inspired the decorative cupboards, painted white to match the squeaky floorboards. Braine designed the round window that brings light to the top floors, where a friend crouched under the eaves to paint the nursery mural of camels, cobras and exotica. “The children have grown out of it, but I won’t change it.”Echoing Braine’s tactile pottery, drenched in glazes of coral or azure, this is a house of contrasting surfaces and moods. One moment you are swishing through beaded curtains, the next reaching out to feel a wall covered in bamboo or a smooth plaster effect. Another friend, the Swiss designer Christophe Gollut, suggested Braine cover the bedroom walls with fabric the paisley motif reminds her of shawls favoured by the Pre-Raphaelites. In the kitchen, the cue for the gallery-red walls was the fake “but painterly” Matisse which she brought home “rolled up in a suitcase” from Thailand. On the ground floor, the malachite-green wallpaper is a foil for ancestral-looking paintings, like Sir Henry Gilbert’s 19th-century portrait of Henry IV, snapped up at auction in Lille “and hauled back on the train”.Like those of her former bohemian neighbours, Braine’s artistic career has ned different media. She originally studied art and sculpture at City \u0026amp Guilds, and went on to specialise in portraiture. The filmmaker Sam Wanamaker commissioned her to make the portrait of William Shakespeare for the Globe theatre, which perches on a plinth downstairs. Braine once spent months “stalking” Francis Bacon to get a true likeness for a bust that ended up in the artist’s Soho drinking den, the Colony Room Club.Pottery has been her “addiction” for 20 years. “A day without making a pot is a day wasted,” she says. Braine works in an old Turkish bathhouse in the garden, where a “graveyard” flower bed is studded with shards of her broken pottery. Childhood nightmares of “Grimm’s fairytales, Peter and the Wolf and dark forests at night” seep into her triffid-like forms. She loves the physicality of pottery, “slashing and cutting” clay into waving tendrils: “I like pushing clay to the limits of its breakability, which is why some of it ends up in the flower bed.”Until now, Braine has only sold her work to friends and family, but this month she holds her first solo show, at home.

Partly for research into my next novel and partly out of curiosity, I find myself asking, who was I at 7, at 14, at 21, and so on? Does looking back on an entire life help us shape who we want to be from now on? Am I still the same person – or someone entirely different? After all, every life has two distinct aspects: the external and the internal. I want to examine the  of my life, like the 63 Up subjects, to see where I am and perhaps where I want to be, as my life approaches its own closing chapters. I want to try to shrink it down to something like a few sequential thoughts, if only to find out if there is any point in the exercise. So here goes…As a child in working-class west London, I was, my mother proclaimed, “a dreamer” living in, according to school reports, a “little world of his own”. But I was also, like all hyper-introverts, vulnerable to bullying – both at school and, to a greater extent, by my elder brother. By my teenage years, I had become uneasy and restless. I indulged in booze, soft drugs and pointless acts of vandalism. This followed a decision I made to abandon the shy, bookish boy I was, lest I be bullied any more. In short, I re-invented myself, as I have had to do repeatedly.At that time I had already determined to achieve several things in my life – primarily that I would escape my dull, suburban, penurious background, by becoming a journalist. I was determined to avoid the 9-5 at all costs. I also wanted to generate thoughts that were worth having, rather than the chaotic ego-driven chaos of my consciousness.I was also desperate to escape the zeitgeist I was born into, the sterile “nothing but” philosophy of British pragmatism and scientism (as in, say, love is “nothing but a series of electrochemical reactions”). I wanted to find a richer philosophy of life. I determined to live a life of extremes, to somehow generate a story worth telling. Finally, I was set on the idea I would never marry or have children. Instead I wanted, as teenage boys do, to have brief, passionate affairs with as many women as possible.It started well. At the age of 19 I had been plucked from my trainee status at a local paper to work on the then-powerful music press. I travelled the world, interviewing the likes of David Bowie, Freddie Mercury and Fleetwood Mac.On the outside my life was going well and was a lot of fun, but much was hidden – including my anxiety. My urgent ambition acted as a way of escape, not only from my background but from my own mind. By 28 I had founded a magazine, and made enough money to attend the LSE. I had friends, a good family and plenty of cash. However, my mental health was fragile. After the break-up of an important relationship and, completing my degree, I was offered the editorship of a major London magazine, a task I was ill-suited for. After three weeks, I resigned, suffered a breakdown and became suicidally depressed. It turned out social mobility wasn’t as problem-free as advertised.I recovered by the age of 31, but I felt effectively unemployable. That same year, my mother committed suicide. It was a devastating low point that would be beyond the stretch of a work of fiction. Yet within a year, I answered an ad in a newspaper for a job with a TV production company and was offered it. I married, at the age of 35, a college lecturer from a background similar to mine – also struggling with mental-health issues. My wife gave birth to two daughters with this, for the first time, I felt something approaching stability.It was now that I began at last to put together one of my childhood goals – a philosophy of life, since the results of my external ambitions had been so unsatisfactory. Prompted by investigations into my own depression, I started to study Zen Buddhism, after reading Alan Watts, the British philosopher who popularised eastern philosophy in the west. I believed I was finding what Taoists call “The Way”. The breakdown had forced me to put a mirror up to myself, something in my furious ambition I had been desperate to avoid, sensing only chaos within.I was sacked from the TV company and I finally sat down to write a novel. As the rejection slips piled up, once more I was feeling like a failure and wondering what the hell I was going to do in the future. But at least I had become close friends with the elder brother who had (in my mind) so persecuted me as a child.At 43 I found a publisher for a book telling the story of my breakdown and my mother’s suicide. It became a critical hit. Then, in 1999, I finished my novel White City Blue. Its protagonist, Frankie Blue, reappears in my new novel, When We Were Rich, as he will, Rabbit Angstrom fashion, in future volumes. White City Blue won the Whitbread first novel award, I was in a new relationship, my partner had given birth to another daughter, my third (so much for not wanting marriage or children). My career was peaking. People stopped me in the street from time to time and asked me for my autograph. By my mid-50s the bubble had started to deflate. My few media appearances had been more or less disastrous, with my ADHD producing more and more eccentric performances – weird outbursts and losses of temper. My books, although well-received, fell very much short of being best sellers. I was dropped by my publisher and only by the skin of my teeth made it to another publisher. My face was beginning once again to show the gravitational sag of the lifelong melancholic.Come, finally now, 63 and, on TV, 63 Up. My depression and ADHD are under control thanks to medication, but they have continued to occasionally flare up – the most recent episode of depression lasting a whole year in 2015. I am orced a second time, but my four daughters are an inexhaustible source of meaning. As for the passion – well, unlike John Betjeman, I have no complaints.So how can I sum it all up? It’s been an eventful drama, as I hoped it would be. And now even more peculiarly, for someone who was the son of a greengrocer, I find myself in a fairly long-standing relationship with a woman whose grandmother was a countess (and whose grandfather the governor of the bank of England). Social mobility has more or less seized up in this country, and I’m beginning to understand why. It’s not just about opportunity – as Professor Green remarked when he was briefly married to Made in Chelsea star Millie Mackintosh – it’s like visiting a foreign country: very disorienting.It’s a journey that has taught me an immense amount. I did end up – I hope – “having thoughts worth having” and even a philosophy of life. As for the “give me the child at seven and I will give you the man” maxim tested by the 7 Up documentary series, I am an entirely different person to that introverted seven-year-old – and also exactly the same person. Who do I want to be now, all these years on? For the most part my ambitions have narrowed to someone who is, simply, alive, healthy and at peace.Like the 63 Up crowd, I’m not sure I’d change a thing. There has been misery, but my story includes many moments of shining happiness. Then again, I’m not sure that I wouldn’t change a thing either. It turns out that the main lesson I’ve learned is that “not being sure” is the essential condition of life. With that in mind I’m looking forward to what happens next. Only, I’m not.Because looking forward is pointless. So is looking back – because every time you do so, the picture changes. The past is no more fixed than the future. What I think about my life is my life. Until, of course, I think about it next time.When We Were Rich by Tim Lott, is published by Scribner at £16.99.

The scholars had flown in from across the world to spend a few days reviewing academic literature on the vexed subject of “populism”.One of the academics showed me a graph charting how the number of Google searches for “populism” had rocketed in 2016, around the time of the UK’s Brexit vote and the election of US president Donald Trump, and remained high ever since. For decades a niche topic mostly studied by specialists in Latin America, the study of populism was suddenly very much in vogue.I was in Spain on a fact-finding mission. ’s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, and her deputy, Paul Johnson, had given me the green light to run a series exploring the rise of populism. The meeting in Segovia was an opportunity to consult experts on the subject that I had been grappling with for some time.In my previous  roles – as Washington correspondent and San Francisco bureau chief – I had reported both on Trump’s extraordinary ascent to the White House and the similarly stunning success of Bernie Sanders, a once-fringe independent senator from Vermont who transformed Democratic politics.I had also spent months trying to understand how dominant technology platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube – and the wider “attention economy” that makes them hugely profitable – were rewiring politics and creating an uneven playing field that might be tilted toward populist candidates.Back in Europe, I recognised echoes of what I’d seen in America – populists on the left and right (although more so on the right) were gaining traction in countries as varied as Italy, Turkey, Sweden, Austria, Spain and Poland. Five of the world’s largest democracies were run by them, including India, Brazil, Mexico and the Philippines.I learned two things from my trip to Spain. The first was that scholars who specialise in populism are exasperated at how frequently the term is overused or misapplied. The problem is especially acute in the UK, where commentators often use the term to refer to far-right, nativist politics, or use it as a shorthand for charismatic demagoguery.My second discovery was that while lots of useful research has been conducted on populism, it was limited – and there was surprisingly little in the way of empirical research tracking populist discourse, campaigns or parties.In the days that followed I worked with Mark Rice-Oxley, the ’s special projects editor, to sketch out the kinds of questions a series on populism would ask. What is populism, exactly, and where in the world is it taking root? Which parties and political leaders deserve the populist label, and what happens when they get into power? Perhaps most difficult of all: is rightwing populism, in particular, really on the rise, and, if so, why might that be?None of these questions have a simple or uncontested answer. This was always going to be an exploratory project helping us (and you, our readers) better understand populism, even if that meant there were no definitive conclusions. But we thought it was important to stay faithful to a broadly accepted definition of the p-word. Simply put, populism is a language that frames politics as a battle between the will of ordinary people and corrupt or self-serving elites, and can exist on the left or right.A few weeks later, we launched The New Populism, a series of essays and reported dispatches from locations as varied as Rio de Janeiro, Istanbul, New Hampshire, Venice, Johannesburg, Delhi, Zurich, Glasgow and Hartlepool.The most novel parts of the series were the research projects we conducted in partnership with political scientists, including several I met in Segovia. We created a partnership with Team Populism, a global network of political scientists, to analyse the hundreds of speeches by presidents, prime ministers and chancellors of 40 countries across the world. A grant from the.org, a US-based non-profit group, enabled us to hire 46 researchers who were trained to identify populist discourse in speeches.The result was the Global Populism Database, the most up-to-date, comprehensive and reliable repository of populist discourse in the world – and the basis upon we which we were able to report that the number of populist leaders has more than doubled since the early 2000s.Team Populism also helped us build a data visualisation of how reliant Trump is on a teleprompter for his particular brand of rather inconsistent populism – and a hugely popular online quiz that allowed 1.5 million  readers to answer several questions to discover how populist their own views were.In another collaboration, we coordinated a team of 35 political scientists to peer-review a list of past and current populist parties in Europe. Our academic partners later helped us design and analyse a major global survey in partnership with YouGov, polling respondents in 23 countries to test populist sentiment across the world.The New Populism series finished last month, culminating in European parliamentary elections in which populist parties secured almost one in three votes. Nowhere was the success of populists more stark than in the UK, where Nigel Farage’s Brexit party triumphed in last month’s election by capitalising on discontent over the failure to enact the result of the EU referendum.Brexit is only part of the story of a decline in trust in British elites that has long roots, as the sociologist Will Davies explained in one of a host of populism-themed essays we published in the Long Reads section.It used to be said that our first-past-the-post electoral system was a bulwark against insurgent populist parties. That may prove to be true. But the language of populism is everywhere in British politics these days. You hear it in the frequent vilification of political elites, the romanticisation of ordinary or “real” people, the attacks on the media and the idea that politics is no longer just a battle of ideas but a winner-takes-all conflict between good and evil.It can pop up in sometimes unexpected places – from Theresa May’s speeches, to the lexicon of those arch-Remainers who insist a “people’s vote” is the only legitimate response to a Brexit stitch-up contrived by powerful cabal of crooks and liars. Our six-month focus on populism has come to an end. But it seems inevitable that populism will be a subject we continue to report on for months and years to come."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1669c0e61aa0f2396a318bcb5d85874191a6986/0_193_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ea77229ec4bd2d252ca0fe1e3b1b7c0","title":"the whole thing was dismal readers on the tory tv debate","story":"Candidates for the Conservative leadership took part in a debate on Tuesday – readers have been reacting in the commentsMost of us will have worked with or for a leader who has had the ability to inspire, to motivate, to explain, to prioritise, to delegate, to coach, to be authentic, to involve, to be intellectually agile, to set out a compelling vision and to make following herhim an honour. None of these candidates come close to having any of these attributes and it makes me despair for our country ZeitgitThe whole thing was dismal. What seems striking is that anyone should continue to bother to ask these people exactly how they’ll get Brexit done, when it’s painfully obvious that their plans range from non-existent to laughable fantasy to just-about-possible-if-a-miracle happens.The merits of leaving or remaining in the EU are now beside the point. Brexit has become a vacuous non policy, which depends for its continued existence on not being specified to any credible level of detail. Once you start to pin down exactly how it would be done, support evaporates from one side or the other.Herein lies its real purpose: to create an endless and insoluble riddle, causing sufficient ongoing distraction and chaos to enable the disaster capitalists to ply their trade. There is no actual Brexit that true Brexiteers would support, because then it would become a boring and difficult reality the fantasy is so much more appealing and useful to them. This is why Farage’s party had no manifesto. Michael GallagherEvery single one of them ignored the repeated question regarding the correlation between poverty and their ideological cuts. Johnson well and truly in script mode, maybe his handlers should have instructed basic listening and response skills. Stewart was squeezed out time and time again by Emily and the other candidates. The only solace I can take from all of this, given the majority view of PM candidates on Brexit, is that we will be facing a general election very, very soon. Jazzfunk23My concern is that Johnson is not running for PM, but for ‘having been PM’ and the lucrative reward that this will afford him for the rest of his life. At least Stewart looks like he means it and that he wants to affect change of some sort. Gove, too, is committed I think and has a track record of actually achieving things... disastrous in education, but actually quite good in environment. I only hope the privileged few who get to choose our leader think about this, though I doubt many will be reading here! ExeprattlerIt’s satisfying and fun to rip in to this collection of deluded misfits. None of them deserves the top job, and most sensible people can see how flawed and uninspiring they are. But, the fact is that no matter how much we mock Boris Johnson’s mannerisms, or his hair, or his fecklessness, the UK is on a collision course with an economic crisis. Isn’t it about time we put aside the sniping partisan politics of our echo chambers and worked towards a solution? The first part of any way out of this mess must be the rejection of no deal as an option. The next stage would be a public consultation on what out negotiated leave options are and how they stack up against not leaving at all. It’ll never happen of course, but my point is that until the current tension is diffused nothing objective can be achieved. FreeThinker73Out of this bunch Gove is by far the best candidate. That’s not to say that I like him, or his politics but considering this is a Tory leadership contest and I’ve voted Labour in every election of the last 30 years, I’m not going to like any of them. Gove is the most serious, the most informed and the most likely to be able to elicit some movement from the EU. The fact that he comes across as that annoying little pip from school doesn’t change that. Nor does what happened within education whilst he was there the policies may have been poor but ultimately he delivered them, which was his job. I can’t stress enough that I don’t even want a Tory government, let alone one with any of these people running it. If we have to have one though and if it has to be run by one of these, it’s Gove. AndyOldhamOn the plus side, the Tory party will almost certainly be crucified on the Brexit cross. Whoever takes leadership has a year, maybe two before they befall the same pitfalls as their predecessors. Reality is simply something none of them are able to face (bar Stewart). There is no logic, or ration, or reason, to what they are doing. Still they believe they can abolish legal issues with force of will. Frankly both main parties may well be sacrificed in the altar: If the Tories fail to deliver Brexit, they are doomed. When they deliver it, they have nothing left to offer other than tax cuts.

I have never spoken on a People’s Vote platform before, but I too have come to the conclusion that the only way out of this mess is now to give the people a final say.“So let’s say it clearly, let the party that I joined at 17 years of age say it loud and clear - we want a People’s Vote.”Sunday marks three years to the day since the UK voted to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum.The MP for Leeds Central told the audience, which organisers estimated as being more than 1,000 strong, that leave voters were fed false promises. Describing their campaign as a fantasy, he said: “Our message is very simply this, what was promised in 2016 by the leave campaign does not exist.“You cannot have all of our sovereignty and all of the economic benefits. There are choices that we have to make. It wasn’t true, it isn’t true. Brexit will make us poorer, Brexit will make the north poorer. Who voted for that?”He was speaking in the first of a series of Let Us Be Heard demonstrations run by the People’s Vote campaign in an attempt to drum up support for the public getting a final say on Brexit.The campaign’s website says it plans to run more rallies in 15 towns and cities across the country, culminating with a march in London on 12 October.Also speaking at the event on Saturday were former England football players John Barnes and Peter Reid. It was hosted by retired athlete Steve Cram.Mary Creagh, the Labour MP for Wakefield, told the audience that she has called in private for her party to show “full-throated support” for a final vote being given to the public, adding: “We must campaign to remain.”Speaking about reports that Conservative leadership candidate Boris Johnson had an argument at his home on Friday morning, she said: “We’ve heard some pretty troubling allegations today about Boris Johnson, and there are some pretty big questions about the character of the man who wants to be this country’s next prime minister and lead us through the biggest crisis in our postwar history. This is the day the Boris bubble burst.”Meanwhile, Alastair Campbell, the former spokesman for ex-prime minister Tony Blair, and who was recently expelled from the Labour party, told the crowd there was no mandate for a no-deal Brexit.Explaining how the event marked the launch of People’s Vote North, he said: “It is time to revoke the long-held media myth that the north is this mass of angry, decrepit Brexiteers.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e2886c3b99a70938bcac0fa1f11d7d5aeb5c350/0_65_2562_1537/master/2562.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=afd927f0bc6615f72c809c1de83830f4","title":"labour must back peoples vote or isk becoming hisotyr margaret beckett brexit","story":"One of the advantages of having been around for a while is that it allows me to hear the echoes of history in current events.Back in 1975, I was a very junior member of Harold Wilson’s Labour government. And, like much of the party in those days, I was hotly opposed to membership of what was then the European Economic Community.I thought it was indefensible that the Tories had so blatantly broken the pledge they had made to the British people not to take us into Europe without seeking the explicit consent of the British people.Our prime minister and many of our most senior colleagues wanted us to stay in Europe, but Harold was – among many other fine qualities – a master pragmatist.Fast forward a few decades, and Labour is much less ided on Europe than it was in those days. Fully three-quarters of our members and voters want a “people’s vote” on Brexit. An almost identical proportion would jump at the chance of staying in the EU if we’re given the chance. Of course, there are still those who are in favour of leaving, but this demand for a confirmatory referendum with the option to remain is still the overwhelming choice of Labour supporters in the so-called heartlands – the north, the Midlands – as well as among our target seats and reachable swing voters.The reason is that Labour people like me have witnessed Europe’s transformation from what we once regarded as a selfish little club of capitalist countries into a union of 28 states that is doing more to tackle the towering social, economic and environmental challenges of today and tomorrow than any other organisation in the world.Now, as the Tories prepare to pick a new prime minister who seems hell-bent on a brutal jobs-destroying Brexit, this is surely the time for Labour to be launching an all-out, full-throated, campaign against this democratic outrage being inflicted on the British people.Labour’s efforts to bring a ided nation together may well have been well-intentioned but they left our voters confused or dismayed as we haemorrhaged votes in recent elections – with four times as many going parties overtly campaigning for a “people’s vote” than to Nigel Farage.Jeremy Corbyn is now said to be studying the history of the 1970s as he grapples with this problem. Labour can and should back a referendum on any Brexit outcome. And, if we get such a vote, I think it is inevitable that Labour will once more support staying in the EU because the idea that we can secure a deal that will satisfy – rather than impoverish – our voters, has long since been exposed as a fantasy.Those who still insist they want to leave could, if they wish, campaign alongside Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage in such a referendum. Jeremy himself could take a back seat in the campaign, as Harold did in 1975. What matters now is that Labour moves with speed to close the gap that has opened up between party’s position on the one hand – and its members, voters and values on the other.If we do this in the next few weeks we can still change the course of history. If we don’t, we risk becoming history ourselves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ab309586e55bd02f5ee85455752643cf5918b5e/0_2614_3370_2021/master/3370.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28f1928947d8c7bea65c453b3c93bace","title":"share your experiences of sure start childrens centres","story":"Whether you helped set up the programme in your area or your family used a centre near you, we would like to hear your storiesThe flagship Sure Start programme has saved the NHS millions of pounds through the benefits it has brought to children including some of the most deprived areas and reducing the number of those taken to hospital, according to a study.Research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies “found that where Sure Start offered high levels of service in poor neighbourhoods in England, visits to hospital to treat injuries fell among all children of primary school age, and by a third of all 11-year-olds”.Tracy Brabin, the shadow early years minister, said: “This research shows the critical role Sure Start plays in children’s health, as well as their development.

However, only a small fraction of doctors responded to oppose advocating any change in the law. On Saturday, the college’s governing council decided that another consultation should take place.Assisted dying is illegal in the UK. It is legally available under various conditions in five European countries including Belgium and Switzerland, as well as in Canada and six US states.The RCGP, which has 53,000 members, said details of how the consultation will take place would be made public in due course and its chairwoman recognised it was a isive issue.“Assisted dying is an incredibly emotive issue that polarises opinions,” said the RCGP’s Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard. “It has been nearly six years since we asked our members whether we should support a change in the law on assisted dying – since then, it is possible that views within our membership have shifted“As such, the RCGP Council has decided that the time is right to conduct this consultation, and we will be issuing further details of how we will do this in due course.”In a supreme court ruling in July last year, a court order no longer has to be requested to withdraw life support from patients in a vegetative or minimally conscious state if doctors and relatives agree that it is in their best interests.In March, the Royal College of Physicians dropped its opposition to changing the law on assisted dying and took a neutral stance on the issue after a poll of almost 7,000 doctors did not return a majority view."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ed65773eace37f9567c4377a4b0cbcfcfb51f4e/388_145_3498_2098/master/3498.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=475a4db85a8557dcae79c0e30363401e","title":"andy murray feliciano lopez doubles final queens","story":"• Scot and Spaniard reach doubles final at Queen’s Club• Murray into final five months after career-saving hip surgeryAndy Murray, dragged along and lifted up by his 37-year-old compadre, Feliciano López, moved into the familiar realm of the surreal by reaching the doubles final of the Fever-Tree Championships in the first week of a comeback that looked distinctly unlikely only five months ago.He and the Spaniard – who spent nearly five hours on court in three different matches – will play Joe Salisbury, who lives in Putney, and the American Rajeev Ram in the final on Sunday, not long after López tries for his second singles title, at 37, against the Frenchman Gilles Simon.There was almost too much drama to take in on day six of the championships, but rarely can there have been a protagonist more suited to the heroics, a player who left Melbourne in tears in January wondering if he would ever play again and who, after radical surgery, has recovered to the point where some of his tennis is almost indistinguishable from that which brought him three majors and two Olympic gold medals.In the space of a few days, Murray has ignited hopes – only recently forlorn – that he could contend again at the highest level, certainly in doubles, and possibly in singles. At 32, there is much to play for once more.Murray said later he felt physically fine. “No pain in my hip at all, zero,” he said. “My back’s a bit stiff. You’re getting down low for a lot of balls and you’re always in a crouched-over position in doubles, more than when you’re in singles. My arm is a bit tired from serving. But my hip’s been brilliant so far. I don’t feel anything at all. It’s amazing.”The semi-final was high-class and tense throughout, but the key moments were compressed into the champions tie-break, as the light faded and the temperature dropped.To get there, Murray served for the match, double-faulted and then López made a mess of a close-quarters volley to take them into a shootout in the second set. The tension, already tight as a drum, spread through the Centre Court seats, as the faithful huddled against the growing chill.Mistakes were creeping into the Spaniard’s game, but who could blame a player who had been on court, with a mere quarter-hour respite between his various tasks, since 4pm, as the clocked ticked on to 9pm and sunset? He’d first seen off the Canadian wonder boy, Felix Auger-Aliassime in full flight, blunting his burgeoning genius over three sets.After a 12-minute break, he returned with Murray to finish their overnight match against Dan Evans and Ken Skupski – and that had its moments before they won 6-4, 7-6 (3) in an hour-and-a-quarter in total. Blessed relief for López.Pausing only to warm up, they then engaged Henri Kontinen and John Peers in the semi-final. It was as if they were housed in one of the escape rooms Murray has become addicted to, where the participants have an hour to solve clues to escape. There were plenty of those moments in this semi-final.Peers, who won two slam titles with Andy’s brother, Jamie, had played well all match and served them to match point before López pulled out a majestic drive down the line to get to 5-6. Murray’s forehand went long on Kontinen’s serve, however, and the drama was extended into the gloaming and a champions’ tie-break.This was now a race to 10, with no prospect of lingering doubt. López smashed a backhand volley for 6-3, as the serve switched to Peers.A mix-up cost the Spanish-Scottish pair a dumb point, but they were still 7-5 up as Murray took the ball back in hand, and he moved them to within two points of the final. The Finn saved one for 6-8, and Murray over-cooked a drive down the middle.It was down to López to serve it out. His weary left arm, on second serve, took them to 9-7. He took a huge breath on the service line ... and Peers struck it wide. Job done. Glory to come? Nobody would bet against it.British supporters had already been guaranteed a home finalist when the 27-year-old Londoner Salisbury and Ram shocked the two greats of modern doubles, Bob and Mike Bryan, to win 7-6 (4), 7-6 (8) in an hour-and-a-half. Salisbury, a doubles specialist who got to the Wimbledon semi-finals last year with Frederik Nielsen, hit a career-high world ranking of 20 in April. Nothing is guaranteed at Queen’s on Saturday.Asked if he would consider playing mixed doubles at Wimbledon with Maria Sharapova – who has intimated she was interested in doing so, even though they fell out over her drugs ban – Murray said, “Possibly. But I haven’t given it a whole lot of thought. At the time I said what I felt, and I still feel the same way about those things. That’s never going to change.”Next he moves on to Eastbourne where he and Marcelo Melo play the Colombian doubles wizards, Juan Sebastián Cabal and Robert Farah – whom they beat here in the first round. At Wimbledon he switches to Pierre-Hugues Herbert.

Until the match at Headingley this Sri Lankan side had appeared rudderless and miserable, finding plenty of excuses for playing badly: the weather, the schedule, the practice facilities, the pitches. By contrast, England were progressing serenely enough, despite the blip against Pakistan.Now Sri Lanka’s win gives scope for hope among the chasing pack , though this would depend on England losing to at least two of the stronger teams that await them: Australia, India and New Zealand.The Sri Lankans are no longer moping around. Their captain, Dimuth Karunaratne, could glow at the performance of Lasith Malinga especially after his veteran pace bowler had flown home twice during the tournament after the death of his mother-in-law. Angelo Mathews, whose unbeaten 85 was critical to the victory, is no longer a glowering Achilles stuck in his tent but a wily old soldier committed to the cause. “Angelo told us it was getting slower and slower,” said Karunaratne. “We couldn’t get to 280-300 but we could get 240 and that would be a good total.”It was not that good a score, but good enough on the day. Ridiculously one can surmise that England might have found 300 an easier target. Then they would have had to bat with more purpose there would have been fewer decisions to make out in the middle about the best way to proceed. Sometimes it seems they do not want to think too much out there. They just want to “express themselves”.Friday’s defeat should not be decisive. But it does add a bit of spice to this week’s games. The match against Australia at Lord’s on Tuesday is not just about bragging rights or laying down a marker ahead of a possible crunch meeting later in the tournament – England need the points.The coach, Trevor Bayliss, is a shoulder shrugger. Outwardly he stays on an even keel whatever the outcome. He did not surprise with the explanation of England’s second defeat at this World Cup. “Obviously it was our batting, I thought our bowling was pretty good, superb in fact,” he said. “The batting? We weren’t as busy as we normally are. Normally on a wicket like this one – not the easiest to play big shots on – we’re still busy and knocking singles around into the gaps. We didn’t do that well enough.”He was asked whether nerves played a part. The matches of the last two weeks remind us that there is a world of difference between tournament cricket and a bilateral ODI series, where the odd defeat does not matter much. “ I honestly don’t know,” said Bayliss, a refreshing response in an age when we all seem to require certainty at every interrogation. “There’s always a lot of noise around the England team when playing well. We just took it a little bit easy with the bat, thinking if we just bat a bit of time we’ll put a partnership together. We forgot about the process we actually go through to put those partnerships together. That gave Sri Lanka confidence. They certainly bowled well, hit their lengths and changed their pace.”The most memorably inappropriate dismissal was that of Moeen Ali, caught on the long off boundary. But Bayliss does not hang his men out to dry. “I haven’t said anything to him yet,” he said. “I think he’s disappointed. Other times he goes out, hits it over the fence and we’d be yelling: ‘Great shot.’ But it was not a great time to play that after hitting the six the ball before. I’m no more disappointed than Mo with that shot.”Bayliss repeated that stance when discussing the contribution of James Vince, who is deputising for Jason Roy at the top of the order. As ever Vince tantalised at Headingley, unfurling two great shots before getting out.“It is not as infuriating for me as it is for him” said Bayliss. “He looks a million dollars then he finds a way to get out. Hopefully he’s one of those guys who can put one together and it tips him over the edge and he gets a string of big scores.”However Vince’s frailties are bound to increase the pining for Roy’s return. “If someone of Jason’s ilk is not playing you’re going to miss him. I’m not sure when he’ll be back but we’re looking forward to that,” Bayliss said, stressing that they would not take any risks with him.Judging by how gingerly Roy trotted on to the field to pass on some fresh gloves to an England batsman at Headingley (an unnecessary task for the lower order) he will not be fit for the game against Australia.It may well be that England would be prepared to wait until the semi-finals before reintroducing the opener – if they get there. The likelihood remains that they will but at Headingley they were served with a delicious reminder not to take that for granted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c99bebc5f63e473fce936bfbff280bd3325094a9/0_363_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45acfe4d2c20c0a0f0a4da351898a597","title":"ireland junior jockeys in pictures","story":"A late summer day’s racing across the sands of Béal Bán can haunt your winter with happy dreams. Around the end of August each year, the fledgling jockeys of the horse and pony circuit descend on this fabled white strand outside the village of Ballyferriter in West Kerry. They ride horses that tend to be either young and excitable or old and stubborn. They show the vivacious colours of their racing silks against skies that sit as often as not greyly over the mountains of the Dingle peninsula and the cold waters of Smerwick Harbour. This is horse racing in a pure, amateur form, and at a meeting like this you can’t help feeling it belongs to an older and better world than ours.The young jockeys have about them an air of intensity and a sense of lasered focus that lifts them directly out of childhood and adolescence – you recognise at once that these are serious operators, and this is a serious game.“I’m 10 years of age now,” says Dylan O’Connor from Liscarroll in County Cork, “but I started off with the horses when I was about two and a half.”He rode in just the one race at Ballyferriter last summer, but it went well enough. “I came in second, I was about two lengths back,” he says. “The horse was a fairly old fella, so he was grand, you know? You wouldn’t be nervous getting up on him at all.”Whenever he gets the chance, and whatever the season, Dylan is away with the horses. “I’d always get out on a Saturday, but hopefully I’d be out in the week as well,” he says. “And at home I’d be watching it on the television a fair bit. I’d be looking out for jockeys like Jack Kennedy or Ruby.”In Ireland, the jockey Ruby Walsh tends to pass as a one-name entity he is a key figure in the pantheon of native heroes for the young riders. And you have to start young – in truth, you’d want to be of veteran stock before secondary school to be seen as a real proposition. If you go well at the likes of Ballyferriter, the entire world of racing might open up to you. “You have to be 16 for the track racing,” Dylan says. “It’s definitely something I’d be thinking about.”At 14, Daniel King, from Kilbrin in County Cork, is nearer still to the age when professional racing might become a reality. “I’m on racehorses since I was 11,” he says, “and I’m doing the point-to-points now as well. I started racing ponies when I was about nine, I suppose.” This wasn’t his first appearance at Ballyferriter – he is already a seasoned familiar of the strand, and the 2018 meeting went markedly well for him. “I think I had seven winners... I know that I won the first five races. But the horses I had were good enough now, to be honest, and I’d have expected to go well.”He knows exactly the discipline that’s required should the professional game become a reality (“My weight’s all right at this stage, anyway!”) but the attraction of racing overrides all else. “Ah, it’s a very exciting thing, yeah. Definitely you’d miss it if you’re away from it for any length of time.”Racing horses is a kind of glorious infection, and once you’ve got the bug, there is no reliable cure. Alan Powdrill, the photographer who took these portraits, stumbled upon the Ballyferriter scene while on a road trip down Ireland’s Atlantic coast last summer. “I saw a poster for the races in a bar and thought I’d go out and take a look. And I knew straight away it was gold. I hadn’t realised it was going to be all these young kids racing.” The fact of a typically overcast day in West Kerry was ideal. “I knew if I used a flash, I could really make the colours pop.”The meeting at Ballyferriter is one of many organised by the Horse and Pony Racing Association (Southern Section). There are meetings at Ballingarry in County Limerick, another beach meeting at Ballyheigue in Kerry, another at Allihies way out at the tip of the Beara peninsula in West Cork, and many others. They are held on fields and stretches of sand that have very often been the sites of horse races for hundreds of years. Many of the famous Irish jockeys have come through from the ranks of the HPRA meets – Norman Williamson, Wayne Lordan, Kate O’Brien. If you can keep manners on a jerky two-year-old across the sands of Béal Bán, nothing that Aintree or Cheltenham can throw up should faze you.I’ve been around racing people a bit over the last few years, researching a film script. I have found among them no more than a grudging acknowledgment that there is such a thing as life beyond the racing of horses, but how dull and inert it must be, and why would you even bother? This is very much a tribe, and there are particular tribal instincts. Even with jockeys as young as these, there is a lovely kind of reticence, or modesty. There is no big talk. The victories are worn lightly the defeats are all the more frequent and are suffered without complaint. It is a sport with a tacit magic made of the trust that develops between jockey and horse, the silent agreement that they can only get through this thing together.On days like this at Ballyferriter, the peninsula might seem to be en fête – the chip vans are out, and the bouncy castles – but when it gets down to the hard business of racing, the attention is intense and deeply serious, and nothing, but nothing quickens the blood like the roaring thunder of a galloping pack across the compacted sands. This is inarguably the kingly sport, even still, and there isn’t a corner of the earth where it is more important to the texture of life neither is there a place where the riders are more revered.• Kevin Barry’s new novel Night Boat To Tangier is out this week.

For the young creators of a hit musical about these six English queens, the year since it opened at the Edinburgh festival – and they gave the Observer their first interview – has changed everything.Six, by the Cambridge graduates and friends Lucy Moss and Toby Marlow, has been selling out in America after its hugely successful debut in London, straight from the Edinburgh fringe. Now Broadway beckons, to say nothing of the productions opening in Australia, Korea, China, back in Britain and on two cruise ships.“I did keep pinching myself, but I had to stop,” said Marlow, 24. “It has been such a whirlwind. I went on my first holiday for two years last week to reflect on everything.”The show, which takes the form of a singing contest between the six royal women, was nominated in five categories at last year’s Olivier awards and has done just as well in Chicago. Featuring songs including Ex Wives, Haus Of Holbein and Don’t Lose Ur Head, the musical has been praised for its score. While the  critic noted the debt it may owe to Hamilton in its unorthodox approach to history, he added that “it has its own manifest cheeky British personality”.Now Marlow and Moss are talked of as potential successors to Lloyd Webber and Rice, but say they are determined to stay “grounded”.“Even though it had been such a hit in London, when we came out to America, Lucy and I were freaking out, wondering if the history is going to appeal in the same way,” said Marlow. “But they knew all the words already from the internet, which was extraordinary. They are much more vocal than Brits, and some have come from right across America to see it.”Moss, 25, agrees that her sudden success in the risky world of showbusiness has been a shock. “My mother is particularly surprised, because my brother is now an international poker player. She is a tax manager, such a safe job, and keeps asking what the hell her children are doing.”Fans also present a challenge for Moss. “I find it hard to deal with them. Although they are lovely, I am so awkward about it. It has been so overwhelming.”Producers Andy and Wendy Barnes joined Kenny Wax, the producer behind international hit The Play That Goes Wrong, to back the show after each spotted something in Six. Speaking to the Observer last summer, Andy Barnes said the show was unusual for attracting finance at such an early stage.“But investors like me have to be in it for the long game, because by the end of the festival we will have spent a lot of money on Six and only got a little back at this stage.” He made the right decision.Moss is now planning to buy her own place in London. “At the moment I am staying in the living room of a three-room flat in Bethnal Green. I do think maybe I need a door and a proper room now, but I am quite attached to east London.”Moss is pleased that the unconventional side of the show has made it many friends. “It is not subversive exactly, but it is feminist and its form is a bit of an experiment for a musical,” she said. “And I suppose the more serious message in there makes it a bit of a Trojan horse for a show that seems so fun and poppy. The audience do not expect the moments of darkness that come.”Moss and Marlow are now off to Kent to work in seclusion on a total of three new musical theatre projects, as well as some pop songs.“We are trying to avoid that difficult second album thing by doing them all at once,” said Moss."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26560f541846d38e77d5a201ae4a938d8dff0139/0_1381_4480_2686/master/4480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5dc4d2104348aebb5c04b424b483c93","title":"five best vr headsets oculus quest rift s htc vive pro playstation nintendo labo switch","story":"From the Oculus Quest and Valve’s pricey Vive Pro to Nintendo’s family-friendly kits, a guide to what’s on offer in the world of virtual realitySix years after the first iteration of the Oculus Rift kickstarted the modern era of virtual reality, the now Facebook-owned company is back with not one but two new entries, joining a raft of big names from Valve’s Vive to Sony’s PlayStation VR and even Nintendo.With more options than ever to suit budgets, play styles – and games and experiences actually worth paying for – there’s never been a better time to don a headset and step into a new reality. Here’s a quick guide to five of the best on the market.The Quest is Oculus’s first fully featured standalone headset and offers a transformational experience. For the first time you get all that’s good about high-end VR, including precise tracking, excellent hand controls and room-scale play that lets you actually walk around in a virtual world, and without the restrictive cables tethering you to a monster PC.You lose visual fidelity (the Quest is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 chip from 2017), the battery only lasts about three hours, and it’s not as comfortable on the face as the Rift S. It’s also more difficult for other people in the room to see what you’re doing, as not every game supports Chromecasting your view to a TV.However the freedom to pick up and play, or to take your headset to another room or a friend’s house with no fuss, is worth it – particularly in households where space is limited. It has pretty good built-in speakers located by your ears, or you can plug your own headphones in.Not every great VR game is available for the Quest, but fan favourites such as Job Simulator, Robo Recall and Superhot VR have made the jump, while titles such as Star Wars Vader Immortal are compelling (if short and pricey) experiences. It just needs more games, but many are on the cards. Verdict A mobile, self-contained VR headset that’s finally worth buying. Best game Beat Saber – Guitar Hero with lightsabers is simply brilliant without wires.The latest PC-powered VR headset from Oculus is a big step up in comfort and convenience compared to the previous Rift, but still requires a hefty gaming PC to power it.The Rift S ditches the annoying sensors that had to be positioned around your room to track your head and hands, and needed recalibration almost every time you used them. Instead cameras on the Rift S track your room and hands, with just one USB cable and one display cable connecting your headset and PC. Just put the headset on and it takes care of the rest, making setup much easier. Another significant change is the switch to a halo design for the attachment to your head, which combined with reduced weight makes it a lot more comfortable to wear even for extended VR sessions. Built-in speakers by each ear remove the need for headphones, but you can plug your own in if you want.The headset’s display is crisper too (though you can still see the pixels) and it has the same great touch controllers as the Quest. The Oculus game library is quite big and you can play VR games from Steam too. Verdict PC-powered high-end VR with less of the faff. Best game Robo Recall – I, Robot turned into an arcade shooter at its best.If you are a VR devotee with all the money to spend on the best possible kit, the Vive Pro is what you want. You’ll also need a lot of space. Vive will let you use a whole five-metre-square room as a VR environment, with the help of the headset sensors and a base station plugged into your (high-end) PC. For your money, you get the best-looking, highest-resolution VR experience currently possible, a step above the slightly pixelly experience on both Oculus headsets and the older Vive. Games look significantly better, and virtual objects less blurry round the edges.Built-in headphones and an improved harness that holds the thing on your head when you’re moving around make playing more comfortable. A cable still connects it to your PC, though for even more money you can tack on a wireless adaptor. Setup is lengthy and quite complex, as every single component requires its own up-to-date firmware and drivers, and sometimes it can take half an hour or longer to actually get a game going. If you’re into high-end VR you probably don’t mind the tinkering so much, but for a lot of people it’s enough to put them off. Verdict Technically the best VR experience – but for a price (in time and money). Best game Doom VFR – only high-end VR can do justice to this frenetic shooter.Compared with high-end PC VR, the much cheaper PlayStation VR headset is pretty plasticky, and lower-resolution. It can’t track your hands or even its own motion controllers with total accuracy, though most games work perfectly well with a standard PlayStation 4 pad. The thing about PS VR, though, is that it’s got by far the greatest number of VR games that you’d actually want to play.Where lots of PC VR games are adaptations of older titles like Skyrim or experimental concepts that can leave you with a headache, Sony has tasked its development talent with making things specifically for VR with the kind of polish you’d expect from a PlayStation game. Tetris Effect is a trippy take on the classic, and transcendental in VR Blood \u0026amp Truth is a hugely enjoyable London gangster drama Moss is a gentle adventure involving a little white mouse. Early PC VR hits like Job Simulator and Beat Saber are available too. If your priority is games that are super fun to play, rather than how good they look, PS VR is the standout. Verdict The least impressive VR tech, but the best games. Best game Astro Bot: Rescue Mission – brilliantly inventive puzzle adventure featuring cute robots.Price: from £38 - plus Nintendo Switch (£280)Nintendo’s VR option is so simple and intuitive you can build it yourself. Indeed, you have to build it yourself: Nintendo Labo comes as a kit full of flat-packed cardboard. Pop the game into your Switch and it’ll give you lively instructions to assemble your own cleverly designed VR headset, along with some endearingly crackpot accessories like a cardboard swan for flight games, a little windmill that lets you play games by blowing on it and a blaster for shooting with. Insert the Switch controllers and screen, and away you go.Labo VR comes with 64 creative, experimental games – one involves feeding hippos fruit with the blaster, another piloting a UFO – and, interestingly, it also lets players remix and create their own VR games. Few of them last more than 10 minutes or so but they’re creative and entertaining nonetheless. Nintendo’s is the only family-friendly VR option, with a 7+ PEGI rating, and it also gives curious kids an insight into how VR actually works with friendly tutorials and explanations. Technologically it’s basic, but the games are spirited and fun, and assembling the headset yourself is an entertaining way to spend an afternoon. Verdict VR as a toy: fun, creative, cheap and family-friendly. Best game Only the packaged games run with it: one favourite has you taking pictures of fish underwater with a cardboard camera.

Yes, that. What’s taking you so long?Perhaps you need to reply to an important-but-not-urgent work email, or pay an overdue utility bill. These tasks are straightforward enough, so why does alphabetising your books seem preferable instead?Procrastination is the pits. It leaves us feeling guilty and self-loathing. When contemplating, say, getting round to finally sorting out that life insurance quote that’s been on a Post-it note on the fridge for nine weeks, why does scrubbing the shower grouting with a toothbrush suddenly become more pressing?It cannot be that, as a species, we are inherently bone idle and appalling at managing our time, because the tasks we engage in rather than the ones we need to do often require focus and physical labour. In fact, laziness has very little to do with procrastination, which is, in simple terms, a form of self-punishment.Procrastination is not just about delaying. It is about engaging in something we know in our gut to be unhelpful – a painful level of self-awareness. We know that we’re avoiding what we need to do, which feels awful enough, but also that doing something else instead is not a great idea either. But we go ahead and do it anyway.The pattern is irrational. Yet when we start to consider how we feel, things become a little clearer. Procrastination is usually a habit rather than a one-off occurrence. It is unfair to label it as a character flaw (although it may be perceived as such by those close to us). Rather, it is an inability to manage uncomfortable feelings associated with a task.Particular jobs such as cleaning the toilet or unblocking the bath plughole are universally revolting because they involve matter we instinctively know could contaminate us. We’re wired to find them disgusting as a form of protection. However, deeper negative emotions – such as frustration, boredom, anxiety, resentment, confusion or insecurity – may be connected with other, less grimy tasks.If I am sitting in front of my computer trying to write a cover letter for a new job, I might start thinking: “I sound like a fool, they will surely think I sound terrible.” Replacing the task with something monotonous and engaging, such as vacuuming the stairs, is a way for me to cope with those difficult emotions.Research shows that procrastination can be explained as something we engage in as an urgent self-soothing technique, but the comfort is fleeting at best – once we start thinking about what we’re doing, more stress creeps in. There’s even a scientific name for this thought process: procrastinatory cognitions. In turn, this makes us procrastinate even more. We reward ourselves for procrastinating, while the negative emotions surrounding the task remain, as well as self-blame.Particular areas of our brain involved with self-perception interpret the tasks we’re procrastinating over as, essentially, not our problem – in the long-term, at least. As humans we aren’t wired to prioritise long-term needs. From an evolutionary perspective, we prioritise providing for ourselves in the present, because our ancestors never knew what was (or wasn’t) around the corner.So what can we do? Looking in the mirror and saying, “Stop procrastinating NOW” probably won’t work. Time management apps will only get you so far. Really, we need to think about the root cause of why we’re procrastinating. Identifying that it is about emotion rather than efficiency is a good start.Practically speaking, we can make our procrastination activities harder to do. If you habitually turn to social media, try deleting the apps from your phone and creating new, elaborate passwords. If you throw obstacles into the procrastination cycle, it takes longer to feel the reward and changes how your brain perceives the value of something – such as checking social media.Ultimately, loosening the grip of this existential habit comes down to self-compassion. Re-evaluate your tasks by creating a new “evidence base” for when you have done similar things well. Imagine the positive outcome. How will you feel in yourself? How will you – or others – benefit? Try writing that down. Presenting our inner dialogue to ourselves can be very powerful.Another potentially helpful technique is “defusion”. When the urge to procrastinate strikes, set an alarm for three minutes on your phone. Close your eyes. Bring your awareness to what is happening in your inner world – your thoughts about procrastinating (are they streams of words or images?) and the feelings in your body: where do you feel them? Are they familiar? Start noticing the way you’re interpreting what the thoughts and feelings around procrastination mean to you, and how that affects you in that moment. When the alarm goes, you may see your urge to escape your feelings for what it is.There is a robust evidence base to show that mindfulness exercises, if practised regularly, can improve our ability to accept and tolerate negative emotions without engaging in avoidance or actions that bring short-term relief. It might take a little time, but change is entirely possible. Your books can go unorganised for a while yet.For more information, visit avivalife"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96e4ac73a96abc34a604b226472ea0b3947f9fbe/48_0_3470_2082/master/3470.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=534eed288c775114db1e3a30160c2e8a","title":"angela merkel rightwing extremism must be fought","story":"Chancellor warns against losing credibility after arrest over murder of Walter LübckeAngela Merkel has said Germany must rigorously fight rightwing extremism after the murder of a prominent politician.The arrest of a man with suspected far-right sympathies over the shooting this month of Walter Lübcke, a regional ally of Merkel known for his pro-migrant views, shocked Germany and prompted calls for a more proactive government response to anti-immigrant extremists. The chancellor, speaking in Dortmund on Saturday at an annual gathering of Protestant churches, said rightwing extremism must be fought “without any taboo”.“Otherwise we will have a complete loss of credibility,” she said, adding that the government took the issue “very, very seriously”.

However, Washington said the incident had occurred in international airspace.UK relations with Iran have been dominated by the ongoing imprisonment of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian national who has always denied the spying allegations upon which she has been held in Iran since 2016.Speaking about Murrison’s planned visit to Iran, her husband Richard Ratcliffe said: “I’ve been asked how hopeful I am. I’m not sure if I’m hopeful, but certainly will be watching very closely to see how things develop and what comes back.”“The sooner the British government’s able to work with the Iranian government and find a resolution, that’s better for our family, for sure.”However, US-Iran relations have overshadowed her ongoing confinement, and while both countries have said they do not have any appetite for conflict Donald Trump told NBC on Friday that if it comes, Iran would experience “obliteration like you’ve never seen before ... but I’m not looking to do that”.Trump said the US was “cocked and loaded” to retaliate against Iran, but that he had cancelled planned strikes just minutes before they were to be carried out on Thursday after being told 150 people could die.Tensions between the US and Iran have soared, with Washington dispatching warships to the Gulf, and Tehran threatening to resume higher uranium enrichment.John Bolton announces the deployment of the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group and a bomber task force in response to \u0027a number of troubling and escalatory indications and warnings\u0027.Iran vows to enrich its uranium stockpile closer to weapons-grade levels if world powers fail to negotiate new terms for its nuclear deal. The US responds by imposing sanctions on Iran\u0027s metals industry.The EU urges Iran to respect the nuclear deal and says it plans to continue trading with the country despite US sanctions.\u0026nbspThe US says it will move a Patriot missile battery into the Middle East to counter threats from Iran.The UAE says four commercial ships off its eastern coast \u0027were subjected to sabotage operations\u0027.Yemen\u0027s Houthi rebels launch a drone attack on Saudi Arabia, striking a major oil pipeline and taking it out of service.Saudi Arabia blames Iran for the drone attack on its pipeline.A rocket lands near the US embassy in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, without harming anyone.

Never threaten the United States again!\u0027Semi-official media in Iran report it has quadrupled production of the low-enriched uranium used for civilian applications. Iran is allowed to enrich uranium, but increased production could lead it to exceed the stockpile limits in the nuclear deal.Senior Pentagon officer Vice-admiral Michael Gilday says the US has a high degree of confidence that Iran\u0027s Revolutionary Guards were responsible for the explosions on the four tankers in the Gulf of Oman.Saudi Arabia\u0027s King Salman hosts high-level summits in Mecca.

The US military confirm one of its drones has been taken down, but say it was in international airspace.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspLast year, the US unilaterally pulled out of the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six other powers and reimposed sanctions on the country. International sanctions had been lifted under the pact in return for Tehran curbing its nuclear programme.A senior Arab diplomat said sharply increased tensions would further harm the crisis-hit Middle East region.“De-escalation is very important because tempers are flaring… It’s very important we avoid confrontation right now,” they told Reuters, on condition of anonymity. “Confrontation, whatever we think about Trump or Iran, will be disastrous for everyone.”On Saturday, Etihad Airways followed Qantas, British Airways, Lufthansa and a number of other airlines and suspended “until further notice” operations through Iranian airspace over the Straits of Hormuz and the Gulf of Oman.The United Arab Emirates-based carrier said “the safety of our passengers and staff is the highest priority” and that it would use alternative flight paths on a number of routes to and from Abu Dhabi.The US has warned that commercial airliners could be mistakenly attacked after the US Navy Global Hawk drone was shot down on Thursday.Tehran dismissed the concerns, which come 30 years after the US Navy accidentally shot down an Iranian civilian flight flying in Iranian airspace, killing almost 300 people."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c927db73f0ec0fc6424c46f1e8ed5baa2a2fa886/0_183_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3fe1ea296e671e88638f0f0e92562c9b","title":"refugee eviction peak in france bid halt channel crossings","story":"British and French authorities have ramped up attempts to prevent refugees reaching the UK with camp evictions in north France running at several a day, new analysis reveals.More than 800 clearances of migrant camps near the ports of Calais and Dunkirk have been recorded since last August, a zero tolerance strategy that campaigners say is designed to stop migrants attempting to cross the Channel by boat.French police carried out 12 evictions in Calais last July when reports of Channel crossings began to emerge, compared to 79 in May, the latest month for which figures are available.Charities argue that the increasing tempo of evictions, a strategy backed by UK border authorities, is forcing the 1,300 refugees currently in northern France to risk the dangerous Channel crossing. Last month the number of crossings by migrants from France hit record levels.The Calais-based organisation Human Rights Observers and French group L’Auberge des Migrants have produced a report that shows attempts to drive out refugees from northern France have increased to record levels, with 803 forced evictions recorded between 1 August 2018 and 1 June 2019.“It’s an astronomical figure which illustrates the authorities’ relentless harassment of displaced people in Calais. The cadence of these operations is uncompromising, occurring on the weekends as well as on bank holidays,” said Jenni Whitaker of Human Rights Observers.The controversial “migrant management strategy” is backed by the UK-France Coordination and Information Centre in Calais, which is staffed by Home Office border officials, National Crime Agency officers and British immigration enforcement staff.The centre, funded by the UK, shares “real-time intelligence between UK and French agencies” and is dedicated to stopping refugees trying to cross the border.The repeated destruction of makeshift camps around the Calais port area and the town of Grande-Synthe, near Dunkirk, has forced many of the refugees to sleep without shelter and also lose their possessions.Of 500 migrants currently living near Calais, 139 are unaccompanied minors, with another 150 children among 800 living in rudimentary camps close to Dunkirk.The scheme to transfer vulnerable child refugees from France to Britain has reportedly been ended, leaving hundreds of lone children facing exploitation. A 10-year-old unaccompanied boy was among those recently attempting to reach the UK, where he has relatives.“The relentless and repetitive nature of the evictions appear to deliberately exhaust the communities, and render them even more materially precarious,” said the report.Of particular concern, says Whitaker, is how police establish a “security perimeter” during evictions to prevent refugees retrieving their belongings. On one occasion last March, gendarmes are alleged to have initially prevented a mother retrieving her child from a tent.The Human Rights Observers, set up in October 2017 to investigate allegations of mistreatment by the French authorities against refugees, also report that tents have been routinely broken and confiscated and food sprayed with teargas, and that even jerrycans of drinking water have been slashed.“These evictions only serve to add to the accumulated trauma of refugees and migrants, and aim only to create further hostility rather than offer a dignified solution. This has led to a deterioration of both the physical and mental health of those affected,” said the report.The vast majority of evacuations occur at Calais, with clearances in Grande-Synthe more sporadic, and currently take place at a rate of two per week.Charities celebrated a legal victory last week against the French authorities over alleged human rights violations at Grande-Synthe, a verdict that means the state must provide water, showers and toilets for the hundreds living there.A Pakistani man told the report’s authors: “Today police came. They take my tent. In two days, I sleep maximum two hours. It’s too much difficult. The mind is not working, the brain stops working. All the refugees are so afraid now.”In October 2016 a huge semi-permanent camp in Calais, home to around 8,000 refugees, was demolished in a move by the French government to remove migrants from its northern coast."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5bf3c9d8db1edbe7be326b45090b10b5a6bcf3c/0_137_4203_2522/master/4203.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6892f6434d3b120c092f237d3c261b6","title":"bringing big tech to heel how do we take back control of the internet","story":"As the web evolves, we should ask how we can maximise its benefits for all and mitigate the obvious damageWhen new technology destroyed their livelihood in the early 19th century, a group of workers in northern England took matters into their own hands. They were alpha males, the fittest of the farm workers with the best gig of their time: whacking and cutting sheets of woven wool into shape and then “cropping” the rough surface to make it smooth enough to become stockings for the aristocracy.It was high-yield, value-added work, earning them three times the average wage for half the time on the job. But when mechanical stocking frames were developed that could do the job six times faster, they found themselves surplus to requirements. What work remained was paid less, the hours were longer, and production had moved indoors, leaving workers “stunted, enfeebled and depraved”.The first attack came in a village called Bulwell. A group of croppers broke into a house and smashed up the offending stocking frames. They called themselves “Luddites”, a whimsical reference to a folktale about a young cropper who, when beaten by his master, retaliated by destroying his frame. The whole thing went viral. Attacks spread from town to town under cover of darkness, the croppers destroying the technology that was robbing them of their livelihood.Contrary to legend, the Luddites were not opposed to the new technology. What they wanted was a fairer distribution of the profits from the industrialists and a more gradual take-up of the machinery to give them time to learn new trades. It was the breach of the social contract rather than the introduction of the new machines that fuelled the resistance. All the Luddites wanted was a planned and fair transition rather than transformative change with no regard for the consequences.The Luddites were ultimately crushed, but their resistance sparked a fire that ignited in newly formed guilds and trade unions demanding workers’ rights. They would also inspire the Chartist movement that demanded universal suffrage and in turn compelled John Edward Taylor to establish the . These waves of activism would secure the Factory Acts that were passed between 1833 and 1853 regulating child labour, mandating regular safety inspections and establishing a 10-hour working day. These laws took the crueller edges off the disruption of the first industrial revolution and created a social safety net for the fairer distribution of wealth through higher wages and better conditions – benefits that would flow to workers for the next two centuries.From our vantage point, this arc from the stocking frames of the Luddites to the Factory Acts makes total sense: a transformative technological change, its adaptation unfettered by regulation, and then the demand for a collective response as the implications of those changes become clearer.The evolution of the web is following a similar arc. Where we are now asking ourselves how we can assert some sort of control to both maximise the benefits and mitigate the damage that is becoming increasingly apparent. Across the globe, the mood for some sort of intervention is palpable. After nearly two decades of believing that the role of government was to facilitate the web and then get out of the way, people are demanding it steps up on their behalf. In response, many western governments are taking their first tentative steps to place rules around the web and the way it interacts with and influences their societies. After all, that’s what government is supposed to do.In the US, the shock of the Trump victory has led to scrutiny of the role social networks and data breaches played in distorting the 2016 election outcome. In April 2018 Facebook’s chief, Mark Zuckerberg, was called before the US Senate to justify how his company pocketed money from Russian troll farms to boost fake news content and then enabled Trump’s data farmers, Cambridge Analytica, to scrape and exploit millions of its users’ profiles. Zuckerberg’s heavily scripted mea culpa was washed away with a global advertising campaign asserting that “data misuse is not our friend”, while clinging to the conceit that Facebook is nothing more than a humble platform. But that facade is cracking: Germany has brought in rules that regard social media companies as publishers with obligations to remove illegal content within 24 hours, including content that breaches anti-discrimination and anti-harassment laws.Others are going further and arguing that the big tech companies need to be broken up in the public interest. With Facebook and Google appropriating the distribution of news and advertising, Apple dominant in hardware and Amazon’s products enjoying a privileged position on its retail platform, laws that were designed to curb the big winners of the industrial revolution are back under the microscope.The so-called gilded age of the late 19th century in the US saw a concentration of power in the hands of robber barons whose control of railroads, steel production and oil extraction was deemed to be damaging to the nation’s economy. This led to the anti-trust laws that gave the government the power to break up the largest monopolies in the public interest. These laws have been whittled away over the past 50 years but some observers, including Tim Berners-Lee, argue the tech behemoths should, at the very least, be required to make their proprietary software and data publicly available.In Australia, tentative steps and missteps are being made to bring the tech giants to heel. In late 2018 the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission recommended a specialist authority be set up with the power to oversee the way Google and Facebook use their algorithms to reinforce their market dominance of the media. At year’s end, federal parliament was locked in a separate debate about the state’s power to access encrypted communications that will set ground rules around the sovereignty of private online domains. The outcome of arguments pitting national security against web freedom will help define the evolving relationships between the state and the web.The most promising theatre of regulation, though, is emerging around our personal information. Data is the wild west of the digital world with its near infinite capacity to capture, record and monitor iniduals and store that information. Everything we buy, everyone we interact with, everywhere we go, and even the abstractions and predictions that algorithms make about us based on that information can be captured and exploited.In July 2018 the Australian Human Rights Commission began the Human Rights and Technology Project, exploring technological change and its effect on human rights. Central is the inidual’s right to privacy and control over how their data is collected and used. To the extent they exist, current rules focus on the idea of consent, that we allow a site to access and use our data by accepting its terms and conditions, which are typically couched in legal jargon that we never actually read, linked to a click-box that we have no option but to click. Acquiescence to these permissions has become the price of entry to many parts of the web, particularly when the platform offers something for free.The project will reference the world-leading Global Data Protection Regulation developed by the European Union. Under the regulation, the idea that you control your data footprint has been accepted and embedded with privacy protocols placing enforceable rules on how corporations harvest and then monetise personal information. Protections include the right to be unknown and the right to be able to delete your personal records from a business that is holding them. It also includes rights for portability of data allowing, for instance, a user to take their data with them when they change banks, obligations on a business to delete a customer’s records when the customer takes their business elsewhere, as well as stringent data-handling protocols. Adopting these principles in Australia would be a significant step towards taking responsibility for the way the digital economy affects our privacy.But it is still an inherently reactive stance, focusing on mitigating the damage of data use rather than imagining how people could actually take ownership of their digital footprint. The natural extension of notions of control and consent is the more radical idea that we should legally own our data and that anyone else who wants to use it should pay us for the privilege. In a world where data is a natural resource on the web and data-mining is a global growth industry, iniduals could have a claim for a payment on the value derived from its use. The inidual transactions would be tiny but, taken at scale and aggregated globally, the concept of data rights could become a way of redistributing the profound concentration of online-derived wealth we are witnessing today.In a world where this data is used to develop algorithms that ultimately replace many of our jobs, some value could be returned to us via inidual accounts constantly topped up with these micro royalty payments. Just as a writer has rights over her words or a composer over his music, why shouldn’t the digital footprint we create be our property?It’s a philosophical question with profound implications. Given the state of copyright, where big tech argues any assertion of intellectual property stifles creativity, this is a challenging proposition. But the Global Data Protection Regulation’s assertion that iniduals should have control over their data provides a starting point for the next contest of ideas.This is an edited extract of Peter Lewis’s Webtopia: The world wide wreck of tech and how to make the net work (New South, $32.99)"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/05/17/TELEMMGLPICT000147339863_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"judges given new expenses policy telegraph discovers judiciary","story":"The Ministry of Justice approved expenses including shampoo and crockery.  Lord Chief Justice, Lord Ian Burnett, pictured, claimed for multiple journeys to and from his homeMinistry of JusticeThe judiciary are to be given a new expenses policy after The Daily  found that Britain\u0027s most senior judges have claimed for crockery, shampoo and a taxi to transport ceremonial robes on taxpayer-funded expenses.Expenses data released under the Freedom of Information Act shows how some of the most high-profile members of the judiciary in England and Wales have had claims for everyday items as well first-class trains approved, even though they receive a salary of at least £180,000.At present, judges are encouraged to follow the expenses policy for Ministry of Justice (MOJ) civil servants, and the judiciary has also set out specific guidance relating to travel, accommodation and relocation....To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Ministry of JusticeDonald Trump announces two-week delay on planned family deportation raidsMinistry of Defence appoints first female Chief Scientific AdviserMPs urge Boris Johnson to guarantee Brexit on October 31Theresa May reigns in education \u0026#39legacy\u0026#39 spending from £27m to £9m after outrage from MPsDozens of army instructors have been \u0026#39accused of abusing recruits since 2015\u0026#39, new figures revealBoris Johnson row: The couple next door passionate about their opposition to ToriesJeremy Hunt pledges to save high street with business rates cutComment: UK needs a leader who will stand up for Brexit      Comment: Boris Johnson has his faults, but he is the only one who can deliver Brexit Next Prime Minister should lift constraints on public spending to fund social care like the NHS, report findsJohn McDonnell pledges to install a Bank of England governor who is \u0026#39in tune\u0026#39 with his ideasBBC editorial director \u0026#39unfairly portrayed\u0026#39 in new Keira Knightley film about Iraq war leakMadonna\u0026#39s tour ambition is frozen out by La Scala as Queen of pop says \u0026#39they don\u0026#39t want me\u0026#39Do not treat prostitutes as criminals, say police chiefsLife in Avis Crocombe\u0026#39s Victorian kitchen proves a recipe for YouTube stardomRAF jets intercept Jet2 flight after passenger \u0026#39assaults\u0026#39 people on boardLeft-wing neighbours admit to taping Boris Johnson row with girlfriend Carrie SymondsParents of hacker facing 65 years in US jail warn he was \u0026#39groomed\u0026#39 playing \u0026#39lethal\u0026#39 Minecraft video gameRSPCA hardline faction behind move for charity to lobby for ban on angling and horse-racingScotch whisky s roll out the barrel with a twist of tequila\u0026#39Dayhab\u0026#39 clinics to offer new way to treat alcohol and drug addictionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"expenses podcast lone campaigner took whole parliament","story":"Journalist and freedom of information campaigner, Heather BrookeTucked away in the back of New Labour’s 1997 manifesto is a promise.

political thriller Official Secrets is tipped as this year’s most anticipated British movie.But, the story about Katharine Gun, a GCHQ translator, leaking a devastating memo showing the US asked British intelligence to spy on the United Nations in the run up to the Iraq War has proven uncomfortable viewing for one senior BBC executive.Kamal Ahmed, the BBC’s editorial director and former business and economics editor, is understood to feel upset he has been cast as “the villain”.Ahmed’s character, played by Ray Panthaki, is based on Ahmed’s time as political editor at The Observer.To

If it was an Islamic state, I wouldn\u0027t have left.The main reasons I left the so-called Islamic State is because they started to kill people I know them personally that are Muslims.I had a group of about 20 friends that all left the so-called Islamic State. They all left at one time. One by one, they started to kill them.Jack Letts in Raqqa, SyriaLetts said that he was caught as he tried to escape the border into Turkey after expecting safe passage through Al Nusra-Front territory.He said: They would help us leave. They would get us a smuggler. Nusra Front not great guys, but they\u0027re a lot more trustworthy than the Free Syrian Army.Letts\u0027 commented on his mental heath, claiming that he was diagnosed with Tourette\u0027s and severe obsessive compulsive disorder.The convert left his middle-class home in Oxford to become one of IS\u0027 most notorious recruits before his eventual capture.Now, after languishing in prison for two years, Letts said that he regretted becoming the poster boy for Islamic extremism.He said: That\u0027s one of the things that I regret I realised that me coming had a lot more meaning than a Syrian becoming ISIS.Jack Letts in Kurdish jailSpeaking about his time in solitary confinement, he said: You wouldn\u0027t be able to sit with me like this. You\u0027d say I\u0027m insane.  Letts faces being barred from returning to the UK under rules that allow Sajid Javid, the Home Secretary, to strip him of his citizenship provided it would not make him stateless.   I\u0027ve repented from what I did, and it\u0027s not important in a sort of legal sense, but that\u0027s why I left. I realized what I did was wrong, religiously and also in a moral sense, he added.There\u0027s a feeling of stress and there\u0027s a feeling of regret. Regret without result. ... we\u0027re just being left like dogs. Donald Trump announces two-week delay on planned family deportation raidsMinistry of Defence appoints first female Chief Scientific AdviserMPs urge Boris Johnson to guarantee Brexit on October 31Theresa May reigns in education \u0026#39legacy\u0026#39 spending from £27m to £9m after outrage from MPsDozens of army instructors have been \u0026#39accused of abusing recruits since 2015\u0026#39, new figures revealBoris Johnson row: The couple next door passionate about their opposition to ToriesJeremy Hunt pledges to save high street with business rates cutComment: UK needs a leader who will stand up for Brexit      Do not treat prostitutes as criminals, say police chiefsMadonna\u0026#39s tour ambition is frozen out by La Scala as Queen of pop says \u0026#39they don\u0026#39t want me\u0026#39Comment: Boris Johnson has his faults, but he is the only one who can deliver Brexit Next Prime Minister should lift constraints on public spending to fund social care like the NHS, report findsJohn McDonnell pledges to install a Bank of England governor who is \u0026#39in tune\u0026#39 with his ideasLife in Avis Crocombe\u0026#39s Victorian kitchen proves a recipe for YouTube stardomBBC editorial director \u0026#39unfairly portrayed\u0026#39 in new Keira Knightley film about Iraq war leakRAF jets intercept Jet2 flight after passenger \u0026#39assaults\u0026#39 people on boardParents of hacker facing 65 years in US jail warn he was \u0026#39groomed\u0026#39 playing \u0026#39lethal\u0026#39 Minecraft video gameRSPCA hardline faction behind move for charity to lobby for ban on angling and horse-racingLeft-wing neighbours admit to taping Boris Johnson row with girlfriend Carrie SymondsScotch whisky s roll out the barrel with a twist of tequila\u0026#39Dayhab\u0026#39 clinics to offer new way to treat alcohol and drug addictionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/06/22/TELEMMGLPICT000201360885_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqwD2sfO9joeQ6RY-qlTATNB2cSHopZMn-aCc647VHTAY.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"madonnas tour ambition frozen la scala queen pop says dont want","story":"Madonna has had her request to perform at Milan’s Teatro alla Scala during her forthcoming world tour politely turned down. It is one of the most prestigious opera houses in the world, having featured the greatest practitioners of the art of the human voice - from Caruso to Callas, Pavarotti to Kiri Te Kanawa.

who was also involved with a failed witchhunt of Sun journalists – has revealed he was paid up to £ an hour by Mishcon de Reya.Mishcon was one of three law firms that brought the legal challenge to Theresa May’s Brexit plans in the High Court this week.Starmer, , was elected as a Labour MP for Holborn and St Pancras in May last year – a role which pays £,.Between June and the end of September this year he was paid £, by Mishcon de Reya for  hours of “legal advice” - a rate of £ per hour.Late last year he earned £, offering legal advice to the law firm for  hours – or £ an hour.He also revealed a payment of £, on May , , for work carried out before he became an MP.He lives in a £million house in North London with solicitor we Victoria, , and their two young children. He also co-owns a house in Surrey.Mishcon de Reya first hired him in  as a part-time consultant for its business crime unit.He quit client work for the firm in April , but was reappointed as a consultant to its in-house academy in June this year.The MP stood down from that role after being appointed to the shadow cabinet last month.Starmer is the third key figure from the lacklustre £.m Operation Elveden witchhunt of Sun reporters to be employed by Mishcon de Reya.His former principal legal adviser at the Crown Prosecution Service Alison Levitt and former politan police assistant commissioner Sue Akers – who headed the bungled investigation – have also done work for the firm.This week Starmer refused to apologise after reporter Anthony France had his conviction overturned - meaning not one of  Sun journalists arrested were convicted.A spokeswoman for the law firm said: “Keir Starmer was a consultant to the Mishcon Academy, our in-house centre for learning and development.“The role did not involve client advice on any issue. Keir resigned as a consultant to the academy when he was appointed to the Shadow Cabinet.”A spokesman for Starmer’s office said: “MPs are required to register and declare fees received since the May  election even where those fees were earned before the election.“The register makes it very clear that in the case of Keir Starmer, the vast majority of his declared earnings represent payment for work undertaken by him as a lawyer before he became MP.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He’s just done so again.People who want a second vote on Brexit should go and live in North Korea, he said. Meaning that they had no time for democracy.Gallagher — like almost every bloody pop musician — backed Remain in the ­referendum. But he said: “There’s only one f***ing thing worse than a fool who voted for Brexit. That’s the rise of the c***s trying to get the vote overturned.”His message, then, to the relentlessly moaning Remainers who have tried every trick in the book to get that democratic decision overturned is: Don’t look back in anger — get on with your lives and let Brexit happen.As we decided it must.And here’s the thing. I suspect most Remainers think exactly the same. The people I know who voted Remain were saddened by the referendum result and they wished we’d all voted dferently.But they all believe that the vote must be upheld. And there should not be a second vote.And when I talk to them, they don’t call me a Nazi or a fascist for voting Leave.They don’t suggest I’m too thick to be allowed to vote or that I hate all foreigners.They just agree to dfer on that simple issue of in or out, and there’s no bad ­feeling at all.This is the thing. The politicians and commentators insist Brexit has ­brutally ided the nation. That the wounds will take a long time to heal. That we’re all at each other’s throats. The .million versus the .million.It’s not so at all. The only real ide is between the four or five million Remain voters who simply won’t have it — and the rest of the country.A lot has been written about the people who voted Leave — most of it codswallop.“It was just the poor and the left-behind, the uneducated and the ­xenophobes.”The statistics simply don’t bear that out.People of all walks of le, all levels of education, all ages and all ­backgrounds voted Leave.This is not, however, true of that hardcore of Remainers, between a quarter and a third of that million, who demand we run the vote again.They are insulated from the normal world. When they say they don’t know anyone who voted Leave, they’re telling the truth.They work in professions where ­virtually nobody voted Leave.In our ­universities , in schools , and among luvviesand scientists .And the BBC — I don’t have figures for the BBC but I would guess it’s close to  per cent for Remain.This is the real ide. Between a ­liberal middle-class elite who simply do not understand the hopes and aspirations of the rest of us. And react with absolute fury when they don’t get their own way.When Brexit is over, one way or another, that liberal elite will still be with us, utterly out of touch with the rest of the country.That’s the ide that matters today. A small minority determined to inflict their liberal policies upon the rest of us.THE BBC shoved an imam from Gloucester on to its Tory leadership debate programme and has now had to apologise.Abdullah Patel asked questions of the candidates about anti-Muslim bigotry in their party. Turns out he’s been accused of plenty of bigotry himself.A whole bunch of social media posts from Patel attacking Israel and praising Corbyn were uncovered. There were “Zionists” hiding behind the Holocaust, a suggestion that Israel should be transported to the centre of the US and so on. The usual stuff.None of it surprised me – and he’s not alone in pushing this view. Is it any wonder anti-semitism is now so entrenched in the Labour Party, and in our country Bob lived in Zimbabwe. Bob was standing in the middle of a road at night when a car hit him.The car cartwheeled, killing both of the people in it. They were rhino-horn smugglers – scumbags who kill rhinos so the valuable horns can be sold in powder form to sad Chinese men who can’t get a stfy.Anyway, Bob’s now dead. But his le was not given in vain.Thank you, Bob.THE latest social media trend is the bubble-tea selfie. Japanese girls take photos of themselves with a carton of the sugary drink nestled between their baps.Nope, I don’t know why.The craze is spreading west, too.People have been seen doing it in Thailand and Vietnam.Will it reach here Well, it’s got to navigate its way through Pakistan, Iran and Saudi Arabia – so I wouldn’t bet on it.THE Breakthrough Listen Project was a massive scheme using millions of computers.It was dedicated to finding intelligent extra-terrestrial le. It has found . . . nothing. Just light year after light year of utter silence.I think it’s time we accustomed ourselves to the fact there’s nothing out there and we’re all alone. The rest of the universe is cold, silent and devoid of intelligent le. Just like Canada.IT’S a shame to see Rory Stewart crashing out of the Conservative leadership race.Not because I agree with him about anything – I don’t. I’d just thought it was high time we had a PM whose real Christian name is Roderick.If people called Roderick ran the country we wouldn’t be in the mess we are now.Sure, Mr Stewart doesn’t use “Roderick”.He’s shortened it to “Rory” in order to sound more dashing and maybe a bit Celtic. Big mistake.Be proud of your given Christian name, Roderick Stewart. It means great ruler.

It will be a shiny new global currency for the st Century, taking on the dollar and the Pound.But I’m not fooled. I think we all know what Facebook is really up to.This is yet another way to harvest data about our financial habits which it can then use for targeted marketing. Critics are already calling it the “most invasive and dangerous form of surveillance ever designed”.Collecting and exploiting information about us is, after all, the whole reason for the company’s existence.Years ago it was basic stuff, like quizzes asking, “What kind of personality type are you ”Fill that in and you are practically begging to be ­targeted in marketing and ­political campaigns. But handing over our spending details is quite another matter.This may be spun as ­connecting the world and ­revolutionising payments but it is really all about tapping the modern-day version of oil — the wells of data.Facebook already knows who you are. Accept Libra and it will know what you are buying, who you’re paying and how much you have.Will it be regulated by the UK Financial Conduct Authority, as banks are in this country  Certainly, the company has not shown much desire for regulation so far — of which more later.But what do we know about how trustworthy, secure or morally sound this would-be money broker is The Cambridge Analytica scandal, where data from million users was shared with political consultants, led to a fine of £, by ­Britain’s Information ­Commissioner’s Office.Last September the company admitted that data from million of its users had leaked due to a security flaw.In  it failed to stop the live broadcast of the torture of a disabled man in Chicago. It has also refused to take down neo-Nazi content.Facebook is under criminal investigation by US prosecutors who are looking into data-sharing deals with, among other, Amazon and Apple. It has been caught out farming data from apps whose users might have been unaware they were feeding information to Facebook.The company was found to be harvesting the dates of female users’ periods via an app which tracked ovulation.Facebook has also been accused of doing little to protect ­vulnerable children from ­promotions of self-harm. British father Ian Russell has directly linked Facebook-owned Instagram to the suicide of his -year-old daughter, Molly.Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg refused to attend the UK ­Parliament’s committee on ­disinformation and “fake news” last year, amid concern the social media giant is ­positioning itself as a news publisher but without ­compliance with any of the regulation or laws governing traditional journalism.The  has been blamed for spreading hatred. In March this year an ­Australian white supremacist live-streamed on Facebook his massacre of  people at two New Zealand mosques.It has further been accused of putting IS terrorists in touch with each other via its “suggested friends” application.When challenged as to why it does not do more to tackle ­terrorism, it falls back on the explanation that it does not have the technology to watch what its .billion users are doing all the time.Yet somehow that does not seem to stop it farming commercially valuable data from our accounts.The same will no doubt turn out to be true about Libra. This week French finance ­minister Bruno Le Maire warned that the cryptocurrency would inevitably be used by terrorists and criminals to sht money around undetected.When it happens, Facebook will no doubt shrug its corporate shoulders once more and say it is powerless to stop it.In theory, the very complex nature of cryptocurrencies means that it should be near impossible for anyone to steal our money.But we have all heard the horror stories. The best-known cryptocurrency, ­Bitcoin, ­at first soared in value, ­making millions for people who latched on to it early. But  months ago it crashed.Of course, most of us like to shop on the internet — and e-commerce is only likely to grow in the coming years.But most of us do it with our bank cards or direct from accounts which hold our money in a ­currency which is backed by the central bank of a First World country.This means we can be ­reasonably sure the currency won’t ­suddenly disappear or become valueless. It is quite another matter doing business in a currency that is backed by internet firms.How can we be sure that Facebook will still be around in a few years’ time Of course, banks sometimes go bust, but at least we have some protection in the form of the Government’s financial services compensation scheme which will refund up to £, of savings in the event of a failure.Facebook claims Libra will be backed by an independent foundation in Switzerland and will be free from the kind of speculation that drove the value of Bitcoin, because its value will be linked to a basket of currencies.But I’m sorry, I’m just not buying it. I’m sticking with sterling when I do my online shopping.It might not be very exciting but I feel confident it will still be around well when Libra, and Facebook, have long ago ­disappeared. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They feel Hunt is the ideal opponent.He voted Remain in , he has been in Cabinet throughout Theresa May’s premiership with its Brexit failures and he is a mild-mannered figure who struggles to impose himself on debates.One Boris backer jokes that they have never seen, “a more lop-sided two-horse race”.The Hunt campaign bristle at the idea that this is going to be a walkover.They believe he has a route to victory by playing on Tory members’ concerns about whether Boris can actually do the job of being PM.They also think they will do well with the large Scottish membership — Scots are twice as likely to be members of the Tory party than the English — and are planning an early campaign trip there.They expect to pick up the endorsement of Ruth Davidson, the popular leader of the Scottish Conservatives.But for all Jeremy Hunt’s efforts to make this a contest, it is still Boris Johnson’s to lose. Of course, he could. He could make a spectacular gaffe or some scandal could blow up.Last night’s revelations of the screaming match at the flat he shares with his new partner shows the scrutiny that his le is going to come under.If he can get through the next fortnight without any major blunders, he’ll become Tory leader.Why  Because the postal votes go out from July  and most Tory members willthem within two days.As one Tory veteran explains: “A week after the ballots have gone out, it is too late to change anything.”I understand Boris will use the next weeks to set out his Brexit position in more detail.Those hoping to see him in full entertainer mode at these hustings will be disappointed. Instead, he intends to stick to the serious persona of the past few weeks.One of those preparing him for the month tells me that Tory members “know he can do Boris. They need to see him do Prime Minister.”This new, more serious approach won’t stop the attacks.Boris’s critics have lost their judgement and want to attack him as a homophobe, despite the fact he was one of the first politicians to back gay marriage. Just as absurdly, they want to smear him as a racist.Oddly, these attacks actually create a problem for Jeremy Hunt.The more ridiculous the criticism Boris faces, the more Tory activists will rally to him. This will make it harder for Hunt to get a hearing for his far more measured criticisms of Boris.All of these hustings will be broadcast on the internet. I understand the Boris campaign were not best pleased about this, which suggests they still have some concerns about their candidate slipping up.But even in this age of political upsets, it is hard to believe that Boris Johnson won’t be the winner of this contest.EDDIE Lister is to run the transition team that will prepare Boris Johnson’s governing programme.Lister, chief of staff for Boris when he was Mayor of London, will take charge of this process and the working assumption is that having done this, he will move to No as chief of staffBoris becomes PM.Crucially, Boris knows and trusts Lister. In his successful stint at City Hall, Lister showed that he knew how to bring order to Boris world – which is no mean feat.One of those close to the decision tells me: “Boris has made the biggest shout, who is your number one man  It is Eddie.” The need for order is urgent.If Boris enters Downing Street, he’ll only have  days until October , the day by which he has promised Britain will be out of the EU. He won’t have any time to lose.Intriguingly, I understand that Sajid Javid – who was knocked out of the leadership race on Thursday – was interested in doing this role.But the Johnson camp wanted whoever ran the transition to become the Downing Street chief of staff. A key challenge for Lister will be to make sure there is a clear structure.Boris has always liked having multiple sources of advice.As one of those who has known him for years observes: “There are going to be lots of dferent courts, lots of people competing for the monarch’s ear – and he quite likes that.”But this source warns that, “as a recipe for government, it could be quite fractious”.It is Lister’s job to make sure there is a clear chain of command.I understand that the spoilt ballot papers weren’t covered in graffiti, but simply left blank.“THE problem is the ,” says one of those preparing Boris for government.The  is a reference to those Tory MPs who voted for Rory Stewart before his elimination from the leadership contest.If only a fraction of this group decides to try to bind Boris Johnson’s hands on Brexit, then the Government could collapse.One of Boris’s closest allies warns that, “It is going to be really problematic, there is going to be a Remainer counterweight to the ERG”, the group of hardline Brexiteer MPs.To the alarm of Boris’ allies, Rory Stewart is uninterested in serving in a Boris Cabinet. Instead, he is setting himself up as an alternative voice on the backbenches.Stewart and his supporters have to remember, though, that a Corbyn government would be worse for this country than any Brexit outcome.The problem for Boris Johnson is that his Brexit strategy relies on MPs giving him time to seehe can use the threat of No Deal to winkle a concession out of the EU.The only chance of these  MPs giving him this time isthey think it is a bluff.“They have to believe it is a bluff, the ERG have to believe it is for real,” con- cedes one Boris ally.Pulling this off is going to be a political high-wire act.BORIS Johnson and Michael Gove have spoken since Gove’s elimination.I’m told the conversation wasn’t substantive but wasn’t rancorous, despite the tactical voting by Johnson supporters that led to Gove being knocked out.In the next few weeks Gove will get on with departmental business. He’ll introduce “Natasha’s law” for clearer labelling of allergens in products, named after Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, who died after eating a Pret sandwich, and increased sentences for those who abuse animals.I am told that it is “not settled one way or the other” whether Prime Minister Boris would keep Gove at the Environment department or offer him a bigger job. But given the scale of the challenges facing theTories, it would be foolish to not put their most talented departmental minister in one of the great offices of state.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She said everyone knows such photos can be hi- jacked and used to threaten and embarrass.I am sure that Whoopi meant well but it all backfired when an emotional Bella posted a video saying how upset she was at being “shamed” by the presenter and actress, — calling her actions “sick and disgusting”.I find it utterly baffling that Bella was more distressed by the words of a middle-aged woman who had her best interests at heart than the saddo who tried to embarrass her by releasing nude photos on to the internet for all the world to see.It’s a great shame this has now escalated into a row between the two women, because I truly admire Bella for how she has handled the whole potential blackmailing situation.It was a masterstroke and instantly took all the power away from the snivelling little git who was hassling her. Bella was not ashamed or embarrassed by the intimate pictures and would not be held to ransom. Good for her.But surely it was far more upsetting to be the victim of a potential crime than receiving a slight scolding from Whoopi for being naive enough to take and keep those sorts of images in the first place.Bella had a right old rant on Instagram and has vowed never again to appear on The View — a chat show co-hosted by Whoopi which is the US version of our Loose Women.I feel very sorry for Bella because she was clearly extremely upset by what Whoopi had to say but I think her anger is misplaced.Whoopi was makIng a really important point, which affects everyone, not only those in the public eye.She was speaking for worried parents of teenagers and twentysomethings everywhere who are concerned that online photos of their children getting drunk, posing nude or even having sex will come back to haunt them.It is one of the real dangers of social media that our accounts are not really secure. they can be hacked with relative ease, falling out of “the cloud” and on to your boss’s Facebook — or, even worse, getting viewed by your mum and dad.There are people who think it is a jolly wheeze to post explicit photographs of former lovers online, or who do it as “revenge” for being dumped.Of course, there are those who have no common sense and post pictures of themselves romping in hotel rooms with girlfriends or boyfriends or boozily feeling each other up on holiday.The authorities are now cracking down. Last August, a man who hacked into hundreds of iCloud accounts of Hollywood actresses and leaked their nude pictures was sentenced to eight months in prison.George Garofano stole private photographs from movie stars including actresses Jenner Lawrence and Kirsten Dunst. It was horribly distressing for these women and I completely sympathise.However, the ease with which that slimy toad was able to access personal images proves thatyou don’t want to have potentially embarrassing photos put out there, then don’t take them in the first place — or just press the delete button.Maybe even go back to the Dark Ages, invest in a Polaroid camera and keep your naughty pictures under lock and key. The hackers are vile, but let us not give them the ammunition. And take heed of the advice from wise women such as Whoopi.I SINCERELY hope the latest rumours from the troubled set of the new Bond film prove to be without foundation.It’s being claimed that the film’s director, Cary Fukunaga, held up cast and crew during a complicated shoot because he was playing video games on his PlayStation.Apparently the production crew and actors were not amused at having to hang about for three hours because Cary wanted to play with his toys. I don’t blame them.I cannot believe someone would be so inconsiderate to fellow professionals.I was, however, more aghast at finding out Cary isn’t a spotty teenage geek, but a -year-old man.Surely he should have outgrown PlayStation by now – especially when he is already in charge of the world’s best video game, involving Aston Martin car chases, shootouts, beautul women and dastardly villains.WILLIAM and Kate showed how royals should react when their lestyle causes harm to a member of the public.Widow Irene Mayor, , was hit by a police motorbike escorting the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to Windsor Castle. She is in hospital with serious injuries.As soon as Wills and Kate found out, they sent flowers and a hand-written note and have told Irene’s family they want to visit her whenever she is ready.I HAVE never watched Love Island. So it’s odd to see images and videos of strange, orange people with impossibly white teeth, like Molly-Mae Hague on my online news feeds and splashed across magazines when I haven’t a blinking clue who they are.And it is utterly bizarre that they all look and sound exactly alike.To be honest,I really need to see fit youngsters strutting around, uttering meaningless sounds and having sex, I will tune into a David Attenborough documentary.THE Fab Five presenters on makeover show Queer Eye are making the world a better place – one scruffy, messed-up person at a time.Makeovers are hardly a new concept but this series does much more than give someone a new outfit and haircut.The hosts lovebomb shy misfits who ask for help, as well as big-hearted people who just neglect themselves – then change their lives for ever.It’s a show full of heart and soul and I blub during every episode.This week I met the British star of Queer Eye, delightful Tan France, from Doncaster. He had a hard time growing up in a world where he had no role models and he feels a huge responsibility to young gay Asian men such as himself.Tan and the Queer Eye boys feature in the video for Taylor Swt’s new single, You Need To Calm Down, with some of my favourite people including RuPaul and Ryan Reynolds.The song hits you over the head a bit with its inclusivity – no bad thing – but the Queer Eye boys do it better just by being themselves.I HAD to look twice at this gorgeous selfie posted by This Morning’s Alison Hammond.She’s glowing with confidence and happiness.After becoming the spokeswoman for a slimming club Alison has lost so much weight and looks stunning.She has talked about being “embarrassed” by weighing st. But I’m so glad she lost weight gradually with a healthy eating plan and doing exercise she loves.I wish Alison all the best with her battle towards being happier, healthier and fitter and I know she will have helped other women with their weight issues too.I BLOODY love Matt Lucas. The Little Britain star saw on Twitter that Amy Dunn was being bullied because she had lost her hair and was being derided as a “Matt Lucas lookalike”.The comedian immediately sent the -year-old a message of support telling her she was beautul and how flattered he was to be compared to her.Amy, who suffers from alopecia, has had people laughing and pointing at her in the street because she happens to have a condition that means she is bald.I hope having Matt on her side has cheered Amy up and given her the confidence to ignore the morons who hurled abuse, and maybe even feel sorry for them for being such ar**holes.Matt is right. Amy is beautul, and so is he.I’M very much liking the look of Beecham House, the new ITV drama set in th Century India that airs tomorrow night.The trails look sumptuous and now Poldark’s Aidan Turner has gone all grungy, leading man Tom Bateman is a most welcome piece of eye candy.Beecham House is on ITV tomorrow at pm.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But no matter how gorgeous the contestants, each one is revealed to be as fragile as the next.I think that is where our real fascination lies.Surely they should all be full of confidence, looking the way they do  And yet they seem to be just as insecure as the rest of us.I like the fact that the show is a portal into a generation to which I no longer belong.I’ve learned so much about how young men and women behave and, until Maura uttered the words, I didn’t even know it was possible to have “fanny flutters”.Another thing I like is the escapism. Surely it’s no coincidence that Love Island is at peak popularity during a time when the news is totally dominated with gloom, doom — and Brexit.Personally, I’m also intrigued by the fake hair and nails — and the very y process of getting ready for a night out. I’m luckyI put a comb through my hair.The amount of make-up they manage to get on to their faces is astonishing — although the irony is that the one girl all the guys seem to like, Lucie, is a surfer chick who doesn’t wear make-up.There is also a real cruelty to the show, though. There is always someone better, someone more chosen. The voting process is brutal and leaves all of the contestants anxious about whether or not people like them.This show strips people of everything that is important, other than their body. They are measured on what they look like and little .As a result, lots of people have questioned the damage caused to the mental health of the contestants.There have been more than , complaints to Ofcom about this series already.But there are good things about Love Island.While it’s not exactly the kind of equality that women have been fighting for over the past  years, there’s no denying that female members in the house are as free as the men to proposition members of the opposite sex.In my day, all we had was: “My mate fancies you.” But Maura said of one guy that he gave her “fanny flutters”.When my daughter Sophia was asked to go on the show, she thought it would be fun to be on a free holiday. You can see her point.But no mother wants to watch their child on Love Island. We all know there are plenty of things our kids do that we don’t know about — and that’s the way it should stay.But it’s not just that. One reason I enjoy being part of the Apprentice is because it celebrates young people for their skills, ambition and what they achieve.They know they aren’t being valued for their looks — they are being valued for so much more than that.That said, no one’s self- esteem should be based on how others value us.I’ve often thought that my biggest superpower is that I really don’t care what people think about me.When I’m on the beach I’m not bothered about which bits and pieces are jiggling.Why  Because there is so much more to me than what I look like in a bikini.Or, rather, as a footballer’s we once said to me: “All I’ve got is my looks — at least you’ve got your personality.”I know it was a back-handed compliment. But you know what, I’m fine with that.LOTTIE Moss said on social media that she feels “uncomfortable” with her weight at the moment – as she posted a picture of herself in a dress on a night out.My first thought was she’s going to look back at those photos when she is in her fties and wonder how she could have felt uncomfortable when she looked like this.My second was she can’t worry that much because the dress she’s wearing is almost completely see-through.BOSSES of the Isle of Wight Festival have been criticised by two mental-health charities for banning Jess Glynne for le after the singer cancelled her show at the last minute, owing to anxiety.Anxiety is a debilitating condition which blights the lives of many people.I’m sorry to hear that Jess is one of those people.But when she knows she suffers from this condition, her choice to stay out partying with the Spice Girls until am on the day she was due to perform seems, well, questionable.Having been out drinking all night before work is enough to make even the most level-headed person anxious.To then go on social media advertising that fact, before effectively phoning in sick to work, is also a tad foolish.By doing that, Glynne gave the impression she chose partying over a commitment – and that is not a good look.If we have one job to do as parents, it is to teach our kids the importance of doing the things that need to be done, when they need to be done, whether you like it or not.When I see a young person doing what they said they would do, despite challenges, I know they’ve got backbone.It’s called resilience, grit, determination, and it’s about being irrepressible. Those are some of the most admirable traits a person can have.Anxiety is awful but it’s certainly not helped by partying until the early hours of a work day.THIS week there has been good and bad news for Boris Johnson. The good news is that it looks ashe is going to be our next Prime Minister.The bad news is not that early-hours row with his partner – it’s his new haircut.He used to have “The Trump”, a sort of comb-forward that hid his balding. But his barber has cut it off and, instead of the long-haired blond bombshell look, he’s now a blond basin with thinning top.Boris, please take it from me, when you go into a hairdresser’s the first thing you do is check out the hairstyle of the person holding the scissors.Anyway, I guess it grows back – and soon will be the haystack it’s always been. Now all Boris needs is a new suit.OOPS! My heart goes out to the mum of the rampaging toddler at a Swiss art show who knocked over a sculpture of a fly worth £,.My main question, though, is how a plastic sculpture of a fly could be worth so much money Someone, somewhere, is having a laugh. Right I WAS trying to work out what was unusual about the recent photo of actor Rob Lowe on the red carpet.I realised it’s this. He is a handsome, successful star who is still with his we – Sheryl Berkoff – after  years without trading her in for a younger model.And they look happy.A rare sight in Hollywood, so good luck to both of them.TO be fair, Sofia Richie pretty much pulled it off when she sported the latest bicycle shorts onesie – the trend you prayed would never happen.But all I can say is, I’m glad I don’t follow fashion.WHAT’S in a word  You might think nothing much. And it’s a small thing in a way, but Sainsbury’s needs to be called out for assuming on its hair-removal product that all doctors are male.Its instructions say: “Consult your usual doctor and show him the packaging.”No doubt lots of people will respond by saying that us women are far too easily offended.But it is assumptions such as this behind the fact that, for every £ a man makes, a woman only makes p.We have to stamp out this unconscious bias by calling it out every time we see it.AMAZING that it’s  years since Friends hit our TVs.But judging by pictures of its stars Jenner Aniston, , and Courteney Cox, , on vacation in their bikinis, they still look fantastic.Even more amazing is that they are genuine friends.It just goes to show thatyou eat well, work out and look after yourself, you don’t have to be fat and flabby at .*Note to self – eat better and go to the gym. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Maybe unusual patches of skin or hair,” she explained.The contest is also about bringing attention to the needs of rescue dogs, with most competitors having been previously abandoned on streets or rescued from shelters.Gentry said: “What we’re really doing is we’re showcasing dogs that have been rescued and adopted and brought into loving homes.“These are sort of spokesdogs for adoption.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It gave spending powers to metro mayors, who now represent almost half the people who live there. But last year it emerged the Government tried to hide how infrequently a previous Northern Powerhouse minister visited. The Information Comm-issioner’s Office suggested “a strategy of wilful procrastination to obstruct a request for information.” "},{"url":null,"title":"brit expat refuses give up","story":"NewsBrit expat refuses to give up on Costa dream after gang run riot in luxury blockEXCLUSIVE: Defiant Linda Brown has been threatened with an axe and even hit in the eye by the squatters but insists she wont be driven out of her apartmentShareCommentsByScarlet Howes:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsLinda and Arlene say they feel like prisoners in their own home after squatters moved into their housing block in  \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRetired Linda Brown and her partner are the only Brits left at a retirement complex on the Costas after squatters turned it into “hell on earth” for residents. A former police sergeant, Linda, , says she has been threatened with an axe and hit in the eye after the gang – who possess at least one gun – seized control of the luxury flats. Expats who poured their savings into  homes have quit the once-smart block. Linda told the Sunday People: “This gang want me to move out too so they can turn the complex into their kingdom. I won’t let them win. I’ll fight them off.” Her ordeal began in  when a man and  kids broke into the Mirador El Pedrera block in Denia, a beautul Costa Blanca town  miles north of Benidorm. Several flats were unsold because the recession had deterred buyers. The travellers then claimed squatters’ rights and were followed by seven other clans, leaving a third of the complex illegally occupied. The gang’s leader, one of  brothers, was nicknamed The Chief by terried residents. Linda said his lackeys swagger around with ferocious dogs, soil the communal pool and torched a flat. A caretaker they allegedly beat up with baseball bats had to have an operation on both arms.    Linda added: “These people hurl rubbish in corridors. They’ve stolen windows in some flats and stripped others. Light fittings have been torn out and half the block is in darkness, yet they guard their flats with a pitbull. “This was once a beautul complex but now it’s a no-go area.” Linda bought the £, penthouse in  with partner Arlene Ashley, . She said: “We sank every penny into what we thought would be paradise. It was our dream – but out of the  properties bought at the time, we are the only ones left.” Other owners, five Brits and the rest German, have moved back to their homelands till the situation is resolved.To cap it all, each household is being billed £ a month in service charges to cover a shortfall left bythe invaders – who pay nothing while trashing the place.The owners must also cover all communal bills for the block, including a £, debt incurred by squatters stealing electricity and water.    Arlene said: “This is My Big Fat Gypsy Nightmare. We worked our whole lives for this and now it’s like being in a third world country. I’m sickened.” Linda said: “On two occasions some of the women have run around the block with axes, threatening me.” She also claimed two wives from the clans assaulted her after she asked for their karaoke machine, which was blaring out Spanish pop music, to be turned down. “It was siesta time, pm, and they were all around the swimming pool,” she said. “One woman hit me in the stomach and another smacked me in the eye.” She took them to court and is awaiting a verdict. Linda added that she sought talks with The Chief, real name Antonio, to calm the situation but in vain. She said: “The others see him as royalty. He comes out with a cane, yelling that it’s his kingdom.” Now she and Arlene, from Nottingham, are prisoners in their home. “We’re scared to leave in case the gang break in,” said Linda. The pair, who claim to suffer daily threats and abuse, have barricaded themselves in their fourth-floor apartment and sleep with the burglar alarm on. Linda said: “We’ve spent £, on security – with cameras installed, a metal gate to keep them out and a £-a-month bill for our own private lt. The squatters’ kids shout, ‘Kill Linda.’ They call me the devil and say the block is theirs now.” She told of seeing “exorcisms” by the invaders, while The Chief “chanted with a preacher to rid his we of demons”.    Linda went on: “He saw me and said I needed to get the demons out of me so I’d let THEM live in peace.” She said the louts have caused the whole town to suffer, explaining: “It used to be lively with expats but they don’t want to come here any more.” Fellow Brit Moira Wakeman, , told how her retirement in Denia has been “wrecked by the family from hell”. The former teacher said: “I moved here from London  years ago for peace and quiet but that has been ruined. We can’t even drink in our local bar. “We haven’t seen Linda in eight months as we won’t step into the area. We won’t go to her and she can’t come to us.” Expats Bill Smith, , and we Judy, , who came to Denia from Kent, said: “We nearly moved into that block because the flats were so lovely – but thankfully didn’t. We had a lucky escape.” Law-abiding families alleged one of the squatters has been pushing cannabis and cocaine, while another has been running a brothel. The travellers’ reign of terror forced a nearby bar to close last November and when a local resident complained her flat was trashed. Linda said: “We came here for a quiet le but this is hell on earth. “Many of our good friends have been scared off and a German couple were called Nazis until finally they fled. “We’ve tried the police but the Spaniards get tied up in red tape.”    Four evictions are said to have been rubber-stamped but not one squatter has been ordered out. Under Spanish law, police are unable to force entry to a propertya developer owns the land. Linda said: “We met the town’s mayor and head of security and both say they can’t help us because of the law. “I’ve called the police at the time of break-ins – but these people changed the lock straight away and showed the key to officers, who then just had to leave.” The town’s National Police spoke of their frustration, saying: “We have no power. “We’ve arrested many people living at the flats, one for assault on the caretaker, and also drugs. Squatters occupy more than  of the  flats but we need a court order to kick them out. Only the building’s owner can get that.” A company called JEPSA is supposed to maintain the complex, managed by Jesus Fermosa.    Linda said: “I threatened him with legal action for lack of security and it appears he has now started trying for court orders to get the squatters out.” Denia court clerk Alfredo Major said: “These families are here all the time. They’ve been arrested for assault, drugs and a fire. Spain has a huge crisis with squatters. They break into holiday homes, so everyone is affected.” Flats boss Mr Fermosa said last night: “I fear for my le with these people. I was attacked when I tried to cut off their electricity yesterday. They attempted to get in my car and chased me down the street. “Spanish bureaucracy is very slow and the law is not on our side. Police don’t have the authority to kick them out. We are doing everything we can.” "},{"url":null,"title":"baby dropped window caught neighbours","story":"NewsBaby dropped from window and caught by neighbours as family flee horric fireThe grandfather of the tot who was dropped to safety from a burning house fire in Wigan, said it doesnt bear thinking about what could have happenedneighbours had not been thereShareCommentsBySteve RobsonCharlotte Dobson:,  JUN NewsIt is believed the fire was caused by a chip pan being left on \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailNeighbours caught an -month old baby as she was dropped from the window during a horric house fire. A family-of-four were trapped inside the burning house in Hindley, Wigan, this morning, with neighbours gathering stepladders to try and rescue the family before firefighters arrived to the scene of the suspected chip pan fire. Screams of Help! could be heard by neighbours as they were woken by the noise of banging on an upstairs window. After firefighters arrived they immediately broke through the front door to rescue the mum, dad and a three-year-old girl who was still inside. It is understood both adults suffered only minor injuries and are being treated for burns and smoke inhalation. The little girl remains in a critical condition at Royal Manchester Childrenaposs Hospital.   Speaking about the incident, one neighbour, who asked not to be named, told the Manchester Evening News : The mum dropped the baby and we caught her in a blanket.I think it came from a washing line. Most of the street was out [trying to help].    Another neighbour then found some stepladders to put up to the window and smash it in an effort to get the mum and dad out. But unfortunately, smashing the window caused the fire to intensy as air rushed in. Once the window went through it was engulfed by smoke, an onlooker said. A mum told how she looked after the toddler thrown to safety before paramedics arrived. She was only tiny and she had soot coming out of her nose, the mum said. She had a bit of a cough. I was singing twinkle twinkle little star and was playing games with her. When youaposve got kids itaposs just an automatic reaction. When the ambulance came I walked her down and put her in. She wouldnapost keep her oxygen mask on.    The blaze was extinguished quickly but pictures at the scene on Saturday afternoon showed the end-of-terrace property has been left badly damaged. A tearful relative, the father of the young dad caught up in the fire, came to recover items and thank neighbours for their heroic actions. Thanks to those brilliant neighbours. If they hadnapost been there... it doesnapost bear thinking about, he said. The grandfather said his son had put on a chip pan in the early hours, but had then gone to comfort the baby upstairs and forgotten about it. Neighbours said it had been a frightening ordeal to witness. It wasnapost nice at all, one said. It was scary. Everyone is just relieved and wants to make sure the kids are all right. It could have been worse.    A spokesman for Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service said: We were called to a house fire on Haworth Street, Hindley at .am on Saturday. Two adults and two children were rescued from the property on arrival. The fire involved the front room on the ground floor of the terraced property. Firefighters were on the scene for two hours. All four people were taken to hospital in Wigan by North West Ambulance Service. Another man took himself to hospital with suspected smoke inhalation.

Haunting photos of the Westgate hotel, which used to a bustling hub of le in the heart of Newportaposs city centre, in Wales, show shattered glass, empty rooms and broken walls. Photos show an impressive ballroom with a partially collapsed ceiling, guest rooms with decor that dates back to the eighties and walls full of cracks and holes. The main staircase and richly decorated public rooms are amongst the best surviving examples of their period. The hotel, which shares many resemblances with the Overlook Hotel featured in The Shining, is famed for being the location of the Chartist Uprising in , the last large-scale armed rebellion against authority in Great Britain.  IIn ,  men were shot dead by the authorities outside the Westgate Hotel on Commercial Street during the uprising, Wales Online reports.Led by John Frost, the Chartists marched to Newport, fighting for better voting rights as per their six-point charter. And now the hotel, which closed in  is set to re-open for the launch of a Chartist-inspired graphic novel, Newport Rising. Dr Adam Coward, data enhancement assistant at the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales, said: The original building dates from , and was rebuilt to design of E. A. Lansdowne in  .    However, the modern hotel, built on the site in the late s, is rumoured to have retained pillars with bullet holes from the uprising in earlier in the century. Dr Coward added: The pillars, and the shot allegedly embedded in them, form something of a question in the records. Our and Glamorgan-Gwent Archaeological Trust’s argument that the pillars in question may still be the ones in place owing to the retention of the earlier Regency entrance does appear to have merit, especially as this description of the re-built building specically notes the retention of the old pillars and the bullet holes.    But while the pillars may be original, the alleged bullet hole appears to be just that. You will hear many people in Newport tell you that the holes inside the porch of the Westgate Hotel are Chartist bullet holes, said Oliver Blackmore, the collections and engagement officer at Newport Museum and Art Gallery. In reality, they are simple railing holes. The present Westgate Hotel was built some  years after the Newport Uprising. It is said that when the old Westgate Hotel was demolished, lead bullets were found embedded in the timbers that supported the porch. This probably gave rise to the present myth.    David Daniel, is the project development officer at Our Christ Heritage, the team who are fixing up the site for the launch of the graphic novel. After a tour of the impressive, dilapidated building, he said: The building was last in use, we believe, as Baltica night club in the early s. Prior to that it was Toad - I think was a nightclub hotel, before that itaposs kind of an unknown but certainly in the aposs and beyond it was in use as a main hotel in Newport Masonic meetings, wedding receptions, things like that. Over a period of time, there have been a ious refurbishments to the building. Thereaposs some damage to areas of the hotel, including the ballroom. It does still feature the legendary - some would say mythical - pillars with what some people say are bullet holes.   Andthis look inside the famous hotel has piqued your interest, you can visit the site from  July -  when the Our Chartist Heritage team are welcoming members of the public to view Chartist artwork. The Newport Rising graphic novel will be available to view and purchase here too."},{"url":null,"title":"jet2 plane passenger pinned down","story":"NewsJet plane passenger pinned down by other travellers after trying to storm cockpitA passenger on the LS Jet plane which ed to Stansted Airport in Essex after RAF Typhoons intercepted it on its way to Dalaman, Turkey, said one woman was \"drunk\" and \"tried to open the aircraft door\"ShareByBradley JollyOnline journalist:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video exclusive-jet-passenger-arrested-stanstead-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailDramatic footage captures police swoop on a young Jet passenger who allegedly tried to open the aircraft door mid-flight.

Sheree, , was told her baby, Carter Davidson, was in a critical condition just days after he was born and his chances of survival were slim. Carter, who is now five-months-old, was born at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy, Scotland, and weighed just six pounds. Hours before he was due to go home doctors noticed that his oxygen levels werenapost stable and he was admitted to the Special Care Baby Unit and given oxygen and antibiotics. Carter had multiple chest and heart X-rays but doctors did not know why he was so ill.Sheree, of Lochgelly, Fe, told the Daily Record : “When Carter was born he was beautul and content, but when he fell ill no one could tell me what was wrong with my son.“He just lay there with an oxygen mask on his face, so tiny and helpless. He looked pale andleless and I thought I was going to lose him. Feeling his little hands and feet through the incubator I wanted to take it away from him.”    Carter had worse to come. On February , the doctors had to tell Sheree her son’s condition had become critical. She recalled: “I got a call at am telling me Carter had crashed and he was needing a machine to breathe for him. “We were then escorted by police to Glasgow Children’s Hospital. “The journey was dreadful. I remember the paramedic telling me thatwe needed to pull over he’d do what he could to help Carter. I was terried. I thought I was going to lose my baby in the back of the ambulance.”    In Glasgow, cardiologists diagnosed Carter with a heart condition called Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Drainage, or TAPVD. The veins carrying blood to his heart from his lungs were not connected in the right place, and were pumping blood into the wrong chamber of the heart. The condition is thought to affect one in , babies. A major operation was Carter’s only slim chance.    Sheree recalled: “The surgeon told me that Carter was in a critical condition and the chances that he would survive were very low. “He was taken from me at pm and came out just after am. Those hours were the longest of my le.” Even after such a gruelling surgery, Carter wasn’t out of the woods. He also needed a heart bypass and blood transfusion before he left theatre, and his le was still very much in danger. Sheree said: “The surgeon said to prepare for the worst as he still might not survive the next few days. “When I saw him there were so many tubes, a ventilator, wires and drains all over him. “He was so swollen but I was just glad to see my baby again. I didn’t think I was ever going to see his big beautul blue eyes ever again.”    Carter spent  days in the  paediatric intensive care unit and was finally sent home in March. Sheree said: “We take every day as it comes and I hold him a little tighter every night. “He is a blessing. He is bright, thriving with energy. You wouldn’t think anything was wrong with him.

I kept thinking, ‘What the hell have they done to me’ ” Her daughter Lacie arrived safe and sound – and is now five. Lindsay and partner Martin already had son Harvey, now . He was born after a dficult pregnancy during which Lindsay developed pre-eclampsia.    The condition causes high blood pressure and swelling, with potentially further serious complications. Lindsay adds: “I had to deliver Harvey by C-section seven weeks early. I was in hospital two weeks and Harvey was in for five, because he was premature.” When Lindsay suffered pre-eclampsia again, while carrying Lacie, doctors warned a third pregnancy could put her le at risk. But Lindsay goes on: “I knew it would be risky. But I always wanted more children. It breaks my heart every time Harvey says, ‘Mummy are we going to have another brother or sister  I say, ‘No, we can’t’. It is a very hard operation to reverse and at my age, the chances of it working are slim to none.” Leeds NHS Trust acknowledged its “shortcomings” and said: “We have a more comprehensive approach to recording consent for patients, which fully adheres to legislation.” "},{"url":null,"title":"over 100 british army instructors","story":"NewsOver  British Army instructors accused of abusing recruits, drugs and pornEXCLUSIVE: At least  British Army instructors have been court-martialled or disciplined in the last four years for twisted \"hazing\" ceremonies and recruit abuseShareCommentsByDan WarburtonSean Rayment:,  JUN NewsA soldier launches a two-footed kick which sends a recruit with a heavy pack to the ground in phone footage that has sparked an inquiry by Forces chiefs\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMore than  Army instructors have been rapped for abuse of recruits and other misconduct.

Instructors were accused of putting soldiers through twisted “hazing” ­ceremonies as well as fighting, stealing, drug-taking and viewing child porn. The shock figures come just days after the end of an inquest into the death of Private Geoff Gray, , who was found with two gunshot wounds to his head at the notorious Deepcut training base.    Four young soldiers died at Princess Royal Barracks in Deepcut, Surrey, between  and  amid claims of abuse. Pte Gray’s father, also called Geoff, said: “I’m a firm believer in Army discipline. But it’s very sad that young, eager recruits are still being bullied despite assurances from the Ministry of Defence.” There are roughly , instructors across the UK – often veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan – who last year alone helped , recruits through training.

One recruit said members of his training platoon were made to parade in just their underwear and were verbally and physically abused.

The SBS commandos are experts in covertly removing mines from ships’ hulls. They will be supported by specialist Royal Navy ers, who are trained to defuse a wide range of mines. Tensions are soaring after the Iranian Revolutionary Guard was accused of attacking ships with mines and shooting down an American spy drone. Fears are growing that the US could slide into war with Iran after it was reported that President Trump said his forces were “cocked and loaded” for retaliatory action, before changing his mind with just  minutes to go.    The Special Boat Service frogmen can also launch underwater attacks against vessels, killing or capturing foreign troops attempting to sabotage shipping. Top defence sources said they could have Shallow Water Combat Submersibles, mini-subs used by UK and US special forces. The Pentagon accuses Iran of blasting two tankers in the Gulf after placing mines on them. On Wednesday Iran fired the first shot, downing a US drone with a surface-to-air missile. There are fears Iran may close the Strait of Hormuz by mining the  mile wide waterway or blocking it by sinking ships. A senior defence source said last night: “The SBS is being sent to the region as part of a deterrent. One of its roles will be to gather intelligence on Iranian mining operations. “It will work closely with Royal Navy ers who are the specialists at disarming mines and protecting shipping. “The SBS has a more aggressive role. Everyone is hoping that the tension will be eased and Iran will back down.” The SBS commandos, mainly recruited from the Royal Marines, complete the same selection course as the SAS and have recently seen action in Syria. The Defence Ministry said: “We don’t comment on special forces operations.” "},{"url":null,"title":"sick website targeting meghan markle","story":"NewsSick website targeting Meghan Markle and Harry refuses to remove race hate postsEXCLUSIVE: Vile extremist rants on US-based website Gab heap fresh torment on royal coupleShareCommentsByGrace Macaskill :,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsSick website targeting Meghan Markle and Harry refuses to remove race hate posts \"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A sick website on which Neo-Nazis made terrorist threats to Prince Harry is refusing to take down more anti-Royal race hate posted by Brits.One vile message posted on Gab in the wake of the attacks on Harry says: “The only good royal is a dead royal.”Other users have uploaded cruel, mocked-up cartoons targeted at his we Meghan Markle ’s mixed-race heritage.Yet the American site’s bosses say they will not take them down – insisting they defend the right of British extremists to have their say. They hit out just days after Britons Michael Szewczuk, , and Oskar Dunn-Koczorowski, , were jailed for encouraging terrorism via posts on the website.    Szewczuk had shared a poster showing Harry having a gun pointed at his head against a blood-splattered background. A caption said: “See ya later, race traitor.” Despite a backlash over the outpouring of hate, the very same propaganda is still circulating unchecked on Gab. When challenged by the Sunday Mirror the US-based site defiantly ­promised to offer British extremists “protection from state interference”. Gab did remove posts by Szewczuk and Dunn-Koczorowski after their arrests. But last night bosses told Mirror investigators they would not be removing any more of the “offensive” posts. Within hours of the two Brits being sentenced, messages appeared on Gab accusing Harry, the Duke of Sussex, of “polluting the Royal line”, along with memes of black babies.    Other shameful posts aimed at Meghan use the “N” word, call her a “b***h” and accuse Harry of being an enemy of the state. Two users shared copies of the image of Harry and the gun. Politicians and charities last night called for the site to be shut down or at least subjected to tougher regulation. Gab is run by Texan millionaire Andrew Torba, who claims the haven for white supremacists simply protects the right to free speech. After viewing our findings, a spokesman for the site, which has over , members, defended its users before accusing our reporter of “whining”. He said: “US free speech jurisprudence protects offensive and ‘hateful’ speech because it recognises that unpopular speech, not popular speech, is what needs protection from state interferencesociety is to remain free, which England is not. We will not take any content down unless it is illegal in the United States. “Our legal team, not whining complaints from reporters, makes those determinations.”    The extremist site was linked to the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting last October. Suspect Robert Bowers allegedly posted his final messages on Gab before killing  people. Torba later said the site had handed over information about his account to police but continued to justy its liberal approach to hate preaching, bragging: “Because he was on Gab, law enforcement now have definitive evidence for a motive. They would not have had this evidence without Gab.” Portsmouth University student Szewczuk, from Leeds, was jailed for four years and three months for possessing terrorist material and encouraging terrorism by posting images and links to Gab. He and labourer Dunn-Koczorowski, from north-west London, were members of the right-wing Sonnenkrieg Division – described as the “third generation” of banned Nazi terror organisation National Action. Dunn-Koczorowski was given an -month detention and training order after admitting encouraging terrorism. Labour MP Wes Streeting, chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for British Muslims, called for Gab to be shut down, saying: “It’s time something more was done about sites like Gab. There’s a fine line between freedom of speech, which is oppressed in dictatorships, and speech which incites hatred and violence.” Patrik Hermansson, of advocacy group Hope not Hate, added: “Meghan Markle and Prince Harry quickly become targets of hate by the far right online.    Gab is one of the s where this happens because of its direct attempts to market itself as a home to the far right online, the usage of far-right rhetoric by its founder, and its unwillingness to moderate hate speech.” The latest scandal comes months after Kensington Palace ramped up its battle against online abuse targeting the Duchess of Sussex.Northampton University lecturer Dr Paul Jackson, who specialises in the far right, said extremists turn to the likes of Gab because Twitter and Facebook have tightened their regulations.He said: “It’s very dficult to apply UK law to Gab because it is based in America. It attracts those who feel they are being silenced where. “Sites like this allow people to gather online where they can share ideas and material. This has the potential to lead to violent radicalisation.” Gab lost around £, between its launch in  and . Torba, worth around £million, blamed everything from leftists to the deep state. When askedGab would remove racist posts, a spokesman – a member of the legal team – added: “Certain offensive memes portraying the Royal Family are in circulation across the internet and not just on Gab.” "},{"url":null,"title":"size 16 models says reaction","story":"NewsSize  model says reaction to her unedited bikini snaps left her in tearsModel Irena Drezi has struggled with her weight for years, but shes now embracing her body and encouraging others to do the sameShareCommentsByZoe ForseyAudience Writer:,  JUN NewsIrena Drezi \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA size  model has said positive comments on her unedited modelling shots left her in tears.

In the wake of the September  attacks the US expanded their military base in Cuba to include a detention centre where they held men linked to terrorism. And they also began using ‘enhanced interrogation techniques’ – widely described as torture.The men held at ‘Gitmo’ were rarely charged but seen by US officials as key intelligence assets in the War on Terror .Guards and soldiers at the base would use the Muslim beliefs of prisoners against them as a psychological torture technique.  In Islam the writing of the Koran is considered the transcribed word of God and every copy is sacred.Prisoners were allowed a copy of the holy book – but it was used against them, according to Ben Taub in The New Yorker.Guards at Guantanamo saw an opportunity to torment detainees by tossing the Koran into the toilet or by breaking the binding under the guise of searching for weapons. This provoked riots and the Internal Reaction Forcewould be called in.  Officially their job was to restrain unruly inmates but multiple reports say that IRFaposs were used liberally and as a form of revenge. ‘IRFing’ typically involved a team of six or more men dressed in riot gear: the first man would pepper-spray the detainee, then charge into the cell and, using a heavy shield and his body weight, tackle the detainee the rest would jump on top, shackling or binding the detainee until he was no longer moving. Eventually the desecration of the Koran became so extreme inmates asked them to be kept in the library rather than the cell. But officials refused.  One day, after a Koran was kicked across the floor, detainees organised a mass suicide attempt, James Yee, an Army captain who served as the Muslim chaplain in Guantanamo, recalled in his memoir ‘For God and Country’. He wrote: “As soon as the prisoner was taken to the hospital, another detainee would be found - his sheet wound around his neck and tied to his cage wall. “The guards would rush in to save him and the chaos would start again. “The protest lasted for several days as twenty-three prisoners tried to hang themselves.” Yee came to believe that “Islam was systematically used as a weapon against the prisoners”.  When news broke in  of the deliberate desecration it caused outrage in majority-Muslim countries. The abuse of the Koran was not the only way guards used Islam as a weapon of psychological torture. Officers mocked the call to prayer, and manipulated Islamic principles of modesty - by having female guards watch naked detainees in the showers. In extreme cases detainees were kept in dark rooms, disorientated and with no indication given as to which direction was Mecca for their prayers. In  alone there were  attempts by detainees to hang themselves, according to official US figures.  Reports from officials confirm that  detainees participated in a mass-suicide attempt from August  to , , thought to be the occasion Yee referred to in his book. Two required hospital treatment.Donald Rumsfeld said that the detainees in Guantanamo were among the most dangerous, best-trained, vicious killers on the face of the earth.In  Dick Cheney said: We donapost do torture. We never have. Itaposs not something this administration subscribes to. After efforts by Barack Obama throughout his presidency to shut it down, Donald Trump signed an executive order in January  to keep Gitmo open indefinitely. There remains  detainees.

Especially here, where they have an extensive menu dedicated to them categorised by flavour and even offer “cocktail experiences” for those looking to learn from their mixologists. Our waiter recommended a real fruit mocktail with lots of real crushed fruit and berries and juices to provide a thirst quenching mix without the alcohol .We relaxed into the quiet and sipped our drinks in the sun as we pondered over the vast menu options.The venue’s interior is a mix of classic wooden floors with soft leathers and muted tartans in greys and brown, combining traditional charm with modern comfort. vw, px\"  The menus are bound in heavy leather books, and there was plenty of choice.My other half ordered bruschetta to startwhich, of course, we ended up sharing. Well, I am eating for two!Who knew that three simple slices of toasted bread with oils and tomato could be so delicious  Also, both of us were pretty in awe of the little yellow tomatoes – spot the uncultured pair.I toyed with the idea of my usual steak pie-pick and even deliberated a fish dish, but in the end we both went for the same main course of chicken tikka curryand it was presented beautully.The plate held rice and naan with a small dish of mango chutney and a large dish of gorgeously bright-coloured chicken tikka.The chicken was wonderfully soft and the tikka sauce was full of flavour, not too salty with just a bit of zing. vw, px\"  I’m notoriously soft when it comes to anything spicy, but this was just enough for me and I only needed water for my tingly lips towards the end of finishing the plateful.We were both equally surprised at the portion size from the Caird.

Strawberries and homemade fudge was presented to the side in a design with shards of wafer and small dollops of salted caramel and strawberry mousse. It sounds like a lot of flavours and it was, but in a good way.My partner’s slab of sticky toffee pudding was also teamed with a large scoop of ice cream, crushed chocolate, a large wafer and a couple of raspberries, sprinkled with icing sugar.We both finished the lot.The whole evening was lovely and relaxing.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll.

Design fleets comprising the Sigma s, Sonatas, Etchells and Hunter s joined the racing at Tarbert.Amid a flurry of rib activity laying and moving marks, it was not long before the CYCA  passage race fleet approached the finish line.The teams later caught up in the bar for the day one prize giving as new event chairman Glenn Porter welcomed everyone to Tarbert. With a number of races omitted due to protests, it was a nice easy start for Glenn.The Hunter s and Sonatas saw a spread of results after some close racing. The CYCA class  fleet on the Largs passage race was won on corrected time by Celtic Spirit. Additional prizes were awarded to Encore for the passage race line honours and Shona of Ashton for toughing it out at the rear of the passage race.Saturday was a much more challenging day on the water with a light wind and dreich drizzle. The race committee nonetheless got two races in for a number of the fleets.Protests concluded, Saturday’s prize giving announced the remaining results from Friday. This showed #s winner and RC Makars Mash class yacht Storm looking strong with a first place.Chimaera showed early signs of being a threat to the Scottish Series crown, taking a first in Friday racing. With no immediate showing of a dominant yacht in the IRC Class  fleet from Friday’s races, it was IRC class four that showed a brewing battle between Lady Ex and F’n Gr. In the CYCA Class  fleet, First by Farr surfaced with the highest number of race wins from Friday.Not to be outdone, CYCA Class  saw the final results dominated by Cool Bandit  before Saturday#s results were announced. With the weather mixing up the league table for Saturday, there were a lot of yachts taking home prizes.Saturday evening saw theof Big Vern and The Shootahs to the Scottish Series for another year and a spectacular fireworks display in celebration of Valhalla of Ashton’s th year on the water.Sunday saw yet another big weather sht with forecasts up to  knots.

Glenn Porter started proceedings with a special award for #assisting mark layers# to the competitor who got tangled up in one of the race marks. In IRC Class  it was El Gran Senor and Forty Licks shining through. The Makars Mash RC class saw Hijacker leading the prize haul. In IRC Class it was Mata taking the #extra# prize. IRC class four saw F’n Gr take a clean sweep of firsts in both races. With only one race in CYCA  and , it was Reflection and Salamander XXII taking home the wins.

Finally, the CYCA restricted sail fleet saw Celtic Spirit take first place.The  event saw the marquee remain open for the Sunday evening as part of additional shoreside activities supported by Event Scotland.An earlier start on Monday was greeted with sunshine and no wind.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"fountainhead megayacht spotted in tarbert harbour","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTarbert enjoyed a short visit from the megayacht Fountainhead, a  Feadship built for American billionaire Eddie Lampert, chief executive officer of American store Sears.At .m , she is the th biggest yacht in the world, registered in the Cayman Islands.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

Itrsquos in such a beautul part of our county that the journey there was an adventure in itself.The loch is hidden, surrounded by a wood which embraces its secrets. Irsquod never visited it before, but Irsquod been told how magical this place is and that it has a story attached to it.Finding an appropriate place to park was our first challenge. There is no direct access to the loch and no car park with signposts, so care is needed in finding a suitable place. A private farm road that takes you to the entrance gate is not an option, so initially I struggled to find a suitable place, but some kind advice from a friendly farmer helped us out.Itrsquos a perfect time of year for such an adventure. The woods are fully clothed and still echoing with birdsong. I like to explore new places initially without a map or guide. It adds to the adventure, as we had to decide which way to go and initially wonderedwersquod taken the wrong route. But there is a circular walk around the loch, so once the path is discovered there isnrsquot a wrong way.It is a beautul and tranquil place, and as we wandered along the tree-lined loch I thought about the story of the man responsible for its creation.That man was Harry Younger, of the well-known brewing family. His ancestor, William Younger, had been the man who had built up the famous brewing business which produced Youngerrsquos Ale. A huge chunk of the Canongate in Edinburgh was taken over by their Holyrood brewery, including the site where the Scottish Parliament now sits.When William Younger died in , he was a hugely wealthy and successful businessman but also, it seems, exhausted and overworked. The empire he left was continued by the family but eventually in , the Younger enterprise was merged with rivals McEwanrsquos, to form Scottish Brewers Ltd.This merger, the reasons for which are another story, meant the Younger family branched out into other ventures. In the s, Harry Younger, the then head of the family, bought the land at Baro and began transforming it into the haven of nature it now is.Harry led an interesting and privileged le. He was an internationally known curler who regularly competed and won trophies. His intention was to create a new home amid the beauty of this area of East Lothian. He set about building a house, but also developed Bara Loch as it now exists and surrounded it with an embrace of trees.But the dark clouds of the Second World War intervened in his plans to enjoy this paradise. He had attended Sandhurst in his earlier years and seen the last months of the First World War. He remained involved in the Territorial Army and in January  he was sent to France as commander of a mechanised unit.It is recorded that he was killed in action on June  at St Valery-en-Caux. His unit, the Lothian and Border Horse, had been part of the brave and ferocious defence of the Dunkirk beaches. Anyone with knowledge of this action will understand the hell and desperation of that defence, and the supreme courage and sacrice of the defenders.Harry died on the day these brave defenders had to finally surrender, after over , had been evacuated from the beaches. How he died, what horrors he witnessed, we can only guess. He lies buried in the St Valery-en-Caux Franco-British Cemetery.And so this is the story attached to this beautul place. The man who began its creation never got the chance to enjoy it.In our walk, we arrived at a stone seat overlooking the loch. It had a worn inscription on it. We could make out the words lsquoin memoryrsquo or lsquomemorialrsquo and lsquoYoungerrsquo, but the rest was too worn.But I knew this must be a memorial to Harry Younger, which was later confirmed when I found a wonderful blog called Walking East Lothian in which the author explained he had traced the inscription to reveal Harryrsquos name and the date , the year of the lochrsquos creation.I sat on the seat and watched my kids play in the wood. The trees on the north side arch over the waterline to catch the sunlight, creating a canopy which dips into the loch. The serene tranquillity and beauty of the place is no doubt what Harry intended.But that in a sense is part of the magic of this place. As the pioneer Nelson Henderson once said to his son: ldquoThe true meaning of le is to plant trees under whose shade you do not expect to sit.It was these words I was reflecting on as I watched my children play. Harry was of course wealthy but we can all plant trees, either real ones or metaphorical ones, as a legacy for others.The recent death of a fellow storyteller and all-round wonderful woman, Ros Parkyn, was also on my mind. I had spoken about this place to her and of my intention to visit it. She loved nature too and would have gladly come along with me. But I sadly left it too late.Ros encapsulated all that was good and compassionate about humanity and she also planted many trees, some in the ground for she was a nature lover, but even more were planted in the hearts of those who knew her. They all now will grown as part of her wonderful legacy.As we left the wood, butterflies and blue dragonflies accompanied me, along with thoughts of my friend Ros and a man I didnrsquot know but whose trees shaded us.I willin autumn to see the colours and pay quiet homage to those who leave this world having made a positive dference."},{"url":null,"title":"new-primary-school-at-letham-mains-starting-to-take-shape","story":"Work began on Letham Mains Primary School, on Haddingtonrsquos western edge, earlier this year.The school, which is at the heart of more than  new homes at Letham Mains, is being funded entirely through developersrsquo contributions.Morrison Construction, which is also behind the development of the nearby East Lothian Community Hospital, was appointed to build the primary school, which will have  classrooms suitable for pre-school and primary teaching, a dining hall, social space and a two-court PE hall with retractable seating for performance and community use.Now the foundations and concrete base have been completed and the steel frame is being put in place.As part of the projectrsquos commitment to sustainability,  tonnes of ground soil taken from the site have been moved to other projects in the county, including a BMX track in Musselburgh.Councillor Shamin Akhtar, a Haddington ward member and cabinet spokeswoman for education, visited the site to meet with Morrison Constructionrsquos team there.She said: ldquoItrsquos great to see the progress that is being made on the new school.ldquoHaddington is growing, with people choosing to live here because itrsquos a lovely town with beautul natural settings and good transport links within the county and wider region.ldquoItrsquos important that we keep up with the pace of growth, have facilities in place to accommodate it, and ensure our wider community benefits from it.ldquoI look forward to ing to Letham Mains Primary School later in the construction process as it continues to take shape.Outside the new building, areas will be designed for outdoor learning, PE and play.Jim Hanna, Morrison Construction project director, said: ldquoIt was great to be joined by council representatives on site so they could see the progress we are making.ldquoWith groundworks and foundations complete, we are now under way with the steel frame for the new building which will start to provide the community with a sense of what the school will look like once delivered.ldquoMorrison Construction is committed to minimising the impact of our activities on the environment and local community.ldquoAlready during the project we have been able to ert hundreds of tonnes of soil from landfill for reuse at Musselburgh, and we look forward to maintaining a proactive approach to sustainability throughout our time at Letham Mains."},{"url":null,"title":"preview-musselburgh-gala-2019","story":"Organised by Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council, the fun-packed event is adored by youngsters in the Honest Toun.From noon until pm, there is a range of activities on offer including shows, quad bikes, face painting and dance displays.Edinburgh magician Alexander the Great will enthral gala visitors with his magic and circus skills show and Dinky Donuts will be present to keep those hunger pangs at bay.East Coast FM lead the fun and games as compegraveres.Also present will be Musselburghrsquos Army Cadets, Air Cadets and Sea Cadets, with musical entertainment provided by the Penicuik and Musselburgh Boysrsquo Brigade Pipe Band.Representatives from Musselburgh Area Partnership will also be on hand to discuss its work with the local community.The Brunton Bistro serves tea, coffee, sandwiches and pies in a marquee.For those who prefer a snack as they enjoy the many activities, Sizzlers are selling food such as burgers, bacon rolls and chips.

There are several factors influencing this, but the major factor which has tipped the balance is the extended funding hours and the negative impact this is having both financially on small businesses, like Mary Poppins, and to the quality of early learning and childcare.New Scottish Government policy instructs councils to increase their funded childcare hours from  to , by . This move also includes longer opening hours and a move from term time to year-round opening hours to attempt to make childcare more nationally accessible.Ms Dewar said: ldquoThe money received for funded places does not cover the costs of providing the quality of early learning and childcare which we want and are required to provide, especially with regards to staff costs.ldquoThe timescales and measures that the Scottish Government has put in place to educate a workforce to meet the increased requirements are insufficient, and there is a serious shortfall to meet the requirements of the extended funding.ldquoEast Lothian Council indicated it estimated it would require approximately  staff to facilitate the increase in funded hours in East Lothian. The majority of these posts are early learning and childcare practitioners.ldquoThe local authority advertises early learning practitioner posts at between pound. and pound. per hour.

The nursery sector has been warning the Scottish Government that private nurseries are struggling in the run-up to the roll-out of its flagship , policy from August .ldquoMinisters must act quickly to address the sectorrsquos concerns and ensure that the capacity exists to deliver the funded hours next year.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoIt is, of course, concerning to hear of any nursery considering closure, and the obvious effects this might have on staff, parents and children.ldquoEast Lothian Council has provided assurance that they will support families to find alternative early learning and childcare places for children who had been expecting to use the Mary Poppins Nursery from this August.Ms Dewar added: ldquoI am distraught that circumstances have forced me to this decision and that such a wonderful place for children to experience their early years is to close.The decision was met with an outpouring of grief on social media.The nurseryrsquos recent th birthday was marked with a garden party.The nursery was founded by Sue Armstrong, affectionately still called lsquoMiss Suersquo, after she had written to Mary Poppins author P L Travers to askshe could use the name.Miss Sue said: ldquoI received many letters from P L Travers about the nursery.ldquoAt the beginning, she wanted to know what the nursery was going to be like. She had no objection to me using the name, she just wanted to find out more. I ended up meeting her as well.ldquoWe were hoping to get her to come and open the nursery  years ago, but her arthritis was bad. We stayed in touch, however. I would send her letters about how the nursery was getting on along with photos, and she would write back saying how she liked it, and ideas of what to do.ldquoShe said that the children should be encouraged to make up their own stories. lsquoChildren like doing that,rsquo she said.Miss Sue sold the nursery to Ms Dewar in  as she was ldquosick of all the paperwork.She said. ldquoWhen I heard it was to close down, well, itrsquos just all so sad really. Itrsquos such a terrible shame.ldquoIt is such a nice and happy place for the children, homely and warm.

modern and dynamic setting aimed at motivating and encouraging more people to get more active more often.ldquoAlthough the dry side facilities remain open at Aubigny, this extended closure of the swimming pool is not what anyone would wish.ldquoenjoy would welcome all our customers at any of our other swimming pools, which remain open.An email was sent out to enjoyleisure members which highlighted the problems.Tom Reid, head of infrastructure at East Lothian Council, echoed Mr Axonrsquos disappointment.He said: ldquoEveryone is looking forward to the completion of this renovation, which will transform the look of the pool for the benefit of the many people who use this much-loved facility.ldquoWe are disappointed that, due to a supply chain issue outwith our control, the date for the poolrsquos re-opening has been now been revised from the end of June with a new opening date of July .ldquoWe appreciate this will be frustrating for pool users who will be eagerly anticipating the poolrsquos re-opening and we are grateful for their patience and understanding.ldquoIrsquod like to assure everyone that we are working very closely with the contractor, subcontractor and enjoyleisure to complete the project within this revised timeframe.The pool hall dates back to the s, with the refurbishment plans including the complete replacement of custom-fit ceiling window  and a new roof covering.Both pools ndash the four-lane swimming pool and East Lothianrsquos only dedicated infant pool ndash were to be drained, with a new light ceiling covering replacing the wood cladding.A new energy-efficient lighting scheme is also to be fitted, which it is hoped will transform the look and feel of the facility.Existing wall tiles will be replaced with wall liner .The delay also means the pool will not be open ahead of the school summer holidays starting next Friday .While the pool and health suite are closed, the rest of the centre, including the gym, dance studio, sports hall and cafe, remain open.Ward councillor Craig Hoy said: ldquoThe delay to the reopening of the Aubigny Sports Centre swimming pool will clearly be disappointing for local residents hoping to use the facilities over the school holidays.ldquoI hope East Lothian Council continues to work closely with the contractors and enjoyleisure to ensure there are no further delays.ldquoThe renovation is very welcome, but as the Haddington population grows we still need to explore how to further enhance and expand our leisure and sporting facilities to ensure they remain on a level with those available where in the county and beyond."},{"url":null,"title":"oor-wullie-sculpture-arrives-in-east-lothian","story":"A total of  sculptures capturing Scotlandrsquos favourite scamp are scattered

Frequency should be half-hourly.Councillor Tom Trotter, who represents Haddington, backed the station bid.He said: ldquoIt is a good idea, especially with the town expanding as it is.ldquoIt would be a tremendous asset to have.However, the councillor felt it was more likely the station would have to find a new site, such as Alderston, to the north of the town.He added: ldquoIn the short-term it is unrealistic, but hopefully in the longer term things can be put in place to make it a realistic possibility.ldquoIt is a great idea and Irsquom sure it would get support from all the local ward councillors, but where it would go and how much it would cost are questions."},{"url":null,"title":"preview-prestonpans-gala-2019","story":"This year is the th anniversary of Prestonpans Childrenrsquos Gala.On gala day itself, the festivities kick off with the crowning ceremony at am at Prestonpans Community Centre.There is then a fancy-dress competition at Middleshot Square at noon before the parade heads off through the town.From Middleshot Square, it heads along Hawthorn Road and down West Loan to the war memorial, then along High Street before turning up Redburn Road, then along North Grange Avenue, where it ends at Mary Murray Park, behind the community centre.The park hosts the gala dayrsquos family fun, which includes a funfair with a host of rides, as well as old favourites such as hook the duck.There is also a vintage fire engine on display, as well as an American police car, motorbike displays, ponies, birds of prey, beat the goalie, Zorbs, safe archery, NERF guns, crazy golf, a tombola and a gala raffle, not to mention ice cream vans, tea and coffee, Mr Donut Man, crepes, waffles, hot dogs, nachos, a burger van, La Favorita pizzas, stalls selling gts, sweets and cake.Gala day marks the beginning, not the end of Prestonpansrsquo week of fun and activities.Events are as follows:Saturday, June Monday, June Tuesday, June Wednesday, June Thursday, June Friday, June "},{"url":null,"title":"tom-gordon-boris-may-not-be-pm-long-enough-to-alter-scotland","story":"It was fun while it lasted. But it was a mania, and all manias are brief and slightly silly. What did we actually know about Rory Stewart  Principally that he didnrsquot look or sound like the other lot. He didnrsquot come across as a greasy, self-seeking weasel. Nor did he look like Theresa May. There was a pulse, for one thing. A personality. A hinterland even.But other than being refreshingly blunt about Brexit for a Tory, we didnrsquot know much. His big policy was not to have policies. No tax cuts, no spending pledges. He was, in effect, continuity austerity. If that had sunk in, the chatterati adoration might have waned.He was no miracle cure for our political malaise, but a symptom of it, a sign of how much people are yearning for an alternative to what theyrsquore being offered. That eagerness to believe in him, in the absence of facts, should have sounded an alarm, not a hosanna.It may be Mr Stewart, for all his apparent guilelessness, is only a smarter sort of self-seeking weasel.Yet he will be missed. When he was in the Tory leadership race, he was a brake on the worst impulses of the other candidates, constantly nagging them over how they might deliver Brexit by October , and that the EU sees the threat of the UK leaving without a deal as no threat at all. Do we really want to join Venezuela and Syria and trade on WTO terms Which brings us to Boris Johnson. The former foreign secretary isnrsquot a lock for Downing Street. His well-chronicled flaws mean he could easily stumble over the next month of party hustings and offer Jeremy Hunt a chance to strike. But as things stand, he is very likely to be the next Prime Minister.This is bad for Ruth Davidson, but possibly not as much as she fears, and good for Nicola Sturgeon, but possibly not as much as she hopes.The Scottish Tory leaderrsquos discomfort over her old enemy could hardly have been clearer this week. First she backed Sajid Javid against Mr Johnson. Then she backed Michael Gove against him. If the empty lectern from the Channel  debate had been running, shersquod clearly have been happy to back that too.Asked by STV news on Thursday whether she was backing ldquoanyone but Boris, she couldnrsquot even mention his name. She and other senior Scottish Tories worry Mr Johnson will prove anathema to Scottish voters.He has already providing the SNP with some choice ammo. His journalistic career is full of sniping at Scotland and the Scots. He didnrsquot really argue in  that a native Scot could never be PM, only an MP with a Scottish constituency, given the West Lothian Question.At the time, Tony Blair, a Scot, was standing for re-election. Mr Johnson, born in New York, didnrsquot attack Mr Blair. He attacked his expected successor, Gordon Brown, as he had a Scottish seat.But the comments were enough for Ms Sturgeon to get her teeth into this week. He has also been very rude about the FM personally, and she about him.So what are the Scottish Tories to dohe wins  In recent weeks there has been a conversation at the top of the party about how to handle the Boris problem.Should they cold-shoulder him, or coach him in the esoteric ways of Scottish politics and hold his hand through the constitutional minefield Itrsquos a bogus debate, a flattering delusion that suggests they have a choice. Ms Davidson and her party cannot distance themselves from a Johnson premiership because by extension they would be backing away from the Westminster system and the Union. That hardly fits with Ms Davidsonrsquos brand.So rather than fuel the SNP claim that Westminster is now so alien itrsquos only sensible to leave, the Scottish Tories can only embrace Prime Minister Johnson.The manic grin of Borista MP Ross Thomson aside, they may well do it through gritted teeth, their skin crawling, but therersquos really no option. Wersquove had hug a hoodie, now itrsquos time to cuddle a clown. For good or ill,Mr Johnson wins this contest, Ms Davidson is shackled to the great lummox.How bad might a Johnson premiership be  Pretty woeful, itrsquos fair to guess. He seems guided by neither plans nor principles. He may survive a while through a lizard-brain instinct for self-preservation, tacking to the centre ground to align with the protective mass of voters. He has already started to squirm out of his Hallowersquoen-or-bust position by saying Brexit by then is ldquoeminently feasible rather than nailed down. But the MPs who backed him because of his apparent Brexit hardline are not the compromising sort. He will soon come up against the same Commons arithmetic and red-faced irreconcilables who did for Mrs May.He may not last long enough to do Ms Davidson serious harm.Ms Sturgeon, meanwhile, is hoping he will be a long-term incompetent, ruffling feathers and setting teeth on edge every time he even mentions Scotland. She said yesterday he would be a ldquodisaster for the UK and Scotland. ldquoIt further demonstrates that Scotland and the rest of the UK are on dferent political trajectories, she told the Herald.But thatrsquos more standard wishful thinking. All things Tory are supposed to move the dial on independence. Just like Brexit. Butall the things the SNP says are boosting independence were actually boosting independence, Yes would be nudging  per cent in the polls. ldquoIt has got to the stage wherethe chicken crosses the road, it will be a boost for Scottish independence, David Mundell said in the Commons this week. Even SNP MPs smiled at that one.So Ms Sturgeon should not mistake her personal needle with Mr Johnson for a looming national backlash. Yes, Scottish voters have a low opinion of Mr Johnson. But they also know he is likely to have a short and inglorious shelf-le before a revival of Rorymania.

Napoleon slept, it is said, with a version of the ldquoCeltic Homer under his pillow as he fought his campaigns in Egypt, and the German literary giant Goethe was famously inspired by the tales of the blind, third-century bard Ossian, and the adventures of Fingal and Oscar, Malvina and King Swaran.Indeed, Macphersonrsquos writings ndash fragments, he contended, of ancient Gaelic stories, tales and songs that he had collected, translated and heard ndash inspired composers, poets, politicians and artists across Europe. In Britain alone, the works of the man from Ruthven, Badenoch, influenced Burns and Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Scott and Byron.However, the Ossian tales as told by Macpherson in a series of publications starting with Fragments Of Ancient Poetry in  ndash largely gloomy stories of wars and loss, tumultuous epic landscapes roiling with storms and conflict ndash were publicly savaged by critics, most notably Samuel Johnson, one of the most famous men of letters of his day.Johnson said the Ossian tales as presented by Macpherson were ldquoas gross an imposition ever the world was troubled with. The charge was that Macpherson was a fraud, and had essentially written the works himself.The controversy was huge at the time: Macpherson defended his work,not as robustly as an author may do in these more media-savvy times ndash one account notes that he challenged Johnson to a duel ndash and the Highland Society of Scotland launched an official investigation, which found, albeit not until , that he had used genuine material in his work.Some  years later, Macphersonrsquos works are little known, and have not benefited from a renaissance in their audience through radio, television or film: Ossian is not a namethat creates many ripples in popular culture.However, a major new show at Scotlandrsquos National Museum ndash Wild and Majestic: Romantic Visions of Scotland, which opens this week ndash hopes to shine a new light on the Ossian controversy. It shows the Ossian tales as crucial to the development of Romantic thought and literature in the late th century, and states clearly, and provides evidence, that Macpherson based his work on authentic texts.Scholars, too, see the whole controversy at the crux of a tension between industrialised central Scotland and the rapidly changing Highlands, and between Scottish culture and the burgeoning idea of British Empire and the dominance of obviously ldquoEnglish culture.Johnsonrsquos ridiculing of Macpherson was much more than a literary argument: the cultural and political undercurrents of the controversy are unmistakable.The exhibition includes one of Macphersonrsquos sources, the Red Book of Clanranald. It adds: ldquoJames Macpherson maintained that his translations of the Ossian cycle were based on authentic Gaelic verse, ballads and songs, collected during his travels in the Scottish Highlands ... Macpherson consulted and collected original Gaelic manuscripts belonging to numerous Highland families.ldquoThese included the Red Book of Clanranald, a volume containing the history and lore of Clan Donald, which was compiled by a member of the MacMhuirich family of bards.The curator of the show, Dr Patrick Watt, said that Macpherson was ldquoscholarly and rigorous in his research.He said: ldquoMacpherson definitely made use of old manuscript sources, we have that one in our show. Itrsquos very interesting to see how he approached his task ndash he had evidence. These are real things, whether he actually changed them or not, we are almost past that now.ldquoI think when you look at it for what it is ndash a lasting interpretation of the remnants of Gaelic poetry ndash then it is fantastic. If you read them, they are incredibly interesting, the characters that are portrayed are fascinating ... the thing that really hit me was that you have a man who goes for himself to investigate these documents. Why did he do this  I doubt it was because he thought it was going to be a best seller.One of the contributors to the show, Dr Domhnall Uilleam Stiugravebhart of Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, believes it is high time for Scotland to move beyond the debate over the ldquoauthenticity of Macphersonrsquos Ossian tales.He said: ldquoYou could talk about it for hours, it is an under-researched part of our own history, which at long last, we can stop being embarrassed about. Put to one side questions of authenticity, and think about how it was put together. It was not just a work of literature, it was seen as a historical document when it was first being produced. It was first produced with footnotes.ldquoMacpherson ushered in an age of romantic nationalism which is still with us. We have never really left that age, and by looking at Macpherson we can fruitfully compare him with other national myths, national epics that were being created, or shall we say recreated, in the th and th centuries, including JRR Tolkienrsquos own attempts to provide the English with national myth in the form of Lord of the Rings.Of the controversy, he added: ldquoIs Macpherson a fraud and a faker ndash or is he perhaps trying to do something possibly a bit more interesting with his own native culture  There is absolutely no doubt, first of all, that he made stuff up.ldquoAt the same time, and we should say that very quickly indeed, he was drawing upon an existing culture of Gaelic, heroic ballads common to both Scotland and Ireland, they date from the middle ages, and they are about Fionn mac Cumhaill and his heroic band, and the defender of Ulster, Cuacutechulainn.Professor Nigel Leask, Regius Chair of English language and literature at the University of Glasgow, says that scholarship suggests Macpherson drew upon about  traditional Fenian ballads ndash that is, medieval and post-medieval heroic ballads in Gaelic relating the feats of Fionn mac Cumhaill and his warrior band the Fianna ndash working from notes of transcriptions made from oral performances and some old Gaelic manuscripts.He added: ldquoBut there was a lot of lsquopaddingrsquo, and his most ambitious long poems Fingal and Temora presented the ballads in the form of epics, modelled on the th centuryrsquos understanding of Homerrsquos Iliad and modern sentimental poetry.Professor Tom Devine, the distinguished historian, has another view of the Macpherson controversy. He notes the tension between the myth that Macpherson was writing, and the reality of Scotland ndash and indeed Britain ndash in the late th century.The stormy epic, godless but noble and ancient, contrasted with a country rapidly gearing up to the Industrial Revolution and, in the Highlands, the Clearances.Devine said: ldquoThe impact of Ossian in Europe was quite extraordinary. Itrsquos dficult now, in the cold light of the st-century day, to think of how the celebrati in Europe were seduced by him. The other aspect is you are dealing with two parallel universes at this time ndash at the same time as this almost fictionalised Highland Scotland was being projected, the break-up of the real traditional society was accelerating rapidly.ldquoOssian was having an impact from the s. And that is the decade when you are beginning to see the rapid commercialisation of Highland society. The s are a real break point in the journey towards modernity in Scotland ... we see the first signs of emigration on a major scale, and the first removals from land at a signicant level. So at the same time as a romanticisation is going on, a quite dferent narrative is occurring at the same time.Devine added that the way Macpherson wrote in the tales suggested ndash sometimes explicitly ndash that Highlanders of the late th century were ldquothe antique past, living in the present, in a way which did not exist anywhere  in Britain, a seductive idea because of the ldquosheer pace of advancing modernity in the UK.The works, too, Leask notes, ldquogave new dignity to Gaelic culture and language that had been crushed in the aftermath of Culloden [in ] and, in a way still seen in modern marketing images for Scottish tourism, ldquocast a romantic light on the rugged mountain landscape, and even turned terrible weather ndash mist and rain ndash into a sublime Ossianic experience, encouraging huge number of tourists to visit the region in the romantic period.Watt notes that the debate over Macpherson and what was authentic and what was his own invention may carry on for many years yet.Stiugravebhart added: ldquoYou can spend your entire time knocking your head against a wall, playing lsquospot the genuine versersquo in Ossian. I am not saying we should move on from that, but I think a more fruitful line of enquiry would be to try to examine and analyse what Macpherson was up to, and beyond that, why at this particular juncture this should be such an attractive literary production, not just for people in Scotland but across the world.ldquoI think the first thing to say about Macpherson is that he didnrsquot work alone. He was the poster boy of a coterie of Scottish enlightenment figures who were interested in Scotlandrsquos past and what that past might tell us about the development of society. So, OK, he was creating literature, but he was also bringing to light these incredibly valuable documents, which illustrated what le might have been like in Scotland, , years before.Macpherson, who died in , perhaps did not help himself.Leask says his original inspiration was existing traditional Scottish and Irish ballads about Fionn mac Cumhaill with which he had been familiar since boyhood in the ceilidh houses of Badenoch, as well as further material he collected in the Highlands and Islands in -.He added: ldquo[The verses] were only lsquoauthenticrsquo in the sense that he had freely adapted traditional Gaelic Fenian poetry ndash it would have been betterhe had admitted as much. He was a dficult and curmudgeonly personality, but made a lot of money from his successful literary career.The Ossian texts are available in current publishing such as Blind Ossianrsquos Fingal, published by Luath Press of Edinburgh.Watt says thata filmmaker adapted the works for the screen, the current general lack of knowledge of Macphersonrsquos works would quickly be overturned. In the meantime, the texts are still available to read ndash Leask says itrsquos best to ldquotry reading it loud, taking long breaths, to capture the flavour of the original.Stiugravebhart added, of reading the often ldquogloomy and morbid works: ldquoYoursquove got to let yourself go, plunge in, and live in the moment. Someit is unreadable, some it isnrsquot. Some of it echoes or gives a foretaste of what other romantic writers, with better reputations, would write over the next two generations.ldquoItrsquos always worth having a go with Ossian, and see what you think.Wild and Majestic: Romantic Visions of Scotland, National Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh, runs from June  until November ."},{"url":null,"title":"headline-to-come","story":"Headline to comeJustine Gordon-Smith with a picture of her late father Randolph #Peter# ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtGordon-Smith who wasltspan classtruncate-full-screengt a victim of the contaminated blood scandal.

STY MACKAYPic Gordon Terris NAtional on SundayWHEN she talks about her fatherrsquos long and tortured last days her voice begins to crack. It is only when she gets on to who she blames for killing him and failing her and her family that it regains a steely edge.Justine Gordon-Smith holds the Scottish and UK Governments responsible. For their failure, not just to properly compensate for infecting their dad with the blood products which would finally kill him, but virtually abandoning him and his complex needs and leaving her and her sister to provide round-the-clock care as he became more and more ill.Justine is one of four girls, two of her sisters live away, so it was left to her and her sister Rto look after their father Peter in Edinburgh as he deteriorated from a caring and funny man to a bedridden one they could barely recognise. All four were at his bedside when he died and she can be precise about it ndash it was .pm on July , just  days, she notes, after the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service, which infected him, opened its ldquoshiny new pound million building in the Heriot Watt Centre.Peter Gordon-Smith was a well-known figure on the Scottish music and entertainment scene, a musician and primarily double bass player ndash he backed Shirley Bassey and others ndash and he managed night clubs, worked at the Citizensrsquo Theatre in Glasgow under the legendary Iain Cuthbertson, even managed a youth hostel in the Edinburgh.ldquoHe was a very outgoing man. He loved a yarn and a funny story. He could charm anyone, she recalls. ldquoHe was a very talented musician and he was also very handsome.Peter was a haemophiliac. ldquoWhen we were young I remember him having the odd bleed and he would go to hospital for a few days. But it was manageable. ldquoYou were always very conscious of it and how an injury would affect him.It was in  that Peter was told he was infected with the Hepatitis C virus, although he was not told how he got it or when. It is clear, however, from his medical records that he received clotting agents Factor VIII and cryoprecipitate produced by the transfusion services Protein Fractionation Centre and administered by the Royal Infirmary in Edinburgh, the RIE.ldquoHe was absolutely outraged when he was told. There was a distinct lack of information about how he became infected. Dad looked into suing the hospital, but that didnrsquot go ahead.Justine, like all the core participants in the new inquiry, has had to sign a non-disclosure agreement ndash in case information at this stage might prejudice future legal chargesanyone is held responsible ndash but she is determined not to be completely silenced.For  years, from when he was told about the infection which would finally kill him, the family received no help or compensation. In  the UK Government set up and funded three charities ndash while refusing to admit liability ndash one of which was the Skipton Fund.ldquoAround that time R found out about it in a newspaper article and we applied to Skipton. Peter subsequently received pound, as well as pound a quarter. The money was used to do up his house, just a stones throw from the Scottish Parliament.Justine, a filmmaker, who was brought up in Edinburgh with sister R, had been living in London but in  ed to pursue a doctorate at Edinburgh University in film and geography. She and R were shortly to become their dadrsquos full-time carers.ldquoHe had been badly beaten in the  and spent a long time in the RIE in . He developed what they call an inhibitor - the clotting agents were facing increasing resistance - and he would turn over in bed and bleed, or opening the door, even shaking hands.In  he developed sores in his legs which refused to heal. In that same year he had a fall in the bath, which led to him developing even more resistance to clotting. At the beginning of  Justine asked the hospital to perform a liver test on Peter. It revealed cancer.ldquoWe used to call him the Comeback Kid, he was so stoic, but this time he said lsquoIrsquove finally hit the buffersrsquo, she recalled.Skipton awarded Peter a further pound,.In May  he was told the cancer was terminal and there would be no further treatment. He was put on steroids and other drugs. ldquoUp until he took the steroids he was a lovely dad. As soon as he took them he went.Justine and her R were now alternating carers. She says she was repeatedly told she was ineligible for carers allowance because she was a student and was unable to work. Later, the sisters were given  hours a week assistance.Peter tried to kill himself in July, taking a massive overdose. After an alert, because the part-time carer couldnrsquot get in, Justine rushed to the house. Her father was saved.ldquoHe was put on fentanyl [a powerful opioid]. This strange creature then appeared who was not our dad, Justine recalls.There was a second suicide attempt in September ndash ldquoGod knows how many Tramadol he took ndash and again he was brought out of it.ldquoThat was the only time I saw him as my dad again. He was so angry he wasnrsquot dead. He didnrsquot want to be alive.Justine and R installed a drug safe in the house so he couldnt try that method again, but he was later to attempt it a third time by stabbing himself. She adds, on the verge of tears again, ldquoWe had become his jailers and his prisoners.After the sisters had taken turns on seven-nights-a-week suicide watch without any support they were given a carer for three nights.ldquoEventually we got seven nights a week, but only when Dad was so frail he required double staffing, but we got at least to sleep in our own beds, Justine says.In  the Scottish Government set up the Scottish Infected Blood Support Scheme which replaced the Skipton and other charities. While it makes payments to those infected, and to partners and dependent children, non-dependent children, carers like Justine and R, donrsquot qualy.ldquoHow can you say itrsquos generous  Why doesnrsquot the government just hold up its hand like the Republic of Ireland The Irish Government has paid out over euro billion in compensation, with the average award euro,.ldquoMy sister lost twenty-one thousand pounds from not working and Irsquom about seventy thousand out of pocket, she says.But itrsquos not about money, itrsquos about justice. ldquoI am outraged at the way our father, our family and other victims and their families have been treated.

He was interested in seeing where his father had come from.Having arrived in Edinburgh, his eyes were opened by the breadth of knowledge of botany that thrived in the city.Johnson adds: ldquoHe wrote lsquoI am very much mortied by my ignorance of botanyrsquo. He was surrounded by people who were completely conversant in botanical science and he didnrsquot know a thing.Hosack resolved to improve his knowledge, and spent hours in botany classes and exploring Edinburghrsquos gardens, including the original botanic garden in Edinburghrsquos Leith Walk, which later evolved into todayrsquos Royal Edinburgh Botanic Garden.Back in New York, he ventured beyond the city limits to Manhattanrsquos untamed pastoral landscape where in  he paid under , for a -acre stretch of land. There he built greenhouses inspired by the ones hersquod seen in Edinburgh and paid tribute to his fatherrsquos birthplace by naming it Elgin Botanic Garden.ldquoHe planted all kinds of agricultural crops, adds Johnson. ldquoItrsquos amazing to think he was growing barley, wheat, cotton and sunflowers on land where the Rockefeller Centre stands today.ldquoHe experimented with native and non-native species. He taught students how to identy plants and prepare medicines, and they conducted chemical experiments to figure out whether plants that were not known could have medical properties.ldquoHe built two ft conservatories which were clearly modelled on the ones hersquod seen in Leith Walk and had plants brought from all over the world.The conservatories faced what is now Fth Avenue, while streets which today are a hub for commerce and retail were surrounded by a belt of forest trees and shrubs. Exotic flowers, plants and fruits, which had never before been seen by New Yorkers, thrived within the garden walls.His visit to Edinburgh and London had also inspired him to gather the cityrsquos brightest minds to lay the foundations for organisations that moulded the cityrsquos future.ldquoHe saw his city through new eyes, she says.ldquoIt was a small town of , at the time, there were pigs walking through the streets and no major institutions.However, having spent over  million in todayrsquos money funding his garden, Hosackrsquos wealth was running dry.

More than % of respondents supported the plans.The plans have been at the centre of controversy after some womens groups, backed by several prominent SNP MSPs and MPs, say the new legislation could put womens spaces at risk.They claim that predatory men could access womens refuges, toilets and other facilities.Now transgender and non-binary Scots have spoken out about their disappointment following Sommervilles announcement on Thursday.Emily Frood, a trans woman from Edinburgh, said: \"Irsquom ashamed, disappointed, and incredibly upset by the actions the Scottish Government have taken this week in relation the GRA reform.\"Trans and non-binary people in Scotland have been let down.\"The Scottish Government has suggested reforming the GRA in a frankly half-arsed capacity. I would rather a broken manesto promise of not getting the reform implemented by , than have a pathetic reform that includes a not fully self-declaratory method, fails to include  and  year olds as eligible, and completely ignores the validation and recognition of non-binary genders.\"Theyrsquore pandering to a vocal minority of ill-informed and bigoted iniduals, many from the within the SNP, who suggest that the rights of trans people have a detrimental effect on the rights of women. This has never been the case.\"Irsquove campaigned on this reform for nearly four years and to see it get ripped to shreds as a result of what comes across as a public pressure from a minority of bigoted people is heartbreaking.Kerry Rush, who is non-binary and from Edinburgh, added: \"To say Irsquom disappointed is an understatement. Irsquom heartbroken, for myself and for the entire trans and non-binary communities. We waited  months to hear from the Scottish government about our rights, or lack thereof. We were led to believe they were working to help usbe legally recognised and instead we received two pitul sentences [In Sommervilles statement].\"Non-binary people are people and deserve to live and love as part of wider society with the same rights and privileges as others. Instead what this so called progressive Scottish government has done is send a message of absolute disrespect and disregard for all non-binary people.\"I exist and I wonrsquot be erased. I will keep fighting for my existence to be recognised.\"One senior SNP source said that the decision to roll back on the manesto pledge is down to \"weak leadership, and the First Minister not having enough control at the top.\"Colin Macfarlane, director at Stonewall Scotland said: \"Now that the government has made this announcement, and it has fallen well short of what we had hoped, they are going to have to show leadership to ensure they tackle transphobic language when they hear it and when they see it, and ensure it is called out. \"Trans people have had their lives put under the microscope now for the past  months, so it is the governmentrsquos duty of care now to ensure that that rhetoric is dialled down while we go through yet another consultation.\"Cabinet Secretary for Equalities Shirley-Anne Somerville said: ldquoWe know that some in the trans community will be feeling a sense of deep disappointment at what they see as a lack of progress on trans rights. I want to reassure them that the Scottish Government is committed to reforming the  Act and to removing unnecessary barriers for trans people to live in their true gender. We are committed to doing so during the current parliamentary session.ldquoHowever, it is important for that reform to be passed with strong support from across the Chamber and wider society.

It was nominated for three Oscars, with Lasseter himself being presented with a Special Achievement Academy Award.ldquoSuddenly, writes Cavalier, ldquothe rush was on for computer-animated features.The rush became a torrent, with ious Hollywood animation studios getting in on an increasingly lucrative trend in film-making and opening a new chapter in the history of animation, a history in which key moments had ranged from early Disney classics to works by influential figures as erse as Tex Avery, Ray Harryhausen and Stirling-born Norman McLaren.Today, the list of top-earning animation movies on the Box Office Mojo website is headed by such films as Incredibles  , Finding Dory, Shrek , The Lion King, Toy Story , Frozen, Finding Nemo, The Secret Le Of Pets, Despicable Me , and Inside Out. Merchandising tie-ins and DVD sales have also been hugely profitable.In , the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences launched a new Oscar category, for Animated Feature Film. The first winner was DreamWorks Animationrsquos Shrek, followed in successive yea rs by Spirited Away, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Wallace  Gromit in The Curse Of The Were-Rabbit, Happy Feet, Ratatouille, WALL-E, Up, Toy Story , Rango, Brave, Frozen, Big Hero , Inside Out, Zootopia, Coco, and Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse. Of these  winners, no fewer than half were products of Disney Pixar.Animated films have become increasingly sophisticated in terms of their storylines. Again, Disney Pixar has blazed an adventurous trail, giving the world films about a lonely little robot cleaning up a ruined Earthan elderly widower who tethers balloons to his house in order to embark on one last adventurethe control centre of the mind of an -year-old girland a young Mexican boy stranded in the Land of the Dead .There was also that remarkably daring scene in Toy Story  when for a few minutes the toys resigned themselves to be an appalling fate, in a trash-incinerating facility. This, observed Empire film magazine, was ldquoa scene of such intense, exquisite end-of-the-line poignancy mdash also the scariest moment of the whole [Toy Story] series mdash that it deserves comparison with Snow Whitersquos terried forest flight, or the shooting of Bambirsquos mother.Indeed, much has been made of the emotional palette of the best animated films, and of the \"le lessons\" that can be learned from them. \"Negative feelings are perfectly okay\" is one such, gleaned from Inside Out. Bereavement and grief were powerful impulses in Up.The software used in the making of the films has steadily grown more sophisticated, too.Asnoted this week, the first Toy Story film, in addition to being a critical and box-office success, also helped Pixar to win an ldquoanimation arms race, with visual effects going on to become a staple of blockbuster films. The crucial weapon in all of this, the paper added, is RenderMan, a software tool that enables film-makers to create photorealistic computer images.Toy Story  was made on an updated version of RenderMan, using ray tracing, which, says the , allows animators to achieve granular detail on light shading.Rob Redman, editor of D World  D Artist, is quoted as saying: ldquoThe outdoor scenes in Toy Story  are really where it comes into its own. You get the blues and greens where the sky is bouncing off the floor: it makes everything feel lush and vibrant. \"Realistic\" is not quite the word, but it does feel more real.

This could take the form of increased headage payments under the existing beef calf support scheme.The SBA, along with NFU Scotland and other industry stakeholders, have been pressing Mr Ewing on the issue and SBA chairman, Neil McCorkindale, was hoping for an announcement by the Cabinet Secretary at the event.This didn’t materialise but Mr Ewing indicated he was sympathetic to the plea and accepted the argument that headage payments would be a more effective approach than area based support which would simply encourage inertia in the industry.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Owners Jonny and Ali Aspden\"  Popular Ellon coffee shop extends opening hoursviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Aby Wilson, Stuart Wood, Elaine Lownds, George Laing, and Director Nicola Alexander of Bethan Customs Consultancy\"  Oldmeldrum start-up doubles team viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"bus timetable consultation","story":"Stagecoach North Scotland is inviting customers to review its proposed timetables until Friday, June .All feedback received will be reviewed ahead of the final timetables being submitted for registration.The new timetables are planned to take effect from Monday, August .Stagecoach representatives will be available to discuss the proposals at a number of events including the Aberdeenshire Area Bus Forum on Thursday, June  at Gordon House in Inverurie from .pm to .pm.Another meeting will be held on Monday, June  at Kemnay Village Hall from .pm to .pm.Feedback can also be sent via email no later than Friday, June  to nscotmarketing@stagecoachbus.David Liston, managing director for Stagecoach North Scotland said: “Our plans to revise our network in August follow a thorough analysis of the performance of our bus services and also take on board feedback from our customers, stakeholders and staff.“We continually monitor our services and these revisions will allow us to improve our reliability and use all of our resources in the best way to meet the demand for bus travel across the region.“All feedback received helps us to ensure we have optimised departure times and routes.”data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Will you be one of the  \"  Countdown to Bosie on Bennachie fundraiser viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"garioch sc launches new children s activities programme","story":"Garioch Sports Centrethis week announced that it islaunching GSCkids, a new programme of children#s activities, in a bid to make children#s activities more accessible in the local area.Launching on Wednesday, August , children will still be able to enjoy their favourites, including additional football classes, and some new additions including Junior Boxercise.GSC will also be offering preschool gymnastics classes in partnership with Donside Gymnastics for the very first time.Sandra Simpson of Donside Gymnastics commented: “We’re delighted to be launching five brand new preschool gymnastics classes at Garioch Sports Centre. “Classes are suitable from .- years old and are the \u2028perfect pathway into our school-age gymnastics programme.”Garioch Sports Centre’s Kevin Bonarius, chief operating officer, added: ‘The aim of GSCkids is to provide a safe and inclusive environment for local children and their families and carers to enjoy active lestyles while having fun.“Our doors are open to children of all ages and abilities.

This year local Scottish Fire and Rescue team will once again have a fire engine at the clinic to help draw attention to the clinic.Councillor Drever added: #The safety checks are carried out by a specially trained Good Egg Safety expert, not police officers # so people should not feel they are at risk of getting into trouble.“Rather it#s an opportunity to get some reassurance that your car seat is compatible with your vehicle, and to get tips and advice on any adjustments that would improve the car seat’s performance. We#d urge anyone who drives children about # whether that#s childminders, grandparents and parents or wider friends – to drop into the clinic. It is five or ten minutes of your time well spent.”The Good Egg Safety Child Seat clinic will be held in the Tesco car park in Kirkwall on Wednesday July , running from am to pm. There#s no need to book — just look for the Good Egg rep in the Tesco foyer, or head for the red fire engine.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Providing practical training for riders where they can improve their skills and understanding of risks through controlled exercises is a vital part of this strategy.“Motorcyclists are vastly over-represented in serious road injuries, so I hope that Orkney’s motorcyclists will take up this opportunity to both become a safer road user and improve their overall riding experience through better bike handling skills.”Anyone interested in attending the course should email: operationriderrefinement@scotland.pnn.police.ukcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Not content with writing just one book, he decided to author two: one will be the scuttle story in photographs, From Scuttle to Salvage, which will be launched this Thursday, June . The  other, The Last Days of the High Seas Fleet, is the more in depth story of the German Naval mutiny, and how the Fleet came to be interned in Scapa. Both are on sale at the Orcadian Bookshop.As with Jutland, Nick decided to tell the story in film. He is passionate about passing history on to his childrens’ generation, and says he felt that this would be a best way of reaching younger people who prefer video to text. The -minute animation has already been seen by more than , people online, and was made possible through crowdfunding and the help of numerous museums and archives, the Kirkwall Library and Archives being among them.Nick will be talking about the scuttle on June  at pm at the St Magnus Centre, where with him, many of the descendants will participate. He’ll also talk at Stromness Academy on Monday June , and at Kirkwall Grammar School that afternoon. He will also sign copies of From Scuttle to Salvage at The Orcadian Bookshop on June , from am to pm.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Barb provides data from meters fitted to TV, computers and tablets from ,  members.Among the  shows to record no viewers at all were several editions of news bulletin The Seven, discussion show The Collective and new music programme Tune.Former BBC editor Tim Luckhurst, who is now a professor in journalism, said: \"These figures are deplorable. But they simply confirm the central flaw in the entire project - there was never a shred of audience demand for it.\"It was launched as a forlorn attempt to please the SNP, a classic example of why the BBC should never bow to political bullying.\"Scottish Conservative culture spokesman Rachael Hamilton said: \"These viewing figures are undoubtedly disappointing. If they remain this low, licence fee payers will ask why so much money is spent on it.\"But a spokesperson for the BBC said: \"Its not unusual for digital channels outwith the main five to occasionally record zero audiences under the Barb system. There were only  instances during core hours when zero audiences were recorded over February  and June  - seven were just one-minute editions of The Seven just as the channel comes to air.\"Overall, the channel is bucking the trend when it comes to engaging younger audiences.\"©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon chances of no brexit now more likely","story":"While recent developments at Westminster, including the emergence of Boris Johnson as front-runner in the Conservative leadership race, have made a hard Brexit more likely, it has also increased the chances of no Brexit, it was claimed yesterday.Speaking during a visit to the Royal Highland Show, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warned of the “catastrophic damage” that a no-deal Brexit would wreak on the Scottish economy.Ms Sturgeon said the chances of no-deal had been increasing ever since the European elections, Prime Minister Theresa May’s resignation and the Conservative leadership election, which she said was between two fairly hardline Brexiteers with the front-runner “almost relishing the idea of leaving with no deal”. Ms Sturgeon said: “I think that that should worry everybody who understands the damage that would do to Scotland, to our economy overall – and particularly to sectors like agriculture. That said, I think the possibility of averting Brexit has also increased since the European election.”The First Minister saidit was possible to get Jeremy Corbyn “off the fence” on the question of a second referendum, moves could be undertaken to build a consensus for gaining a majority in the House of Commons for a second referendum: “So we are in this perhaps rather strange situation where the risk of no-deal is rising, but the risk of stopping Brexit has also increased and there’s a real sense that that is up for grabs.”Commenting on how much the Scottish Government could do to offset what she termed the “disastrous consequences” that a no-deal would deliver to many sectors, including agriculture and in particular sheep farmers who could face huge tarfs, Ms Sturgeon warned: “We will look to do whatever we can to help dferent sectors and dferent industries, but our first priority must be to do everything we can to avert a no-deal Brexit happening.“But we’re not going to kid people on about the extent to which we can mitigate the damage of a no-deal Brexit – it would be catastrophic andI say to people, ‘Yes, we can take away all of the damage of that’ then I’m not doing my duty in saying to people that it would be so serious that we need to double, triple, quadruple our efforts to stop it.”l The First Minister also launched a food education programme designed to teach children and young people about Scotland’s food industry. The Good Food Futures programme, which is backed by £ million of Scottish Government funding, aims to give children a greater understanding of where food comes from and the range of career opportunities available in the industry.The programme will also include support for more farm visits, healthy cooking lessons and put more locally produced healthy food on school menus.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"renegotiation calls are wasting time eu tells leadership hopefuls","story":"European Union leaders have warned the Tory candidates vying to become prime minister they are #wasting time# and won#t secure a renegotiation of the UK#s Brexit deal.At a summit in Brussels, EU chiefs sent a clear message the existing withdrawal agreement was the only basis for an orderly Brexit, with both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt calling for changes to the Irish border backstop.And European Council president Donald Tusk suggested that Mr Johnson, who led the Leave campaign in , was one of those who had earned a “special place in hell” for failing to plan for how they would deliver Brexit.Following the summit, German chancellor Angela Merkel said: “We made it very clear we wish to co-operate with the newly elected [British] prime minister.“We will enter into talks, but we underline yet again, that the withdrawal agreement has been negotiated.”When an extension to Article  was agreed in April, giving the UK until  October to raty the Brexit deal, Mr Tusk pleaded with British politicians: “Do not waste this time.”Askedthe Tory leadership contest was wasting time, Mr Tusk told journalists: “When it comes to Brexit as such, yes, I am afraid that you are wasting time.“But I can understand why – the internal problems of political formation in London.“This is something we should respect.

OK, yes it isspeeding.Surely the issue is appropriate speed # like doing  mph when there are pedestrians or next to schools, built up areas, where there is a limit etc Kat is so right to complain about dangerous driving.It has become an unwanted fad amongst young menwho must be so stupid and so bored that they are prepared to risk le and limbto get their kicks. My belief is that the pointless and brainless cavortings of silly,silly moronic types on programmes like Top Gear are partly to blame.In addition , street racing in cities like London take place late at night driving people to distraction.Police keep an eye on proceedings but it still goes on. Not easy for police cars to safely keep up with idiots in illegally souped up cars travelling , as reported, at  mph.I understand people that have the need for speed. But keep in mind, just because you think you#re a confident driver, that you are safe because you can drive. Doesn#t mean you#re safe. Just recently there was a news report about a drunk driver going off the road and hitting another car. If you#re going at a high speed and that thing comes at you, what can you do  Swerve  There#s a good chance you#re dead, in hospital or best case scenario, your car is totalled.Just because you think you#re a competent driver, doesn#t mean everyone  is. Drive safe.Of course, accidents do happen even to competent,confident, safe drivers but there are people who cast aside such standards in favour of dangerous, unlawful behaviour.These are the ones who need to be severely apprehended.Try to be less pedantic when reading comments.Johan, youseemto have missed the point of Kat’s letter.Nobody has said that overtaking is illegal or wrong but It was estimated that the Audi was travelling at around  to  mph. An offence.In addition , about six or more cars were overtaken in one fell swoop.Not advisable by any stretch of the imagination. Suppose there had been a need to suddenly pull in due to an unforeseen hazard.Something would have had to give , possibly causingan accident.My father used to say to me when I was learning to drive “ always drive asother drivers are stupid”.In short, drive defensively NOT offensively.It seems to me that the Audi driver falls into the stupid category.Better to be ten minutes late in this world than fty years too early in the next.Have you seen this stretch of road  It is the only place in Shetland where there is a lane for overtaking # that is two lanes going up a hill.Very often you are overtaking quite a few things even at  mph going up because of slow things and other cars not overtaking.Unless she actually had a speed gun she cannot judge the speed of things. I regularly see traffic pouring down Herrislea hill and I know that although it looks fast, some of them are actually sticking to the  mph limit.I maintain that it’s better to be safe than sorry.Ease off and keep the undertaker waiting !! Or,you feel so inclined, speed up and become a statistic.Your choice.You need a fair few horses to go up some of our hills at  mph. She is right in that respect, it would need to be a #sporty blue audio or similar#.Johan, I’ve driven on the roads of Shetland and I can’t recall any that could be called steep.Gentle slopes maybe but nothing to compare with the really steep roads of Scotland and Wales. Even England has some pretty steep examples in the Lake District.The sharpest inclines I’ve experienced in Shetlandare on Foula.I doubt that quad bikes would be much use on the hills though I have seenthem being driven on the low level road.It would be interesting to gauge why people bought a certain model of vehicle in proportion to its top speed, and whether or not this was a deciding factor  The power of an engine could be compared as well  How often would the said person go well over the speed limit just to test the engine or impress a passenger in the vehicle with them regardless of any safety  If a vehicle can do  # mph, why would this be allowed  Why would there not be a limiter to say mph installed If the law allows such vehicles to be sold, why would this be the case Good questionI think more and more there will be speed limiters on cars and insurance companies and Companies already want these.Johan,The EU has already sorted this one for us.Thanks MHJ. Electric self charging cars available by then too I would think.It’s an attractive and interesting idea Johan but I doubt that such a short time scale will see the hope come to fruition.Predictions do not suggest that the high cost of EV manufacture will reduce for quite some time to make such purchases viable in the immediate future.Motor production is going through an increasingly lean time and it seems unlikely to me that the decline will bounce back into the black by trying to incrrease the sales of expensive electric cars.

Abandoned - BlissThe first dog to arrive at the centre was -year-old Spaniel Grace, found by a member of the public at the side of the road. She was taken to the vet immediately, but after an owner didn’t come forward, she was brought to Dogs Trust.Two weeks ago, another Spaniel - aged eight and nicknamed Bliss by the team - was found tied to a fence not far from the rehoming centre. Like Grace, the Spaniel has not been microchipped, which has been a legal requirement for all dogs since  and the easiest way to identy a dog who has become separated from their owner. Shockingly just one week later, a Cairn Terrier - less than a year old, was found by a rehoming centre staff member at the very same spot where Bliss was left. Terrier Rizzo was lucky to be found as she is quite small and it would have been easy to miss her in the long grass.The most recent addition to the ranks of abandoned pooches is Sally, an eight-year-old Collie cross, who was found as a stray by a member of the public and brought to the rehoming centre.Abandoned - RizzoOonagh Philips, Rehoming Centre Manager said: “We want to remind anyone who no longer feels that they can care for their dog to contact their local rescue organisation for support. When a dog is abandoned on the road side, it not only puts them in danger, but also drivers. We are so thankful that all four of these dogs were found when they were.“Grace and Bliss were very shaken up by their ordeal when they came into our care and it took them a couple of days to build trust around people again. We could tell Rizzo hadn’t eaten in a while, which could have resulted in a deterioration of her physical health. Sally is incredibly sweet natured, and just like the others, will make a wonderful addition to the right home.“We are not sure why there has been a recent influx in dogs being abandoned. We always remind people that ‘A Dog is for Le®’ but we understand that le happens, and places like Dogs Trust are there to support any dog owner who experiences a bump in the road and needs our help. Sometimes the most responsible thing we can do as a dog owner is admit that we aren’t coping with our pets, but it is important to ensure they are kept safe and not left to fend for themselves.”If you are interested in adopting a dog please get in touch with the team at Dogs Trust Ballymena on  or visit www.dogstrust.org.uk our-centres ballymenaAbandoned - SallyThis is how many points youll get on your licence for these driving offences Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"try catch "},{"url":null,"title":"this is how many points you ll get on your licence for these driving offences","story":"Drivers who accumulate  or more penalty points from motoring offences within a three-year period can face a ban from driving for up to six months, while six or more penalty points within two years of passing your driving test can lead to a license withdrawal and a re-test requirement.

As a result of its strategic importance both sides concentrated some of their best armoured regiments and equipment in this area. The Guards Armoured Brigade comprised of three tank battalions and had been set up and trained in England. The three battalions were the nd Battalion of the Grenadier Guards, the st Battalion of the Coldstream Guards and the nd Battalion of the Irish Guards. The Irish Guards were recruited from Northern Ireland and the nd Battalion contained men from the Province. You can see it in the tank commanders names. We have Agnew, Brennan, Carson, Connolly, Healy, Harbinson, Mahoney, McCorkell, McGuire, McHugh and Robinson amongst others.The nd Battalion Irish Guards was equipped with American Sherman tanks. These were  ton Medium tanks and mainly equipped with a  mm gun, a useful weapon against infantry but not entirely satisfactory against tanks. The battalion was organised into sub units. There were three squadrons in the battalion, each composed of four troops and each troop had four tanks. The Irish Guards named their tanks after towns and the nd Squadron named theirs with B’s. So we have Ballina, Bangor, Bantry, Belfast, Benbane and Ballynahinch. We also have Ballyraggett and BallymenaBallymena was a special Sherman tank. Ballymena did not have the standard  mm gun. The inconvenient truth for the Allied tank crews was that their tanks were not as good as the best of German ones. A German Tiger tank, for example could destroy a Sherman tank at a distance of over a mile. A Sherman on the other hand would be lucky to harm a Tiger at  yards.  The Britsh crews themselves had already concluded that a Sherman tank was not considered as safe a location as many would have been believed. Hence they covered the front with extra metal tracks and the propensity of the Sherman to do a “Ronson”, that is light up, encouraged the crew to get out very quickly.To deal with the stronger German tanks the Allies devised a way of mounting a bigger gun on some of the Shermans. This new gun was so big it meant redesigning the tank and reducing the size of the crew. These Shermans, now armed with a  pounder gun, which referred to the weight of the shell it fired, were nicknamed FireflyThe Irish Guards arrived in Normandy  days after the initial D Day landings. Caen had still not been completely captured so the Irish Guards eere given a mission to help bypass the city of Caen by gaining ground to the east of the city and drive towards the village of Cagny. This was Operation Goodwood, named after the racecourse in England.Undercover of darkness on the night of th July, Ballymena and the other tanks moved over the River Orne on newly constructed bridges and prepared for battle.The smoke, noise and movement of the battlefield created chaos. Units became mixed up and both sides sometimes got lost. This led to one of the most famous incidents of the battle. By the middle of the afternoon of July th the Irish Guard’s assault is under fire, stalled and mud bound outside the village of Cagny. Lt John Gorman of B Squadron th troop commanding a mm armed Sherman called “Ballyraggett” gets slightly ahead of his comrades and spots a German King Tiger at about yrs. Knowing his gun could do little damage to the King Tiger, Lt Gorman chose a dramatic course of action. He had previously briefed his crew Gunner Albert Scholes, Driver James BaronRadio operator Agnew, and told themhe got the chance they would adopt “Navy tactics”. He instructed Baron to drive at full speed ahead and prepare to ram the German tank. Firing a high explosive shell at close range stunned the inexperienced German crew but had little impact on the tank. However, the high speed collision effectively immobilized both tanks. The Sherman and the King Tiger were abandoned and their crews hid in the fields.Lt Gorman realising the King Tiger was still a viable threat ran towards the nearest Sherman Firefly, in the knowledge only a  pounder gun on the Firefly could do any meaningful damage. This was Ballymena. Some of Ballymena’s crew were already either dead or injured but Gorman jumped in and directed fire on the abandoned King Tiger.  The fighting continued for a while but eventually Gorman was able to rescue his own and other crews and get back to safety.For his exploits Gorman - later Sir John - was awarded the Military Cross. Editor’s note: Sir John, who died aged  in May , was a Northern Irish Roman Catholic Unionist with an unflinching sense of service.After the war he joined the Royal Ulster Constabulary before becoming a senior manager with British Overseas Airways Corporation, then head of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. Finally he was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly as the sole Roman Catholic member of the Ulster Unionist Party, and served as Deputy Speaker until the Assemblys suspension in . He was a frequent visitor to Ballymena during his time with the NIHE and he never failed tomention that he had married a Ballymena woman, Norah Caruth.

At the time it was taken in the iconic Flamingo Ballroom, they were members of local rock’n’blues band, Tailor.The band was formed in the early s by Tucker McIlwee and John Tennant.“Other band members who played with Tailor over the years were Ronnie McAuley, Hubert Dunlop and Ricky Maybin, Henry McQuillan, Dave Moore Trevor Erwin andGerry McNeely. We were transported to and from the gigs by Brian Surgenor, ” says John.“Our first gig was at a place called Betty Staffs in Belfast but we travelled throughout Ireland playing most of the towns on the circuit.“Amazingly, we had never played in Ballymena until Sammy Barr of the Flamingo approached our manager to offer a booking.”It transpired that Tailor were playing on the same bill as Rory Gallagher. As you would expect, the group were excited but, in their own words, ‘not overwhelmed.’John remembers: “We met with Rory and his band during set up,. Rory was a very down to earth guy. We discussed what songs we were going to play as we were going to have a one hour set. The Flamingo was full to the brim, the crowd were electric and Tailor recieved a tremendous welcome.“Following the gig we met with Rory for the photo call. The rest is history. Tailor continued to travel theand breadth of Ireland entertaining the young and not so young ravers until the group members went their seperate ways after six years of traveling on the road.”After years of inaction the group reformed to play two gigs for Cancer research, The Countryman Inn and the Telecom Club were filled to capacity for the night of nostalgia and entertainment. pound was raised for charity.And John ponders: “Will the group do it again  Watch this space!”Rory Gallagherwas an Irish blues and rock multi-instrumentalist,songwriter, and producer.Born in Ballyshannon, County Donegal, and brought up in Cork, Gallagher recorded solo albums throughout the s and s, after forming the band Taste during the late s. His albums have sold over  million copies worldwide.Gallagher received a liver transplant in , but died of complications later that year in London at the age of .He began playing after school with Irish showbands, while still in his early teens. Having completed a musical apprenticeship and influenced by the increasing popularity of beat groups during the early s, Gallagher formed The Taste, which was later renamed simply, Taste, a blues rock and RB power trio, in .Performing extensively in the UK, the group played regularly at the Marquee Club, supporting both Cream at their Royal Albert Hall farewell concert, and the blues supergroup Blind Faith on a tour of North America.After the break-up of Taste, Gallagher toured under his own name. The s were Gallaghers most prolic period. He produced ten albums in that decade, including two live albums, Live in Europe and Irish Tour . November  saw the release of the album Deuce. In the same year he was voted Melody Makers International Top Guitarist of the Year, ahead of Eric Clapton. Though he sold over thirty million albums worldwide, it was his marathon live performances that won him greatest acclaim. He is documented in Irish Tour , a film directed by Tony Palmer.During the heightened periods of political unrest in Northern Ireland, as other artists were warned not to tour, Gallagher was resolute about touring Ireland at least once a year during his career, winning him the dedication of thousands of fans, and in the process, becoming a role model for other aspiring young Irish musicians.

Kenneth stands aghast as chants of ‘Greysteel seven, Ireland nil’ rain down from the stands as the match kicks off.Shell-shocked following the match and all that went on during those fraught  minutes, Kenneth brings Ernie home and begins to question what could be his inevitable pathhe doesn’t start making some changes.Lead actor Matthew Forsythe has a total of  roles to portray in this fast, furious and incredibly demanding one-man show. It’s no easy task but each character is brought to le vividly through his tone, his stance and his voice. Even a simple fold of the arms can work wonders, whether’s it’s Kenneth’s ‘keeping up with the Jones’ snooty we Deborah, his boss Gerry, or Wee Ernie, the bitter and wheezing father-in-law.Chris Hunter’s set design is in a sense the only other character beside Kenneth and that too is brought imaginatively and effectively to le. Astro turf gives us our pitch, but it’s the innovative scattering of cardboard boxes that turn into Kenneth’s car, his desk, chair – even the soaring New York skyline – which work to greatest effect. A particularly effective ploy is the backdrop of a distorted mirror showing us, the audience, and inviting us to join Kenneth on his journey of reflection.The play comes  years after the curtain first came up in Dubblejoint’s Whiterock theatre space. It remains as dramatic, funny, poignant, worrying and challenging as it was when it burst into our consciousness all those years ago. The question is, how much has changed outside the theatre A Night in November runs at the Lyric Theatre until June  and will then go on tour.

Parishioners and well-wishers packed into Corpus Christi Church for am Mass as the Springhill congregation came together to give thanks for Fr Des’ dedicated service to the West Belfast community.Parish Priest of Corpus Christi Fr Paddy McCafferty, who celebrated the special service, praised Fr Des’ “immense strength and dedication” within and to the community and said the depths of gratitude felt towards him are “immeasurable.” “Fr Des is a champion of the people, Fr Des saw was needed to be done and did it, he is a man without equal.”“Fr Des co-ordinated, instigated and educated the community. I’m almost lost for words when it comes to describing him. I was looking up the meaning of the word ‘platinum’, it means hard wearing, hard, Fr Des was rock hard in his work for the community. What would people have done without him ”On celebrating his Platinum Jubilee Fr Des said: “I never thought I would get this far.“There were more than  priests ordained the same day as I was, most of them are gone from this world, a mere handful of us laughing about which of us will reach the th birthday first.“What I want to do now, most of all is to thank God for allowing me to live among such good family, friends and neighbours during those years. You taught me what le means you taught me that especially during the bad, sad times. I believe we are seeing the beginning of a renewed Ireland, a renewed Christianity, a renewed city of Belfast – and we are privileged to live in one of the most beautul parts of the city – between the beautul mountain that is full of surprises like the feast of bluebells in the beginning of summer to the snow topped hills in winter, between the sweeping magnicent valley of the Lough and the Lagan,” he said. “This must surely be one of the most beautul places for a city to be in.”Fr Des continued: “This is where I learned the best lessons about le and I am grateful to family, friends, neighbours who taught me and even had great patience when I learned so slowly. I learned how good people show their dignity even during the hardest of times, show it most of all during the hard times. “So I am grateful to God for being here, grateful, to all whom I have had the privilege of being family and neighbour to. And very, very hopeful for the future.“Coming out of the worst of times we could now be facing into the best of times. May God and good people make it so. Father Paddy, like our friend Father Aiden, you are with us all at the beginning of a newly awakened Church and a people refreshed by what they have suffered and achieved together. We have good reason to be thankful for that and for each other.#"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"from detroit to north belfast how a big name does a big job","story":"TO say the name Kronk Boxing Gym is iconic in the sport would be an understatement. Located in Detroit and once led by trainer Emanuel Steward, the name is a household word in the sport of boxing.But North Belfast has its a Kronk Boxing Gym, located in the Duncairn Centre on Duncairn Avenue.Formed as Belfast ABC over  years ago by Bobby McAllister, one of the best coaches in Ireland at the time, the club has come a long way since.In December , former secretary of the gym, Damien McCann, played a pivotal role in Limerick boxer Andy Lee turning pro. He then negotiated a lucrative financial management agreement for Lee to turn professional with Emanuel Steward from the world renowned Detroit Kronk Boxing GymLee was Ireland’s rising amateur boxing star and when he beat USA champion, Jesus Gonzales in the semi-finals of the World Junior Championship, a new relationship between Steward and Kronk in Detroit was born with Belfast ABC gym, hence its name today, Kronk ABC Belfast.Past professional coach Tony Dunlop has been a key figure throughout the history of Kronk ABC Belfast and spoke about the club’s illustrious time.“This place started over  years ago when Bobby McAllister walked past the building which was derelict at the time and thought it would be perfect place for a boxing gym,” he explained.“He asked people in the community who were very positive and said that it would be great for young people in the area.“After a period of time, a lot of kids came through the doors. Ryan Burnettt and Paddy Barnes both started off here.“Burnett was groomed from his early days in here to become a superstar. He left here at  fights undefeated and was one of the best in the world at just  years old.“The turning point I suppose was when Emanuel Steward from Kronk gym in Detroit, which is the best gym in the history of boxing, got in touch.“He saw some of the work we were doing and Belfast Kronk Boxing Gym was born –the rest is history as they say.“We have continued to bring through a lot of champions including professionals James Tennyson and Daniel McShane.“Tommy McCarthy is also here now fighting professional.”Today, the club is going from strength to strength under the stewardship of a new breed of coaches in the shape of Paddy Saunders and Martin McCullough.The duo have embarked on a new programme of coaching young people from North Belfast with the aim of using boxing to their benefit.Tony added: “Paddy Saunders and Martin McCullough are both fantastic coaches. They are flying the flag for Belfast Kronk Gym today.“They have started off a new programme with the youth of the area. They are both giving it a million per cent. I’ve never seen two coaches work as hard. Kronk Gym could not be in better hands.”Classes for - to -year-olds take place every Monday, Wednesday and Friday from .pm to .pm with classes for  years and older from .pm to pm on the same days.Paddy Saunders explained: “Many of the kids have behavioural problems and some suffer from autism.“These classes are an outlet and something to focus and concentrate on.“It is not all about boxing but something for them to do. They don’t miss classes.“If we get a few champions out of it, then brilliant, but it is for the kids.“Most boxing clubs don’t take kids at eight years old, but we do.“All the kids start off exercising and running about the big hall before they come into the boxing gym itself.“They are putting their energy into something positive instead of being on the street and engaging in vandalism and anti-social behaviour. I believe there is a bright future for boxing in North Belfast. We have a top-class facility and there are a lot of good kids in here.”To find out more about the club and to get involved, check out the new Kronk ABC Belfast Facebook page."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"local mla gets brexit safety alert","story":"POLICE have delivered an extraordinary advice list to the West Belfast home of a Sinn Féin MLA suggesting ways in which he can improve his and his family’s personal security post-Brexit.The document has already been delivered to the homes of all  MPs across the United Kingdom, but officers who called to the home of Máirtín Ó Muilleoir said they are widening distribution of the document to take in Brexit spokespersons of parties in the north. The leaflet – headlined ‘When It Goes Too Far’ – outlines steps that politicians should takethey are targeted by extremists in any wave of public unrest that may break out post-October , the latest deadline for the UK leaving the EU.The document – which Mr Ó Muilleoir yesterday branded “Brexit bollox – has been compiled by a number of UK agencies: the National Police Chiefs’ Council, the Crown Prosecution Service, the College of Policing and the Electoral Commission. Despite its wide experience in dealing with public unrest, the PSNI has not been involved in drawing up the guidelines. But local police officers have been tasked with distributing it to MLAs closely connected to the Brexit issue.To the fore in the security advice is what Mr Ó Muilleoir and his family should do in the event of being targeted with a hazardous substance. Police advice is to:• Leave the house and seek fresh air.• Treat itchy or painful skin with water.• Remove outer clothing – but not by pulling it over the head.• Remove any substance that may contact clothing or skin by using a dry absorbent material or brushing it off.Advice is also included on what signs may signal the presence of hazardous substances in the home.The leaflet also advises politicians not to engage with iniduals who may be “stalking harassing” them, either online or offline. It urges them to seek further advice on personal safety and building security from their local police force and to conduct a review of what personal information about them is available online.The leaflet explains that the advice is being forwarded for politicians to consultthey are subjected post-Brexit to “unacceptable levels of harassment and intimidation”. It continues: “In some cases, these behaviours and actions have reached the criminal threshold. The worst examples have led to violence and injury.”The most serious example of Brexit-inspired violence was the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox in June  in West Yorkshire by a gun- and kne-wieldingman holding extreme pro-Britain views. Mr Ó Muilleor said: “It seems preposterous to me that the PSNI is promoting Brexit security advice compiled at the behest of a UK government which for three years has shown itself so thoroughly inept in its handling of the issue. There’s little in this that isn’t already known to most people and no reason why it couldn’t have been emailed to me rather than dispatching a police patrol. There are Catholic families in my South Belfast constituency living under the jackboot of the UVF and the flegger bully-boys. The PSNI would be better advised to protect those folk rather than wasting their time and my time with this Brexit bollox.”"},{"url":null,"title":"9000 in northern ireland apply to secure status after","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

cannot accept alternative arrangements to checks on the border as a replacement for the backstop, the country’s premier has said.Leo Varadkar said he could not accept the deletion of the backstop insurance mechanism from the Withdrawal Agreement unless it had been demonstrated how such arrangements would work in practice to ensure there are no customs checks on the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .A new body of experts has been set up in the UK to look at potential alternative arrangements.Read MoreExtent of Irish north-south cooperation revealed in secret Brexit impact mapping exercise reportFuture PM seeking to delay Brexit would face EU hostility – VaradkarExpert  appointed to advise UK government on alternative arrangements for Irish border after BrexitMany Brexiteers believe technological solutions could replace the backstop. But Mr Varadkar said he could not see evidence of arrangements being outlined before the October  deadline for the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.If there is a no-deal Brexit at the end of October, Ireland will be under an obligation to protect the single market.Leo VaradkarThe Taoiseach made the remarks at the end of an EU summit in Brussels as European Council president Donald Tusk said Brexit would become “more exciting” than before with a change of British prime minister but that the EU’s position had not changed.Mr Varadkar said: “We can’t accept that alternative arrangements are an alternative to a backstop unless we can see what these alternative arrangements are, know how they would work and see them demonstrated.“That hasn’t been done yet and I don’t see that being done this side of October  which is why we certainly can’t accept the deletion of the backstop.”He added: “For us, a deal without a backstop is effectively no deal because it means that there is no legal guarantee we won’t have a hard border, there is no operable mechanism by which we can avoid a hard border, it would just be a case of trying to pull it off, which I don’t think really is much of a solution.”Mr Varadkar said EU leaders had reaffirmed that the Withdrawal Agreement was not open for renegotiation and they agreed that negotiations would only take place between the UK and the EU.But he said the Irish government would have an “obligation” to protect the single market in the event of a no-deal outcome.“If there is a no-deal Brexit at the end of October, Ireland will be under an obligation to protect the single market, it’s our single market, our economy and our jobs are dependent on it,” he said.“We will have to make sure that Ireland doesn’t become the back door to the European single market.”He added that the only way he could see of being sure of avoiding a hard border was through regulatory alignment.Asked about the Tory leadership race, Mr Varadkar highlighted that both of the candidates, who remain in the running to become prime minister, had voted for the Withdrawal Agreement.He said he looked forward to holding a meeting with the new prime minister and discussing potential changes to the Political Declaration.But he reiterated that there would be “no implementation period for the UKthere is no Withdrawal Agreement and there will be no Withdrawal Agreementthere’s no backstop”."},{"url":null,"title":"22 northern ireland schools could close because

However, the -page mapping exercise gives an insight into the extent we could be impacted.The scope of areas highlighted is broad and includes everything from health, travel, waterways, animal movement and organised crime and drugs to benefit fraud, schooling, library provision and teacher and doctor qualications.For each of the  sectors, the document species the extent to which it is underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement as well as by existing EU legal and policy frameworks.In the case of the North West Cancer Centre, the report points out that the initiative was based on an intergovernmental agreement between Health Ministers from both jurisdictions.It says the centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, which opened in November , \"offers radiotherapy services closer to home for many patients from the north west, reducing their travel time signicantly\".Similarly, the All-Island Congenital Heart Disease Network is identied as ensuring that \"vulnerable children\" receive treatment on the island of Ireland. The network has a single surgical centre in Dublin and a specialist childrens cardiology centre in Belfast, supported by cardiology expertise in local hospitals. There is also cross-border cooperation on organ and tissues transplants. Nineteen areas are linked to the avoiding a hard border objective and include everything from customs and physical checks on live animals crossing the border to rules on movement of national treasures.Current EU rules \"stop national treasures from leaving the country and prevent illicit trafficking and looting\". Other less obvious areas mentioned in the report include the operation of cross-border taxis repatriation of waste and cross-border movement of waste, and even the management of Lough Erne eel stocks.It also species areas such as invasive alien species, chemicals regulation and wildfire initiatives.DUP MEP Diane Dodds said that in the majority of areas ongoing cross-border cooperation would be addressed by retaining the common travel area and pursuing an agreement on free trade and customs. \"In many cases, where frameworks are highly integrated, the circumstances are not unique to our province,\" she said.\"For instance the conditions required to operate both the Enterprise service between Dublin and Belfast and the Channel Tunnel will require a very similar technical agreement with Brussels. Genuine concerns in areas like agri-food and healthcare must be taken seriously.\"Sinn Fein MP Chris Hazzard said an expert  is not needed to show how disastrous a no-deal Brexit will be. He said: \"The British Government has now convened a  of experts to determine the impact of a no-deal Brexit on the North. \"It neednt have bothered as a range of experts have already given dire warnings of the disastrous impact a no-deal Brexit will have on the Norths economy, our rights and the Good Friday Agreement.\" Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington said the documents were part of \"initial scoping work\" by the Government, supported by the Civil Service here, the European Commission and the Republic.Mr Lidington said they were intended to form the basis of discussion and not final products.

The time for that has long since passed.”Mr Varadkar had a meeting with the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier on Thursday morning, at which, the Taoiseach said, the pair agreed that the Withdrawal Agreement would not be reopened but that they were willing to consider amendments to the joint Political Declaration.And he warned: “There’s no Withdrawal Agreement without a backstop and there’s no implementation period without a Withdrawal Agreement.”Two years on after the first round of #Brexit negotiations: good discussion with An Taoiseach @LeoVaradkar, @HMcEntee and their team today on Brexit 🇪🇺🇮🇪 pic ybCkhoJUFV— Michel BarnierJune , Mr Barnier, writing on Twitter, said the pair had a “good discussion”.Of the remaining three Tory leadership hopefuls, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said the EU “would be willing to renegotiate” a Brexit deal, and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has said he would delay Britain’s departurehe was on the cusp of deal.Front-runner Boris Johnson has said it is essential the UK leaves on October , and suggested the Irish backstop issues could be solved during the implementation period.Earlier, Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte said the next prime minister needs to realise a no-deal Brexit would be bad for the UK.He told BBC Radio ’s Today programme: “With a hard Brexit, even with a normal Brexit, the UK will be a dferent country.I would say a hard Brexit is a hard Brexit.

It is unavoidable.”And he said there could not be a transition perioda Withdrawal Agreement was not in place, telling the BBC: “As Boris Johnson would say, Brexit is Brexit.“I would say a hard Brexit is a hard Brexit. I don’t see how you can sweeten it.”Nigel Dodds claimed Mr Rutte’s remarks were “utterly uninformed and careless” and saidthe Dutch PM and other EU leaders want to protect the peace process in Northern Ireland “then they will not impose a deal which all unionists in Northern Ireland reject”.The DUP’s Westminster leader said: “The Republic of Ireland’s prime minister has been to the fore in feeding emotionally charged but inaccurate information to his fellow EU heads of government.The desire for murder is not driven by pro-EU sentiments or anti-Brexit sentiments but by a deep sectarian hatred of BritishnessNigel Dodds, DUP“From photocopying and distributing -year-old border bomb stories to repeatedly twisting the Belfast St Andrews Agreements for his own political ends, Leo Varadkar has painted a wildly inaccurate picture for the EU about Northern Ireland and theborder.“London, Brussels and Dublin have all confirmed that even in a no-deal scenario, there would be no hard border. Therefore the comments by Mark Rutte today were utterly uninformed and careless.“Mr Rutte may not realise, but only  days ago the same republican terrorist ideology which bombed the border checkpoints  years ago, attempted to murder a police officer in Belfast.“The desire for murder is not driven by pro-EU sentiments or anti-Brexit sentiments but by a deep sectarian hatred of Britishness.“If Mr Rutte and his fellow EU leaders really want to protect the peace process in Northern Ireland, then they will not impose a deal which all unionists in Northern Ireland reject.“They will work for a sensible deal which everyone can support.“Building a new border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom would run absolutely contrary to the Belfast Agreement.”"},{"url":null,"title":"half of northern ireland population neither unionist nor nationalist survey says","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

As recently as last week members of Westminsters Foreign Affairs Committee visited the area and heard similar concerns.Read MoreBrexits impact on many cross-border initiatives finally revealed in reportAs we boarded the plane to head back to London news broke of what would come to be known as the backstop agreement between the EU and UK namely that in the absence of another solution to keep the border open with no checks and no infrastructure, Northern Ireland would effectively remain within the EU customs union and large parts of the EUs single market.In the joint report published by the UK Government and the EU the following day - December ,  - we had the first mention of the mapping exercise which showed how North-South co-operation, established under the Belfast Good Friday Agreement, relied to a signicant extent on a common EU legal and policy framework.The document noted that the UKs departure from the EU \"gives rise to substantial challenges to the maintenance and development of North-South co-operation\".Hoping the mapping exercise would provide answers to the people we met in Co Armagh, our committee went to considerable efforts to secure its publication.We called for this to happen in reports in March, May and September .We wrote letters to consecutive Brexit Secretaries of State in April, August, October, November and December . We asked for the document, face-to-face, in April and July . Despite the publication of a technical explanatory note in December , we did not get the full story until this week, after it was obtained by a member of the public through a Freedom of Information request.The document, which we have now published, lists  areas of le in Northern Ireland that could be impacted by Brexit.It demonstrates very clearly that the residents of Armagh were right to be concerned, as many areas of co-operation are \"not underpinned or linked\" to an EU law but listed because of their link to the Good Friday Agreement.Its deeply disappointing that the Department for Exiting the EU did not choose to share this information with us or with the people of Northern Ireland. Its another example of the Government not giving Parliament the facts which we need to help inform our decision-making.The stakes are even higher now as the clock ticks and the Conservative leadership debate takes up some of the available time until October , just  weeks away.Alternative arrangements for the border are highly unlikely to be in place by then or indeed any time soon, which makes the transition and the backstop as important as ever. And as for leaving with no deal, our committee concluded in January that a managed no-deal cannot constitute the policy of any responsible Government.Hilary Benn MP is chair of the Committee on Exiting the European Union"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed five schools share the top spot in gcse league table results","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This is to ensure that staff welfare is protected and that the delivery of front line services is not adversely affected.\"With overall absence levels at Northern Irelands councils at their highest in   for two consecutive years and consistently ranking as the highest in the United Kingdom, with no indication of improvement, I have decided that councils could benefit from a more detailed report in this area.\"She said the Audit Office would investigate the matter more extensively.Overall, councils are in a financially strong position and managed their finances well in  , the report continued. The £m spent providing services to the public works out at £ on average for every person here.Councils received income of £m, % of which was from district rates.As of March , councils had outstanding loans totalling £.m. In   councils paid almost £m towards the principal outstanding balance and £m in interest costs.Use of agency staff not giving value for moneySome councils are still too heavily reliant on agency staff, leading to warnings that using them is not delivering value for money.In  , total employee costs totalled £m — around % of operating expenditure — with agency staff accounting for a further % .The overall cost of agency staff has continued to increase year on year, rising by £.m last year.Most of this increase was attributed to Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, and Lisburn and Castlereagh City Council.Agency costs at seven councils either reduced or remained relatively stable. That is an improvement on the previous year, when nine councils saw agency staff costs rise.Local government auditor Pamela McCreedy said: “In   some councils continued to be dependent on agency staff to deliver local services.“I will continue to keep the costs associated with agency staff under review across all councils, and I will also focus on the types of work they perform and theof time they have been working in the council.“There is a risk that over-reliance on agency staff over an extended period of time does not provide value for money.”Severance payouts cost £m from  to Almost £m was spent on council exit packages in the last year.Councils are required to disclose the number and costs of these payments.Expenditure includes compulsory and voluntary redundancy costs, pension contributions and other departure expenses.Over the four years from   to  ,  councils have paid a total of £.m in exit packages to staff. A total of  exit packages were agreed, with  exceeding £,.Many of the payments were linked to the reform of local government, which led to the creation of  super councils in .In   councils agreed  exit packages at a cost of £.m. The average cost was £, —  were greater than £,.The number and cost of exit packages has fallen signicantly since  .However, in the four years preceding  , the average number of exit packages was , with an average cost of £.m.Today’s report states: “The number and cost of exit packages in   remained high and is an indication that councils’ workforce plans had not stabilised.”Not one local authority ready for no-deal BrexitNo council is fully prepared for a no-deal Brexit, today’s report warns.It states the UK’s October  departure from the European Union presents a signicant risk to the operation of local government, and councils have been constrained in terms of planning.“The lack of clarity so far on the shape of an exit deal and a clear way forward, as well as the absence of additional funding, inevitably means that councils have been limited in terms of the practical preparations they can make,” the report states.“Exiting the European Union is a signicant risk to local government service delivery, in particular community planning, the economy and tourism.”Auditors found that Brexit preparations y across councils, with some establishing dedicated working groups or committees.It adds: “No council is fully ready, in operational terms, for a no-deal exit. The outworkings will have most impact on those councils which have a border with the Republic of Ireland.”The report also warns thatthe UK Government and EU fail to agree a withdrawal deal, there will be no transition period and councils will need to respond immediately."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38243182.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/Lisburn_Armed_Forces_Day007.jpg","title":"thousands descend on lisburn for armed forces day in northern ireland","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

alternative arrangements to checks on the border as a replacement for the backstop, the country’s premier has said..pushLeo Varadkar said he could not accept the deletion of the backstop insurance mechanism from the Withdrawal Agreement unless it had been demonstrated how such arrangements would work in practice to ensure there are no customs checks on the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland .A new body of experts has been set up in the UK to look at potential alternative arrangements.Many Brexiteers believe technological solutions could replace the backstop. But Mr Varadkar said he could not see evidence of arrangements being outlined before the October  deadline for the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.If there is a no-deal Brexit at the end of October, Ireland will be under an obligation to protect the single market.Leo VaradkarThe Taoiseach made the remarks at the end of an EU summit in Brussels as European Council president Donald Tusk said Brexit would become “more exciting” than before with a change of British prime minister but that the EU’s position had not changed.Mr Varadkar said: “We can’t accept that alternative arrangements are an alternative to a backstop unless we can see what these alternative arrangements are, know how they would work and see them demonstrated.“That hasn’t been done yet and I don’t see that being done this side of October  which is why we certainly can’t accept the deletion of the backstop.”He added: “For us, a deal without a backstop is effectively no deal because it means that there is no legal guarantee we won’t have a hard border, there is no operable mechanism by which we can avoid a hard border, it would just be a case of trying to pull it off, which I don’t think really is much of a solution.”Mr Varadkar said EU leaders had reaffirmed that the Withdrawal Agreement was not open for renegotiation and they agreed that negotiations would only take place between the UK and the EU.But he said the Irish government would have an “obligation” to protect the single market in the event of a no-deal outcome.“If there is a no-deal Brexit at the end of October, Ireland will be under an obligation to protect the single market, it’s our single market, our economy and our jobs are dependent on it,” he said.“We will have to make sure that Ireland doesn’t become the back door to the European single market.”He added that the only way he could see of being sure of avoiding a hard border was through regulatory alignment.Asked about the Tory leadership race, Mr Varadkar highlighted that both of the candidates, who remain in the running to become prime minister, had voted for the Withdrawal Agreement.He said he looked forward to holding a meeting with the new prime minister and discussing potential changes to the Political Declaration.But he reiterated that there would be “no implementation period for the UKthere is no Withdrawal Agreement and there will be no Withdrawal Agreementthere’s no backstop”."},{"url":null,"title":"we can sort out border after brexit says boris as rivals for pm lock horns","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

Its the UK that has the border with the Republic of Ireland and its for us to come forward with a solution that would work.\"I think everyone here would agree that what we cant have is ato border infrastructure on the island of Ireland.\"Mr Hunt added that the UK needs to show that it can keep the border open. \"I think that through technology we can do that but we have to do that in a way that doesnt trap us in the customs union,\" he said.Home Secretary Sajid Javid said he was \"% committed to the Good Friday Agreement and keeping an open border\".\"In my department, Borderforce has looked at this issue and its perfectly possible to have an open border with two dferent customs arrangements on either side of the border using existing technology,\" he said - although Ms Maitlis pointed out that the existence of the technology to do so is in doubt. \"Obviously it will take time to put that in place and it will cost money. I would have a time limit on the backstop. There will have to be some sort of compromise.\"International Development Secretary Rory Stewart said that he had visited Enniskillen and Londonderry recently and argued that Mr Johnsons plans wouldnt deal with trade tarfs for farmers in border regions.Mr Johnson said that there would \"be no tarfs or quotas\" and that he wanted a \"standstill in current arrangements\" until a trade agreement was negotiated.Mr Stewart said that the Withdrawal Agreement was legally binding and would not be renegotiated before October , and accused the other candidates of not explaining how they would enact their Irish border plans.Following the answers, the questioner Mark said that there was \"a lot of fear and confusion in Northern Irelandwe come crashing out without a deal\", adding that he had been \"hoping for more\" from the candidates.The backstop aims to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit, but opponents have claimed it could keep the UK aligned with the EU indefinitely and create a trade border in the Irish Sea.The backstop effectively ended Theresa Mays hopes of getting her Brexit deal through Parliament and its failure hastened her departure as Prime Minister.However, the EU has said it will not renegotiate the deal, which includes the backstop.Ballots of Conservative MPs will continue over the next few days to whittle the race down to the final two candidates. The final stage of the leadership race will begin and members will then vote on the next Party leader and Prime Minister, with the result expected on July ."},{"url":null,"title":"climate activist says mp who manhandled her has not apologised directly","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz himself was head of the presidential guard when he seized power in a  coup. He said he did so to prevent ato repressive military rule.He won a landslide election the following year in what opponents called a fraudulent “electoral coup”. Most opposition parties then boycotted the  election in which Mr Aziz won % of the vote according to official results.The president is barred by the constitution from seeking another term. In respecting term limits instead of seeking to change the constitution, he contrasts with several leaders where in Africa in recent years.His successor of choice is former defence minister Mohamed Ould El Ghazouani, a retired general who served as chief of staff of Mauritania’s armed forces.Mr Ghazouani was chosen by the ruling majority as a presidential candidate after his retirement. He has campaigned on his security credentials and the outgoing president’s record on fighting Islamic extremists.“Mauritania has to choose between Mohamed Ould El Ghazouani — who wants to strive toward security, development and progress — or vote for ato insecurity, bad management and corruption where there is hate, racism and destruction of national unity,” the outgoing president said at a press conference marking the end of campaigning.The moderate Islamic republic borders Mali, where jihadist rule forced tens of thousands to flee the country’s north to Mauritania in . While the security situation has deteriorated in Mali even after the extremists were ousted from control, Mauritania has not seen the spillover in violence experienced by Mali’s other neighbours Niger and Burkina Faso.The opposition candidates in this election include anti-slavery activist Biram Dah Abeid, who was elected to Parliament in September from his prison cell, where he was held on charges his supporters called politically motivated. He was released late last year after serving four months.Mauritania was the last country to abolish slavery, doing so in , but did not criminalise it until . Late last year, the United States ended trade benefits with Mauritania, saying the country is not making sufficient progress toward combating forced labour, including slavery.The Mauritanian government, however, denies that slavery is widespread.Candidate Kane Hamidou Baba of the “Living Together” coalition is representing parties backed by Mauritanians of sub-Saharan African descent.Other candidates include Sidi Mohamed ould Boubacar, a two-time former prime minister who is supported by the opposition Islamist party Mohamed ould Maouloud, candidate of the Opposition Coalition for Change and Mohamed Lemine El Mourteji Wafi, who hopes to draw the support of younger Mauritanians.A run-off election will take place next monthno one receives a majority of votes on Saturday."},{"url":null,"title":"closure derry hmrc office plan move workers belfast branded ludicrous tin eared decision","story":"A Derry MLA yesterday branded as \"ludicrous\" a decision to uproot HMRC staff from Derry and move them to Belfast.SDLP MLA Mark H. Durkan said that many of the  staff at Foyle House, on the Duncreggan Road, will be made redundant as it will be \"impossible\" for them to relocate to Belfast.In  HMRC announced that the Derry tax office would close in  .It came as part of a move to reconfgure its offices into thirteen regional centres serving every nation and region in the UK, with one of these centres being located in Belfast.In July  HMRC declared that its Belfast Regional Centre would be based at Erskine House, Chichester Street, Belfast, and expected to open in late . It is on schedule to open later this year.This week, Sir Jonathan Thompson, Chief Executive and Permanent Secretary of HMRC, sent a letter to Mark H. Durkan asserting that based on current plans Foyle House will close in September , with staff moving, where possible, to the Belfast Regional Centre.There are currently around  staff in Foyle House and Mr Thompson accepted that the majority live outside reasonable daily travel to Belfast.Mark H Durkan had asked that consideration be given to the integration of HMRC workers in Derry into the Northern Ireland Civil Service.Speaking to the Derry News yesterday, he said: “The intention of HMRC to close their offices here in September  is something I have been appealing against since it was announced in November .“I had written to Head of Civil Service, David Sterling to consider the integration of Derry staff to available DAERA positions in Ballykelly. Why this obvious solution has not been given due consideration is beyond me.“And while HMRC have acknowledged a duty of care to ex-employees, the current plan to relocate  staff members to their Belfast offices is a highly impractical approachnot virtually impossible for those with families and caring responsibilities. For many the only option they have been left with is redundancy.“It is a ludicrous and tin-eared approach to remove employment opportunities, chronically lacking in the North West, and in effect to move more of our skilled workers to Belfast.“These experienced and highly competent staff would be an asset to any organisation. The inability to provide these people some peace of mind as well as affording them opportunities to apply their skills in similar roles closer to home, has been completely overlooked.”However, in his letter Mr Thompson said, “regrettably, there are no priority arrangements for redeployment of our staff into Northern Ireland Civil Servicedepartments.“The NICS is entirely separate from the Home Civil Service and, as such, HMRC staff can only apply for roles in the NICS which may be advertised externally, including those at the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs in nearby Ballykelly.”Mr Thompson added that it has always been made clear that HMRC wants as many people as possible to transfer to their new location and continue their careers in Belfast.“That is why we have committed to hold one-to-one meetings between staff and managers around a year in advance of any move, to discuss inidual circumstances.“The meetings will establish who can and cannot move and what level of support will be needed to keep people working for HMRC. The one-to-ones for this office will commence in September ,” he concluded.The letter went on to say that those who decide to travel to Belfast will be given financial support in terms of travel costs and in some cases with home moves.The option of working in other government departments would also be explored.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"creggan men mixing mayweather dream las vegas boxing encounter","story":"A boxing coach and personal trainer from Creggan has spoken about an ‘amazing’ trip to Las Vegas spent in the company of many of the fight game’s legendary characters never mind his best friend who just happens to be international footballer James McClean.James McClean recently decided to celebrate turning  by inviting a few of his close friends and their partners to go on a trip to Las Vegas.

They have also branded claims the mercury bath poses a health and safety risk as a ldquored herring and fear that replacing the existing mechanism could potentially damage the Fresnel lens.Described as a ldquoworkshop, the January meeting lasted over one hour with the official council record of the debate that ensued only amounting to a paltry two and a half lines.The Lecale Lightkeepers vehemently argued that they had a case for briefing councillors on the impact the loss of the beam would have but, surprisingly, the request was initially rejected.Instead, council officials insisted that officers from the the Commissioners of Irish Lights would be invited to future meetings of the districtrsquos respective DEA Forums to discuss the future of the lighthouse.The local authority said this was to ensure that information could be shared and that local stakeholders and communities were fully consulted on any proposals for the lighthouse in the immediate future, before any plans are finalised.Council officials also insisted that wide ranging public consultation on the future of the lighthouse would take place.Campaigners mdash who were at a complete loss to understand why they were initially refused an opportunity to meet directly with councillors over five months ago mdash have now been told they will get a chance to brief them and outline their case for the retention of the beam.The Lecale Lightkeepers have described the plan to remove the beam as ldquototally inadequate and unacceptable and are looking forward to outlining their case for its retention.They are also pleased that having heard from the Commissioners, politicians can now have face-to-face dialogue with campaigners.Campaigners have held several discussions with the Commissioners and frequently engage with the organisation as part of the bid to retain what they have described as a key facet of Lecalersquos heritage.ldquoWe welcome the opportunity to meet with councillors to demonstrate just how passionate people are about the retention of the beam, the spokeswoman declared. It is a symbol of unity in Lecale and has brought together all sides of our erse community. It must be retained.ldquoMeeting with councillors is particularly important for us. We have put together a detailed presentation on the lighthouse issue and will outline our concerns about the future of the beam which we cannot afford to lose for a whole host of reasons.The spokeswoman said that in the interests of fairness and given the sensitive nature of the beam issue, it was important that they meet with local politicians.ldquoCouncillors have had the opportunity to hear from the Commissioners and it is important that they hear what we have to say as the group representing those opposed to this controversial proposal, she continued.ldquoThe beam must be retained for future generations given that it is an intrinsic part of the maritime history and heritage of the area and is a stunning feature of the Lecale landscape.The spokeswoman added: ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Council is backing the campaign to retain the sweeping beam and it is it important that councillors hear directly from campaigners.

However, I doubt many think that it is the cradle of horse racing, but it is.We do of course have a famous racecourse, which has just hosted a festival of racing as part of the DownTime Summerfest.Some of you, dear readers, may even know that there is an earlier racecourse in Downpatrick mdash at Old Course Road. So racing has been going on for centuries in our beautul corner of the world. And we have also played a vital role in the foundation of the Sport of Kings.The breed of horse associated with modern horse racing is the thoroughbred. A mere glance is enough to tell even the casual observer that the thoroughbred does not look like other horses.When compared to a pony or carthorse, the thoroughbred is leaner, taller and sleeker. In fact, these horses are perfectly designed for racing. They have big lungs, a big heart and long, slender legs that can move swtly.They also need special care when compared with native breeds. They have thin hair coats and so need to wear rugs or live in stables in bad weather. They need special food to give them energy to race. So these features tell you that the ancestor of the modern thoroughbred came from somewhere hot mdash from the desert, in fact. The ancestor of our racehorses is from Arabia.Back in the th century, horses were bred for work and war, not pleasure. Officers prized horses that were fast to get them in and out of battle and keep them alive. By this time, the medieval charger of knights mdash the destrier mdash was out of fashion. They were too slow and cumbersome, and soldiers no longer wore heavy suits of armour.So the horse evolved through selective breeding to become fleet of foot. There were no horses faster than the Arabian, which was specially bred to become bigger and faster than its wild cousin. The armies of the Ottoman Sultan developed special studs to create this new war machine.In , one of these fine stallions, known as the Byerley Turk, found himself outside the gates of Vienna. The Ottoman Sultan wanted to capture the imperial capital of the Holy Roman Empire, an objective he failed to achieve when the Polish King John III Sobieski led the greatest cavalry charge in history to defeat the Ottoman forces.The Byerley Turk was captured and eventually brought to England, finding himself in the ownership of one Captain Byerley.His adventures were not over though. Recognising a fine animal, Captain Byerley adopted the Turk as his war horse. In  hewas called to Ireland to fight for King William and in  he fought at the Battle of the Boyne. Indeed, Captain Byerley later attributed his surviving that battle to the swtness of his favourite war horse.After the battle, the Turk was entered in a horse race mdash in Downpatrick. Of course, he went on to win that race and go on to be one of the most famous horses in history. The Flying Horse housing development to the east of Downpatrick is named after this famous race.The remarkable career of the Turk continued mdash and now we come to his ultimate destiny. He was put out to stud in Yorkshire. His pedigree was highly prize and he became the first of only three foundation sires of the modern thoroughbred breed.Genetic testing has revealed it is his DNA that is the most common in all modern racehorses. His progeny are successful right to this day including names such as Dr Devious, Ahonoora and Indian Ridge.And it all started with a fateful race in Downpatrick over  years ago. Needless to say,Downe Vets had been around then and caring for his veterinary needs, we feel he could have achieved more..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Hurlers seeking big upset at Croke Park  ","story":"DOWN senior hurlers go into Saturdayrsquos Christy Ring Cup final at Croke Park against Meath as rank outsiders.Few pundits outside the Down camp expect anything other than a comfortable win for Meath, but say that quietly in and around Ronan Sheehanrsquos new kids on the block.The Newry man, who has close connections to several Cork hurling legends, has engendered a new-found enthusiasm and confidence in his charges.His young hurlers are a real surprise packet this season and getting to the Christy Ring Cup final is a major achievement for his fledgeling side.Sheehan has invested heavily in youth and has two schoolboys in his starting .Downpatrickrsquos Tim Prenter, who plays his club hurling for Ballygalget and Ballycranrsquos Phelilm Savage are both in their final year at St Patrickrsquos Grammar School and De La Salle, Downpatrick, respectively.Both lads were in the Down Schoolsrsquo side that lted the Mageean Cup earlier in the season and both hail from famous sporting families.Prenter, who also won a MacLarnon Cup medal with the Red High a few months back, is the son of former Antrim senior football defender Kieran Prenter and his grandfather Seamus Burns was a well known member of the all-conquering Belfast Celtics basketball team that swept all before them in the s and s.Savage, whose brother Liam is also in the team, is the son of former Ballycran and Ulster midfielder Gary lsquoGazarsquo Savage, who was also a noted centre half with Ballycam Celtic in the Newcastle League.There are also several other young players in the  with Portaferryrsquos Matthew Conlon, Ronan Blair, Darragh Mallon, Tom Murray, Caolan Taggart and Eoghan and Daithi Sands all in their early s.Throw in Liatroimrsquos Oisin McManus, P J Davidson and Ruairi McCrickard and Ballycranrsquos Stephen Keith, Gerard Hughes, Huw Flynn and Liam and Phelim Savage and you have the nucleus of squad that could dominate Ulster hurling for years.In addition to Prenter, Ballygalget provide the squad with, John McManus, Danny Toner, Marc Fisher and Cathal Coulter with Newry Shamrocks providing Paul Sheehan and Jordan Murphy.Helping Ronan Sheehan from the sidelines is Cork legend Diarmuid OrsquoSullivan and the Down manager believes his support has been critical in moving the side forward.ldquoDiarmuid has been doing a bit of defensive coaching for us and he has been there for all of the Christy Ring Cup games, he said.ldquoHe would know a lot of the boys from the development squads because he wouldrsquove come and done coaching sessions down through the years.

all visitors to the forest parks, with work ongoing to remove unauthorised trails which pose risks to mountain bikers.Over recent months, council officials have received a number of requests from event organisers for events that will use a combination of authorised trails, forest roads and unauthorised trails.While organisers are responsible for providing relevant health and safety risk assessments and insurance cover for the use of unauthorised trails, no adequate cover or permissions are in place post event which council officials have warned presents a ldquoconsiderable risk to the local authority and those using both natural and unauthorised trails.Councillors agreed on Monday night to meet with mountain trail bike stakeholders and representatives from Cycling Ireland to consider the ious challenges that would enable ldquothe responsible and safe management and maintenance of part of the natural trail network, with adequate health and safety considerations in place.It was also agreed at Mondayrsquos meeting to review the trail network at Castlewellan and Kilbroney parks in terms of the local authorityrsquos ongoing management and maintenance and consider future

They all agreed.The trigger had been a question by a Muslim hardliner, Abdullah Patel, who asked the they accept that ‘words have consequences’. The debate host put this to Boris Johnson, reminding him he had said Muslim women wearing burkas looked like letter boxes and other controversial things.It later emerged that Mr Patel is accused of anti Semitic tweets and had expressed reactionary views about relations between men and women ..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog The controversy that flared up after the debate related to the fact that the BBC had used such a questioner, while making it seem ashe was just a man in the street.A less noticed aspect of the saga was Mr Javid’s response. He committed to the Tory Islamophobia probe and then bounced the others into the same.This was unwise. When people rise up against the odds from a group that has hitherto suffered discrimination — for example Margaret Thatcher as the first women prime minister of the UK, or when Colin Powell became the first black US secretary of state — they almost always do so by not making any issue at all out of their status.They send out an unspoken signal that they might be female or blackbut their minority status is incidental to their persona, not central to it.If even a flash of resentment or preoccupation about that status emerges, then prejudiced people in the dominant group think: ‘Ah, he is as bitter as the rest of them.’Mr Javid has in the past seemed aware of this. Part of his image is that he happens to be the son of a Pakistani bus driver, but he is also a proud British patriot, who is eurosceptic and hawkish on some security and foreign policy issues.He took the harsh decision to cancel the citizenship of the Isis bride, Shamima Begum, who travelled to Syria to back the terror group — a statement that he harbours no ambivalence about radical Islam, evenother Muslims do.But on Tuesday , Mr Javid damaged that image with his decision to extract a commitment from his colleagues. He should have just stated his own view, and used the opportunity to remind viewers of his proven antipathy towards the Islamic extremism that most of us so justiably loathe.Instead, he compounded his error by putting pressure on Rory Stewart to say he would condemn foolish comments by Donald Trump.Ben Lowry: Oh no, the days are getting shorter — once again Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"If anyone has demonstrated his credentials of being profoundly respectful of Islam, it is the erudite Mr Stewart, who has spent much time in Muslim countries.I believe there is no need to examine alleged Tory Islamophobia. Consider for a moment the parallel controversy over anti Semitism in Labour. As someone who is strongly pro Israel, I accept that it is legitimate to criticise Israel fiercely, and possible to do so without being remotely anti Semitic.Similarly, it is possible to criticise radical Islam without being Islamophobic. We must be able to say, for example, that a large minority of the one section of the UK community, and only one, British Muslims, has shown notable levels of ambivalence about suicide bombing.Liberals should be honest that mainstream Muslim thinking in the UK is now more consistently hostile to issues such as same sex rights as is mainstream Christian thinking.Muddled thinking on ‘Islamophobia’ led to Pastor James McConnell being put in the dock for an anti Islamic sermon after a complaint by Dr Raied Al Wazzan, a man who praised the peace brought about in Mosul by Isis barbarians .Dr Al Wazzan was on the BBC recently rejecting a far right allegation of Islamic extremism in Belfast, yet was not asked about his shameful, extremist Isis remark.Dr Wazzan has been given residency, good employment and opportunity by our wonderful country, yet still he has implied the UK is ungenerous to immigrants. His defence of Isis was worse than anything Pastor McConnell said, yet it was the latter who faced trial.The Tories of all people must speak out against such injustices.• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editor• Ben Lowry: The days are getting shorter, again• Ben Lowry: Sad to see departure of colleaguesJPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"left wing politicians tell untruths as well as right wing ones so are as deserving of scrutiny  ","story":"....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+Bootstrapper.ensEvent.trigger]]]]]]]Bootstrapper.ensEvent.trigger]] initInArticleOnlySiteText, initArticleSiteText, isInArticleOnlyTemplateReady. s isArticleTemplateReady. s addCustomTextToSiteTemplate addSiteName.html  TriggerPrompt url  https:survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site_oqfshupypyivmsxzqude + url +  +:  + random + .getTime + afterel.setAttribute head  document[]  document[]headChildTriggerPrompt   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business Subscribe#jp #login-widget #login-flip.flip RegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Opinion Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Offbeat People Read This News Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health People Read This Sport Football Rugby Union Motorcycling More Sport Sport Opinion Whats On Arts  Entertainment Things To Do Nightle Lestyle Retro Cars Homes Must Read           Left wing politicians tell untruths as well as right wing ones so are as deserving of scrutinyLetter to the editorPublished::Saturday  June Share this article window.onload  .sharetool \"m.\" index  .indexOf \"ContentId\" pointIndex  .indexOf articleID  .substringSign Up To Our Daily Newsletter ipaddress.getJSON .keypress.focus.on email  .val.ajax\",source_url: location.href,source_website_category: \"Letters\", \"text\".done .removeAttr  .htmlThanks,  + email +  has been added to our newsletter..

As anticipation builds for next month’s Open at Royal Portrush, the veteran radio and TV presenter visited the host course as well as clubs like Royal Belfast, Royal County Down and the town of St Andrews in Scotland – recognised internationally as the home of golf. Gery Kelly and Bill MontgomeryGerry starts his journey at his home club in Ardglass tracing the beginnings of golf in Ireland and reveals a few surprises as he discovers the relatively unknown Ulster-Scots golfing pioneers who helped establish the sport here.He visits stately homes including Mount Stewart on the shores of Strangford Lough and Grey Abbey House – chatting with Lady Rose Lauritzen and William Montgomery – and travels to St Andrews to explore how the Scots claim to have invented the sport and what part they played in bringing the game across the Irish Sea. .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog He also sets out to finally answer the age-old dispute about which club is actually the oldest in Ireland. Gerry, who has been playing golf for over five decades at Ardglass Golf Club, said: “Before I began filming for the programme, despite playing the game for most of my le, I actually knew very little about its history, and that’s a shame because there are few sports with as long and as rich a history. Gery Kelly at St Andrews“The thing that amazed me the most was the fact that golf was played in Scotland in the s and it took over  years before it came here. With all the movement of people between the two countries, that Ulster-Scots connection, why did it take so long for the game to be finally organised here ”Gerry, who has been playing golf since he was a teenager, said: “Golf is a sport you can get easily hooked on. It’s a game for le. I know people still playing in their nineties.“For me it’s not so much now about that standard of golf now. I used to play off single figures, now I’m a teenager , it’s about the craic with your fourball. “We would get out once or twice a weekend and play for a fiver. It’s the most important three or four hours of the week to win that fiver.”Links To The Past: Pioneers Of Ulster Golf is on BBC Two Northern Ireland tomorrow night at pm.The one-hour film has been produced by NPE Media for BBC Northern Ireland, with support from the Ulster-Scots Broadcast Fund.l Morning View, page JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"this is how much it costs to get married in northern ireland  ","story":"....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+Bootstrapper.ensEvent.trigger]]]]]]]Bootstrapper.ensEvent.trigger]] initInArticleOnlySiteText, initArticleSiteText, isInArticleOnlyTemplateReady. s isArticleTemplateReady. s addCustomTextToSiteTemplate addSiteName.html  TriggerPrompt url  https:survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site_oqfshupypyivmsxzqude + url +  +:  + random + .getTime + afterel.setAttribute head  document[]  document[]headChildTriggerPrompt   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business Subscribe#jp #login-widget #login-flip.flip RegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News People Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion Read This News Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion Read This Sport Football Rugby Union Motorcycling More Sport Sport Opinion Whats On Arts  Entertainment Things To Do Nightle Lestyle Retro Cars Homes Must Read           This is how much it costs to get married in Northern Ireland   Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...BRIGHTCOVE.createBrightcovePlayerInstance Helen JohnsonEmail Published::Friday  June Share this article window.onload  .sharetool \"m.\" index  .indexOf \"ContentId\" pointIndex  .indexOf articleID  .substringSign Up To Our Daily Newsletter ipaddress.getJSON .keypress.focus.on email  .val.ajax\",source_url: location.href,source_website_category: \"Human Interest\", \"text\".done .removeAttr  .htmlThanks,  + email +  has been added to our newsletter..

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

I will challenge other councillors to back it.Earlier on Wednesday, Cllr Gray made a statement to Vale of Glamorgan Councilrsquos Conservative group to say he was resigning.In his statement, he said he had ldquoabsolutely no issue with the manner in which Cllr Bailey was elected as the new leader of the Conservative Group,But he said he is ldquoat least partially at odds with Cllr Bailey on three issues ndash the proposed lsquoclosurersquo of Llancarfan Primary School, the Dinas Powys Bypass and the incinerator in Barry.On the Llancarfan School proposal, which would see the primary moved to a new building in Rhoose, he said: ldquoI seconded a motion to have the executive reopen the issue consultation and this was ignored by the then cabinet but now that this dficult decision has been made I fear that any attempt to articially prop up Llancarfan School will take funding away from the budgets of Penarth schools which is something I will not tolerate.Cllr Gray said heremained ldquounconvinced that the proposed bypass around Dinas Powys, linking Cardf to Barry, ldquois an issue with a large base of support in my ward, and the efforts to give it even more prominence and funding would I believe be to the detriment of the residents of my ward.Vale council has been waiting for more than a year for Welsh Government to decide whether the Barry incinerator needs to carry out an environmental impact assessment before it can operate.Cllr Gray said any efforts to ramp up the councilrsquos rhetoric on the incinerator ldquowould do a disservice to those residents who are passionate about the subject.ldquoRaising  hope for headlines is not the reason I stood for local government and I donrsquot want to mark my success by how many column inches we are able to achieve on a wedge issue, he said.       ,params: .pushHe added:ldquoThe structures around the group that Vince is proposing seemed to be geared up to act as an opposition party and not to focus on the work of delivering core services for the benefit of the most vulnerable members of our society.ldquoI donrsquot expect everyone to agree with my decision and I donrsquot take this decision lightly ndash I am sure that there will be a great number of people who have an opinion on whether I have done the right thing or not.ldquoI need to remain true to myself and my belief in acting as a positive advocate for the residents in my ward ndash the issues that get me out of bed every morning to work hard for the residents in my ward are not the way the press views me but how I can make a positive dference to peoplersquos lives. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people.

The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This is a project of regional signicance and we need to be banging the drum for funding because this scheme should be the top priority for the administration. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Abandoned - BlissThe first dog to arrive at the centre was -year-old Spaniel Grace, found by a member of the public at the side of the road. She was taken to the vet immediately, but after an owner didn’t come forward, she was brought to Dogs Trust.Two weeks ago, another Spaniel - aged eight and nicknamed Bliss by the team - was found tied to a fence not far from the rehoming centre. Like Grace, the Spaniel has not been microchipped, which has been a legal requirement for all dogs since  and the easiest way to identy a dog who has become separated from their owner. Shockingly just one week later, a Cairn Terrier - less than a year old, was found by a rehoming centre staff member at the very same spot where Bliss was left. Terrier Rizzo was lucky to be found as she is quite small and it would have been easy to miss her in the long grass.The most recent addition to the ranks of abandoned pooches is Sally, an eight-year-old Collie cross, who was found as a stray by a member of the public and brought to the rehoming centre.Abandoned - RizzoOonagh Philips, Rehoming Centre Manager said: “We want to remind anyone who no longer feels that they can care for their dog to contact their local rescue organisation for support. When a dog is abandoned on the road side, it not only puts them in danger, but also drivers. We are so thankful that all four of these dogs were found when they were.“Grace and Bliss were very shaken up by their ordeal when they came into our care and it took them a couple of days to build trust around people again. We could tell Rizzo hadn’t eaten in a while, which could have resulted in a deterioration of her physical health. Sally is incredibly sweet natured, and just like the others, will make a wonderful addition to the right home.“We are not sure why there has been a recent influx in dogs being abandoned. We always remind people that ‘A Dog is for Le®’ but we understand that le happens, and places like Dogs Trust are there to support any dog owner who experiences a bump in the road and needs our help. Sometimes the most responsible thing we can do as a dog owner is admit that we aren’t coping with our pets, but it is important to ensure they are kept safe and not left to fend for themselves.”If you

The application area also stretches or borders on  Areas of Special Scientic Interest from the boundaries of Belfast Lough to the glacial peat deposits of Benburb.“We have serious concerns about the impact oil and gas exploration will have on bioersity, on intensying our reliance on carbon-heavy industry and on people and communities here. “We consider this a regionally signicant application and, as such, the decision is likely to be taken by the Department for the Economy. “It is important that the Department hears and understands the strength of opposition to these proposals,” they said calling for the restoration of an Executive.Cllr O’Hanlon said: “Where we dfered with Councillor Lavery is that he sought to form a Council view in a Council Committee when the correct prcedure is to formally bring a notion of motion to Full Council.We advised Councillor Lavery of the proper process and said we would support such a motion. “The SDLP are opposed to fracking, just as we are opposed to parties trying to form council policy in the wrong manner.“Procedures are there to protect the public and good governance and we will continue to follow those rules.”NIHE offices may close and move

Thats signicantly higher than % of bosses globally. And according to the firm’s latest Global CEO Outlook, Northern Ireland’s bosses are leading the way when it comes to embracing the ‘fast fail’ culture in an effort to make their companies as innovative as possible. Of the Northern Ireland bosses surveyed, % said they want their employees to feel ‘empowered to innovate. On the issue of Brexit, around two thirds of business leaders see the UK’s exit from the EU as the greatest threat to growth. Looking at overall growth, all of those questioned said they expect ‘top line revenue growth over the next three years’. But just % of company bosses said they ‘expect to increase headcount in the next three years of more than %’. John Hansen, partner in charge of KPMG Northern Ireland, said: “Successful CEOs know they need their companies to be as innovative as possible and it’s clear that the right environment is being created in Northern Ireland to do just that. “Our leaders aren’t afraid to give their teams the scope to try new ideas which may have a risk of failure and that opens up a world of potential. This level of freedom will no doubt make sure that Northern Ireland companies are at the cutting edge of innovation in the years to come.” Angela McGowan, CBI director in Northern Ireland, said: “KPMG’s  Global CEO Outlook gives local business leaders some great insights into what is on the radar for chief executives across the globe and raises some important and interesting ideas around what leaders should doing to maintain competitive advantage despite the uncertainty.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/glandore_web.jpg","title":"glandore the family flexible workspace on the rise","story":"Posted on Wednesday June  by Ulster Business High-end flexible office company Glandore has expanded rapidly into an all-island family business with further growth on the horizon. Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tradeniiii.jpg","title":"new northern ireland trade alliance formed","story":"Posted on Wednesday  June  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s newest trade body alliance will take its message to Westminster later this year amid the ongoing political vacuum at home and with Brexit on the horizon. Trade NI is an alliance between Hospitality Ulster, headed by Colin Neill, Manufacturing NI, Stephen Kelly, and Retail NI, Glyn Roberts, and aims to represent a wider swathe of Northern Ireland’s private sector amid the “paralysis” surrounding a lack of Executive and therefore a lack of local political voice on the UK’s exit from the EU. The group will take its message to London on September , hosting an event to once again bring together politicians, businesses, stakeholders and the media to raise awareness of the issues and challenges facing companies here. The alliance, which has been supported by the likes of Heathrow Airport, Danske Bank and Flybe, outlined its aims at its launch in the Cathedral Quarter, Belfast, to an audience of business leaders from across Northern Ireland. “Northern Ireland is facing huge economic and political challenges ahead with Brexit, no Assembly, and a rapidly changing global economy,” the group said. “Trade NI will seek to give leadership on behalf of our three sectors and provide new policy solutions to creating a modern local economy.” “The paralysis that has been created with the lack of an Assembly and Executive has developed a situation where very little has been done to address the needs of our sectors or the economy at large. “The sht of power from Stormont to Westminster means that we must press decision makers there to implement policies and make legislative changes that will help grow Northern Ireland. Our local economy and businesses have taken a back seat and we simply cannot afford that situation any longer. “Our three organisations represent most of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland. Therefore, a louder voice needs to be heard on their behalf so that they don’t suffer in the wake of the local political issues. We want a reboot of the economic policy of Northern Ireland, in order to benefit our economy and safeguard our growing business community.” “Last year we held a NI business reception with over  people that brought together the Northern Ireland Secretary of State, MPs, lords, ministers and key political influencers in Westminster to bring focus to Northern Ireland issues.” “This was a great opportunity to be able to discuss the key concerns of the business community with national political decision makers and help them understand the priorities needed for Northern Ireland, and to promote Northern Ireland as a great place in the United Kingdom to locate or start a business.” Kevin Kingston, chief executive of Danske Bank, the main sponsor of Trade NI’s forthcoming Westminster reception, said that “Northern Ireland has a strong business community and should be considered across the United Kingdom as a thriving business hub for the global market”. “The vitality of the private sector is imperative to the strength of the Northern Ireland economy. We must ensure Northern Ireland businesses are well positioned to be able to compete in the post-Brexit environment. We will continue to work alongside the Trade NI alliance and other key influencers to make sure that Northern Ireland, as a constituent part of the United Kingdom, remains a key priority at Westminster.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
