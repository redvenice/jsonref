Use the next few weeks to practise your photography, taking daily shots as the garden starts to bloom in the warmer weather. You could even post your best photos on social media, or email them to friends and family to cheer them up. You\u0027ll find lots of good tips and articles online — just type into Google, \u0027improve your garden photography\u0027. Some of the techniques that professionals recommend include photographing the garden at sunrise, when the light is at its softest standing on a ladder to get a bird\u0027s-eye view and investing in a small smartphone tripod (you can get them by mail order at amazon.co.uk for under £20). A good book is The Garden Photography Workshop by Andrea Jones (available on amazon.co.uk, for £17.99, or only £1.98 as a ­Kindle book). STAKE PLANTS This is one of those tasks that most of us (me included) put off for far too long, with predictably dire consequences: by high summer, plants that should be standing tall and proud are collapsing all over the place. If you\u0027re growing peonies, dahlias, delphiniums, oriental poppies, foxgloves, sunflowers and the taller forms of salvias, they will need support with canes and soft twine. The trick is to do it early in the season before the plants have put on too much growth, so now is the perfect time. Create a framework of canes around the plant (the plant will soon disguise the supports as it grows) and don\u0027t tie it in too tightly — it needs to be able to move in the wind. Staking isn\u0027t the most exciting job to do in the garden, but do it properly and your prize plants will look fantastic this summer. SUPPORT NURSERIESSupport nurseries The cancellation of RHS shows such as Cardiff, the Malvern Spring Show and, mostdevastating of all, the Chelsea Flower Show, has hit small nurseries hard. Many of them are bursting with stock and still very much open for mail order business. Britain has a world-class selection of specialist nurseries and it would be a tragedy if we lost them, so do support them if you can. Some of the best are Bluebell Cottage Gardens and Nursery in Cheshire (bluebellcottage.co.uk) and Edrom Nurseries in Scotland (good for alpines and woodland plants — edrom-nurseries.co.uk). Plus, Beth Chatto\u0027s Plants and Gardens in Essex (bethchatto. co.uk), Thorncroft Clematis in Norfolk (clematis and other climbers — thorncroftclematis.co.uk), Claire Austin Hardy Plants (claireaustin-hardyplants.co.uk) and Knoll Gardens in Dorset (a superb range of ornamental grasses — knollgardens.co.uk).SCATTER COMPOSTIf you\u0027ve been dutifully composting your garden and household organic waste, now is the time to get spreading. All that rotted material (which gardeners call mulch) will return valuable nutrients to the soil. You\u0027ll know the compost is ready to use when it has a pleasant, earthy smell and looks like dark, crumbly soil. Spread it around your beds and borders, about 3in (5cm) thick: either fork it in lightly or simply leave it to break down into the soil. If you don\u0027t have a compost bin, why not start one now? Apart from helping your garden, it will also cut down the amount of food and garden waste you throw out.

They add: ‘We assumed that children have a role in transmission (for coronavirus) similar to that of influenza.’The scientists also say that if police are off sick because of the outbreak it could trigger a wave of ‘opportunistic’ crime – such as muggings, shoplifting and vehicle theft – ‘by those who are already antagonistic towards the police’.But overall they say ‘large scale rioting’ and crime is ‘unlikely’, unless the Government is deemed incompetent by the public or police numbers fall dramatically.The scientists were also wary about causing ‘tension’ among the public by banning large mass gatherings – such as football matches and pop concerts – but not smaller events, such as tennis matches and theatre shows.In fact, they were more concerned about the virus being spread in smaller gatherings than larger ones. ‘Smaller gatherings such as bars and nightclubs are higher risk as you can be in closer contact with others,’ they state.‘Family gatherings are particularly high-risk as they bring people into closer contact.‘Similarly, religious services with a high level of physical contact would be higher risk.’ Latest coronavirus video news, views and expert advice at mailplus.co.ukcoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"Exams graded pupils sat them","story":"Share this article There will be an appeals system so students who dispute grades can still sit exams early in the next academic year.The DfE said: \u0027In terms of a permanent record, the grades will be indistinguishable from those in other years.\u0027 Teachers will have to take into account \u0027a range of evidence and data\u0027, such as mock exam results and other school work.Pupils will also have the option to sit their exams next summer.

But now, they’re seeing unmanageable losses,” said chief executive Nicola Solomon. “It was clear that current levels of funding would fail to meet needs.”Author Philip Pullman, the society’s president, said that the pandemic was making it “impossible” for authors to do their work, as much of it consisted of lecturing, visiting schools and teaching.“When part of the crisis consists of not knowing enough about the crisis itself to be able to plan with any certainty, it will be enormously reassuring to many authors to know that this fund exists,” said the His Dark Materials author. “With the cancelled event there also disappears, of course, the author’s fee. This is the situation that many of us now face, and which the Authors’ Emergency Fund will do a great deal to mitigate.”The grants are open to all professional authors resident in the UK or British subjects, are likely to be up to £2,000, and are “designed to meet urgent need”.The dire situation comes as the book industry is shaken to its foundations by Covid-19. While Waterstones, the UK’s biggest bookshop chain, remains open, independent bookshops are closing their doors to protect staff but hand-delivering books to customers to stay afloat. Publishers are offering free ebooks and audiobooks, and Amazon is prioritising essential goods, raising fears among publishers that book sales will dramatically drop.Children’s author and illustrator James Mayhew, who writes the Ella Bella Ballerina books, said he has had 13 events cancelled this week alone, amounting to losses of around £6,000.“It suddenly seems like all of my many possible sources of income are about to evaporate. I rent and am self-employed. I am the breadwinner in my home,” he said. “Am I about to see a 31-year career come to a halt? Of course, I look at the bigger picture – what the virus has done to Italy. It breaks my heart. Health before wealth, always.”Haleh Agar’s debut novel, Out of Touch, is due out on 2 April, but all her speaking engagements and launches have been cancelled. “As someone who also suffers from an underlying heart condition, I’m feeling extremely anxious and find it difficult to concentrate and be productive at this time,” she said. “Although this is so disappointing, I’m hoping for a silver lining, that as we’re trapped in this strange new reality of distancing and isolation, that more people will read books by debut novelists who especially need a leg-up at the start of their writing careers.”Children’s poet Joshua Seigal, who is giving away books online, said his entire work schedule has been wiped out for the foreseeable future. “Schools have all cancelled my visits, which was by far my main source of income. Festivals have cancelled. I do not know how I am going to pay my bills,” he said. “This is an incredibly difficult, scary time. However, my job is based on sharing joy, and I am determined that I will keep doing this, in whatever form it takes.”Like Seigal, many authors are taking new and innovative approaches. Author Glenda Young has been left with boxes of books she had lined up to sell at events, so she’s teamed up with a local florist who is offering a book and a bouquet for Mother’s Day, and says they’re “flying off the shelves”.Bestselling children’s author Philip Ardagh said he was already “around £2,000 out of pocket and counting” with multiple events and a launch party for his new picture book Bunnies on the Bus cancelled. “I’ve been a published writer for around 30 years and have been working from home for about 25 of them, but it all feels very up in the air at the moment. I’m still writing away but have put up a Bunnies video on my YouTube channel, along with other silliness, which I’ll be adding to soon, to try to keep children entertained during their six months or so off school,” said Ardagh.The Society of Authors already distributes around £95,000 a year to authors in need, via grants of up to £1,500. Charities and corporations who also contributed to the emergency fund include the Authors’ Licensing and Collecting Society, the Royal Literary Fund, the TS Eliot Foundation in partnership with English PEN, and Amazon UK, which added an additional £235,000 to the fund. The society hopes to increase the pot through talks with further funding bodies."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2e5bd734efdc3215195366e43ed04f27d76b943/10_11_3482_2089/master/3482.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45efd1f8f85110070a9fc5997ac347b2","title":"marks and spencer considers temporary store closures wetherspoons coronavirus","story":"Arcadia to shut all stores, M\u0026ampS warns of closures and Debenhams seeks time to pay billsThe coronavirus shutdown is laying waste to the high street, with Sir Philip Green’s Arcadia group announcing it was shutting all its stores, as Primark told suppliers it was cancelling orders and Debenhams sought extra time to settle its bills.In a dramatic day of developments Marks \u0026amp Spencer axed its idend to preserve cash because its clothing arm faced being “severely impacted” over the coming months as Britons were forced to stop shopping. The retailer also said some stores could have to close temporarily.Arcadia, which owns Topshop, Dorothy Perkins and Miss Selfridge, said it had taken the “difficult decision” to close its more than 500 stores until further notice. The retailer said all staff would receive their normal pay for March “after which we will review this situation and will be keeping our store teams updated”.In a sign of the scale of the slump that retailers now expect, Primark has written to suppliers urging them to “seriously consider putting a halt on all current and future production and the purchasing of any materials in relation to any Primark orders”.“We have been left with no option but to place a hold on any new orders being placed,” the fashion retailer said. Orders already in train were also being reviewed, it said, adding: “It is likely that in most circumstances we will have little option but to terminate those orders pursuant to our contractual rights.”Earlier this week Primark’s parent company, Associated British Foods, said about a fifth of its selling space was already closed. Paul Marchant, the chief executive of Primark, said it could not have foreseen that over the course of a week, stores in every country in which it operated, with the exception of the UK, would have to close.Marchant said: “We have large quantities of existing stock in our stores, our depots and in transit that is paid for and if we do not take this action now we will be taking delivery of stock that we simply can’t sell. This is unprecedented action for unprecedented and frankly unimaginable times.” “We recognise and are deeply saddened that this will clearly have an effect throughout our entire supply chain,” Marchant added.The gloomy update came as it emerged that the Debenhams chief executive, Stefaan Vansteenkiste, had written to the department store chain’s suppliers to inform them they would be getting their money a month later than expected.“Unfortunately, we have to ask you for extra support,” wrote Vansteenkiste. “We will be extending all supplier payment terms by 30 days – except in those cases where we are already on extended terms. This decision is crucial to make sure we can ultimately pay the outstanding payable balances we have with you.”Debenhams had already asked landlords for a five-month rent holiday as it faces “unprecedented pressures” because of the pandemic. The department store, which has closed 22 branches in recent months and is set to close 28 more next year, was struggling even before the virus hit.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Many countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns.\u0026nbspIn the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u0026nbspstay at home for at least 7 days.If you live with other people,\u0026nbspthey should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.M\u0026ampS said it had served customers “without cease through two world wars” but the Covid-19 outbreak meant it anticipated the performance of its clothing and homewares departments – where sales were already falling – would worsen. It was seeing substantial declines in these departments and has redeployed many staff to support its food retail business amid a run on supermarkets by panicked shoppers.With demand for its spring and summer ranges expected to be weak, M\u0026ampS has ditched plans to order £100m worth of goods so as to avoid being left with a glut of stock. As Next’s chief executive, Simon Wolfson, put it this week: “People do not buy a new outfit to stay at home.”Unlike high street rivals such as Next and Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group – which on Friday issued a profit warning and announced plans to close five Jack Wills stores – M\u0026ampS is expected to be among a handful of “essential” retailers alongside supermarkets and pharmacists permitted to keep shops open throughout the crisis.M\u0026ampS said its food halls were busier than usual but its bias towards selling chilled and fresh food (which have a short shelf life) meant it had not experienced the same huge sales uplifts experienced by the major grocers.M\u0026ampS said scrapping the idend would save £130m as it warned profits for the year to the end of March could fall short of the £440m pencilled in by analysts. The government’s decision to suspend business rates would also save it about £180m.In further evidence of the tough outlook faced by retailers, Hotel Chocolat said the virus signalled the closure of some or all of its 125 UK stores. Greg Lawless, an analyst at Shore Capital, said: “The UK retail sector is facing a storm of reduced footfall to the high street, particularly for the general retail sector. Nobody knows how long normal lives will have restrictions in place – so the impact on financial forecasts is unknown.”“Cash preservation is the new priority,” added Lawless. “Those companies that adapt quickly and do the right thing will survive but we are in uncharted territory.”In other developments:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ec845c4b44195a4179ebb7d56c8d87ba4889d4e/0_485_5760_3457/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b30a9b68ed8dd319e404245ed241b224","title":"coronavirus anxiety nature","story":"Reconnecting with the natural world – however we can – is a wonderful medicine against anxiety and fearThe National Trust has announced that it is opening as many of its parklands and gardens as possible for free during the coronavirus outbreak. The South Downs National Park, Forestry England and others have reminded people that our forests and grasslands, woodlands and commons are open for business. With constrained options for leisure and restoration and heightened stress and anxiety levels, this is good news.If you were in any doubt that it was OK to go outside, while keeping at least two metres away from others, the chief medical officer Chris Whitty told the BBC on Wednesday: “Being outside in the park is a very good thing to do.”He would know. In the past decade, the scientific evidence that connection with nature has important therapeutic benefits for human mental health has mushroomed. Robust studies from disciplines across the world are demystifying what many intuitively know – that we often feel restored when we spend time in nature.For a number of years I’ve been researching this mechanism for my book, Losing Eden. I was astounded by the variety and range of the evidence. Time spent in nature is linked to lower stress, restored attention, a balanced nervous system, increased levels of cancer-fighting “natural killer cells”, the activation of neural pathways associated with calm, and decreased levels of anxiety and depression. Phytoncides (compounds emitted from trees and plants), relaxation, stress reduction and awe are known to enhance immune function.And there is an abundance of awe outside right now. The leaves are starting to erupt vivid lemon green. We are at the moment just before the natural world really lets rip.Birds are busy making their nests. The baby-skin softness of an unfurling chestnut bud breaks through Bumblebees potter sleepily. The blues and pinks of lungwort are as psychedelic as a Los Angeles sunset.In this new world of uncertainty, nature can be transportive. Get down on to the earth and you can find a new reality. Spring is legal, free LSD.It’s also a symbol of renewal and regeneration that we need at the moment. In February Afternoon, by the poet Edward Thomas, birds symbolise constancy, a reassuring sign that the globe is still working: “When one, like me, dreamed how  A thousand years might dust lie on his brow  Yet thus would birds do between hedge and shaw.” Nature is a common element in war poetry.Can spending time in nature help people deal with death and dying today? Over the past few years as I’ve talked to people about their psychological relationship with the Earth, I have been moved by the stories of people who have encountered desperate loss and grief and found a solace in the rest of nature.For those faced with the spectre of the death and suffering of loved ones (and, let’s be honest, that is the fear we are living with), the natural world, with its seasons and changes and weather, reminds us of the facts: death and disease are part of life on Earth, but life goes on. On a run around my local cemetery before dusk yesterday, the sky was glowing and the trees were still winter-stark. The birds were piping up, indifferent to the quieter streets and the panic. Rabbits hopped around the daffodils. Obscene, almost, the sublime-meets-Basingstoke, but also grounding.For the religious who are unable to meet for fellowship, or indeed for those who normally find spiritual solace in pubs, recovery meetings or therapy rooms, the natural world could provide a connection with the numinous that it has done for humans over centuries.What about the most vulnerable in our society, the disabled and chronically ill? National Parks have been doing important work improving access to open spaces for people with limited mobility. The South Downs, for instance, is creating new routes in an aim to become the most accessible park in Britain.And for those who can’t get outdoors at all? Studies have shown that just looking at a picture of the natural world can give stress reduction and wellbeing benefits. But those who looked through glass window at real nature saw a quicker decrease in heart rate than those who looked at a technological nature window. Pot plants, too, are no small thing. GPs in Manchester have even started to prescribe them. Much of nature is fractal – a self-repeating pattern of a shape that varies in scale, rather than repeats exactly. The leaves on a pancake plant (Pilea peperomioides), for instance, which start small and grow in size but repeat the same shape. Richard Taylor, professor of physics at the University of Oregon, found that these fractals provoked brain waves suggesting a relaxed state which could reduce stress levels.Thankfully, the dawn chorus has started across the country. At 4.30 this morning, on the busy urban street where I live, there was a magical wall of sound. Crack open a window if you’re sleepless in the early morning, or first thing.In the interwar years and second world war, bird song was early public sonic therapy. In 1924, the BBC recorded the cellist Beatrice Harrison playing in her garden accompanied by a nightingale. It became a cult hit, and the recording was repeated every spring until 1942. It represented something that we all “unconsciously crave and urgently need” as the BBC’s first director general, Lord Reith, wrote.Of course, the natural world isn’t there to make us feel better. It doesn’t exist for mankind. (Nor is it going to be the panacea for our loneliness, stress and worry.) Are there ways, then, that the relationship can be reciprocal, instead of a one-way street? Perhaps by making our gardens nature-led and more habitable for other species. Supporting initiatives that improve access to nature and bioersity. Ceremonies, rituals, gratitude. Could reconnecting with nature help us see our environment and origins with new eyes? Could we start to see the trees in our stockpiled loo roll?In Boccaccio’s Decameron, the 14th-century novellas about Florence during the Black Death, some people lived temperately, hoping it would protect their health, secluding themselves from society. Others got plastered round the clock: “seeing death imminent they became reckless with their lives”.But there was a third group who kept a middle course. They carried flowers or fragrant herbs, which they “frequently raised to their noses, deeming it an excellent thing thus to comfort the brain with such perfumes”. More than 600 years later, we would be wise to take a leaf out of their book, and seek joy in spring.• Lucy Jones is a journalist and the author of Losing Eden: Why Our Minds Need the Wild"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f0c2fbc8867cc8fba6608cc45b921867efd33ae/0_37_5040_3024/master/5040.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6882f00649b7349c02e1ff28a3d95860","title":"home schooling teachers child coronavirus","story":"While the world outside panicked over coronavirus, I was to be the calm, efficient teacher to my child. It didn’t last longI’ve totally got this, I think. I point out she is doing the letter S backwards, nicely ask her to try again, offer to show her how, tell her to stop being unreasonable, mutter “oh my god what is your problem I’m only trying to help you!” Now she’s screaming “stop confusing me!” Jesus Christ, there’s another month of this to go.Like salesmanship and writing, teaching is one of those things a lot of people sneakily think they could probably do if they had the time. When the New York school system shut down on Monday, I went into this new period of quarantine fully nursing this delusion. By the end of the home-schooling period maybe my kids wouldn’t necessarily be up to scratch with their curriculum. But after busting out my best Jean Brodie impression, I truly thought I’d have them reciting Wreck of the Deutschland, proffering age-inappropriate opinions about politics, and engaging with the world with a sense of wonder unaided by worksheets. This was going to be great.This confidence lasted until approximately lunchtime that first day. After the fight about the letter S, I tried to engage with the school’s online maths resources, died a small death at reading the word “module”, got bored after the third paragraph, wondered how teachers cope with the volume of information they have to process, then called snack time.Going into this period I already loved my girls’ teachers, but along with a lot of other parents in New York this week, trying to teach my own kids has filled me with an unparalleled sense of amazement. How on earth, in a single kindergarten year, had they got them reading and writing and counting and sitting quietly – and that’s in a class with 20 other kids? I have two and by midweek was exhausted and screaming.We make a decision, my children and I. We’re going to keep our expectations low. We’re not going to schedule this out. We will study when we feel like it and if someone wants to break off to give their Baby Alive doll her flu shot or do a drawing unrelated to the task at hand, that’s not annoying, it’s OK, really it’s OK, no I’m not angry, I just need to step away for a second to look out of the window.By the afternoon, I have put them on iPads so I can get some work done.

Increased inequality will be the resultSome may welcome this, at least at first. Nobody wants to catch Covid-19, or be responsible for spreading it. British schooling has become narrowly exam-focused and in the run-up to primary school Sats, GCSEs and A-levels, lessons can be more like drills than investigations. Some parents have already begun sharing plans (and jokes) about home schooling. There is an undoubted novelty factor.Most parents will feel less well equipped to teach older children. On Friday, the UK government announced that teacher assessments would determine grades for GCSE and A-level pupils, along with the option of sitting exams late. Such clarity was badly needed by students, some of whom have spoken powerfully of feeling that their entire secondary schooling has led to a dead end.The social impact of being separated from peers also varies for different age groups. Almost all children, including some who find school difficult, benefit from the social experiences that it offers. But for teenagers, whose emotional development requires them to become more separate from their parents and carers, being forced back into the family nest carries particular stresses.But economic inequality will be the biggest variable between the experiences of British children over the next few months, and between richer and poorer children in other countries. Even in a society that is starkly unequal, and an education system that does worse by disadvantaged pupils than by advantaged ones, school is a leveller. When they are there, pupils share the same spaces, lessons, menus and teachers. At home, children of well-off parents invariably live in bigger houses, are more likely to have their own bedrooms, two parents rather than one to support them, and better access to technology as well as books and other learning resources, and food.We must all do our best over the coming months, and no one should begrudge those who are looking forward to lessons, or weekday lunches, with their children. But during this strange, frightening period, the government must do everything in its power to ensure that more vulnerable children and families do not lose out. When things get back to normal, any who have fallen behind must be helped to catch up."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e0cce7f39d82f03fc2a2fc7363890980b14b043/0_150_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f6a24c1152edd5677a9afb5d63bcf2b","title":"the guardian view on the uk response to coronavirus playing catch up","story":"Tougher measures are the only way to stop the NHS being overwhelmed, but at last the government may be shaking off complacencyThe best time to act has already passed. The second best time is now. We have already squandered too many days in the battle against coronavirus. The 177 deaths reported in the UK are only the beginning. Hospitals are already under intense pressure. Because so few people are being tested, and because it takes days to get results, and because growth is exponential, we can be certain that the true level of the disease outbreak is many, many times worse than the figures suggest. When hospitals are overwhelmed, the mortality rate will rise steeply too.With each day lost, the dangers increase and tougher measures are needed. Britain had one advantage: the experience of others. China, South Korea and Italy have all showed how fast the number of cases and deaths could rise. We squandered the time we could have spent preparing, and ignored lessons from abroad.To many watching from outside, we have looked like a nation in denial. Though transmission is clearly much more advanced in London than elsewhere, official figures show significant clusters of cases in places from Sheffield to Hampshire. Other countries have shown that draconian lockdown measures or extensive testing and tracing of contacts can contain outbreaks – at least in the short term. Britain has abandoned community testing and has missed the window for a tracing policy.Telling households to stay home if one person feels sick is insufficient when a significant proportion of transmission occurs before the carrier is symptomatic. The government failed to give an early, clear, strong and consistent message on the need for social distancing – or the economic means to ensure cooperation. That delay means that the measures announced on Friday are probably still not enough – especially given that the prime minister seemed to think it was still all right to visit elderly parents for Mother’s Day. New York and California have insisted, for instance, that all but essential workers stay home.The government pivoted away from herd immunity, yet did not move fast or far enough. Institutions and large parts of the public have proved themselves far ahead of authorities: the Premier League suspending the season the Church of England announcing that only five people would be allowed at weddings. Compare and contrast Boris Johnson’s bumbling, confused performances, and his blithe assurance that the UK can turn the tide in 12 weeks, with Angela Merkel’s clear and urgent address to her nation a few days earlier – or even the much more impressive remarks of his own chancellor. Consider the lack of a public education campaign compared with those seen in Asia.No one suggests such restrictions are easy or even wholly effective. The report by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies published on Friday notes that the Imperial model suggests Britain “will come in and out of a shutdown for two years”, to manage the burden on the NHS. The goal can only be to buy time: time to obtain and use tests that quickly tell us whether health staff are infected time to acquire more beds and equipment time in which effective treatments may be discovered or – in the longer term – a vaccine.Key questions remain. When will NHS staff be tested? How quickly can capacity be ramped up to the promised 25,000 a day, for wider testing? What efforts are being made to increase the supply of personal protective equipment to hospitals, and how quickly will they pay off? The government’s change of pace was desperately needed, but there is much further to go."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9df47edbb12581687bda49f9afeb7c59979e431e/0_129_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=568d7fba4d564dd9cbeb3a507ca4ce47","title":"netflix 100m coronavirus fund relief creatives","story":"In response to the many global productions forced to stop, the streaming giant will help support cast and crew without employmentNetflix has set up a $100m fund for creatives whose jobs have been affected by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.In response to the collapse of many productions globally, the streaming giant has announced that it will help support those in the community who have found themselves out of work. The majority of funds will go towards those affected by the collapse of Netflix’s own productions, such as season two of The Witcher which was shut down when the actor Kristofer Hivju tested positive for the virus.“The Covid-19 crisis is devastating for many industries, including the creative community,” Ted Sarandos, the chief content officer, said in a statement. “Almost all television and film production has now ceased globally – leaving hundreds of thousands of crew and cast without jobs. These include electricians, carpenters and drivers, many of whom are paid hourly wages and work on a project-to-project basis. This community has supported Netflix through the good times, and we want to help them through these hard times, especially while governments are still figuring out what economic support they will provide.”As well as the announced fund, Netflix had already agreed to pay workers two weeks’ worth of wages.The company will also offer $15m to not-for-profits that offer emergency relief to out-of-work cast and crew members in countries where they have major productions.“What’s happening is unprecedented,” Sarandos added. “We are only as strong as the people we work with and Netflix is fortunate to be able to help those hardest hit in our industry through this challenging time.”The statement follows news that an estimated 120,000 film industry workers have lost their jobs as a result of the crisis, according to the US entertainment industry union IATSE (International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees). Global productions that have been shutdown include sequels to Avatar, Mission: Impossible, The Matrix and Jurassic World as well as new films from Ridley Scott and Guillermo del Toro.This week saw the Democratic congressman Adam Schiff team up with three dozen lawmakers to send a letter to Nancy Pelosi asking for provisions for those working in the entertainment industry. “They’re every bit as deserving of a financial lifeline as anyone else in the country,” Schiff said to Deadline. “And in some ways, we should be even more in debt because so many are finding solace and entertainment in watching their creative work product from home right now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa2b11e61716da8ea6ce0e7d4342b14513879e16/0_278_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=303336d69df35c56fa0e283c8373a54b","title":"some uk schools looking at unregulated exams to replace gcses and a levels","story":"Schools discuss possible use of alternatives such as international GCSEs which have so far not been cancelledSome schools in the UK are investigating the use of unregulated examinations to get around the government’s decision to cancel A-level and GCSEs exams this summer over coronavirus fears, the  has learned.A group of schools have been discussing the possible use of qualifications such as international GCSEs known as iGCSEs, or alternatives to A-levels known as Pre-U or international A-levels, which are offered by examination boards AQA and Cambridge Assessments and are almost exclusively used by independent schools.The move comes as the Department for Education said pupils would be awarded assessed grades for conventional GCSE and A-level courses by the end of July, using an algorithm to be developed by Ofqual, the exam regulator, with each pupils’ grades then ratified by their teachers and exam boards.The DfE said pupils unhappy with their assessed grades would have the option of appealing, and the opportunity to sit exams in the affected subjects after the start of the next academic year or in summer 2021.“I have asked exam boards to work closely with the teachers who know their pupils best to ensure their hard work and dedication is rewarded and fairly recognised,” Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, said.But while A-levels and GCSEs have been cancelled, students say they have not been told that iGCSEs or similar unregulated qualifications have also been called off, leaving them in limbo.Both AQA and Cambridge Assessments have said they intend to continue with the international versions of the exams this summer, because of demand from overseas.After Williamson announced on Wednesday that domestic exams would be scrapped, AQA told schools taking iGCSEs: “We need to work through the practical implications of this situation for our colleagues in the UK, but would like to reassure our schools, teachers and students that we currently intend to proceed with our summer series of international GCSEs and A-levels as planned.”Cambridge Assessment plans to go ahead with its exams and is currently advising users: “For schools in England that take Cambridge International exams, we are working with the UK government to understand more about their intentions. We will provide more information to schools as soon as possible.”The international versions of GCSEs and A-levels have been controversial in recent years, with claims that private schools use them to bolster their results since the qualifications are not subject to Ofqual regulation and their grades are not limited by prior attainment like their domestic counterparts.The move comes as most state schools in the UK were frantically adapting to the government’s order to close to all but vulnerable children, those with special needs and those with parents who work in key sectors, while at the same time holding emotionally charged meetings with staff, parents and pupils for what is almost certainly the end of the school year.Headteachers said they were working as fast as possible to provide remote learning for most of their pupils staying at home, while also trying to figure out the number of children to be looked after at school next week, and if it was safe to host them, and administering efforts to get food to those eligible for free school meals.The government delayed defining key worker status until Friday morning, leaving headteachers with little time to get parents to supply details and arrange staff rotas, catering and – in some cases - transport before the end of the day.“This week has been an epic one, with schools told they have to be closed but open,” said Kat Pugh, headteacher of St Marylebone CE School in central London, who described how her school called each family of pupils with special needs or vulnerabilities to establish if they wanted their child to attend.Pugh said the school then emailed all parents with a questionnaire about key worker status, but on Friday afternoon said she still wasn’t sure how many pupils or staff would be in on Monday morning.“We’re expecting 40 to 50 students, but it may be 20 or it maybe 60,” said Pugh, who said she needed to balance the needs of the families with the dangers caused by students mingling and using public transport.Other school leaders were preparing to juggle staff and sites to provide the supervised care that the government has demanded.Martyn Oliver, chief executive of Outwood Grange academies trust in the north of England, said: “All our 33 schools are due to be open from Monday for those students coming in – children with an educational, health and care plan, children in need, those on the child protection register and looked-after children, while all of our schools have a vulnerable register. Then we will have children of those parents working in critical sectors.“We also have two children who attend private school and whose parents are doctors, so they have asked if they can come to school from Monday, which of course they can.”The pressure has been particularly acute for the leaders of pupil referral units (PRUs) and alternative provision, which educate a high number of vulnerable and special needs pupils outside of mainstream education, while special schools are also likely to have a high proportion of children eligible for care.Philip Potter, the headteacher of Oak Grove College special school said: “Teamwork from staff, families and the local authority is amazing, it is how we juggle numbers in a special school while operating with skeleton trained staff.”The headteacher of one primary school in Dorset said: “Staff are responding well, spirits are high and we are getting on. It is all very Dunkirk spirit!”Paul Tarn, the leader of the Delta academies trust that runs more than 40 schools across Yorkshire, said his organisation was grouping its schools into clusters to keep fewer open and support social distancing.“We are more likely to sustain our support through the length of the epidemic this way than if we try to run standalone schools,” Tarn said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/368e9ea63a02044a9399e65e7257bd188117838a/0_0_5211_3127/master/5211.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=48f137cd00d14956222302005c1283e8","title":"nature is taking back venice wildlife returns to tourist free city","story":"With the cruise ships gone and the souvenir stalls closed, the coronavirus lockdown has transformed La Serenissima’s waterwaysLook down into the waters of the Venice canals today and there is a surprising sight – not just a clear view of the sandy bed, but shoals of tiny fish, scuttling crabs and multicoloured plant-life.“The water is blue and clear,” said Gloria Beggiato, who owns the celebrated pole Hotel a few steps from St Mark’s square and has a view over the Venice lagoon. “It is calm like a pond, because there are no more waves caused by motorised boats transporting day-tripper tourists. And of course, the giant cruise ships have disappeared.”Under Venice’s strict rules of self-confinement to prevent the spread of the coronavirus – all journeys but a trip to walk the dog or buy food are forbidden – the ancient city has been transformed almost overnight.La Serenissima’s hundreds of canals have been emptied of speeding motorboat taxis, transport and tourist boats. The chugging vaporetti water buses now run on a reduced timetable. Even most of the gondolas are moored.The clarity of the water has improved dramatically. Swans and cormorants have returned to e for fish they can now see. At the Piazzale Roma vaporetto stop, ducks have even made a nest. “Someone has put up a sign saying, ‘Don’t tread on the duck eggs,’’” Beggiato said. “All totally unimaginable a while ago.”As the death toll from coronavirus in Italy outstrips that of China, the government of Giuseppe Conte has tried to keep citizens at home using a mix of social media and police controls.But locals are still moving about cautiously to do their daily shopping – except now in a city without visitors. It is a remarkable transformation for a city that until recently saw protests against overtourism under the No Grande Navi (“No more cruise ships”) slogan.At the world-famous and usually overcrowded Rialto market, most of the fish and vegetable stalls are still open, though customers are few and far between. All markets are allowed to serve customers at a minimum one metre distance.In a queue to buy fish, Franco Fabris, an architect, reminisced: “When I was a kid growing up, there were far less boats in the canals and lots of kids would jump in and go swimming.”“For the moment I am not going out fishing as all the restaurants I supply have closed, so what is the point?” said Franco Folin, a fisherman. “But when this all over, we may well see more fish returning because for the moment pleasure fishing is prohibited – there will be an awful lot of extra marine life in the lagoon.”The apparent cleanliness of the water is not in fact due to a lack of pollution, said Davide Tagliapetra, an environmental researcher at the Institute of Marine Science. He told a local TV station that the reason is the absence of motorised transport, which normally churns up the muddy canal floor.Matteo Bisol runs the vineyard restaurant Venissa on the tiny lagoon island of Mazzorbo, and has been campaigning for a more eco-responsible, sustainable model of tourism in Venice for some time.“For goodness sake, it is not surprising there are fish in the canals of Venice,” he said. “If there were not, then we should all be worried as the lagoon here is a fragile ecosystem. People need to realise that if we control and cut down boat traffic in Venice and its lagoon then we could all discover a unique biosphere.”It is not just the cruise ships that are gone: the souvenir stalls that line the Riva degli Schiavoni, the Murano glass and lace shops, and the bars and restaurants are all closed.It is a brutal hit to an economy that relies on tourism, but in the meantime locals appear to be rediscovering their city, in an admittedly constrained way.“We Venetians have the feeling that nature has returned and is taking back possession of the city,” said Beggiato.“If you ask me today – sunny blue skies, clear canals – then, yes, we would all like Venice to stay like this for a while. But we need, and look forward to, the return of tourists, though maybe not the 20 million a year that we have had to cope with.“I honestly believe we should take the opportunity of this lockdown to reflect and see how we can be more organised in the future to find a balance between the city and tourism.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e13596fd51e00e7a5fb86705d3ba8711a42ede61/0_0_3456_3456/master/3456.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3fd81043bcb47747be8da9e7a402dea9 480w","title":"in a spectacular fashion the escapist world of karl lagerfelds chanel in pictures","story":"From a rocket in flight to a life-sized recreation of a ski chalet, the late designer will go down in history as the creator of epic moments of visual fantasy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12c6eb4f692491e881d7def96c1aa7eb062db84f/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da61a672d6357acbb85ae2843867add4","title":"10 best high street tops in pictures","story":"There’s a top for everyone this season, from statement tie-dye tees to elegant polo shirts and big-sleeve blouses.

What does the film about the flour-bombing feminist protests at 1970’s Miss World get right, and wrong?Sally-Ann Fawcett, author, former beauty contestant and judgeFrom a historical point of view, the film Misbehaviour’s sequence of events was incredibly accurate: a women’s liberation group – including activists Sally (played by Keira Knightley) and Jo (Jessie Buckley) – set out to disrupt the 1970 Miss World contest at the Royal Albert Hall in London. They bought tickets and chose their moment to stand up, shake football rattles, shout, scream and throw flour bombs on to the stage. It was a pivotal moment. To do that during a live broadcast in front of millions of viewers – they really did make their mark. A lot of women took inspiration from that.I think things could have been stronger, though. I once met one of the protesters and she said one of them actually threw a rattle – and it only narrowly missed the head of Joan Collins, who was a judge. And they were really sorry they did that. In the film, it was more about the flour bombs, shouting and screaming. But I think it was trying to show all the angles in a very empathetic way.There were one or two small errors. For example, they referred to the contest as a pageant. Miss World wasn’t called a pageant until at least the 1990s. It was a “beauty contest”. And there is a storyline about the inclusion of South Africa’s first black contestant, Pearl Jansen, known as Miss Africa South, during the apartheid era. That was portrayed as the idea of Eric Morley, the owner of the contest, though it was actually the idea of his wife’s PA. It was shown as a triumph but it didn’t pan out that way: six years later, South Africa was not allowed to enter either a black or white contestant – although I realise nobody at the time would have known this.I met Morley and I think they got him pretty spot on. He had a flamboyance. There was a documentary from 1975 that showed him shouting and screaming at the contestants, as he does in the film. They got his wife Julia right insofar as she was trying to steer him in a more PC direction. Eventually, she got rid of the swimsuit section.They were spot-on with the host, the US entertainer Bob Hope, too. His wife says something like: “We know what happened last time you hosted it – you brought the winner home.” He had an affair with Miss World 1961. It wasn’t mentioned explicitly in the film but for those who know, it was cleverly done. In real life, Julia had to hang on to Hope’s arm after the attack because he wanted to dash off to the dressing room and not come back.There is a scene where a large group of male journalists and photographers run at the contestants. That sort of thing happened. Bookmakers would take bets and you would see the chief bookmaker going up to the contestants, looking them up and down and writing notes. It really was like a cattle market, as the feminist group says. Miss World was massive business in the 70s and 80s. Only recently has interest dropped.Morley later admitted that, even though the protest did shake them, they realised all the publicity actually kept Miss World alive. It continues but there’s no swimwear parade and it’s a lot more about the women’s personal achievements and charity work. Is it still a narrow definition of beauty? It is – but it’s about an overall persona. I don’t think pageants are as relevant today, not the way they were in the 60s and 70s, when they actually were a stepping stone for women.Sally-Ann Fawcett is the author of Misdemeanours: Beauty Queen ScandalsAnn Sidney, actor and Miss World 1964When I won Miss World we still had black and white TV. It was 1964 and I was a hairdresser, earning 30 shillings a week. Suddenly I was on a pedestal – and it was fragile. At that time, we went to modelling schools and all wanted to be debutantes. Beauty contests were a stepping stone for working-class kids, or so we believed. It was an amazing experience for me. I’ve travelled around the world five times. I had to do fashion shows – but I said: “I don’t want to be a model, can I at least compere?”I found the film was very entertaining and fair. It didn’t take sides, though I think they portrayed Eric Morley a bit cruelly, and Bob Hope. Eric was tough, it was his contest – after the war, we wanted to celebrate beauty again. But he was always very professional with me. He was portrayed as being very bossy and we all know that wouldn’t be acceptable today. Expectations were different for women: we weren’t used to standing up so much for ourselves.The camaraderie that exists between the girls really comes across in the film. In those days, lots of beauty contests were held up north, like in Blackpool. It was a way to make a considerable amount of money. One day, one girl would win the next, somebody else. As Miss World, whenever I toured anywhere, all those girls from the contest came out to visit me. Julia Morley said something about “furthering the cause of international friendship” and this was true.The feminist group rightly felt it objectified women. As a Miss World, you are a trophy, you are objectified, but you can have a lot worse things to deal with. I never felt uncomfortable. I’m 75 now but I was coming up to 20 when I won. I had a different mindset. We were much more naive and it might not be a choice that I would make now if I were the same age. Hopefully, women today have more choices. I think it’s wrong to choose one woman over another. In this day and age, it doesn’t fit well.I wasn’t aware of feminists making a noise about beauty contests when I competed. These days, beauty contest are looked down upon. But compared to how women are objectified today, they were mild.Carina Tyrrell, doctor, Miss UK 2014 and former Miss World contestantObviously, Miss World has changed but some things shown in the film still endure – the multicultural side of things, for example, and the fact that the girls develop friendships. Today, a lot of them keep in touch with one another. It’s quite a strong network. Some have even set up businesses together.Sally the activist’s experience at university also felt familiar. She is talked over by male peers. I went to Cambridge and was very lucky to be at an all-female college, where you didn’t have to compete with men. You were able to speak your mind.I didn’t realise that, back in 1970, Miss World was actually giving a platform to women of colour. It was won that year by Jennifer Hosten, Miss Grenada (played by Gugu Mbatha-Raw). And the film touched on women not being able to open a bank account without their husband, not being able to get their own contraception, and equal pay. Some of these are things we’re still fighting for.There is a swimsuit scene where they’re looked up and down. We didn’t have that, although I did take part in an optional swimwear photoshoot when I was competing in Miss England. I didn’t find it objectifying. But had I been walking down a catwalk with my statistics being read out, then I possibly would have.Fifty years on, Miss World is now run by Julia Morley. There is a scene where Eric is talking about the women’s body features and Julia says: “They’re personalities as well.” When she meets with heads of state in the Commonwealth Club, she talks about a shift in direction. You can see that she is taking on this leadership role and wanting change – and today the competition is very focused on its charity Beauty with a Purpose, which supports women and children worldwide. It has raised more than $1bn.What happens now, which wasn’t part of the competition in 1970, is each participant presents a charitable project, often issues facing women in their countries – for example, sexual harassment in Latin America and female genital mutilation in sub-Saharan Africa. The projects thought to benefit most will get funding from the charity, while the girl who becomes Miss World becomes a charity ambassador and supports the projects of the other girls.Today, you never have to wait as a camera hovers over your bottom or any other part of your body. And you don’t have any measurements taken, as they do in the film. People don’t touch your body. It was shocking to see people checking for bra padding in the film. We do still get called by our country – Miss UK or whatever – but that didn’t particularly bother me.I’m really quite grateful that the Miss World competition enabled a platform for the start of the women’s liberation movement. I’m a feminist and the competition has completely changed. Now it’s a network of strong-minded, caring women who want to bring change to their communities. And so I see it as really quite empowering."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a62e923c759156d2ba9051bfa441f83aac57ea4b/0_167_5021_3012/master/5021.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6745d432ad44f1644e4bbb9af4e65c5","title":"gabriel cleur lockdown italy football coronavirus","story":"Gabriel Cleur, of Alessandria in Serie C, describes life at the centre of coronavirus in the Piedmont region of ItalyBeing under lockdown teaches you many things, and there is one that my teammates and I are particularly united on: until football has been taken away, you don’t realise just how much you love the game and how big a factor it is in your life. But we also know we are in the middle of a situation that is much bigger than us.As players, we tend to live in our own bubble. We don’t really think external issues are going to affect our work, so the last month has been a massive jolt. I play for Alessandria, in the north-western region of Piedmont, and on Sunday we will have been virtually housebound for two weeks.Everything happened very quickly. Our last game was on 23 February and at that point we knew our match the following Wednesday would be postponed. We assumed it was a precaution but then our next fixture was also called off and the situation spiralled. Next we heard we would be playing behind closed doors but that was followed by a bombshell: our region was locked down on 8 March, and the entire country the following day, which meant the season was suspended and training banned.The days merge into one. We are so used to training daily, burning off energy, getting our stimuli that way, so it does drag on. Alessandria are in Serie C, the third ision, so our players do not have home gyms or anything like that. Many of us younger guys live in the same apartment block, where space and resources are limited. I’ve established a routine as best I can. The club have given us workout programmes that help with strength and fitness training – yoga, stretching, posture, core training – and that assists with the mental aspect too.I’m fortunate to be studying psychological science, via a university back home in Australia, so I’m using this as an opportunity to complete some assessments. I find I’m cleaning the apartment a lot and I’m on a mission to complete Netflix.The gravity of what is happening strikes when you go outside. Quarantine is strictly enforced and the streets are desolate. Everyone is required to carry a document that gives permission to do the necessities, such as going to the pharmacy or the grocers, or giving a relative or elderly person a helping hand. The police have stopped people and given them fines, or even a court summons, if they cannot show they are out for a good reason.Shopping takes time. Supermarkets have a limit of 10 or 15 customers, so the queues outside are long, while stocks of masks and hand sanitisers are wiped out as soon as they arrive.We are lucky to have an authorisation document that, as footballers, gives us leniency to go for runs as long as we are not in groups or near other people. When the weather allows I tend to run in an isolated place it doesn’t have the best terrain but you minimise the risks of contact with others and of getting into trouble.Nobody at Alessandria has tested positive for coronavirus, although I know of other teams in our league, some fairly near to us, where there have been cases. The club are on top of everything and doing well to filter fact from fiction, which brings some serenity to the team. A lot of our players have families and small children so they have a right to be more worried than someone like me, who lives alone. We are all keeping in touch and making sure everyone is OK.My situation has its drawbacks, though. I’m a long way from my family in Australia and my mother has found that difficult lately. At first I played down the seriousness of things when we spoke but it’s hard to keep the facts hidden. We have a daily phone call and I try to reassure her. Returning home is not really an option: I could have the virus but be asymptomatic. The reasoning behind our isolation is clear.We wait to see what happens next. I think the league has a meeting on Monday to discuss the season and, if coronavirus cases are still rising, I can’t see any chance it will continue. In a way I feel calmer about that than some of my teammates.Last season my parent club, Virtus Entella, did not play for nearly two months due to a complicated situation with the league. It means I’m used to this type of ordeal, in a strictly footballing context. I know the processes can take time and be a bit unclear. But I also appreciate there is lots at stake: I have several years left on my contract but wages at this level are not huge and I know some players whose deals expire this summer and need assurances.It has been difficult, but we have to keep perspective. I have food and am healthy there are people far worse off and we need to give them our support. The football authorities and clubs will have to find a way through this but there is another thing my fellow players and I are unanimous on: people’s lives are far more important than anything else.Gabriel Cleur, 22, plays for US Alessandria Calcio 1912, on loan from Virtus Entella.

It was my turn recently, and he greeted me at the pub with a set of Virgin Atlantic pyjamas.Usually, I am a “sleep-in-my-boxer-shorts” type of guy, regardless of the time of year. I like to give my wife something to have nightmares about, plus, first thing in the morning I like to look in the mirror to keep track of how many letters of the words “Calvin Klein” are obscured by my stomach overhanging my boxers. I am currently on the n and the K, and hope to move to full words by the summer.Sleeping in your boxers is a pleasant enough experience. It means getting ready for bed does not require looking for anything, and in the winter there is that sadomasochistic moment where you have to warm up the sheets when you get in. You also place yourself at high risk of cold hands and feet touching your bare skin: many of my mornings have been ruined by an icy foot to the stomach, as one of the kids jumps in.As is the nature of comedians, I will often be in bed when parcels and post are delivered. This means a scramble to the door, a realisation that I am wearing only pants, a scramble to a wardrobe, before scrambling back to the door to leave the DHL driver wondering if that was my penis he could see below my dinner jacket.For these reasons, I decided I would try the pyjamas out. When bedtime arrived, I went upstairs with my wife. I told her that I was going to be wearing pyjamas she responded by saying it didn’t need an announcement.The first issue was finding the bloody things. I spent five or six minutes trying to remember what I had done with them, turning our bedroom upside down, while my wife calmly retrieved hers from under her pillow – because unlike me, she gets up and has a structured morning routine. I always get up half an hour after I should, and leave a trail of destruction in my wake as I try to get to work on time. I will often return home after work to remember that I was running too late to put my breakfast stuff in the dishwasher, and so smashed it on the floor to save time.I have to confess to finding the pyjamas unreasonably comfortable. There is something about putting on loose polyester garments that makes you feel ready for an enjoyable sleep. The visual, however, was slightly depressing. I’m not implying that me in my boxer shorts suggests there is still some magic in the bedroom, but both of us changing into our pyjamas felt a little bleak.Still, having enjoyed the new nightwear so much, I decided I needed to experiment further. I worried I had been so narrow-minded about night-time options that I had allowed myself to be pigeonholed – so I purchased myself a onesie.It arrived last week. It’s cosy, it’s comfortable, and I feel as if I’m really getting ready for bed when I put it on. In fact, it felt great until I had to get up for one of my now-compulsory seven pisses in the night. I get out of bed, and try to stay semi-asleep as I go. This was rendered impossible: the onesie seems to operate a level of security similar to the nuclear codes – I couldn’t get out of the bloody thing. I spent several minutes fumbling around, trying to free myself via the usual zips, before panicking that I would have to tell my family I had pissed my onesie, and tearing myself out of it.My experiment is now over. ​I have decided to go back to my tried-and-tested boxer shorts. I can only apologise to any delivery drivers in the Crawley area."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/caa903ec84f01f3e107220390884f0fbe1b5a72a/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6f94b20ef0d46cfcebf16d7733d6a4b","title":"the secret of calm how to de stress if you have one minute five minutes or 14 days","story":" Anxiety is running high, and it can be difficult to find time alone to take a deep breath. Here is a guide to relaxing, however much time you have to spareWhile “stay well” has become the default sign off in the age of coronavirus, “it is really important to say ‘stay sane’, too”, says Lucy Atcheson, the psychologist and author of Anxiety Attacks. As situations change faster than we can process, and we try to muddle through, here are some anxiety-busting coping strategies, whether you have one minute to spare or a yawning, self-isolating fortnight.“Breathe yourself calm,” says the psychologist Linda Blair. “Inhale slowly through your nose, counting to three, hold your breath, and then breathe out for six counts.” Ten of those, she says, will reduce levels of the stress hormone cortisol, and boost feelings of wellbeing. Atcheson recommends sitting or standing with your feet hip width apart and inhaling, holding and exhaling for four counts each, breathing through your nose, especially if you’re feeling panicky, because “you cannot hyperventilate if you’re breathing through your nose”.“Learn a new word and use it,” says Blair. “Look at the word of the day on the Merriam-Webster website.” This simple act of self-improvement, she says, will make you feel more in control and confident about your ability to cope, “with a sense of, ‘Yes, I am moving forward,’” even though it’s not consciously tied to the current health crisis. Equally, five minutes is plenty of time to try a mindfulness meditation.In fact starting small is best, says Karen Atkinson, the cofounder of MindfulnessUK and the chair of the British Association of Mindfulness-based Approaches. “It is like building your physical muscles you start with low weight and reps, and then you build up.” Go outside, she suggests, and try a practice called taking in the good, “which really helps your psychological, emotional wellbeing. It’s springtime, so if you notice a beautiful flower coming up, savour the moment, and let everything else drop away. Just be with the physical and emotional experience of looking at the flower, or a bird perhaps. It takes 20 seconds for a positive experience to be registered in your brain, so stopping and feeling the air on your skin, and using your senses to be present helps to calm down any anxiety.”“Write a letter to yourself about all the good things you’re doing and how well you’re doing,” says Atcheson. The way to frame it, she says, is: “I’m going to write this letter to my best friend, who happens to be me, and I need to cheer them up. That really challenges the critical voice in your head and a lot of anxiety comes from not having sufficient faith in our own abilities.” If letter-writing isn’t your thing, try a gratitude journal, as Blair describes: “Write down three things that you’re grateful for. You may think at the beginning: ‘I haven’t got anything.’ Oh, yes you do. Spend 10 minutes finding three things. It makes you feel safe.”Two words: power nap. “When we get anxious, we start thinking emotionally, and we don’t use our logic any more,” says Blair. “The best way to regain perspective, and put logic back in the driving seat is to take a little break away from everything.” Lie down on the floor, on your back. Bend your knees and drop your hands to your side. Set your clock for 20 minutes or ask someone to tell you when the time is up. Close your eyes, says Blair, “and start the breathing that you did at one minute. And that is all you do.” You do not have to fall asleep, “but what happens is the thoughts that are running through your head neutralise. They are there, but they don’t have power.” At the end of 20 minutes, roll slowly on to your side, sit up and then go back to whatever you were doing.To avert the risk of being overcome with worry, it is important to structure this time so life still has purpose, meaning and joy, says Atcheson. “It’s possible with books, box sets, online exercise, trying a new recipe, talking to people who we don’t normally have time to talk to.” Build in healthy routines, starting each day with deep breathing, then exercise, and ending the day similarly – “not with high-adrenaline exercise but yoga.”Martin D Clark, the editor of Om magazine, recommends Yoga with Adriene on YouTube, and many teachers and studios are temporarily moving their classes live online, from Emma Tilley in Gloucestershire to Yoga at the Mill in Chelmsford. And remember the importance of microlifts – “small, almost imperceptible lifts throughout the day”, says Atcheson. “You may usually get one from grabbing coffee in your favourite cafe. Do something that makes you feel good for a moment.”Numbing the brain with mindless social media scrolling, she says, can allow depression and despair to slip in. Blair advises getting a pot for your windowsill and planting some seeds. “Things such as mustard and cress are good,” she says, “because you’ll see things coming up in a couple of days. And at the end of 15 days, you can eat them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b1b3eaeca71621192646fdd9e94536dc7293aa4/0_579_8688_5213/master/8688.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=162ac4c3d60f74112b816378c8311899","title":"the weeknd after hours album review abel tesfaye","story":"(XO RecordsRepublic RecordsIsland Records)Abel Tesfaye is starting to show remorse for his failed relationships – but only a little bit – on this wonderfully varied yet cohesive recordWhen Abel Tesfaye first emerged nine years ago as the Weeknd he arrived with such an immaculately constructed sound and aesthetic that it swiftly became a creative prison. While his early blend of doleful R\u0026ampB and emotionally despondent lyrics seemed fresh on 2011’s trio of influential, Drake-approved mixtapes – House of Balloons, Thursday and Echoes of Silence – by his disappointing major label debut, Kiss Land, in 2013 the conceit had worn thin.A rethink was in order. As with his 2015 commercial breakthrough, Beauty Behind the Madness – home to the lithe disco funk of Can’t Feel My Face, which offered a PG edit of the Weeknd’s lyrical tropes of unfulfilling sex and drug use – and its bloated follow-up Starboy, the new album After Hours attempts to blend the drip-fed, drug-addled mopes of yore with luminescent, Max Martin-assisted bangers your mum can sing along to.The agile After Hours might be his best attempt yet at fusing the two. Rather than sticking out like a sore thumb, the glorious 80s synthpop explosion of lead single Blinding Lights – No 1 in the UK for five of the last six weeks – blends in nicely with the album’s nostalgic palette of shape-shifting synth workouts, tactile minimalism and (on Too Late and Hardest to Love), splashes of drum’n’bass and UK garage. Just as those early mixtapes were buffeted by blog-friendly samples from the likes of Beach House and Siouxsie and the Banshees, the Phil Collins-esque ballad Scared to Live soars over a hilarious sample from Elton John’s Your Song, while new single In Your Eyes struts around a refreshingly uncool sax solo.Lyrically, he ventures into new territory too, albeit briefly. The album opens with a suite of songs that show a scintilla of remorse for failed relationships that never seemed to make it beyond the bedroom. On the widescreen expanse of the excellent Faith he croons, “thought I’d be a better man but I lied to me and you” in his best choirboy voice. The featherlight, Limahl-esque Save Your Tears, meanwhile, offers up a hint of self-reflection. Even when he’s apologising or looking for reconciliation, however, it’s always to serve him and him alone. “Where are you now when I need you most?” he mopes on the title track, while on slow-burn opener Alone Again you can imagine him padding mournfully around his apartment as he sighs: “I don’t know if I can be alone again.” Unfortunately, this being a Weeknd album, there are still moments of misogyny, specifically on the bloated Heartless, which seems like self-parody, and the risible, nearly six-minute epic Escape from LA, in which he details having very boring-sounding sex in a studio with women who have all had the “same work done on their face”. Not that he has a problem with that. “I don’t criticise,” he adds, leaving a pause to give himself a pat on the back.What connects After Hours so successfully to his early mixtapes is a sense of narrative cohesion, something the Weeknd seemed to value above all else when he started out. Here songs bleed into each other, with sonic references dotted throughout to neaten up threads that previously he would have left to unravel. By balancing the two sides of his musical personality – not to mention add some levity to that boring, bad-taste id – After Hours feels like the first Weeknd album in a while to offer up a clear, singular vision rather than something frustratingly abstract."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cfc0f259f855c2a6a0e34515826cd9a66f42f7f/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83f6a9259bfc3deaef126aa59c269c29","title":"weatherwatch why climate change harder spot uk us","story":"Changeable weather in mid-latitude countries may have masked impact of climate crisis up to now, study findsThe data tells us that climate change is real, but sometimes the feeling on the ground is far from convincing. A spell of hot weather can always be compared to a similar spell of hot weather from way back in the past. Similarly a big storm, intense rain and flooding often have parallels from long ago. Now a study in Geophysical Research Letters reveals that the signs of climate change are harder to spot in mid-latitude countries such as the UK and US, and easier to see in the tropics.Ed Hawkins, from the University of Reading, and colleagues compared global mean temperature fluctuations with local temperature fluctuations for different parts of the world. They show that while the global average temperature has wiggled smoothly upwards, a mid-latitude location such as Oxford in the UK has always had wild swings in temperature. “Climate change impacts in some countries are being hidden by their own changeable weather,” writes Hawkins. By contrast increasing temperatures in tropical regions are more obvious because the background climate is steadier in these regions.When it comes to rainfall, the data reveals a clear signal of increasing extremes, masked in mean rainfall plots.

However, the coronavirus outbreak has led firms to demand immediate aid.Graham Vidler, the chief executive of the Confederation of Passenger Transport, which represents bus companies, said: “Operators are under extreme pressure and facing impossible choices over which routes they have to cut and how many staff may have to go. We urgently need the government to help now to secure the future of the industry.”Firms collectively employ about 100,000 drivers and 120,000 support staff. More journeys are made by buses than trains, not least by key workers and the public to reach hospitals.The confederation said companies were ready to help the national response to the crisis in different ways, possibly using buses as mobile grocery stores for people self-isolating, or as mobile virus testing units.Meanwhile, train companies started to confirm which services would be pared back across Britain from Monday, with passengers urged to stop all non-essential travel.About half the timetable will be cut after ministers and rail operators across England, Scotland and Wales agreed to ensure core services and freight could keep running.Operators pledged to run enough trains for key workers and to allow the public to access medical appointments, as well as maintaining the flow of goods by rail. Franchised train operators have minimum service obligations and could have faced contractual penalties without government dispensation.The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said: “We are taking decisive action to protect the public, which means reducing travel for the time being, whilst still ensuring key worker heroes can get to their jobs to keep this nation running.”Shapps suggested this week that more rail networks could be temporarily nationalised but the government would be “flexible” over contracts. Several franchises were in financial difficulty because of stalling passenger numbers even before the current crisis.Operators will publish next week’s schedules by Sunday lunchtime. Many, including Northern, have already been forced to cancel dozens of trains at short notice because of sickness and self-isolation. It expects to be running rail replacement buses as part of its revised timetable.Among the first to announce emergency timetables on Friday were London and south-east commuter franchises. South Western Railway will cut all services on some branches, last trains will depart earlier from London Waterloo, and major lines will have only half-hour or hourly services, particularly outside peak hours. Southeastern said it would attempt to keep all stations open for now and stretch schedules over as much of the day as possible. Govia Thameslink Railway said it would make a second batch of cuts in a week’s time, and has already slashed trains to Gatwick airport.Network Rail has said retailers in its stations will not have to pay rent for the first quarter.In the capital, a reduced London Underground service has come into effect with the closure of 40 stations and the axing of the night tube.National Express said it would be running only a limited number of its nationwide coach services from Tuesday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5eacee5e9046b74ed21009e2fe1f0c82b86ada2/189_79_2971_1783/master/2971.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f6bdc0370bfabda12060f98cf7b6a312","title":"uk coronavirus live confusion over key workers list as schools close","story":"All the day’s developments as UK death toll reaches 177 and government announces new clampdown alongside financial easing. This blog is now closed, please head to the latest global coronavirus liveblogThat’s all from us for today on the UK side – and what a day it’s been. But the global coverage of the pandemic continues over on our worldwide coronavirus blog, which you can continue to follow here.What are the symptoms of Covid-19, what treatments are available and how do I protect myself and the people around me from infection? Our health editor, Sarah Boseley, answers some key questions as coronavirus spreads across the globe in this video explainer.Following the government’s announcement that pubs, clubs, cinemas and theatres are to close from tonight, the ’s data team have found this will affect some 1.4 million workers across the country. There are some 39,000 pubs and bars across the UK employing 450,000 between them, all of which will be forced to close their doors from this evening while a further 75,000 people working in 7,600 clubs will be affected.The median wage for all full- and part-time employees stood at £24,897 last year. Torsten Bell, head of the Resolution Foundation think tank, has also found a couple of problems with the chancellor’s plan - including limited support for the self-employed or low paid workers.Resolution are broadly supportive of Sunak’s announcement, saying:The Chancellor’s hugely welcome and unprecedented pledge to pay 80 per cent of the wages of employees without work to do in struggling firms is a crucial step change in the government’s economic response to the current crisisThe big gaps that remain in support are for two million low earners that are not entitled to Statutory Sick Pay and for the self-employed seeing work dry up because of the crisis, beyond those benefitting from the abolition of the Minimum Income Floor in Universal Credit.He says the chancellor has moved in the right direction, but not “far enough or fast enough”.McDonnell is disappointed that the government hasn’t boosted statutory sick pay, or providing more help for carers. He’s also worried that the wage guarantee scheme won’t be up and running fast enough to save jobs:Speaking from Bute House this evening, Nicola Sturgeon has repeated the UK government’s call for restaurants, cafes, pubs, gyms and cinemas across Scotland to close, telling the public that staying at home “will save lives”.Sturgeon said that people working in the NHS and care services “will be tested like never before”, and also promised “unprecedented” support from the Scottish government for the economy,Speaking directly to particular groups, the first minister began with older people: We’re asking you to stay away from your grandkids, from the people you love. That’s hard, but it’s so you can stay around to see them grow up.To children: I know this is a strange time, you’re away from school and won’t be able to spend as much time with friends. The adults around you are probably feeling a bit anxious too. So help them, follow their advice, study and do your homework, but don’t forget to have fun, and wash your hands.Describing modern technology as a “lifeline”, she urged people to call, text and Skype loved ones and neighbours: At times of crisis we need each other more, but we are boing told to stay apart, but we can still communicate and offer comfort.Asking the public once again to follow health advice, she concluded: This crisis is reminding us just how fragile our world is but also reminding us what really matters, health, love, solidarity. With compassion and kindness and with the dedication and expertise of our NHS we can and we will get through this. Fire and rescue service personnel must receive priority testing and vaccination for coronavirus, the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) has said after some brigades reported losing hundreds of staff to self-isolation.In a letter to ministers, the FBU has said that without testing, firefighters and control staff could be self-isolating unnecessarily, when they could be on hand to protect the public.The union also says that testing could help reduce the risk of frontline staff transmitting the infection to vulnerable members of the public.Fire and rescue services across the UK are operating with 11,500 fewer firefighters than in 2010, and, unless services are able to test their employees, they could face dangerous shortages.Business leaders and unions have both welcomed the government’s new economic emergency plan, as they brace for Britain to slump into a deep recession.Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general, believes the coronavirus job retention scheme could be the start of the “economic fightback”.“This is a landmark package of measures for business, people and jobs. The Chancellor’s offer of substantial payroll support, fast access to cash and tax deferral will support the livelihoods of millions. Firms and employees will respond with relief and determination.“It marks the start of the UK’s economic fightback - an unparalleled joint effort by enterprise and government to help our country emerge from this crisis with the minimum possible damage. An important day for our country.” Dave Prentis, general secretary of the UNISON union, believes Rishi Sunak’s plan will protect jobs: “People concerned about their jobs and livelihoods will feel hugely reassured today that the chancellor has acted swiftly.The whole country is understandably anxious about the spread of the virus, being unable to see their loved ones or buy the food they need in the shops.“Now at least the fear of being laid off and having no income shouldn’t be one of them.“UNISON will continue to work with employers and businesses providing our public services to make sure the money gets to people as a matter of urgency.”TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady is also impressed, saying Sunak is showing “real leadership”:Following Boris Johnson’s press conference, first minister Nicola Sturgeon has asked all restaurants, cafes, pubs and cinemas in Scotland to close. Speaking in a televised address from Bute House in Edinburgh, she said the number of cases of Covid-19 are set to rise sharply. She said everyone must act now to slow the spread of the virus, adding that we must also reduce the number of people we meet and come into contact with.The Wetherspoon’s in Leytonstone, east London seemed to be filling up in the moments following the prime minister’s announcement, whereas the nearby Bird pub was not as busy as it normally would be on a Friday evening. The publicans were not shocked by the news pubs would be closed at the end of the night and felt it was “about time”.Andrew Rose, a study abroad administrator is returning to Sydney, Australia tomorrow. “Pubs are not as packed as they usually would be and they’re the only hubs we have. I’ve been practicing self isolation all week.“I think the uk has had adequate restrictions, people have been practicing social distancing. It’s the same in Australia.”“Closing pubs now is fine, they said people shouldn’t go but had no protections for them. The pub today only has about 20 people in it so people are practicing social distancing.”Caitlin Morgan and her colleague Nick Slotnick are both from Woodford, and work in a local college. “It’s sad but inevitable.

It is currently slated for October but full-scale pre-rehearsals were still planned for this month with the leading actors. Lloyd Webber has now found himself self-isolating, like so many of us, and in an idle moment asked his Twitter followers which of his songs they’d like to hear him play at the piano. The song that came out on top was All I Ask of You from The Phantom of the Opera and in a video shared on Twitter, Lloyd Webber plays the tune “in C major because my arthritic fingers couldn’t do it in C flat”. He is accompanied by his dog. (“It’s alright, it doesn’t come from Cats,” the composer quips to camera.)Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda was one of many who enjoyed the video, tweeting: “It’s almost your birthday and you give us gifts. Thanks maestro.” Lloyd Webber, who turns 72 on Sunday, replied suggesting they have a play-off.With a Phantom mask on top of his piano and children’s toys in the background, Miranda duly picks up the challenge from “AL Dubs” and plays Everything’s Alright from Jesus Christ Superstar. Its lyrics strike a note of comfort in these uncertain times: “Try not to get worried  Try not to turn on to  Problems that upset you, oh.” Miranda asks his followers to imagine a red bucket on the piano for donations to a Covid-19 emergency assistance fund. He ends by throwing down the gauntlet to Lloyd Webber: “Sing You’ll Be Back from Hamilton – you know, the one about your friend the queen, the great-great-great-great grandma.”Miranda is no stranger to virtual creative partnerships. In 2018, he sent the Decemberists frontman Colin Meloy some leftover lyrics from Hamilton and they created Ben Franklin’s Song together.

Choose yours wisely, says sleep expert Dr Rangan Chatterjee Do you wake up with an aching back? With pain in your neck? Or an acute need for high-strength coffee? How you feel the second your alarm goes off tells you legions about how well you slept. And the underlying cause of your sleep issues could be literally lying under you: your mattress is the foundation to a good night’s rest.“One of the big problems with sleep is that we underestimate the importance of getting eight quality hours,” says Dr Rangan Chatterjee, M\u0026ampS sleep ambassador and author of The Stress Solution. “Once you prioritise your sleep, it automatically improves.” Sleep is fundamental to how we feel in the day. If you look in the brain after a bad night’s sleep, says Chatterjee, “you see a collapse in memory, attention, cognitive function, decision-making capacity and the ability to learn new things.” And an increased likelihood of exploding when there’s an unexpected item in the bagging area at the supermarket, because a bad night’s sleep is synonymous with a bad mood.Admittedly, we all have a few big nights out and accidental midnight Netflix binges, but sometimes we’re unable to sleep well through the night at no fault of our own. And a common culprit? That old mattress you’ve been making do with. “When your mattress is so comfortable that you can’t wait to get into bed in the evening, you send a powerful message to your body and brain,” says Chatterjee. Think of finding the right mattress as an act of self-care, up there with going to yoga or cooking a healthy dinner.Waking up covered in sweat isn’t necessarily a symptom of nightmares. The answer is more practical than that, says Chatterjee: “Being physically hot at night will wake you up. Being cool is critical to good sleep, so keep your bedroom at a cool, well-ventilated 17C.” If keeping the window open isn’t an option, or you’re still overheating, treat yourself to a cooling mattress topper or a luxury mattress with thermoregulating properties.If you often wake up feeling stiff, a memory foam mattress can feel like a miracle. The material is also supportive if you’re tossing and turning, or you have joint problems. “For some people, memory foam can be absolutely life-changing,” says Chatterjee. “The material adapts to your weight and body shape, so it’s very personalised.” As your body sinks into the mattress, you may even feel your spine start to stretch out. It’s the restorative antidote to hunching over a desk during the day.So how do you know you’ve found the right mattress? Simple, says Chatterjee: “When you lie down and you don’t want to get up.” Sweet dreams.The natural option: Made using cashmere, silk, pashmina, lambswool and cotton, the Natural Plus 1500 Medium mattress (from £499) is a pocket spring mattress with an enhanced natural and supportive feel.The M\u0026ampS Sleep Shop has everything you need for a great night’s sleep.

The secret to a good night lies in your evening routine, says  Alexandra Jones“We all have our own unique relationship with sleep, but two things are true for all of us: to sleep soundly we need to feel safe and settled in our environment,” says sleep therapist Nerina Ramlakhan, author of Fast Asleep, Wide Awake. The solution is multi-sensory. “Creating a pre-bedtime ritual, incorporating visual, physical or olfactory cues can be a good way to foster those feelings,” she says. “So my most important tip is to find a routine that helps you to drift off and to stick to it.”And it’s not just about the 20 minutes before bedtime. “From the moment you step through the door in the evening, start making the transition from the busyness of the day to a relaxed state that’s ready for sleep,” says Ramlakhan. “There are a few small tricks that can be incorporated into anyone’s evening, no matter how busy.”But where do you start? “Lighting is paramount,” says Ramlakhan. The hormone melatonin is responsible for making us fall asleep the pineal gland in our brain naturally starts to release more melatonin into the bloodstream at night. However, bright lights, especially screen light, can delay the production of melatonin by stimulating a nerve pathway connecting the retina in the eye to an area of the brain called the hypothalamus. “Candles are a good option if you don’t want to delay the onset of melatonin release,” says Ramlakhan. She recommends two hours of low light, giving the brain plenty of time to start pumping the sleep hormone into the system. Opt for the Calm Candle, £7.50, which releases a gentle fragrance mix of clary sage, lavender and sweet orange – formulated to promote relaxation.In fact, lavender has long been used as a natural sedative as far back as the 14th century, Charles VI, king of France, is said to have demanded that lavender be stuffed into his pillows to help him sleep.“My own bedroom is scented with lavender,” says Ramlakhan. Over the past 10 years, several studies have found that, neurologically, the smell of lavender oil has anti-anxiety and analgesic properties. “The scientific benefits of aromatherapy interventions are still being understood, but incorporating them into our night-time routine can make us feel calm from the associations we have with the smell.” As well as lavender, Ramlakhan uses eucalyptus because, as she explains: “It was used in my childhood a lot – and that memory makes it a potent relaxant for me. Adding something with a strong aromatherapeutic smell into your night-time routine can act like a trigger, telling your brain that it’s time for sleep.”When you’re sleeping away from home, bring your bedtime routine with you to reduce the unsettling feeling. So, if lavender is part of your night-time ritual, says Ramlakhan, “the associated behaviour and smell is likely to help you relax and create feelings of safety.” Ren Pillow Spray, £19, is blended with essential oils, including lavender.Alternatively, switching your regular shower gel to something like L’Occitane Aromachologie Relaxing Shower Gel, £16.50, could work just as well. It has a blend of essential oils that infuse the steam with a relaxing scent. “And if you’ve got time for a bath in the evening, salts are a great way to relax tired muscles,” says Ramlakhan. As well as washing away tension, This Works Deep Sleep Bath Soak, £22, smells ine and will leave your skin feeling soft and hydrated.The trick is not to leave showering or bathing too late. Like light, body temperature plays an important role in preparation for the night the process of rapid cooling after a hot shower is proven to aid sleep, but it takes about 90 minutes to reach peak drowsiness.

Here’s what she learned‘We can grow that grass. When I go on holiday in Spain, I’m like: ‘Ah, it’s brown.’ You come here, it’s green! That’s because of our ability to grow grass!” I have to admit, this wasn’t exactly the answer I was expecting when I asked Tom Pemberton what made him proud to be British.Pemberton is the only farmer I’ve ever met. And therefore the only vlogging farmer I’ve ever met. He runs a highly successful YouTube channel called Tom Pemberton Farm Life, which he started three years ago as a way to publicise his dad’s farm shop. His videos include Let’s Talk Grass and Poo, and We Need a Big Hammer. And his 145,000 subscribers lap it all up.I’ve been travelling around the UK for the past four months and quizzing young people including Pemberton about Britishness for my new podcast, United Zingdom. What makes them proud – or not – to be from here? How do they see their identity? And, most crucially: could I be British?When I was a teenager, I moved to London from Singapore – a freckle of a city on the lower elbow of the Malaysian peninsula. Now, 15 years later, I’m eligible for a British passport. But Singapore doesn’t let people claim dual nationality, so I’d have to give up one for the other.I’ve always hesitated to make the jump. I’m pretty comfortable claiming my identity as a Londoner – but British? What does that even mean in these post-Brexit times? I decided that I had to find out before I committed. I told friends that it was like scoping out a party invitation (and, before you ask, yes, I’m the kind of person who stalks the other attendees before I click “attending”).Truth be told, it’s more like marriage. A citizenship ceremony isn’t so different from a wedding – they both involve taking vows in front of a council official and your loved ones, and pledging yourself for ever more to a single person. Or, in this case, a country. So it made sense to, well, get to know my beau a little better.After months of traversing the UK, here’s what I’ve found: Britishness isn’t easily defined. Every time I thought I got a handle on it, I’d meet someone who upended it. I found myself both passionately disagreeing and agreeing with the things people told me. But what struck me most is the fact that British people have such little self-awareness, and I mean that in a purely observational way (no offence).The things that seem most self-evidently British to me – such as the strained, almost sweatily perverse, urge to remain polite at all times and the love of drinking pints – are never what occurs to anyone.There are the cliches, obviously. Harry Potter gets mentioned so does the Queen. But there have also been lovely moments of clarity. RuPaul’s Drag Race contestant Sum Ting Wong said that multiculturalism made her proud to be Brummie an insight that made me – an immigrant who has felt, at times, unwelcome in this country – feel much more at home.As the country slowly shuts its schools, offices and pubs in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, it’s easy to look at your neighbours with suspicion. Are they hoarding loo roll? Are they coughing a little too loudly through the walls? Did they nick the last bag of pasta from Aldi? Small-minded parochialism can be part of the British identity – after all, this is the country that invented the phrase “curtain-twitchers”. But my experience making United Zingdom is that it doesn’t have to be. I’ve sat on sofas in Cardiff, split fried halloumi sticks in Bradford and shared countless pots of tea up and down the country. People have let me into their lives, their living rooms and, yes, their farms.I haven’t made up my mind yet about the passport, but I think that kindness counts for something in a potential date. Don’t you?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/356e21cf5d3368bf0701f02031c2bd96c4f409a8/163_535_1270_761/master/1270.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fd6a203b1162e102e8d6f17684869f9","title":"tiger king joe exotic netflix series","story":"The directors of Tiger King thought they were making a film on big cat ownership in the US. Then their subject was charged with plotting a murderTiger King, a new Netflix docuseries resulting from a five-year odyssey that fully earns the term wild, started, perhaps surprisingly, in the reptile world. In 2014, Eric Goode, a film-maker and longtime conservationist, was looking into a notorious snake dealer in south Florida when a stranger mentioned, off-hand, “check out what I just bought”. There’s a collective “oh shit” when he slides open his van to reveal a snow leopard resting in a cage, in 100F heat. “It just blew my mind: what is a snow leopard doing in the back of this guy’s van?” Goode says early in episode one. “That set me on this journey to really understand what is going on with people keeping big cats in this country.”If only it stayed that simple. Over the next five years (and seven 45-minute episodes), Goode and co-director Rebecca Chaiklin followed the thread of private big cat ownership in the US – a disturbing if fascinating topic in and of itself – down a rabbit hole including, in no particular order: a murder-for-hire plot of a rival big cat owner, a theory that said owner fed her millionaire husband to tigers (there’s no evidence to support this, though the husband’s children from a previous marriage have aired the claim in local media), a guru-led harem based around an exotic animal park in Myrtle Beach, an accidental gun death and a federal sentence for animal abuse. That’s aside from the astounding fact that there are more privately owned tigers in the US (somewhere between 5,000 to 10,000) than in the wild (fewer than 4,000), kept as pets or in side-of-the-highway wildlife menageries.But all that comes later, as Goode and Chaiklin follow the descent of one of the most notorious tiger owners in the US: Joe Maldonado-Passage, professionally known as Joe Exotic, who ran a 16-acre private zoo in Wynnewood, Oklahoma, with dozens of tigers, plus lions, bears and alligators. The film-makers first learned of Joe, an attention-loving eccentric with a bleached mullet, piercings and a penchant for leopard-print outfits, through Carole Baskin, operator of Big Cat Rescue in Tampa, Florida, and Joe’s philosophical opposite. She had “a hitlist of ‘bad guys’”, recalled Chaiklin via email. “And Joe was her No 1 bad guy” as a prominent breeder of tigers for “cub petting”, a cottage industry in which people pay for photos with baby tigers, which grow to be unmanageable after about 12 weeks and are then frequently discarded, mistreated or euthanized. “Carole was completely obsessed with Joe, which naturally made us quite curious about him,” said Chaiklin. They reached out, and soon were filming in Wynnewood, about an hour north of the Texas border.Joe loved the publicity (“Joe loved being on camera more than just about anything,” said Chaiklin), his husbands (of which there have been several, sometimes overlapping, throughout the series’s five-year timeline), and his YouTube and TV channels. But he hated Baskin, who he accused of feeding her husband to tigers in the late 1990s and who had successfully petitioned malls across the country from hosting his cub petting shows. “The feud between Carole and Joe and their obsession with each other was quite comedic at first – it had a very best in show feeling to it,” said Chaiklin. But there was no end to the escalation – as documented in the show’s early episodes, Joe frequently and crudely mocked Baskin in his broadcasts, threatening to set venomous snakes on her and even shooting a dummy of her in the head.And then, in September 2018, in the middle of the Tiger King project, he was arrested on charges of hiring two hitmen to kill Baskin. “This story is a film-maker’s dream in how it evolved narratively,” said Chaiklin. “However, when you spend a lot of time filming with people, you get to know them quite well. So on a human level it was quite difficult to process some of the unexpected twists it took.” Some of Joe’s commentary in the series is taped from jail phone calls in January 2020, he was sentenced to 22 years in federal prison for the Baskin plot and various wildlife violations.Still, Joe Exotic’s fall from self-proclaimed Tiger King to prison is but one of several absurd threads in the series, in part because the world of big cat ownership in the US is isolated, unregulated and propagated by cults of personality. “All of these characters check out of mainstream life,” said Goode via email. “They have created their own inidual universes – little ‘utopias’ – along with their own set of rules, which ultimately was Joe’s greatest downfall.” For example, Goode and Chaiklin interview Bhagavan “Doc” Antle, a polygamous, guru-styled owner of Myrtle Beach Safari who has been accused by a former longtime employee of running a cult, and by Joe Exotic of euthanizing tiger cubs once they outgrow petting (he has denied these accusations his compound was raided by federal agents in December 2019) Jeff Lowe, a former Joe Exotic business partner and con artist who took over and dismantled the Wynnewood zoo and Tim Stark, a former Lowe partner and private zoo owner in southern Indiana who is also under investigation for animal cruelty. And that’s not even getting into the staff and associates of each.It’s easy to see how Goode and Chaiklin obtained too much material over five years on this story – there’s a miniseries on Antle’s compound alone – but the most gutting and dramatic thread remains the shadow trade of wild animals in the US. “I’ve been in this exotic animal world for a long time, and I wanted to expose the exploitation and the suffering of these cats,” said Goode. In typical American fashion, regulation of the ownership of big cats such as tigers and lions is scant and confusing, varying state by state or even county by county. States such as Oklahoma have almost no regulations. “In some places there are more regulations on keeping a pet dog than a pet tiger,” said Chaiklin.“It’s not dissimilar to guns – you can buy an AR-15 in Oklahoma and you can buy a tiger in Oklahoma easily,” said Goode of an unwillingness of state and federal governments to wade into private wildlife regulations. A federal bill to impose much stricter rules on private ownership of big cats, the Big Cat Public Safety Act, has not passed Congress.It’s clear, even after just an hour of Tiger King, that there’s an intoxicating allure to big cats – a force that draws visitors to lucrative private zoos, turns keepers into fanatics and beckons viewers deeper and deeper into what can seem like an alternate reality. In Tiger King, reality is stranger than fiction and the characters larger than life, their morality, and culpability in Joe Exotic’s fall, up to viewer discretion. “I hope as film- makers, we have told this story in such a way that the audience will arrive to their own conclusions,” said Goode, while “ultimately … recognizing that the real victims in this story are the cats”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d90148d5e1e42b04b36a630a28a79a59a4c721ff/0_255_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b9a4a428beef2e85253aa54227fc453","title":"detroit automakers shut down plants workers return build ventilators coronavirus","story":"Plants close but United Auto Workers union says most workers likely to return amid shortage due to coronavirus pandemic Detroit automakers shut down their North American plants this week amid growing fears over coronavirus spreading among blue-collar employees working in tight quarters.Soon they could be back – building ventilators as a shortage presents the US with a potential health crisis.Relations between the Big Three – General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler – have been tense of late after GM workers walked out in their first strike in a decade.But most workers are probably open to returning to the line, said D’Andre Jackson, a United Auto Workers (UAW) committee representative at GM’s Flint Assembly Plant. He added that he would “go back if it would help the country”.“I think the majority of the UAW members wouldn’t mind doing what it takes to get America back running,” Jackson said. Though workers just demanded to leave the plant over coronavirus fears, Jackson said the cause has changed.“Instead of working for profit, you’re working to help save some lives, and I think a lot of people would join in on that,” he said. “It’s what they did during wartime, and that’s what they say we’re in now. I think that if it was on a voluntary basis they could get people to go back in.”Both automakers have confirmed that they are in discussions with the US government, which this week invoked the Defense Production Act, legislation that goes back to the second world war and grants the president broad powers to direct industrial production.“Right now, we are doing an internal study to evaluate this as an option, and we are looking at ways we could help during this crisis including potentially supporting production of medical equipment such as ventilators,” a GM spokeswoman, Jeannine Ginivan, told the .However, a United Auto Workers spokesman, Brian Rothenberg, said the proposal had not been run by the union. Its leadership was busy working to shut down the plants and did not immediately have a comment, he added.It’s unclear how retooling the factories or sending workers back into them during a pandemic might work. The Trump administration economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, told Fox News this week that an executive said she “might even ask them to do it on a voluntary basis for civic and patriotic reasons. That’s the kind of can-do spirit that we’re hearing and seeing”.Ford, which will suspend production following Thursday evening shifts through 30 March, said in a statement that it “stands ready to help the administration in any way we can, including the possibility of producing ventilators and other equipment”.“We have had preliminary discussions with the US governments and are looking into the feasibility. It’s vital that we all pull together to help the country weather this crisis and come out the other side stronger than ever,” it said.In the meantime some 150,000 UAW workers will be put on a temporary layoff. A GM spokesman, David Barnas, said employees “will be compensated”, though specifics were still being hammered out.“It’s the right thing to do, but they should’ve done it a couple days ago,” said a worker from Ford’s Dearborn Truck Plant who declined to provide his name.The UAW has been pushing for temporary closures for several days. Automakers initially resisted those calls, prompting threats of a walkout among an increasingly frustrated workforce. On Monday, UAW Local 600 filed a grievance at the Dearborn Truck Plant in which it demanded a two-week suspension and coronavirus testing for all employees.Any return to work will have to come with better safety protections for workers during the pandemic.The UAW president, Rory Gamble, said temporary closures were “the prudent thing to do”.“These companies will be put on notice that the UAW will use any and all measures to protect our brothers and sisters who are working in their facilities,” Gamble said. “And make no mistake, we have powerful allies who have stepped up to help us.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/499089b4e0d978b4c54b17d7a02cd6cfc812482f/0_117_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6123b551b8120fa55faa3fbdb325cb5","title":"new york 90 day stay home order what it means","story":"Governor Andrew Cuomo has ordered all non-essential businesses to shut down and for New Yorkers to remain indoorsGovernor Andrew Cuomo of New York has ordered the shutdown of all non-essential businesses in the state, as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases surged above 7,000. Except for essential services, all New Yorkers are now ordered to stay indoors from 8pm Sunday evening.Cuomo called the new measures the “ultimate step” to curb the outbreak.“These provisions will be enforced. These are not helpful hints. This is not if you really want to be a great citizen. These are legal provisions,” he said at a briefing on Friday morning in Albany, the state’s capital. “We need everyone to be safe otherwise, no one can be safe.”The governor also announced a 90-day moratorium on evictions for residential and commercial tenants.What does a quarantine mean for New York state’s 19.5 million residents?Can New Yorkers go outside?Yes. Although New Yorkers are strongly encouraged to stay indoors and public gatherings are limited, they can still go to the grocery store, hospital or doctor’s office, walk their dogs or even head to the laundromat. That’s simply because state officials have determined these activities are essential.Although residents are still allowed to enjoy the outdoors, the governor reminded them to use common sense in maintaining social distance.“Outdoor recreation is a solitary recreational exercise. It’s running. It’s hiking,” he said. “It’s not playing basketball with five other people.”Only professionals in industries also deemed essential during the outbreak will be permitted to go back and forth from their jobs. Residents working in healthcare, sanitation, food services, law enforcement as well as gas stations and laundromats won’t see specific limitations on their movement.All non-essential businesses have been ordered closed, however, after state officials increasingly demanded staff reductions. Previously capped at groups of 50, non-essential gatherings of New Yorkers of any size, for any reason, are now banned.What happens if residents don’t comply?Cuomo announced that the mandate applies to all iniduals and business in the state. But it’s important to note the measure stops short of being a so-called shelter-in-place order, which is intended for mass shootings.In contrast, California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, issued an order mandating residents shelter-in-place earlier this week, although Cuomo on Friday said California was no longer officially using that term.However, unlike New York’s regulations, California’s mandate is enforceable as a misdemeanor crime, and demands sheriffs and police chiefs “ensure compliance with and enforce this order”.In New York “the violation of any provision of its order constitutes an imminent threat and creates an immediate menace to public health”, the mandate states.Any businesses violating the order would be fined and forced to close. However, Cuomo insisted the state does not plan to fine iniduals who violate the regulations.What about transit?New York is home to the county’s largest, and oldest, transportation system of subway trains and buses – the MTA in New York City. According to the order, mass transit will stay operational, but residents are strongly discouraged from using public transit unless it’s absolutely necessary.Roads, gas stations and some auto repair services will stay open.In New York City, the mayor, Bill de Blasio, had pushed for a shelter-in-place order to limit even non-essential travel, such as by foot, bicycle or scooter. However, the state governor had repeatedly dismissed the idea, insisting New Yorkers would not be confined to their homes under a quarantine. The governor is the only official with the executive power to order a city or the entire state to, in effect, lock down. Donald Trump reiterated on Friday that the federal government was not ready to order a nationwide stay-at-home order.The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus soared by more than 1,000 in the city in just a matter of hours on Thursday. Under Cuomo’s order announced on Friday, essential travel is categorized as traveling for necessary supplies, accessing healthcare or going to provide aid to family or friends. Air travel and taxis are still permitted, as is ride-sharing on a personal basis, excluding group rides.The new provisions will take effect on Sunday night."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa67bc8de9ed3f9cac23840eadd452ccbd8261be/0_232_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc89081563e94db721d1f31297b8e322","title":"new york center us coronavirus","story":"The number of infected people in New York City has risen rapidly, and experts are worried about glaring gaps in preparedenessby  Ed Pilkington in New YorkNew Yorkers can’t say they weren’t warned. Andrew Cuomo, the governor of the state, spelled it out a week ago when he told the 8 million residents of New York City that as soon as testing was widely available the coronavirus numbers “are going to be shocking”.Even with his dire warning ringing in their ears, New Yorkers were still stunned when the truth finally hit on Thursday. Within a single day, the number of confirmed cases in the city had more than tripled to 3,954 – almost a third of all coronavirus cases in the nation.Of those, almost one in five of the sickened iniduals have needed hospital care, much higher than is typical, underlining the massive challenge to the city’s health system. At least 26 have died.“We’re seeing an explosion of cases here in New York City,” Bill de Blasio, the mayor, said.That’s just the start. “The latest figures reflect only the tip of an iceberg,” said Theodora Hatziioannou, an associate professor in virology at the Rockefeller University in Manhattan.“Keep in mind that estimates suggest each infected person transmits the virus to another two to three people, who in turn can transmit to others, and you begin to grasp the magnitude of the problem.”A contagion that began as a west coast crisis, affecting a nursing home in Washington state and upending daily life in California, is now striking the east coast with a vengeance. New York City has become the undisputed center of the US pandemic, inheriting that grim distinction from Seattle, which has fewer than a fifth of New York’s recorded cases.Today, a city that prides itself as the world’s capital of finance, fashion and the future finds itself asking an existential question: can it cope with something as age-old as a disease?The answer is not wholly comforting. The scale of the mountain that the city’s hospitals and health workers must climb over the next days and weeks is daunting, and there are glaring gaps in preparedness.“If all those get sick at the same time, then I do not see how the NYC healthcare system will be able to cope,” Hatziioannou said.The only hope, as most New Yorkers are coming to recognize, is that social distancing will flatten the curve and not only reduce the number of infections but spread them over time to avoid a catastrophic spike. “We have to try and distribute the number of infections over as long a period as possible. That way, critical cases will not require ICU treatment at the same time,” she said.She added: “Even with such measures, New York will struggle.”That struggle was on full display on Friday when De Blasio let his frustration and anxiety rip on MSNBC, saying that the city would run out of basic medical supplies including ventilators and masks by early April. “I’m telling you, in two weeks’ time or three weeks’ time, we will have nothing left,” he said.It’s self-evident that things are bad in New York when De Blasio – who based his mayoral and recent failed presidential campaigns upon his leftwing credentials – starts pleading with Donald Trump to send in the US military. “The military is needed in New York right now,” he told NBC News.The mayor wants federal reinforcements to help deliver extra stocks of essential equipment. He has presented Trump with a shopping list of 15,000 ventilators for those patients unable to breathe alone, 3 million N95 respirator face masks to protect essential health workers and 50m surgical masks.New York has some of the finest hospitals in the US, but when it is presented with a contagious disease of such potentially monumental proportions the weaknesses are glaringly exposed. At every stage in the process of caring for patients fighting Covid-19 there are now projected shortfalls.That starts with the most basic item – hospital beds. The city has about 20,000 beds and De Blasio has unveiled plans to add an additional 8,200.In advance of the deluge, hospital managers have desperately sought to empty their bed capacity by discharging regular patients and suspending all elective surgeries as New York-Presbyterian hospital has done.With existing hospitals expected to become overrun within days, provision is also being made for creating ad-hoc intensive care units and field hospitals using tents, commandeered hotel rooms and a disused nursing home in Brooklyn. Appeals have gone out to the federal government all week to dispatch the army corps of engineers to help build emergency hospitals, with Cuomo announcing on Friday that “they are in”.Ventilators too are in potentially short supply. The machines, which are critical in keeping the most severely afflicted alive by helping them to breathe, are a top priority, Cuomo said on Friday. “Ventilators, ventilators, ventilators: that is the greatest need,” he said.The state as a whole could need 37,000 ventilators but currently only has 3,000. Cuomo appealed for any health facility with spare machines to hand them over.New York city has one advantage – that it has been through these wars before. New Yorkers have grappled with anthrax, Ebola, West Nile virus and the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic in which up to 1 million people fell sick. The problem this time round is the unusually high transmission and lethality rates of Covid-19.Experience is also not enough unless it is coupled with decisive leadership from the top. On that level, New York’s early response to the coronavirus crisis has been less than exemplary.On Monday, De Blasio was spotted at his favorite haunt, the YMCA gym in Park Slope, Brooklyn, despite mounting calls from his own office for New Yorkers to avoid social gathering places and with Broadway shows and the city’s 27,000 restaurants already having been told to close.Those terrible optics followed days in which De Blasio was bitterly criticized by teachers and New York scientists – Hatziioannou among them – for hesitating over closing the city’s public-sector schools. It was not until Monday, at precisely the time he was seen in the gym, that schools were shuttered until at least 20 April.And De Blasio and Cuomo, who have a long history of mutual antagonism despite both being Democrats, have also been squabbling over how far to take social isolation.De Blasio has been pressing for a shelter-in-place order citywide, like the San Francisco Bay Area and, from Thursday, all of California. Cuomo overruled until Friday then announced that all non-essential workers are mandated to stay home, from Sunday evening.Meanwhile, both New York politicians are in a state of barely concealed apoplexy towards Trump. The White House has so far failed to move on many of the city’s requests, and when the president did agree amid much fanfare to dispatch a navy hospital ship the USNS Comfort to New York the Pentagon was forced embarrassingly to point out that the vessel was undergoing repairs and will not be ready until April.‘Where the hell is the federal government in the middle of the biggest crisis we have seen in generations?” De Blasio howled on Friday.The city is very obviously not in the greatest shape to enter a conflagration.But then, the “city that never sleeps” has always confounded the critics with its tenacity and resilience. What happens over the next two weeks will test it to the limit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/110065117a9cf3f154b0dd976cd75aefbb779767/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44eaa9b2fc8f25348865dbee9401c30f","title":"anywhere but westminster we need your help covering the coronavirus","story":"Become part of our new video project documenting the impact of the outbreak across the UKFor 10 years, the ’s Anywhere but Westminster video series has been about getting out into communities, giving voice to ordinary people, and trying to find a new way of covering politics and current affairs.

After a phone consultation with her GP she was diagnosed with a chest infection and prescribed antibiotics.She began self-isolation last Monday in Manchester, where she lives, but moved to her cottage in Wales on Sunday. “I’m one of the fortunate ones,” she said. “It’s a very difficult situation for elderly people. The majority of us live productive lives and hope that society will take care of us when we are older, but we appear to have been abandoned by the health service and the government.“I’ve finished the course of antibiotics and now I just hope it goes. I’ve been putting Vicks on my chest and taking menthols. I’m quite determined.”O’Neill has been trying to support the people she works with from home. “We offer a lot of activities like horse riding, crafts, etc. Some of those won’t be possible now but we are trying to find ways to deliver other services using video.“I’ve been reading a lot and am nearly caught up with the programmes I’ve missed. At the moment I’m watching Hidden. I have three children and eight grandchildren and I’m actually trying to stop the social contact. When they all try and call it’s the end of the day before I know it.”John, who works as a bicycle courier in Manchester, decided to self-isolate on Saturday after waking up with a cough, fever and shortness of breath. “I wanted to be cautious as my job involves visiting people who might be vulnerable to coronavirus.“I messaged the supply company and they disabled my account for seven days, so I’m unable to work,” said the 24-year-old. “This wouldn’t normally be a problem but they have funds available for people who have coronavirus, but they’re not available unless you get medically tested.”As people were not getting tested for the virus unless they had been admitted to hospital John feared some people in the gig economy may not have access to the funds they need. “It makes sense as it prevents fraud but it’s a very difficult time,” he said.John said he reduces social isolation by talking to people all day on platforms such as Discord, where gaming communities can chat and share their screens while playing. “Not talking to real people can be difficult because you struggle to validate whether your thoughts are valid,” he said. “Hearing people’s voices makes you feel human and it’s a good way of trying to maintain social connections without social contact.“I live alone and one problem is that I don’t tend to remember what day it is. We’re so used to doing things that define our time off work that being at home means not having that shared experience.“I’m anticipating going back to work soon though, as people need food delivered, and there could be someone who is reliant on me.”Rosie,* who works in an office in London, has been in self-isolation for over a week. “I filled in the 111 questionnaire online and it advised me to call my GP,” she said. “I could only get through to a receptionist who advised me to go to the pharmacy, which I didn’t think was a good idea because I had a sore throat and was coughing.“I’m lucky enough to get two weeks’ sick leave from my workplace and my colleagues are supportive and understanding,” said the 37-year-old who is at home with her husband, who works in finance in IT. “My husband’s employer has been pushing for me to get tested but I can’t.”Rosie has been too unwell to do anything but rest at home. “I don’t need to think about how to pass the time as I’m actually sick. I feel tired and weak so I don’t want to do anything. Passing the time is not a big problem.”Andrew Moscrop, 42, works as a GP in Oxford, and has been in self-isolation since Friday after his temperature rose to 38.6C. “My fever resolved over the weekend,” he said. “Any other time I would go back to work as normal, but I can’t.”Moscrop contacted 111, Public Health England, the local health protection agency and the John Radcliffe hospital in the hope of being tested. “The advice was the same. Stay at home. It’s quite frustrating as at the end of the day you just want to do your job.“We are facing an escalating caseload and the government has talked of drafting in retired clinicians. Surely we should be testing frontline health workers so that, if negative, they can return to work promptly after an illness?”Moscrop’s partner, who also works in the health service, has also had to self-isolate along with their young child. “It’s become a bigger issue than we thought,” he said. “The government’s advice doesn’t seem entirely thought through as there’s nothing to say this won’t happen again later down the line.“We need to remain fairly pragmatic about it. We’re surrounded by fields so I took the little one out for a walk and a breath of fresh air. Soon I’ll have to pop out for food. I won’t wear a mask but I’ll just nip in as quickly as possible and use self-checkouts. My partner looked at getting food delivered but the available dates were quite far into the future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47cae858e7397f8ed4bf6e2c4da00f46102ac994/0_62_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=946102312972887f99b4ed44c1715b4e","title":"behave or face strict coronavirus lockdown germans told","story":"German citizens could be confined to their homes from Monday if people do not act responsiblyItaly and Spain have both reported their biggest single-day death tolls from the coronavirus as Germany’s 83 million citizens were warned they would be confined to their homes on Monday if they fail to behave responsibly this weekend.As Europe’s governments ramp up already draconian restrictions to curb the coronavirus, authorities in Rome on Friday announced 5,986 new cases and a record 627 new deaths, raising the totals to 47,021 infections and 4,032 fatalities.In Spain, the death toll rose to 1,002, a highest-ever increase of 235 in 24 hours. The latest statistics showed 19,980 confirmed cases across the country, more than a third in Madrid. Army specialists are to help disinfect care homes after the virus claimed more than 50 lives at elderly care facilities across the region.The army, already deployed in northern Italy to help move bodies as funeral services are overwhelmed, will also be used to help police the lockdown in Lombardy, regional president Attilio Fontana said. “The request to use the army is accepted and 114 soldiers will be on the ground,” Fontana said. “It is not enough, but it’s positive.”Helge Braun, Angela Merkel’s chief of staff, warned that a near-total lockdown – as in force in Italy, Spain and France – could soon be necessary in Germany. “We will look at the behaviour of the people this weekend,” Braun told Spiegel magazine.“Saturday is a decisive day, and we will keep a close eye on that.” The chancellor would hold a conference call with state premiers on Sunday, he said.The epidemic has infected more than 255,000 people worldwide and killed more than 10,400, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. Italy on Thursday overtook China as the centre of the biggest outbreak, with authorities in Beijing on Friday reporting no new cases of domestic transmission for the second day running.Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus task force response coordinator, said the virus appears to be less deadly for younger people but warned that data from Italy indicated the fatality rate is twice as high for men across all age groups. “No one is immune,” she said. “We know it’s highly contagious to everyone.” Mexico and the US announced plans to sharply limit travel over their busy shared border as part of efforts to control the outbreak.As Spanish health authorities warned the peak of the crisis was still a few days away, frontline care workers described beleaguered hospitals operating near capacity and struggling with severe shortages of protective gear such as masks and gloves.“The current situation in hospitals in Madrid is critical,” said Ángela Hernández of the Association of Doctors and Professionals in Madrid. “The healthcare system is in a state of alarm.” Spain’s health minister has promised reinforcements, including medical students and recently retired physicians.In the UK all cafes, pubs, restaurants, gyms and other similar venues were ordered to close from Friday evening for the foreseeable future, and the government followed some other European countries in saying that it would pay a large proportion of workers’ wages.Belgium, which entered lockdown on Wednesday, on Friday reported its biggest daily rise in number of deaths since the beginning of the epidemic. Sixteen more people had died from the virus, the health ministry said, bringing the total to 37, with more than 2,000 cases.As in many European countries, schools, kindergartens, bars, nightclubs and non-essential shops have been closed in most parts of Germany and people urged to avoid unnecessary social contact in a bid to avoid a full-scale lockdown.But people are still socialising outside, some even organising “corona parties”. The leaders of Germany’s states warned mandatory confinement would be next. “Unless everyone fundamentally changes their behaviour, we won’t avoid tougher measures and sanctions,” said the Baden-Württemberg premier, Winfried Kretschmann.The country’s largest state, Bavaria, led the way on Friday, instituting a lockdown from midnight. “We are not locking Bavarians in but we are winding down public life almost completely,” the state premier, Markus Söder, said.Beyond Europe, more than 1.2 million Iranians ignored pleas by the government, clerics and local authorities to stay at home, taking to the country’s roads at the start of Iranian new year. Iran on Friday reported 149 new deaths, making a total of 1,433 and 19,644 confirmed cases in all. South Africa said its confirmed cases had risen to 202, the most in the sub-Saharan region, while Tunisia announced a lockdown.In the US, the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, ordered all workers in non-essential businesses to stay home and banned gatherings statewide, while California’s population of 40 million experienced their first day under lockdown.President Trump said US authorities were aiming to fast-track the antimalarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine – synthetic forms of quinine, used to treat malaria for centuries – for use as a coronavirus treatment.Both Italy and France have said this week that they will extend their restrictions and may tighten them further as the number of deaths on the continent continues to rise.In Austria, which has reported more than 2,200 coronavirus cases and six deaths, the chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, said on Friday that the signs were encouraging, but the country must continue to “stick with the measures” it had taken earlier. “Hold tight,” Kurz said. “We must not slow down.”In France, which on Friday reported 12,612 cases 450 deaths, President Emmanuel Macron said the country was only at the beginning of the crisis. “We are right at the start,” Macron said. “We have taken exceptional measures to absorb this first wave, but we’ve started a race against the virus. We must react strongly, and reorganise ourselves continually. We need to anticipate.”On Friday, authorities reminded people that exercise should be confined to 20-30 minutes in close proximity to home and alone, adding that they should only leave home once a day, choosing between, for example, shopping and exercise.Police would step up security checks in Paris train stations from Friday, a spokesman said, as the country further escalated its lockdown measures. Like anyone else in France stopped by police without documentation to justify their presence outside their homes, rail passengers will face a fine of €135 (£123). The mayor of Nice imposed a curfew starting from 8pm local time, going a step further than the national lockdown."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f15cdb587f07efb012ce3e9ef40a688dde116608/0_78_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=302c56c5cb2bd4b32056270c84fcba0a","title":"california lockdown shelter in place traffic schools jobs","story":"Streets are empty and schools closed as the state takes dramatic action to stop the spread of coronavirusForty million people on Friday morning woke up to a locked down-California, grappling with new rules about what to do and where to shop as the state battles the coronavirus pandemic.At a press conference late Thursday, when Gavin Newsom, the California governor, announced a shelter-in-place order that asks people to stay home unless absolutely necessary, he said the rate of coronavirus was doubling every four days in some areas of the state. The degree to which the hospital system will be overwhelmed will depend on how Californians respond to the restrictions, he said.It was a dramatic escalation in the state’s attempt to curb the spread of a coronavirus the governor said could over the next eight weeks could infect 25.5 million people – more than half the state’s population.Non essential-traffic at the US-Mexico border, the busiest port of entry in the US, had been halted on Friday as both countries sought ways to defend against an unseen virus.A few minutes north in Chula Vista, where a city councilman has been hospitalized after he was infected with coronavirus, police use drones rigged to loudspeakers to enforce the lockdown.Los Angeles was a shadow of its ordinary self. Famously gridlocked freeways stood virtually empty, prompting bored-at-home Angelenos to open Google Maps just to marvel at the rare green sight of uniformly traffic-free roads in the middle of the day.The traffic reduction led to significant improvement in air quality as smog and pollution dramatically declined. Across LA county this week, the air was consistently ranked as “good” quality, instead of at levels officials deem “unhealthy” for many, which frequently dominate the region in normal times.At the Wine House, a prestigious outlet for wines and spirits in West Los Angeles, staff were quick to shoo out the last lingering shoppers shortly after the restrictions took effect, telling customers that orders would be strictly by curbside delivery from now on.“They say we’re not an essential service,” an Italian wine specialist, Lance Montalto, said as a colleague hastened to lock the doors. “In a crisis like this, I think we should be.”Their economic worries matched that of the city’s small army of waiters, bartenders and restaurant hosts who were laid off a few days ago. Many of those restaurant workers are also aspiring actors, but auditions and shoots are off the agenda as the TV and film industry screeched to a stop.One of LA’s most prominent chefs, Nancy Silverton, announced that she was turning one of her restaurants on Melrose Avenue into a relief center for laid-off restaurant workers that would provide 300 high-quality meals every night for the next two weeks, paid for by the whiskey company Maker’s Mark, along with a variety of household essentials.Up north in Sacramento, the first day of shelter-in-place felt like a weekend-come-early.The clangs of the passing trolleys and beeps of the pedestrian walk signals echoed in the downtown area’s near-empty streets.The typical steady flow of pedestrians had slowed to a trickle, with few still pacing the sidewalks with dogs and grocery bags. Parking, a precious commodity in California, was plentiful, with lines of meters blinking blankly next to swaths of spaces. The Capitol Mall, usually buzzing with activity on a weekday, sat quiet and peaceful under blue skies, few cars and even fewer people passing by the state house.Downtown Sacramento businesses generally heeded the governor’s advisories early on, with bars and brewpubs closing down earlier in the week. On Friday, some restaurants with their chairs stacked on top of their tables were open for take-out and delivery only. Some bars were completely dark, with gates pulled down and shuttered.“Downtown is kind of a ghost town,” said Shane Nicolette, 27, a barista at Temple Coffee Roasters. “Over the last week, it’s been a progression of state workers and people who work downtown, figuring out how they can work from home. Now it’s kind of integrated into everything over here.”On a typical weekday, Nicolette would serve up to 500 people. On Friday, he served 50.“It’s been a struggle for everyone,” he said. “We’ve had to cut hours back, way back. And when you work for tips, it’s a huge impact going from a line out the door to one person every 10 minutes.”Other businesses downtown have already started letting their workers go. The manager on duty at Rodney’s Cigar and Liquor Store, who asked to be identified only as Bob, said he learned right after the governor issued his shelter-in-place order that he lost his other job working as a parking attendant at the downtown Marriott and Hyatt hotels. “It’s been rough, really rough,” he said. “I got to find some place else, some place unaffected. We’re all looking for some place unaffected.”The lack of business as usual downtown made the presence of Sacramento’s homeless population stand out in sharp contrast. None of the unhoused iniduals approached by a reporter said they had heard from the city, county or state about coronavirus, or about washing their hands, nor had they received any hand sanitizer.“I just know what I’ve been hearing from the past week out on the street from other people,” said Thomas Mitchell, 44. “I didn’t even know the coronavirus was here until it was already here.”Mitchell has already suffered a stroke and a seizure while out on the streets, as well as the stomach flu. He’s not worried about getting coronavirus.“I’ve been out here eight years,” he said. “I’ve already been sick. So be it.”But while the rest of the state comes to terms with the new restrictions, life seemed to be slowly taking on a new, if altered, sense of normalcy in the Bay Area, where a shelter-in-place order took effect on Tuesday.Midmorning, two medical students at the University of California San Francisco stationed themselves at a typically busy corner of the city’s Mission District, soliciting N95 masks. They made sure to stand six feet apart, a distance enforced by a tape measurer they’d extended.Behind them, dog-walkers and parents with children enjoying a warm spring morning dotted the usually crowded Dolores park.Even as workers nailed plywood over windows of nearby shops, the video-rental section of Fayes coffee did brisk business.“We’re telling people if you want to leave your house once this week and rent 15 movies, we’re not going to be charging late fees,” said the store owner Justin Lawrence.Life had re-emerged, too, on the trails and sidewalks lining Oakland’s iconic Lake Merritt.Sidewalks filled only with radio silence on Monday night had been reanimated by Friday morning, as bikers and joggers awkwardly navigated a 10-ft sidewalk while trying to observe social distancing norms.Nearby, Amber Fina, 30, was organizing clothes in the tent where she sleeps. She said she’s lived through similar restrictions amid a hurricane in her native Florida, but the lockdown in Oakland was posing unexpected challenges.“It’s making it impossible to get money. Not that many people are out, and if they are nobody wants to get close to you to hand you money. I need to eat,” Fina said.Fina held up a bag of purified water and a bottle of sanitizer, which she said two healthcare workers delivered when they came through the encampment this week to take her and her neighbors’ temperature. Police have been kind, she said, coming around to ask if she needed services. They haven’t chased anybody off the encampment, she said, not even when the guys three tents down set a fire near their tent earlier this week.Two construction workers near a playground smoked as they took a break from a project underway. One of the workers, Greg Stevens, said he was happy for the work.“I’m more worried about everyone losing their minds and panic-buying everything,” Stevens said. “Did you see the crowds at gun stores? I’m an avid shooter, but c’mon. To me, that’s the dangerous part. People losing all reason.”Kendall Shotwell looked on as her two-year-old son Rider, wearing a hat that said Little Dreamer, ran in circles in a nearby playground and hopped on the scooter he’d commandeered from another child.Shotwell’s husband is also in construction and works as an electrician, but he’s been off work. Unlike Stevens, who was working on a residential project, deemed essential under the new restrictions, Shotwell’s husband was working on a commercial, and therefore non-essential, project.Shotwell said she’s grappled with the ethical and moral quandary of letting Rider outside to run and play, while also adhering to the state’s guidance.“I know the order lasts until 7 April, but how long is this really going to last, and when can he see his grandpa?” she said. “That’s my biggest question. Along with how much people can really take and where the breaking point is.”In the meantime, Shotwell said she’s trying to live by her grandma’s advice to make lemons into lemonade and enjoy “the great indoors”.Later in the day, Rider has a playdate scheduled. He’s going to FaceTime with his pals from preschool.Mario Koran reported from Oakland, Vivian Ho from Sacramento, Peter Lawrence Kane from San Francisco, and Andrew Gumbel and Sam Levin from Los Angeles."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0449e0fddd1890b9f2932b06557fb2344f6e6195/0_280_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=17c4a21925237ef3f533cc35b1c8edb5","title":"chinese life slowly gets back to normal as the epidemic subsides coronavirus","story":"Restrictions are being eased across China as the number of new infections recorded drops sharplyAt 44KW, a nightclub in Shanghai, life almost feels normal again. Bartenders mix cocktails for patrons leaning against the bar. Groups sit close together without face masks on, talking and sipping their drinks. A young woman pulls down her mask and speaks into her phone as she livestreams to her followers. A DJ plays disco under a neon sign saying “Dance me to the end of love” while a few venture out to the dance floor.“Right now we need music,” said Kaijie Huang, 27, who manages the club, which reopened its doors last Thursday after more than a month of staying shuttered as Shanghai joined cities across China in various levels of lockdown to contain the coronavirus outbreak. “A lot of people seem very lonely because they all had to stay at home,” she said.For many in China, life is slowly returning to normal, giving other countries a glimpse of what might await them once the worst of the epidemic has passed.Elsewhere in Shanghai, women walk arm in arm past a reopened shopping district. Narrow pavements are crowded as residents browse food shops. At one entrance to a hospital, a man wore his hazmat suit partly unzipped as he waved in cars.In Beijing, traffic has begun to return and more residents can be seen out on the streets, in parks and in shopping and restaurant districts. Jia Shu’na, 20, travelled to Beijing on Wednesday, a stop along her route back home to Inner Mongolia to resume classes.“Now I feel like things are gradually recovering. Now a lot of transportation has opened up,” she said, sitting in a park with her luggage. Jia said she noticed long lines at the train station when she departed from the southern province of Yunnan, and several people in each train car. “Many people have gone out. It’s much better than before,” she said.More than 80,000 people have been infected by the virus that first appeared in the city of Wuhan, killing more than 3,000, but the daily number of new infections has dropped dramatically.For several days in a row, China has reported no new locally transmitted infections. Authorities are loosening restrictions and trying to crank back up the stalled economy, urging factories and businesses to resume operation.Some experts doubt the numbers officials have been reporting, noting inconsistencies in reports of what areas are deemed “low risk”. Others worry cases could spread again once normal life has resumed.“It is likely that cases will rise once China eases its control measures. This means they will have to maintain vigilance for a surge of new cases and decide how to respond,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University in the US.On Wednesday, the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, ordered officials at all levels of the government and Communist party to move with “urgency” in restoring economic and social order. In low-risk areas, production and normal life “must be fully restored,” he said, according to state broadcaster CCTV.On Thursday, Wuhan reported no new infections for the first time. Local authorities in the surrounding Hubei province, outside Wuhan, loosened travel restrictions, allowing residents deemed healthy to begin moving around. Companies are able to arrange for their workers to come back to Wuhan and most car checkpoints have been removed.Hospitals have resumed normal operations, opening to patients with conditions that are not virus-related. On Friday morning, the city of Honghu, south of Wuhan, officially ended its lockdown.For those in Wuhan, however, life has not yet returned to normal. Residents are still barred from going outside of their residential compounds. The streets remain mostly empty. Food supplies are still difficult to source and the prices are three to four times higher than normal, according to Iris Yao, 40, who has been at home with her parents for most of the last two months. She is still rationing their supplies, making one cabbage last a week and pooling with others in order to buy groceries at cheaper bulk prices.While Yao says the situation has improved dramatically, she disagrees with the characterisation from Chinese officials and state media that the government’s methods have been a success.“In terms of controlling the epidemic and requiring everyone to stay at home, that worked,” she said. “But the beginning was a failure. The virus was able to spread because of what was not done. The sacrifices Wuhanese people have had to make are huge.”The outbreak prompted a level of public anger and criticism directed at the ruling party not seen in decades. But as the epidemic lessens within China and the crisis worsens in other countries, relief has begun to displace outrage and anxiety.“At the beginning, I wanted to yell at the local government. Everyone was getting sick and unable to get help,” Yao said. That anger turned to a sense of dissent, Yao said, after the death of a doctor who tried to warn colleagues about the virus.“Now I feel like my emotions are going back to normal some. There is a little more light,” she said. “Now we are not in a state of fear.”There are many ways that life has not returned to normal. Economists say the Chinese economy will take a large hit, which could pose an even larger threat to social stability in the wake of the outbreak. Analysts believe the economy is on track to experience its first quarterly contraction since 1989.Day-to-day life for people across China will remain stilted for some time. Office buildings, shopping malls and other public places still require people to be registered and their temperatures recorded. Several areas require people to show a “green” reading though a smartphone app called Health Code, through WeChat or Alipay.At Tianzifang, a recently reopened shopping district and tourist site in Shanghai’s French Concession, the measures have created a bottleneck. A small crowd is gathered at the entrance where two guards try to guide confused patrons through the Health Code app, as well as an additional ticket to enter.For others, the added measures are perfunctory. At the gate to one neighbourhood of Shanghai’s iconic lane houses, a guard sat next to a folding table with a clipboard to register those coming in and out. Residents quickly stuck their arms out for their temperature to be taken. One walked away before his reading came up while others noted with surprise changes in their temperature.“The last place said I was 33 degrees. How can I now be 36?” one asked, complaining about inaccurate thermometers being used in the city.While China has reported no new locally transmitted cases, the country has still seen daily increases in those coming from abroad, prompting worries of a rebound. Imported cases reached 228 as of Friday, as infected travellers were confirmed not only at major hubs like Beijing and Shanghai but in provinces including Liaoning, Gansu, Heilongjiang in the north and Zhejiang, Fujian, and Sichuan in the south and west.“The number of imported cases in China has further increased. So the pressure to be on guard has also increased,” said Wang Bin, an official of the national health commission at a news conference on Friday.Xi has ordered officials to be vigilant at the borders, and international flights to Beijing have been erted to other cities. Wariness of foreigners has increased. As one US citizen struggled to check into a hotel in Shanghai, a woman waiting in line murmured: “Before, everyone was afraid of Chinese people. Now it’s the reverse.”At 44KW, patrons must show their Health Code reading and foreigners have to bring their passports to show they have not been in virus-stricken areas recently. For now, the club cannot host DJs coming from overseas. Yuan Qingai, 26, a singer, is livestreaming from the club and speaking to more than 100 fans online.She tells them that she is speaking to foreign media about the epidemic. They quickly advise: “You should wear a mask.”Additional reporting by Dave Tacon and Lillian Yang"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4abc4c919ef5efa5943a2fd81183ee9167217ae2/0_1351_2186_1312/master/2186.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=30051bd13432c023f4618d9e1c9244ae","title":"coronavirus impossible mother tirade remote schooling","story":"Israeli tells her children’s teachers, ‘Enough – it’s not working’ in an Instagram videoParents of school-aged children who are frustrated with being forced by coronavirus to supervise their education for potentially months on end have found their champion in a very cross Israeli mother.She rails on Instagram that, “It’s not working this distance learning thing. Seriously, it’s impossible, it’s crazy!”“You’ve finished us off - it’s only the second day! If we don’t die of corona, we’ll die of distance learning!” she shouts into the camera in a 90-second rant posted on Instagram.“One of my daughter’s teachers is living in a dream world if he thinks she’ll get up at 8am to see him on screen. 8am she only just manages to roll over in bed. Where do you get off?” she says. The woman, who says she has four children, complains that schools are asking too much of parents who are running from “one child to the other – here’s science, here’s math – forget it! And how am I supposed to know all those things? Now our children will find out how dumb we are… How am I supposed to know how to transform an improper fraction?“The music teacher of my youngest sent over a musical score this morning. What am I going to do with that information? What, have I got some band in the house? I can’t read music. Just one second, let me pull out my clarinet and help my son with his score. Enough guys, teachers, dial it down with the expectations.”It raised the issue of the extra stress placed on parents – as well as on children – by schools around the world closing due to coronavirus. “The kid’s fine, he’s on his cellphone all day. I’m falling to pieces,” the mother in the video says.The closure of schools has been one of the most contentious measures introduced – or not – by governments in their efforts to fight the coronavirus. More than 70 countries have made the decision to shut down schools in the hope of reducing the spread of the virus.On Wednesday, Boris Johnson announced that schools across the UK were to close indefinitely and that A-level and GCSE exams would not take place."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/057ccb905652fc199bbe89ddd264a1f166cbd876/0_294_3494_2096/master/3494.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85793ad49b365f9792c5a4e73f7830be","title":"coronavirus symptoms doctor covid 19 cough","story":"What are the symptoms caused by the new coronavirus, how does it spread, and should you call a doctor?It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organisation has declared it a pandemic.The virus can cause pneumonia-like symptoms. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the symptoms as experiencing either:No. In the UK, the NHS advice is now that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home. This applies to everyone, regardless of whether they have travelled abroad.In the UK, you should look on the dedicated coronavirus NHS 111 website for information. If you get worse or your symptoms last longer than seven days, you should call NHS 111. People will no longer be tested for the virus unless they are in hospital.Many countries have imposed travel bans and lockdown conditions in order to try and halt the spread of the virus. You should check with your local authorities for the latest advice on seeking medical assistance.China’s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. As of 20 March, more than 244,000 people have been infected in more than 150 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.There have been over 10,000 deaths globally. Just over 3,200 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China. Italy has seen over 3,400 deaths. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated.More than 86,000 people are recorded as having recovered from the coronavirus.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4f32d8900f9fee142a9b0a05b1fb49735150d9d/0_302_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=236131e96309656f76c20ab7907f7993","title":"coronavirus the guardians promise to our readers","story":"Together we can find a way through this crisis, providing accurate and insightful reporting and listening to you, our readersThank you very much for your commitment to the .

The children, two girls and a boy from West Berlin, eventually managed to get their ball back, but not before the Stasi had thoroughly documented the ball’s position – “around 25 metres from the border markings” – and photographed the ceremonial return of the offending object.A lightbulb tossed out of a high-rise apartment caused a similar flurry of activity in the town of Suhl on 7 October 1987, after it hit the roof of a vehicle in a motorcade for state apparatchiks. The Stasi suspected “negative enemy forces” were to blame.Over the 40-year existence of communist East Germany, the Ministry of State Security built one of the most tightly controlled surveillance regimes in history. The Stasi created a vast web of full-time agents and part-time spies, with some historians calculating that there was one informant for every 6.5 citizens.The historian Philipp Springer, who spent two and a half years combing through the archive’s more than 2m photographs, said the Stasi’s attention to seemingly mundane detail intensified as technology became more sophisticated and easier to disguise.“In the 1950s, photography was still a relatively rare technology. But by the 80s cameras were more widely available and the Stasi discovered them as what they called a ‘weapon’. The number of photographs taken grew exponentially.”Cameras were hidden inside arm casts, shopping bags, books and bras, with the ministry offering incentives for employees who could come up with ingenious solutions.“East Germany’s secret police had a tendency to see the fingerprints of ‘the enemy’ behind every minor event or mishap, so they began to take pictures of even seemingly harmless everyday objects,” Springer said.Sometimes, the appetite for photographic documentation could backfire. In May 1980, Stasi spies accidentally took photographs of a senior member of their own team leaving and entering a house that had been put under surveillance in Neubrandenburg. It emerged the man had used the same building to maintain an extramarital affair with a colleague in the secret police.“When you e into the archive in a non-systematic way, you find all sorts of stories that surprise you,” said Springer. One cache of pictures documented the story of a 19-year-old Soviet soldier who spent four and a half years hiding in a hole in the ground in rural Brandenburg after deserting from his East German barracks. “If Hollywood had made a film about that, I wouldn’t have believed it.”Another series of photographs shows a young couple from Dresden with a six-month-old child, who had tried to escape to the west in the boot of a car. The baby suffocated during the journey, most likely because of leaked exhaust fumes, the couple were arrested before making it across the border. Unmoved, the Stasi continued to spy on the couple after the tragedy, even getting a photographer to covertly take pictures at their child’s funeral.“Many of these pictures are now comical in an involuntary way,” said Springer. “But when you come across a picture like this, it really drives home the incredible inhumanity of this surveillance state.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/830892952eacb6baccd897d516fe38d7e30243fb/0_197_2450_1470/master/2450.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dbbecf19797e21d93ddbfbe4704d9a3d","title":"iranian new year self isolate covid 19","story":" Holiday destinations report thousands of cars despite advice to self-isolate as Covid-19 spreadsPleas by the Iranian government for citizens to stay at home at the start of the country’s new year have been widely ignored, with more than 1.2 million people taking to the roads, according to police.Northern towns on the Caspian coast reported tens of thousands of cars trying to reach the main holiday destinations.Latest figures published on Friday showed Iran had recorded 19,644 cases of infection and 1,433 deaths. There were 1,237 new infections in the past 24 hours and 149 new deaths. The number of new infections is a record high for a single day, and the number of deaths is the same as the day before.Every layer of Iranian society – from clerical to army, as well as local government – had urged people to stay at home for the new year, a time when Iranians traditionally travel to see friends and family and celebrate the coming of spring.Alireza Raisi, the deputy health minister, said unless Iran got a grip on the crisis in the next two weeks, the country would be struggling with the disease for six months.Iranian ministers appear to be wary of imposing compulsory France-style quarantines, despite the rising death toll, because the government does not have the resources to provide welfare payments to low-income workers. Five former health ministers had written to the health ministry urging them to take more radical steps.The government has closed schools, universities and shrines, banned religious and cultural gatherings, but has not announced a ban on traffic. Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, continued his diplomatic drive to ease US sanctions and spoke to Toshimitsu Motegi, the Japanese foreign minister, after Japan contributed $23m (£19.5m) to help Iran.Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director of the World Health Organization, told a Lebanese broadcaster that Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, had agreed to ease some of the US sanctions covering banking to allow more medicines to reach Iran. But Brian Hook, the US special representative for Iranian affairs told reporters this week. “Our policy of maximum pressure on the regime continues,” he told reporters. “US sanctions are not preventing aid from getting to Iran.”Iran claims that American promises that medicines and medical equipment are exempt from sanctions are untrue. International banks, wary of US fines, will not permit the transfer of Iran’s financial resources stored in other countries into a Swiss Humanitarian Trade Arrangement (SHTA), a new humanitarian channel agreed between the Swiss government and the US on 27 February.Despite the tensions between the US and Iran, Michael White, a US citizen jailed by the Iranians three years ago has been released on medical grounds, and is staying at the US embassy in Tehran.

There were surreal scenes as the big-screen televisions beamed Downing Street’s daily press conference, which carried news of one of the most wide-ranging peacetime changes to British life. Directly underneath them, games of pool continued undisturbed.Shortly after the announcement, with Johnson still speaking, one customer headed out to call a friend. “Listen, you’d better hurry up and get here because all the pubs are shutting at 7pm. Hurry up,” he was heard to say.At another pub about 250 metres away, a sign on the door assured customers that, as a response to the Covid-19 alert, children would no longer be allowed in until further notice. The bar was full, friends were greeting each other with handshakes and horse racing continued to be shown on the televisions.At a Wetherspoon’s further up the road, customers had been told that they must sit apart and try to use the app when ordering, but it too was doing a roaring trade.By the late evening in Penge, however,the streets were quiet and all but one of the pubs on the high street had closed.Earlier in the evening, the Wetherspoon’s in Leytonstone, east London, was also full – and seemed to be filling up further in the moments following the announcement.Meanwhile the nearby Bird pub was less busy than normal for a Friday evening. Caitlin Morgan and her colleague Nick Slotnick, from Woodford, said: “It’s sad but inevitable. It had to happen.” Brid Fitzgerald said: “I’m surprised they weren’t shut sooner. I needed a break because I’m working from home.”A group of three teachers said the prime minister’s announcement had made them feel “expendable”. “If we’re gonna catch something it will be from the tube, which is packed, rather than from the pub.”At Dulcimer in Chorlton, staff seem to be mostly relieved that they would be forced to close. Chris Henry, manager at the fine ales pub, which also serves food and hosts live music events, said the announcement brought an end to their “limbo”.“We got put in the position where it wasn’t in the best interests for our customers’ health to be open but no one said we should be closed,” said Henry. “It’s been a horrible week for all of us.”The pub had been “dead” for the past few days, with only four regulars popping in for a pint since it opened at 4pm on Friday. Other bars and restaurants in the area, including the Creameries and Mary \u0026amp Archie, had taken the decision to close earlier in the week, but Henry said financial insecurity had meant it was difficult to make the same call.“The money we’ve taken this week is going to be the last money we’ll take since God knows when,” he said. However, Henry raised concerns that the insurance the business would now be able to try to claim would not cover them for costs including the wages of six staff.At the Fork ’n’ Ale taproom in Weston-super-Mare, owner Dave Turner was letting customers finish their pints and meals.“The prime minister has said we’ve got to close as soon as is reasonable,” said Turner. “I think that means that we should let our customers finish their drinks and meals and when it gets quiet, we’ll close.”The end of the week is celebrated with “Thank Cod it’s Fryday”: fish and chips and a pint for a tenner. “This has been the roughest week ever,” said Turner. “It would have been nice if we’d had the weekend to try and balance that out but it’s not going to happen.”Seven staff work at the pub and another six at its brewery. “I feel very sorry for all of them,” said Turner. “I’m hoping the help they say they’ll put in to assist with salaries will work properly.“It’s going to be very difficult but we have to do what is morally right for the country as a whole. We have to do what is best for everyone. We will be closing down tonight.”Karen Feagin, a PhD linguistics student from Washington DC, had only just arrived with her husband, sister-in-law and mother-in-law in the Devil’s Advocate, a famous whisky bar in Edinburgh, when the news came in that ministers had ordered all the UK’s bars, clubs and museums to close with immediate effect.It felt surreal, she said. She and her husband, Aaron, a congressional public relations officer from DC, and her mother-in-law, Lyn Tillett, had been planning this holiday for a year.“We’re both sci-fi readers and it feels a little bit like living through some of the books we’ve both read,” Feagin said. Which book? “World War Z,” she said. “We’ve actually had these conversations.”As the waiter arrived with a tasting menu of four special-edition whiskies, her sister-in-law Hannah Fritschner, a masters student in art history, said the coronavirus had been “very disruptive”. She had been planning to study in Glasgow for four years, and had funded it herself. An internship had been cancelled she’d received no instructions on her course.But Fritschner was determined to make the most of having her family in Scotland. “I’m trying to enjoy it because once they leave I know I will be here indefinitely,” she said.They would share out all the bar food with staff once their bars closed at 9pm tonight. “Personally, and I’m not talking on behalf of the company, this has been the toughest challenge that we have faced as humans. We were just working our plans out how to survive.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5accafad89ccfd6271e72b0eab26004104bacbc1/81_0_1733_1041/master/1733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f5c449c86a178478670a05b919447abb","title":"london pubs cinemas and gyms may close in covid 19 clampdown","story":"Cafes, gyms and leisure centres also told to shut from Friday evening because of Covid-19 Boris Johnson took the extraordinary step of ordering pubs, clubs and restaurants across the UK to close on Friday, and announced an unprecedented wage-support scheme to try to prevent a tsunami of job losses.Announcing the decision in the fight against the coronavirus, the prime minister said that he realised it went against what he called “the inalienable free-born right of people born in England to go to the pub”.Johnson had come under increasing pressure to take more stringent action as social distancing measures announced on Monday – including the recommendation to avoid all unnecessary social contact – were being flouted.The decision to order the nationwide shutdown was only finally decided at an afternoon meeting of Cobra, the government’s crisis committee, which ended shortly before the prime minister made his dramatic announcement.One issue thrashed out at the meeting was when it should come into place, with several voices – including that of the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, and others – urging that it should come in on Friday evening and not the following day.Earlier on Friday, the government had decided that venues in London should be ordered to close. By early afternoon, emerging scientific evidence made crisis planners believe it had to be a nationwide shutdown. Johnson said that with the agreement of the three devolved governments, “we are telling – telling – cafes, pubs, bars and restaurants to close tonight, as soon as they reasonably can, and not open tomorrow”. They would be allowed to sell takeaway food and drink, he added.The same instruction was being given to nightclubs, theatres, cinemas, gyms and leisure centres, Johnson added. The new social distancing measures would be reviewed every month to see if any could be relaxed.The announcement came at 5pm, just as hundreds of thousands of people were enjoying post-work pints. Some pubs said they would close – but others showed no signs of heeding the instruction. Police who may have been expected to enforce a ban backed by law, merely said there would remind any businesses staying open of what the government had wanted.A spokesperson for National Police Chiefs’ Council, representing all forces in England and Wales, said: “We expect business owners will want to support the measures designed keep us all safe.“We will police as normal. If officers see specified businesses open, they will remind them of the government advice.”The government is not planning to take specific action to enforce the closures initially, believing a direct instruction from the prime minister should be enough to convince almost all venues to shut their doors.But ministers are prepared to take more action next week through a crackdown on licensing conditions, if necessary.The UK death toll from coronavirus rose on Friday to 177, from 144 the previous day, with nearly 4,000 people testing positive.Since Monday’s announcement, even many Conservative MPs, including the former business secretary Greg Clark, had complained that many companies had little choice but to lay off thousands of staff as their business dried up overnight.On Tuesday, Sunak announced a big-ticket package of loans and other business support measures, including £330m of taxpayer-backed loans, but Clark and others complained that they gave little disincentive for firms to lay off workers.Friday’s announcement, which was negotiated with business groups and trades unions, and included increases in universal credit and other benefits, marked the third multibillion-pound financial commitment the chancellor has made in 10 days.The pubs closure appeared to be the latest example of the government scrambling to catch up with events. A ban on mass gatherings was announced last Friday after scores of fixtures and concerts had been cancelled and nationwide schools closures were confirmed on Wednesday, after thousands of teachers and students had already taken the decision to remain at home.The shutdown of social venues had been expected to cover only London, and the fear of a “lockdown” appears to have been fuelling panic-buying of food and other commodities in the capital. But Johnson said he had consulted with the devolved nations, and the measures would be imposed nationwide.He also said he would be chairing a meeting with supermarket executives on Saturday, in an attempt to keep food supply chains operating normally.After criticism of the lack of clear instructions to the public earlier in the week, the podiums at which Sunak, Johnson and the deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries were standing carried the bold message, “Stay at Home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives.”Johnson exhorted the public to comply, saying, “Bit by bit, day by day, by your actions, your restraint and your sacrifice, we are putting this country in a better and stronger position, where we will be able to save literally thousands of lives, of people of all ages, people who don’t deserve to die now. People whose lives can, must, and will be saved.”Harries gave more detail as to what children should and shouldn’t do, once their schools are largely closed from Monday. She warned against social gatherings, playdates and team sports, and suggested children can take walks in the park – but without coming into contact with others.A full list of affected venues affected by the shutdown was tweeted by the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, also mentioning betting shops, bingo halls, casinos, spas, museums and galleries.In a sign of the radical nature of the Treasury’s intervention to support firms by paying staff’s wages, Len McCluskey, general secretary of the Unite union and a close ally of Jeremy Corbyn, called it, “historic, bold and very much necessary”.Johnson had been widely expected to announce tougher measures in London at Thursday’s daily press conference, but instead simply highlighted advances in scientific understanding of the virus, and claimed the UK could “turn the tide” on it in 12 weeks.The shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, who had warned earlier on Friday that, “pubs and restaurants appear to be full of people, but supermarket shelves appear to be empty,” welcomed the shutdown.Symptoms are defined as either:NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u0026nbspstay at home for at least 7 days.If you live with other people,\u0026nbspthey should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine. But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start.\u0026nbspEven if it means they\u0027re at home for longer than 14 days.Information: If you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days.If you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.After 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine.If you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal.If you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.He said: “We have been increasingly concerned that the social distancing measures needed were not being followed which is why we called for this earlier. We all have to adjust our behaviour to defeat this virus.”In Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon endorsed the planned closures, telling the public that the move “will save lives”. She told older people to stay away from their grandchildren “so you can stay around to see them grow up”, adding: “With compassion and kindness and with the dedication and expertise of our NHS we can and we will get through this.”At Friday’s press conference, Johnson urged people not to decide to go out one final evening: “Please don’t. You may think you are invincible, but there is no guarantee you will get mild symptoms, and you can still be a carrier of the disease and pass it on to others.”Answering questions, the prime minister confirmed that, if needed, the government would enforce the closures, but added: “In reality I think everyone can see the imperative of doing what is necessary.”The announcement marked the end of a dramatic week, which began with Johnson urging the public to avoid unnecessary social contact."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e704e956c69aee3f891fda4346384e8086fd47ba/71_228_1042_625/master/1042.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26d2f2fbcedfa21a111c7a5e5a87091e","title":"love coronavirus spanish couple balcony wedding","story":"Pair lighten a grim week by getting married with the street as witness in Spain’s answer to Italy’s balcony singingNearly a year of planning had gone into the day: fresh flowers filled the venue, name cards sat at each of the 190 place settings and the final nips and tucks had been sewn into the bridal gown.What Alba Díaz and Daniel Camino hadn’t anticipated, however, was that their wedding would instead be forced into the confines of Spain’s near-total lockdown, with the bride and groom shouting “I do” as they leaned out of their apartment window, neighbours cheering them on.The improvised ceremony was a bright moment in an otherwise grim week across Spain and around the world. Coronavirus has tightened its grip on Spain, claiming more than 1,000 lives and sending the number of confirmed cases rocketing to nearly 20,000.Last week, as they watched the number of Spanish cases climb, Díaz and Camino wrestled with the decision of whether or not to cancel their Saturday wedding. “We had put so much of ourselves in it,” said Díaz. “And so much time and so much money.”Díaz, a wedding planner by profession, had meticulously planned every detail, transforming a warehouse in a village in northern Spain into the venue of their dreams. Guests had travelled from across the country and from as far as Iceland to be there.On Friday, as the number of confirmed cases in Spain continued to climb, the couple realised they couldn’t go ahead with the wedding. “It was going to be a lot of people in a small space,” said Díaz.Despondent, they left the venue as it was and headed back to their apartment in the city of A Coruña. Hours later the country was plunged into a near-total lockdown, with the government banning all social gatherings and ordering residents to remain in their homes save for essentials like food or medicine.It was Camino who first suggested they try to go ahead with the wedding, albeit modified to fit the circumstances. “We were both so upset,” he said. “I just wanted to get a smile out of Alba.”When guests started sending them photos, their hair done and all dressed up with nowhere to go, the idea took root. “That’s when we thought, we’re going to get married from our window,” said Díaz.The next-door neighbour was swiftly recruited to lead the ceremony from his window while another was enlisted as a witness. The couple threw on what they could find Diaz wore the gown she had sewn to wear before their plans had changed, while Camino dug out a suit he had worn to a recent wedding. A bouquet was crafted out of a few boxes of flowers that hadn’t been used at the venue.As they began – “On this special day, two friends are getting married,” their neighbour called out, his voice filling the empty street – others, stuck in their homes by the same lockdown orders, began poking their heads out.Soon dozens were cheering them on, calling for the couple to kiss as Díaz threw her bouquet into the apartment of a friend who lives across from her. “In the end it felt our wedding,” said Díaz. “It was unique, special and very personal,” added Camino.Now the couple has moved on to their next improvisation in the time of Covid-19: the honeymoon.“In the end our honeymoon will be at home,” said Díaz, after the virus quashed plans to travel first to Italy and then to Portugal. With a laugh, she added: “There’s not a lot of folk who can say that their honeymoon was 15 days with their husband at home.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61d2da297d03460f52192acca0cde6403e919a46/894_211_3233_1941/master/3233.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc86df694abb610f4f571731535a2907","title":"self isolating stars share washing and workout tips to stay in spotlight","story":"From Gloria Gaynor to Arnold Schwarzenegger, celebrities help to stave off boredomVariations on the adage that celebrities are just like us but with better hair, teeth and diets have been put to the test this week as a number of actors, singers and reality stars have made their way onto social media with content inspired by their time in quarantine. They have ranged from public-broadcast-style announcements from Arnold Schwarzenegger to unusual beauty tips from January Jones and digital singalongs with Gal Gadot and friends.Some celebrities’ content has been altruistic and, from a public health perspective at least, helpful, focusing on practical guidelines. Gloria Gaynor, for instance, posted to TikTok a video of herself lip-synching to I Will Survive while lathering up .I believe simply, frequently, properly washing your hands can go a long way toward accomplishing what’s best for my fellow man“We’re all in this crisis together,” Gaynor told the . “I for one want to do what’s best for myself, my family and my fellow man.

I believe simply, frequently, properly washing your hands can go a long way toward accomplishing that.“For generations, I Will Survive has become the anthem of the world, to give hope, encouragement and inspiration, and I will continue to make sure that happens.”Mariah Carey also washed her hands to a song from her back catalogue: she and her children posted a video to TikTok of themselves washing their hands to a remix of her 1995 number 1 Fantasy.On Thursday, the American singer JoJo posted a reworked version of her song Leave (Get Out), changing lyrics to give an instructional message the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the US would be proud of. Foregrounded by a bowl piled high with shiny lemons, she chides younger viewers who may not be taking isolation warnings seriously: “Tell me why you’re acting so confused when the CDC laid it out for you. Come on I know you’re not dumb to go behind my back and hit the barshows how immature you really are keep exposure to a minimum.”The Pussy Cat Dolls singer Nicole Scherzinger took the opportunity to promote her band’s new single, React, to wash her hands while singing along dressed in latex.Other celebrities have been offering lifestyle tips specific to their age group. The 72-year-old Schwarzenegger has been posting advice focused on how fellow over-65s can stay fit and well.In one, he poses in front of a giant mural of himself in his flexing heyday while explaining the benefits of cycling as a self-isolation-friendly exercise option. More recently he has extolled the stay-at-home message from in his whirlpool bath while smoking a cigar.January Jones’ Instagram video of her “detox bath” falls into a more corona-adjacent than practical class of celebrity produced content. The former Mad Men actor’s beauty routine is quarantine friendly by dint of being time-consuming. In it she stirs lavender bubbles, baking soda, organic-apple cider vinegar and two scoops of sea salt into a bath tub. One person on Twitter called it a “thrush cauldron”, while another described the video as “January Jones teaching how to turn your coochie into salt \u0026amp vinegar crisps”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5853159ffb46df50200f838a4e6767e6782b9902/0_176_5670_3402/master/5670.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0756e7cb189d9919b6550a247b9703d4","title":"social distancing could needed uk autumn report shows coronavirus","story":"Government documents show thinking behind approach to dealing with coronavirusStrict social distancing measures may need to remain in place until the autumn to have the required impact in controlling the Covid-19 epidemic in the UK, according to government documents that reveal the thinking behind its approach to the crisis.The documents, published online on Friday, give an extraordinary insight into the projected toll of the pandemic, the tactics that government advisers believe will be most effective in containing the spread of the virus and how messaging has been carefully framed to so the public accepts the need for unprecedented changes to daily life.In a consensus statement on the overall strategy being deployed, the government’s scientific advisory group for emergencies (SAGE) suggests the UK would need to alternate between “periods of more and less strict social distancing measures” to have a plausible chance of keeping the number of critical care cases within capacity. “These would need to be in place for at least most of a year,” it concludes.It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals.The virus can cause pneumonia-like symptoms. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties.In the UK, the National Heath Service has defined the symptoms as:Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.Yes. China’s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January.China’s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. As of 19 March, more than 219,000 people have been infected in more than 150 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.There have been over 8,900 deaths globally. Just over 3,200 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated.More than 84,000 people are recorded as having recovered from the coronavirus.The advisory group also stresses the need to promote a sense of collectivism in a modern-day spin on “Keep Calm and Carry On”. “All messaging should reinforce a sense of community, that ‘we are all in this together’. This will avoid increasing tensions between different groups,” the documents say.In papers that date from mid-February to the present, the group also considers issues ranging from public disorder to the psychology of self-isolation and potential social impacts of school closures. One paper outlines the potential for unintended consequences and the need to be clear about the purpose of school closures to prevent children from continuing to mix or grandparents taking on childcare responsibilities. Some social and workplace norms will need to be rapidly overturned. For instance, for many healthcare workers it is the norm that people continue to work when unwell. “It will be important to make it socially unacceptable to attend work or school if unwell,” the documents say. “To avoid the risk of stigma, ‘voluntary quarantine’ should be portrayed as an act of altruistic civic duty.”An assessment of the chances of public disorder, drawn up in February, concluded that while “large-scale rioting” seemed unlikely, any disorderwas likely to be generated by anger at the government’s response rather than the direct effects of the pandemic.One 12 March paper on public expectations about measures to stop public gatherings noted there was general support for the move, especially as people could see this happening abroad – and that if policy was not properly explained, people might not trust the government, potentially increasing the risk of disorder.“Acting in a way that does not meet expectations poses a risk that a section of the public will view government actions as incompetent or not in the public’s best interests,” it says. “It may also be taken as signifying that the situation is not expected to be severe for the UK. This could have knock-on implications for public attitudes to other recommendations made by government.”It adds that “the risk of public disorder would be higher if there was a perception that the government’s response was not competent”.Other issues that could cause tensions, it says, include a possible lack of certain goods such as hand sanitisers, not enough police officers because of sickness, and police efforts seen as unfair, for example limiting access to food or healthcare.Particularly, a lack of police numbers “could lead to a rise in opportunistic crime by those who are already antagonistic towards the police”, the paper says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/672a37ae6fead972f74e5b1f02da491713f3aa91/0_79_3196_1917/master/3196.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e75aaba84c41c641c4e8d09f93b5e576","title":"uk state support for business and workers reaches new heights","story":"Rishi Sunak said an unprecedented level of state protection will be offered to support businesses and workers through the coming months to prevent the coronavirus outbreak bringing the economy to its knees.The chancellor’s second package of measures since he announced a £30bn rescue operation at the budget earlier this month, has been developed in recent days in response to criticism that previous efforts would fail to prevent thousands of companies going bust.Earlier this week he announced state-backed loans of at least £330bn of tax breaks and other measures worth £20bn to protect companies and households suffering amid the economic collapse triggered by the virus.A fresh scheme will go further and offer greater protection, he said.The grant will be backdated to 1 March and available from next month.

By  Gavin FrancisOn 13 January, a bulletin from Health Protection Scotland was sent to all GP practices in the country describing a “novel Wuhan coronavirus”. I work in a small clinic in central Edinburgh with four doctors, two nurses and six admin staff. It was the first time I’d heard of the virus. “Current reports describe no evidence of significant human to human transmission, including no infections of healthcare workers,” it said reassuringly.I cast my mind back to the Sars coronavirus of almost two decades ago, and briefly wondered how quickly the spread of this coronavirus would be stopped, as Sars was. A seafood market had been closed and sanitised. The bulletin said that although Wuhan was a city of 19 million people, there were only three flights per week from there to the UK, and the likely impact was “very low”. I shrugged, and carried on with my work.Scientists had already discovered that the new virus was fundamentally different from Sars, though still within the family of coronaviruses. “Corona” refers to the spiky little packets of sugared protein stuck all over the surface of the spherical virus, like fleurs-de-lys sprouting from the band of a crown. Under an electron microscope they look like tiny planets, each one buzzing with angry satellites. They’re a similar size to flu viruses – 0.1 microns – and are widespread among many different mammals. Sars came to humans from the Asian civet Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers) came via dromedary camels. It seems likely that the new virus has its origin in bats, but whether there was another mammalian intermediary between bats and humans is still uncertain.That evening I met up with a friend, a consultant physician who had recently come back to work after a period of time doing research. She had been stationed at a general hospital around 30 miles from Edinburgh, and was enjoying being back in the thick of clinical work, though startled at how stretched her medical colleagues were. “It’s the same every year,” she said. “I wonder when health boards will realise how many winter beds we actually need.”A week later, Chinese infections stood at 550, and the death toll was 17. A new bulletin arrived reassuring me that the risk of infection was still low, but attaching a specific form to be completed should I suspect someone of having the virus – specifically anyone flying in from Wuhan. I was disgruntled but not alarmed when one university asked worried Chinese students to seek GP attention. “By phone!” I wanted them to add, “tell them to seek attention by phone!”On 30 January, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a global health emergency. The death toll in China reached 170, and the cases that had tested positive there reached almost 8,000. Further cases were reported in India and the Philippines.Coronavirus infects and irritates the lungs. Most cases are mild. In severe cases it leads to breathlessness as the lungs struggle to do their job of oxygenating the blood – something that can be relieved with oxygen delivered by mask. A proportion of those patients who require oxygen will go on to need ventilation in intensive treatment units. In these early days of the outbreak, I still thought of the virus as something that, like Mers and Sars, would be contained. As GPs we are accustomed to dealing with an annual spike in flu – the “swine flu” of 2009 turned out to be not much more dangerous than seasonal winter flu – though in its severity and prevalence, this new virus seemed worse.That same day, another message came in, this time from Lothian health board. It instructed me that masks “and other personal protective equipment” would be sent to the practice shortly, prompting the usual jokes among the staff that we would be sent a paper bag and some of those clingfilm gloves you get at petrol stations. Surgical masks did arrive later that week, along with a roll of tear-off plastic aprons.During the week, I work at my small Edinburgh practice, but at the weekend I sometimes work evening GP shifts at an “out of hours” (OOH) centre in the city, covering a much larger population, with a team of other doctors and nurses. I had an email from the clinical director of the centre advising me to tell any patients from mainland China that they would only need to self-isolate if they had symptoms, adding that those symptoms did not include a sore throat. Until then, I’d been assuming that a dripping nose and a sore throat would be the herald of coronavirus infection, the way they are for most respiratory viruses. My practice started a WhatsApp group to keep one another updated. It proved as good for sharing joke videos as for the latest governmental advice.On 4 February, I flew to the US to give a talk at the New York Academy of Sciences about science, medicine and wonder. United Airlines warned me I would be turned back at the US border if I had been through China. There were a few face masks in use at the airport, but I still thought of this as a problem that the Chinese lockdown and the Wuhan flight ban would address.Radio New Zealand had also been in touch to ask if I would do an interview. The absurd levels to which we are all now interconnected came home to me as I sat down, cross-legged and jet-lagged, in a New York hotel room to talk, via Skype, to a presenter 17 hours into tomorrow. He asked me for predictions on how far this epidemic would spread. I remember saying that I had no crystal ball, but what I’d seen of infection control measures in China seemed impressive – I hoped very much it would be contained as Sars had been contained, and that isolation measures would be effective. That day it was reported that 425 Chinese patients had died, and infection rates, for those who’d been tested, stood at just over 20,000.Flying out of Newark, I found myself in a departure terminal where every table was festooned with tablet computers on stalks. They flashed like gambling machines, entertainment as well as shopping opportunities. To speak to a companion it was necessary to peer over these screens. All food and all payment was to be ordered by touching the tablets. Maybe they wipe them clean regularly, I thought, as I watched a kid pick his nose then start playing with the screen.When I got home from New York, in early February, the threat began to feel real. That weekend the number of deaths in China surpassed those of the Sars epidemic of 2002-2003, at 811. Half-term holidays followed. Along with my wife and kids, I drove north to Orkney to see friends and take up a locum position as a GP on one of the islands for a week. At Kirkwall, on my way to the ferry, a message pinged from one of the NHS Orkney staff. Did I have time to drop by the hospital and be measured up for a “face-fitting mask”? These masks are effective at blocking the droplets of coughs or sneezes that carry viruses. It disturbed me that the request came in such haste – did they know something I didn’t about the imminence of the outbreak? In Orkney? I had time if I dropped by the hospital right now, I replied, but had only an hour until my ferry was leaving. “It won’t be necessary,” came the reply, and it wasn’t.By the time I got back to Edinburgh eight days later, things were changing fast. The OOH service asked if I could come by and be assessed for a face-fitting mask. But when I tried to set up an appointment, stocks had run out. New guidance appeared that, for the kind of examinations I perform as a GP, it would be enough to wear a “fluid resistant” mask and follow the usual infection control procedures – aprons, gloves, eye protection. The face-fitted masks were to be preserved for those performing the kind of procedures – such as intubations and endoscopies – during which you might be sprayed with saliva, or worse. Some were finding governmental advice infuriatingly inconsistent, but it was clear that tough decisions were having to be made with limited resources, and time was running out. As GPs we were being urged to avoid suspected cases in case we spread it inadvertently to others, though the virus was undoubtedly circulating among our patients at higher levels than were evident in official figures.On 21 February, Lombardy reported its first cases resulting from spread within Italy, rather than among people who had flown in with the virus. They still had only a handful of confirmed cases. My wife is from Lombardy, not far from Pavia, and her parents went into isolation. Italy reported its first deaths the following day, but several patients of mine were still relaxed enough about the virus to fly there for skiing.In the next four days, Italy’s number of reported cases leapt from single figures to 229, and China’s approached 80,000. But China’s were slowing while Italy’s appeared to be gathering momentum: on 25 February, a new bulletin from the public health specialists of NHS Lothian asked me to tell anyone who had been in Lombardy or Veneto within the last 14 days, and who had symptoms, to self-isolate. “First of all, for reassurance,” it stated, “with regards to Italy, the area of concern is only for northern Italy – north of Pisa, Florence or Rimini.” I was not reassured.I spoke that day with a patient who had returned from Milan, but who had no symptoms other than a slight sore throat, common enough for anyone just off a plane. According to the rules I’d been given, he didn’t have to isolate himself. “Have you got a thermometer?” I asked him, and toyed with the idea of dropping round to see if he had a fever, but then more calls and demands came through, and I didn’t. (He subsequently recovered.)At the OOH centre in West Lothian, in the first week of March, it was evident just how thick the weekly traffic is between Italy and the UK. One among several calls: a man who had flown in a day earlier, from south of Pisa, and who had a cough with a fever. According to the guidance I’d been given, he’d been too far south to be considered as a potential case – I informed him there was no official need for self-isolation. But the advice made me uneasy, and I asked him, if he could, to stay at home and off work for at least a week.Another call was to a family just back from skiing according to the location of their resort they were at risk, and they were referred to the public health board for testing. This is done by sending away an official form – we GPs don’t get to hear who turns out positive and who doesn’t.In early March, the computer system with which GPs read all medical records, make notes on each consultation and refer patients for specialist care, had new coronavirus codes added. The idea is that anyone registered in the system with Covid-19 is tagged with a special code that will keep track of the spread of the disease, as well as our Covid-19 workload as GPs. At this point, “Advice given about 2019-nCoV” was the only code that I had much opportunity to use.To carry on with “containment” of the virus, it felt like we would need hundreds of call-handlers to decide who should stay put and self-isolate, and who should be tested – and then hundreds more workers to trace every contact. Drive-through testing was happening now in Edinburgh, though there was only one mention of the virus today among the 30 or so patients I saw face to face.By now, fear was spreading, with some justification, and the situation was beginning to feel extremely serious. One elderly lady requested a letter for her insurance company, to get her out of her package holiday I explained that until the government changed its advice, my letter wouldn’t make any difference, and she left, dejected.Watching the news, the measures Italy was taking seemed extraordinary, though necessary. Once, when I worked as an Antarctic expedition doctor, I studied with military medics for a diploma in the medical care of catastrophes. We learned about building makeshift hospitals, about iding clinics into “clean” and “dirty” zones, about planning urgent mass vaccination, about emergency medical supply chains. It felt surreal that those kinds of measures were now being discussed so close to home.The gravity of the crisis was only just starting to be felt. It seems incredible now that I was so blase, but on Saturday 6 March, I was out with friends, jokes aplenty about nudging elbows instead of shaking hands. I stood in the corner of a pub packed with people watching the rugby. (England were victorious over Wales.) A GP friend in Fife told me that she was convinced the disease was already widespread among her own patients – she was seeing more viral breathlessness than usual, but none from people who had travelled to the “at risk” areas, and none who fulfilled the criteria for testing. We went together to a sold-out concert at Edinburgh’s Usher Hall – capacity 2,200 – crowds singing, people hugging, everyone pretending to forget about Covid-19 for a night.Another friend, a hospital specialist, told me in a crowded pub that night that what we needed urgently was to slow its spread – allow the government to buy time, get in more ventilators and prepare the hospitals. But he wondered if we were doing too little too late. “We could run out of ventilators by May,” he said. Evidence from China was showing that if you buy ventilators early and deploy them in new and cleared-out hospitals, you save lives.The following day, Italy went into lockdown, but Britons were still being allowed to fly home. The supermarkets there started offering free delivery to the over-65s. My parents-in-law at least have a garden a neighbour is passing fresh bread over the fence. They have their chickens, their vegetable patch and a well-stocked garage. There are frightening stories from Lombardy hospitals of insufficient ventilators, and operating rooms used as intensive-care units.I woke up on 10 March to a WhatsApp message from a colleague – the first few Covid-19 cases from our patch of Edinburgh had been confirmed, all in people returning from Italy. They had a fever, a frontal headache and a dry cough. We were all expecting the news, but it still came like a cold slap. Everything about the way we work would have to change. Planes were still flying in from Italy and France. Websites were telling worried people to phone their GP, while each morning we GPs were picking through emails from local and national health boards for the latest advice. Protective suits were to be saved for hospital staff and paramedics at the bedsides of sick people shedding the virus.There were plenty of nervous jokes among my patients that day about the coming “coronageddon”, but only one who phoned in, drenched in sweat, with a dry cough and a fever of 39C. He hadn’t been abroad for months, and I told him to stay home for at least a week. That evening, my GP colleagues and I had a meeting in the pub that felt like a boozy council of war. We shared stories we’d heard of patients in hospital with the virus, and ideas for how to protect the practice, should we, one-by-one, end up catching it. I remembered planning meetings for the swine flu of 2009, but they were nothing like this, and the threat had felt nowhere near as real.On 11 March, the WHO declared Covid-19 to be a pandemic. Events were moving at unprecedented speed. The UK budget was delivered and the NHS was told it would have whatever it needed. We’ll see. Deaths in China continued to drop – just 19 new infections.A helpful message signed by all the government health departments, health boards, royal colleges and the General Medical Council also arrived on 11 March. It said that I’ll be expected, in the coming weeks, to go beyond what I’m accustomed to dealing with, but that I can be reassured that the GMC and health board will support me and my decisions through the crisis. “Clinicians may need to depart, possibly significantly, from established procedures in order to care for patients in the highly challenging but time-bound circumstances of the peak of an epidemic.” It’s good to feel the GMC is at my back, rather than on my back, for a change.Among my worried patients were a grandmother with full parental responsibility for all her grandchildren. A mother of a seven-year-old daughter who has a fever and cough asked whether that means she should also be self-isolating. According to official guidance, the answer was still a disquieting “no” – we were still in the “containment” phase – but I asked people to be pragmatic. If they felt at all unwell, stay in and minimise contact with others. The only unconcerned patient was a man with advanced cancer, spread to the liver, who thought we were all overreacting.By this point, we GPs were doing almost everything over the phone, even if it meant prescribing antibiotics without seeing patients, and making guesses about non-urgent diagnoses – shunting anything that wasn’t an emergency into an imagined future of normality. Over morning coffee, my colleague joked about getting us beekeeper outfits, visiting only the most seriously ill in their homes while hermetically sealed in our own isolation suits. As jokes go, it wasn’t very funny.I spent the afternoon doing a men’s clinic for the city’s rough sleepers and those with no fixed address, some of whom sleep in Bethany Trust dormitories. In my morning surgery, everyone had asked me about the virus my homeless patients had, it seems, more pressing concerns. About half went to shake my hand, and thought me cowardly for bumping elbows instead.By the time I emerged from the clinic, Boris Johnson had told everyone with cough and cold symptoms to stay home for a week. “At last!” I thought. Maybe people will take it seriously. We were again informed that more protective equipment was coming, but the droplet-resistant masks still won’t be available. Everyone with a beard who works with Covid-19 patients has been asked to shave it off, as the masks don’t work if there’s hair between them and the skin. Anyone with religious or cultural objections was told to speak with their line manager.Friday the 13th, and an atmosphere of dread in morning meeting at the news from Italy. There aren’t enough ventilators to go round, or nurses, and people are being buried without funerals. The practice WhatsApp group has been renamed “Dream Team CoronaCombat” in an attempt at levity. There was an air of quiet resignation at what’s coming, but an edge of bunker humour, too. One of the clinic thermometers broke, and I went online to buy another – £30 versions are changing hands for £125. But virologists are learning about Covid-19 all the time, and for all their horrors, the Chinese and Italian experiences mean that we’re better prepared in the UK than we might have been.One of my patients that day, a man in his late 80s, told me that the virus is mother nature getting back at us. “Too many people!” he said, and chuckled. “All us oldies need clearing out!” I didn’t share his glee. Some who have had coughs for weeks, but that have worsened, asked me if they’d got it – but there’s no way of knowing, and I told them all to stay home for a further week. The lab had stopped accepting viral swabs from GPs, so unless someone is admitted to hospital, they aren’t tested. And also on the 13th, the first death in Scotland, in Ediburgh, was announced.Spain followed Italy into lockdown, planes turning back halfway. The UK attitude of allowing schools to stay open came under attack. It was obvious we needed new ways to slow the spread, particularly among the over-65s – they’re the ones most at risk from this disease. One of my colleagues has purchased us hazmat suits from eBay for home visiting, just in case. The medical students of Edinburgh University have set up a pet-and-babysitting service for NHS staff.On Tuesday 17 March, the practice was oddly quiet – there was a hush on the streets, a sense of anxious anticipation, and my days now feel like a prelude to what is to come. People were stunned by the implications of the guidance delivered by the prime minister on Monday night – to avoid going out, to avoid restaurants and theatres, to self-isolate for 14 days if anyone in the family has symptoms. Unprecedented, necessary, belated advice. Of the 20 people I spoke to on the phone, a couple almost certainly had the virus – a new headache, fever, cough, malaise and exhaustion. I coded them “suspected coronavirus infection” and gave advice to stay in with their whole families, and call us if they get worsening breathlessness.As healthcare workers, we’ve been told to follow the same advice as everyone else: stay off for 14 days if anyone in our homes has a cough or fever. Practices adjacent to my own are already losing staff, and we’re clamouring for testing. If I develop a cough but test negative, I can go on working. Even better will be some future test that can show if I’ve had the virus, and developed immunity – then I’ll be able to work overtime through the coming weeks without fear. Hospital clinics are being cancelled wherever possible, all elective surgery postponed. We’re clearing the decks for an onslaught. Yes, it would have been nice to have been better prepared for this pandemic, but though it’s frightening, it could also be worse, and I don’t feel the same anger as some of my colleagues towards the government for its prevarication over such immense and unprecedented decisions.On Wednesday I heard that schools are closing, and so my wife and I will be contending with the competing necessities of the kids, the virus and the NHS. My wife contacted her GP in Lombardy. The situation is, he said, very grave, and he wished us luck with what is to come. I messaged a medical contact in Beijing, the Chinese translator of my books, who said things are improving, with few new cases. “As you know, isolation is the only effective method to stop the virus,” he added, and asked that I give thought to the mental health of my patients as much as to their physical needs. He ended on a sanguine note: “People will have to change their habits for a while. The spring is coming.”• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7200859fb487792e1336e456cb1a1b0c126614c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c3503426875ecac8614c1ddb0a46742","title":"coronavirus 21 march at a glance","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:According to Johns Hopkins University figures, 271,629 people have been confirmed as having contracted the virus and 11,280 have died. In addition, 87,403 people have recovered.The United Arab Emirates announces its first deaths. One of the patients was a 78-year-old Arab national who had arrived in the country from Europe. The official news agency, WAM, reported the health ministry as saying the cause of death was a “heart attack, coinciding with complications from the coronavirus disease”. The other patient was reportedly a 58-year-old foreign-born resident of the UAE who had heart disease and kidney failure.Jerusalem’s Shaare Zedek hospital said an 88-year-old man died a week after he was admitted. The hospital said the man had a history of health problems, according to the Associated Press. Israel has reported more than 700 cases.The employee, who was not identified, had not come into close contact with either the US president, Donald Trump, or his boss, Mike Pence, who is in charge of the US’s coronavirus response, according to the latter’s spokeswoman.Italy and Spain both reported their biggest single-day death tolls from the coronavirus. Authorities in Rome on Friday announced 5,986 new cases and a record 627 new deaths, raising the totals to 47,021 infections and 4,032 fatalities. In Spain, the death toll rose to 1,002, a highest-ever increase of 235 in 24 hours. Helge Braun, Angela Merkel’s chief of staff, warned that a near-total lockdown – as is in force in France, Italy and Spain – could soon be necessary in Germany.The US president invoked the Defense Production Act to get needed medical supplies on the frontlines of the coronavirus outbreak, mobilising the federal government to marshal the private sector to combat the pandemic. The secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, confirmed the US-Mexican border will be closing to nonessential travel.The Chinese doctor who was reprimanded for “spreading rumours” after he sought to warn colleagues about the emergence of Covid-19 has been officially exonerated by an investigation into his death. However, the report has been criticised for not going far enough, after it only recommended the reprimand against Dr Li Wenliang be withdrawn.Thousands of British holidaymakers could find themselves stranded abroad, as flight cancellations, travel restrictions and lockdowns due to the global coronavirus pandemic complicate their journeys home. As many as 100,000 tourists may still be in Spain, despite a near-total lockdown and government orders that all hotels be shut down within the week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abd0a8a2e363ee8439bc4ca1ecccdae39e9ce023/0_228_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de8d34f202c728ec37fc45f98e84d9af","title":"new zealanders told to cancel non essential travel to limit covid 19","story":"Jacinda Ardern says this ‘is about saving lives’ and asks over 70s or those with compromised immunity to stay home for foreseeable futurePrime minister Jacinda Ardern has addressed the nation, asking Kiwis to “be strong, be kind” during an unprecedented global crisis.“Please take it seriously, this is about saving lives,” Ardern said.There are 53 confirmed cases of coronavirus in New Zealand, with two of them having no links to overseas travel – meaning the virus may now be being passed on via community transmission, something health authorities said they were urgently exploring.Ardern asked New Zealanders to cancel any non-essential travel around the country, and for those aged 70 or over, or with a compromised immune system, to stay home for the foreseeable future. Her deputy prime minister Winston Peters, aged 74, was exempt as he was “essential”, Ardern said.Anyone who could work from home should now do so, Ardern said, and then reassured Kiwis that essential services such as supermarkets and pharmacies would remain open throughout.If you cannot go out and maintain two metres of distance, then don’t go out, Ardern said.“Over the past few weeks, the world has changed. And it has changed very quickly.” Ardern said, speaking from her parliamentary office in Wellington.“We are experiencing an unprecedented event – a global pandemic that in New Zealand, we have moved to fight by going hard, and going early.”“I understand that all of this rapid change creates anxiety, and uncertainty. Especially when it means changing how we live.“The first really important thing to remember, is that the vast majority of people who will ever have Covid-19 will only experience mild to moderate symptoms. But there will be some who need more care.“That’s why we have to focus on one simple goal – to slow down Covid-19,” Ardern said.Slowing it down would mean having “smaller waves” of the virus circulating, to reduce the impact on health, jobs and and the economy.Ardern said “some countries have successfully managed to do this” and the goal now was slowing, not stopping, the virus.The prime minister also introduced a four-level alert system, with New Zealand currently at level two.“Alert Level Two is where the disease is contained but the risks are growing because we have more cases,” Ardern said.“This is when we move to reduce our contact with one another. We increase our border measures, and we cancel events. This is also the level where we ask people to work differently if they can, and cancel unnecessary travel.”Level four, the highest level, would mean transmission through the community was “sustained”. At this stage “we eliminate contact with each other altogether”, Ardern said, as seen in Italy and France. The government would “keep essential services going, but ask everyone to stay at home until Covid-19 is back under control”.Different areas of the country could move to different alert levels at different stages and times.Dr Ashley Bloomfield, director general of health, said it was wise for people to stay home at the moment, limit their social contact and not travel domestically at all if they didn’t really need too. Air New Zealand would be booking plane tickets with seats between passengers to limit contact.Despite some health experts pressing for school closures and other level four measures, the prime minister said schools would open as normal on Monday, despite many parents already choosing to keep their children home.Many tertiary institutions are now moving to teach students online, while most workplaces are testing, phasing in or adopting work from home practices.Kiwis praised Ardern’s national address, describing it as calm and reassuring."},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

A total of 137 community transmission cases have been recorded, according to an analysis of confirmed cases, with 132 infections linked to foreign travel.Seventy-three people were infected with Covid-19 due to contact with a confirmed case, while 96 remain “under investigation”.The figures emerged as the department announced that 126 new cases of coronavirus were reported by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) on Friday evening, slightly lower than the previous day.There are now 683 confirmed coronavirus cases in the State, and three people have died. An analysis of the causes of the 683 cases has not yet been completed. Monaghan remains the only county without confirmed case, according to the department’s chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan.People aged over 65 account for 17 per cent of cases, and 29 per cent of the total number hospitalised.Of the notified cases, 55 per cent involve men and there are 27 reported clusters involving 142 cases.The median age of patients is 44 years, and 32 per cent of those who have fallen ill with the virus have been hospitalised. Twelve patients have had to be admitted to intensive care.The department said 114 healthcare workers have contracted the virus, with 36 of these cases related to foreign travel.Dublin has the highest number of cases, 51 per cent of the total, followed by Cork (15 per cent) and Limerick and Wicklow (3 per cent each).Dr Holohan said it was too early to say whether the social distancing measures, which involve people being asked to stay 2m away from others, introduced last week were working.RestrictionsWhile the Taoiseach has forecast Ireland may have 15,000 cases by the end of the month, Dr Holohan said this was based on the numbers showing “unmitigated growth” and he was hoping to see “some impact” from the restrictions introduced last week.With the number of cases currently growing by an average of one-third per day, he said he would be “pleased” to see this rate of growth fall to 15 per cent daily.Dr Holohan said Ireland remained in the delay phase, though elements of the strategy for containment, delay and mitigation were being deployed at the same time. He said there was no evidence to indicate that people returning from the Cheltenham horseracing festival had been a significant source of infections.Of the three reported deaths, he said two patients had underlying health conditions and there was no report of an underlying issue with the third person.Meanwhile, schools in Northern Ireland are to be repurposed as facilities to care for the children of key workers during the outbreak. First Minister Arlene Foster said on Friday evening that “the educational work that goes on in schools has come to an end” but they were “a good place” to provide free childcare for workers in the NHS and other key areas. Key workers include those employed in health and social care and other frontline positions, as well as roles deemed essential to public life or to the provision of essential goods and services. The Department of Education is to publish guidance for schools after principals called for clarity on how this proposal would work. Nine new cases of coronavirus, also known as Covid-19, were identified in the North on Friday, bringing the number of confirmed cases to 86. One person has died as a result of the pandemic. Employees in Northern Ireland who have been laid off because of coronavirus will benefit from a commitment by the UK government to pay 80 per cent of wages for employees not working, up to £2,500 per month. All cafes, pubs, bars and restaurants in the North will also close following an announcement by UK prime minister Boris Johnson, though many such premises have already shut down voluntarily. Asked about the UK government’s decision to order the closure of restaurants, Dr Holohan said this had been considered. However, he said the NPHET was happy for resturants to stay open if they can adapt by, for example, enforcing social distancing or providing takeaway food only.Regarding advice for families in relation to Mother’s Day, which is on Sunday, Dr Holohan said that while he understood it was a challenge for society, observing social distancing rules was extremely important.

File photograph: Getty ImagesTwo specially designed postcards will be delivered to the State’s 1.8 million households over the coming week to allow people to post a message of love and support to their family and friends amid the coronavirus outbreak, An Post has announced. As more people socially isolate and become “cocooned” in order to combat the spread of the Covid-19 virus, every household in the State will receive the postcards to write personal messages for family and friends to help them stay connected in the weeks ahead. The 5,000,000 postcards can be sent anywhere on the island of Ireland, free of charge.Speaking about the postcards, An Post chief executive David McRedmond encouraged households to “write to your grandparents or older relatives and friends who are self-isolating write to someone who is living alone or who could do with a boost. Send a note to your cousins or friends. Let them know you’re thinking of them. Send thanks to our outstanding healthcare and all those working so hard to get us through this crisis.”The process is simple, Mr McRedmond explained: “Pop the postcards in the postbox when you’re out for a walk – there’s no need for a stamp. The postmen and postwomen of Ireland will deliver your message free of charge to your loved ones.“There’s nothing like a personal note to raise our spirits and remind us that we’re not being forgotten, that we are all in this together and that we will get through it. Post is a powerful link connecting people and communities who have to remain apart at this strange and difficult time,” he said.Additional cards will be available at local post offices.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4208313.1584751985!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus government to ramp up support for laid off workers","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMembers of the naval service outside the 3Arena in Dublin on Friday. Photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireThe Government is considering a proposal under which it could pay up to three-quarters of the wages of thousands of staff who have been laid off as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.In the interim, the Government on Friday night announced changes to its existing financial support arrangements, which would allow employers to top up the Covid-19 unemployment payment of €203 per week offered by the State to the 140,000 people who have lost their jobs in the past week.Sources said Ministers were now looking at a broader scheme similar to measures being introduced elsewhere in Europe and the UK, where the government has committed to pay 80 per cent of wages, up to £2,500 per month, for people out of work as a result of the pandemic.It is expected the details of such a scheme will be announced in the next week, with work ongoing at Government level on how it would apply in Ireland.Trade unions submitted proposals to Government on Friday for a €1.75 billion scheme which would pay workers up to a cap equivalent of €40,000 per year. It would see the Government pay 75 per cent of the wages for up to three months, with employers covering the remainder.Unions and business lobby groups had strongly criticised the Government over the rules governing its existing employer refund scheme, which they maintained would penalise employers who gave workers additional money.Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection Regina Doherty said last night the Government had agreed that employers who engaged with the scheme “should be allowed to top up the payment by the State”.Emergency powersMeanwhile, President Michael D Higgins last night signed the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Bill 2020, which was passed in the Seanad and gives the Government emergency powers to deal with the pandemic.“As President, I am urging all citizens, given the emergency of our situation in relation to the grave challenge to our public health, to respond in a generous way to the Health Service Executive’s advice on measures to alleviate the spread of Covid19,” Mr Higgins said.“These new health and social measures may be difficult for many, but they affect us all and we are at a point now when a person’s actions have consequences not only for themselves but for all in society. Irresponsible inidual action puts all at risk. We must draw on our strengths now.”Speaking in Templemore, Co Tipperary, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said he was hopeful the new powers would not have to be used. Ireland had a history of policing “by consent, never by coercion”, he said. “And I hope that is never going to change as a consequence of this crisis.”Public health officials say they have no current plans for further social restrictions or the closure of borders to counter the spread of coronavirus.Ireland can “get a long way down the road” in fighting the virus through compliance by people with the measures already introduced, according to chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan.Community transmissionAnother 126 new cases of the disease were reported by the National Public Health Emergency Team on Friday evening, with cases involving community transmission surpassing the number of travel-related cases for the first time.There are now a total of 683 confirmed cases in the Republic, and three deaths.With doctors at the frontline of the health services growing increasingly concerned about the system’s ability to respond to the massive surge of cases expected over the coming weeks, some have suggested a “lockdown” of non-essential services would help buy time by reducing the spread of infection. Oncologist and former senator Prof John Crown said on Friday night all non-essential workplaces should be closed, though people could continue to work from home.Asked about such calls, Dr Holohan described proposals to stop people leaving their homes as “very severe” and “draconian”.“I don’t think at this moment in time, based on the measures in place and the high compliance, we have justification for stepping up to something like that,” he told a briefing in the Department of Health.“I don’t anticipate us recommending the closure of borders,” he added, pointing out that incoming travellers were required to self-quarantine for 14 days.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4208300.1584743689!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus immigration permits to be extended temporarily","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Justice  Charlie Flanagan. Photograph: Dara Mac DonaillThe .Foreign nationals with visas due to expire in the coming weeks will be able to remain in Ireland until at least May 20th under a temporary extension announced by the Department of Justice in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. The Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service on Burgh Quay in Dublin will also temporarily close its doors as part of range of measures being taken in response to the coronavirus.In a statement released late on Friday night, Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan said non-EEA nationals with immigration permission due to expire in the near future would be granted an automatic renewal of their visas for two months. He said the immigration status of thousands of people living in Ireland could become “unlawful” through no fault of their own if permission to remain in the country was not extended. The decision to close the Burgh Quay registration office was due to the “high footfall, challenges in maintaining social distancing and to ensure consistency across the system”, the Minister said. These measures will also apply to immigration registrations and renewals that take place outside of Dublin. These take place in garda stations and are overseen by local immigration officers. The department said the moves would free-up members of the force for other duties. Three categories of foreign nationals will be affected by the development - those who currently hold valid permission to be in Ireland but need to renew this those who arrived in the State in the past three months and were awaiting their first immigration registration appointment, and those who had been granted three month permission (a short stay visa) to remain in Ireland. “I want to assure people whose immigration permissions are due to expire shortly that your legal status in the country will be maintained,” said Mr Flanagan. “If your immigration or international protection permission will expire between March 20th, 2020 and May 20th, 2020, I am granting you an automatic renewal for two months. This renewal is on the same basis as your existing permission and the same conditions will continue to apply.”Mr Flanagan said he would keep the situation under active review as the Covid-19 pandemic evolves. Any person who had already scheduled a visa appointment and is now impacted by these changes will be contacted by Immigration Service Delivery, the department said.

Higgins signing the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Bill 2020 on Friday. President Michael D. Higgins has said he hopes future generations will look back with pride at how Irish society has risen to the challenges posed by the coronaviurs pandemic.Tens of thousands of people have offered to work or return to work in the health service to help combat the Covid-19 outbreak and communities have rallied together to help those vulnerable to the illness. Speaking after signing emergency legislation drafted in response to the Covid-19 outbreak, Mr Higgins urged citizens to “respond in a generous way to the Health Service Executive’s advice on measures to alleviate the spread of Covid-19”. He appealed to young people to follow advice on maintaining a two metre social distance during the outbreak and to “spread the word among their friends of the importance of that which we have been asked to do”.“In every generation there will be exceptions to what is being sought in the public interest. Let us hope that we have seen the end of such behaviour which puts all of us at risk.”Mr Higgins said he hoped future generations will look back and “be proud of how we as a society rose to the challenges together, with different generations taking account of one another”. “Many of the older people, of whose generation Sabina and I are a part, and to whom I have spoken, have been very appreciative of the large numbers of young people who are helping them, and that such assistance is offered in such a caring way that addresses issues of our older citizens that go far beyond the delivery of necessary groceries or food,” he said in a statement on Friday.“These new health and social measures may be difficult for many but they affect us all and we are at a point now when a person’s actions have consequences not only for themselves but for all in society. Irresponsible inidual action puts all at risk. We must draw on our strengths now.”The President signed the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Bill 2020 on Friday, which allows the State to shut down mass gatherings and potentially order groups of people in certain areas to stay in their homes.

Photograph: Aiden CrawleyGreen Party leader Eamon Ryan has proposed that Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney and Minister for Health Simon Harris remain in their jobs as part of a temporary national unity government.Mr Ryan outlined the proposal in a letter to all other party leaders in which he further elaborated on his party’s call for a national unity government to deal with the coronavirus crisis.However, some in Fine Gael have now raised the prospect of Mr Varadkar being Taoiseach first to continue dealing with the coronavirus crisis.Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald on Friday said the idea should be examined but others, such as Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour have been cool on the proposal.A Green Party spokesman said the proposal was intended to ensure there was no disruption in key departments and to also stimulate discussion. It is also understood Mr Ryan put no time limits on how long Mr Varadkar, Mr Coveney and Mr Harris would remain in place.Ms McDonald had previously downplayed the idea of a unity government but, in her latest comments, left the door open to it while still expressing some doubts.‘Respond quickly’“We need to look at every option,” she told Today FM. “The issue with a national unity government is how exactly would it work and would it be coherent enough to respond quickly.“That is the concern but, yes, there is merit of course in all of the political forces coming together because we all represent different sections of our people, whatever our views on other political matters.“It is one of the options on the table. I still think a better option would be a government for change that reflects the outcome of the last election but I don’t hold all of the cards in this and my concern and our concern at this time is to do the right thing for people and certainly that unity government option needs to be looked at, absolutely.”Sinn Féin sources also raised concerns about how the Dáil and Seanad will function by passing measures and by giving oversight to proposals to tackle the crisis,The issue of the appointment of 11 Senators by a new Taoiseach was also raised by those in Sinn Féin as an issue that may have to be dealt with. There is concern that no legislation can be passed by the Oireachtas once the incoming Seanad is elected until a new government is formed.‘National crisis’The two candidates for the leadership of Labour – Alan Kelly and Aodhán Ó Ríordáin – also downplayed the idea of a national unity government but raised the prospect of their party’s six TDs allowing a new government take office by either voting for it or abstaining. Both raised concerns, however, about moving ministers in the immediate future at a time of national crisis.Mr Ó Ríordáin said: “If two of the three power blocs in the house have an agreement to form a government and that government can lead us through this period, I think the Labour Party would be working with that government in facilitating without taking part in that government necessarily.”“If there is a government to be formed and it needs to facilitated, in the interests if the country, then the Labour Party as usual will put the country first and would have discussions on that.”The best news and analysis from the campaign trailStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4208231.1584732867!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus bavaria imposes total ban on movement","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA police car patrols between crowds of people at the English Garden in Munich on Friday. Photograph: Lukas Barth-TuttasEPABavaria broke rank on Friday as the first of Germany’s 16 federal states to impose a total curfew on its citizens to contain the spread of coronavirus.The two-week movement ban on 13 million Bavarians, imposed at midnight on Saturday morning was followed by the small southwestern state of Saarland.That makes it more likely that the rest of Germany will follow suit on Sunday as the number of confirmed cases topped 17,000, up 3,000 in a day, with 44 deaths.Aides to Angela Merkel warn that if people continue to visit parks at the weekend in large numbers, ignoring a televised plea from the chancellor to self-isolate, a total lockdown will be imposed.“We are almost completely winding down public life in Bavaria,” said Bavarian premier Markus Söder at a press conference on Friday. “From tomorrow it’s even more imperative: stay at home and only go out in exceptional circumstances.”He said the measure was due to a large increase in the number of coronavirus cases in Bavaria: up 35 per cent from Thursday to Friday with deaths jumping from 10 to 15.He said his government could “no longer accept” large numbers of public gatherings and promised the two-week measures would not cause “cabin fever”. As in other European countries, people will be allowed leave their home only for limited, targeted tasks such as shopping or inidual exercise.Health warningsGermany’s federal disease-control body, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), has attacked ongoing public gatherings in spite of repeated health warnings. “We can only slow down this epidemic if everyone plays by the rules,” said Dr Lothar Wieler, RKI president.His institution has been granted access to anonymised mobile phone location data to analyse how much – or how little – people are restricting their movements.With that data in mind, Dr Merkel’s chief of staff, Helge Braun, said that “Saturday is a decisive day” in Germany’s battle to contain coronavirus. “We will look at the behaviour of the population this weekend,” he said.A decision is likely on Sunday, when Dr Merkel meets state premiers with the ultimate competence to impose further movement restrictions.As the spreading epidemic turns daily life on its head, along with Europe’s largest economy, a new crisis is looming in one of the Germany’s most beloved culinary traditions.Travel restrictions across Europe mean Germany is experiencing a shortage of seasonal workers to harvest the white asparagus beginning to poke out of the ground. About 23,000 hectares of German farmland is dedicated to the so-called “queen of the vegetables” but the €700 million business is facing disaster.Of the 280,000 seasonal workers required, only about a fifth have shown up. Recent years have seen a shift eastwards in workers, away from Poland to Bulgaria and Romania. But most have been kept away by sealed borders. Bus drivers are unwilling to travel because they face long queues on borders and 14 days’ quarantine on their return. Other workers coming by aircraft, mostly with Ryanair, have had their flights cancelled.Simon Schumacher, head of one lobby group representing 600 asparagus and strawberry growers, said: “The sun is shining, the asparagus is ready to be harvested but there’s no one here to do it.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4206213.1584564281!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu sets out proposals for close uk ties after brexit talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Union chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and the British prime minister’s Europe adviser David Frost in Brussels on March 2nd. Photograph: Oliver HosletReutersThe European Union released a draft of its hoped-for future relationship deal with Britain on Wednesday, setting out ambitions for a tight relationship on trade and security.The 440-page document crosses several of Britain’s red lines, spelling out the bloc’s ambitions for Britain to agree “uniform implementation” of state subsidy rules, with the European Court of Justice remaining the adjudicating authority.It also makes reference to the so-called “level playing field”, provisions to ensure fair competition by keeping rules aligned, which London has already rejected.“The Parties recognise that the establishment of conditions that ensure a level playing field between the Parties is necessary for trade and investment between the Union and the United Kingdom, ” the draft reads.The EU’s draft envisages reciprocal access to waters for fishing rights, with negotiations held each year by December 10th on fishing opportunities for the following year, another contentious point.The UK negotiating team said it had also sent a draft to the EU. This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship. If none can be agreed, it will automatically begin trading on World Trade Organisation terms from January 1st, 2021, with potentially severe effects on the Irish economy.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has until July to request an extension to the transition period, but has insisted it will not do so even as the Coronavirus pandemic delayed talks this week.Both sides said they were examining options such as using video conferencing in place of face-to face talks.“The negotiations can still proceed given all of the logistical arrangements that have been put in place,” British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday.“We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons march 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Coronavirus latest news: Social distancing could last for rest of the yearHow many coronavirus cases are in your area?

Mr King claims almost every unionist he knows agreed with his argument, although they were unwilling to say so publicly.“We are moving inexorably to a united Ireland position. Unionists should not be burying their heads in the sand about this,” Mr King tells The  in one of Belfast’s most famous watering holes, The Garrick, close to the city centre.Unionism has suffered a number of setbacks over the past few months. The Brexit Withdrawal Agreement has put a de facto regulatory and customs border down the Irish sea and Sinn Fein, the former political wing of the IRA, won the popular vote in the recent general election in the south of Ireland. Both of these have put question marks over the future place of Northern Ireland as part of the UK.Most unionists, whether publicly or privately, are in agreement that it is not a question of if but when a border poll takes place.In the next few weeks the Belfast Court of Appeal will deliver a judgement in a potentially landmark case. If Raymond McCord, a victims’ rights activist prevails, then he will force the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to publish the exact criteria that will trigger a border poll. There is a growing consensus on both parts of the island that it will happen within the next five-to-ten years.Unionism is split on what to do next. Mr King is on one end of the spectrum. He has joined the SDLP, a moderate nationalist party, and warns that unionists must engage with discussions on unity or risk getting swept away by the tide of history.His argument is that the rationale for loyalism has been undermined by the British government. “What is the point of being a loyalist if that loyalty isn’t reciprocated.” He cites the Irish protocol in the withdrawal agreement as evidence the London would sell out the province if it is in its interests.He adds that the £10bn subvention from the exchequer every year need to keep the “the most troublesome part of the empire” afloat will strengthen the British government’s resolve to sever ties with the province. He says that unionists should engage now with events such as ‘Future Ireland’ - a forum set up to discuss in what circumstances unity would make sense – to ensure that “Northern Ireland’s rich culture and traditions” are fully protected in a new dispensation.On the opposite end of the spectrum is the Reverend Mervyn Gibson, a Presbyterian minister and the current grand secretary of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland. Speaking at the Orange museum in the heart of loyalist east Belfast, Mr Gibson, 62, says there will be a border poll in his lifetime but it has no chance of passing. He says his commitment to the union is not about economics, although that is a compelling argument, it is about cultural identity. “I am British and there is no place for me or people like me in a united Ireland.”Mr Gibson says that he has no intention of engaging with any discussions on a united Ireland.“If the future is a pre-determined outcome of a united Ireland, then that is not engagement. That is working out the terms of surrender.”He adds that unionism has to broaden its appeal and reach out to Catholics and ethnic minorities who want to remain part of the UK.Underlining the pace of change in Northern Ireland, Mr Gibson says that even though he is a Christian and “my moral values would be seen as outdated these days but they are still my moral values but we need members of the LGBT community to support the union as well. We need a range of people to support union. We don’t always need to agree on moral issues, but we can agree on supporting the union.”The threat of dissident paramilitary violence is ever present in the province. Last month it emerged that the Real IRA had tried to explode a bomb on a ferry going from Belfast to Stranraer to coincide with Brexit day on January 30th.Mr King warns that if a border poll is rushed and the result is a crude majority in favour of unification, but the complex constitutional, economic, cultural and security issues remain unresolved, then it threatens to plunge the province back into armed conflict. This is a view that is shared widely in politicians on both sides of the border.Northern Ireland’s troubled past is very evident on the streets of Belfast. People are willing to give their views on a united Ireland, but not their names and background. The issue is too sensitive.“I was against Brexit. I want to be part of Europe. Freedom to travel is a big thing for me. That is one thing that would make me favour a united Ireland. I don’t think it would happen for a long time though,” a female in her late twenties says.A middle aged man who worked as a lawyer says a united Ireland won’t happen in his lifetime. “I think what Sinn Fein is doing is very dangerous. Too many people don’t want a united Ireland. All this talk of a border poll is going to be very destabilising. Stormont is just back up and running. We have a lot of problems we need to sort out.”As Northern Ireland prepares to celebrate its centenary in May 2021, the future is more uncertain than anytime in the past. A next census which will be released next year is expected to show a majority of Catholics in the province for the first time.However, privately many unionists say that the future position of Northern Ireland will be settled by how Brexit unfolds and whether Scotland eventually secedes from the UK. Of these, the position of Scotland is seen as a gamechanger.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"quarter uk adults strictly following governments coronavirus","story":"Only a quarter of the general public are strictly following the government’s coronavirus advice, according to a new poll.Just 23 per cent said they were following the official guidance to the letter, with a further two in five saying they were ‘mostly’ adhering to the instructions on self-isolation and social distancing.The poll by Savanta for the Daily  found that roughly three in four UK adults left the house between Monday and Wednesday, despite Boris Johnson’s plea for people to only undertake essential travel to try to slow the spread of Covid-19. Almost as many left the house on Wednesday as on Monday, when the Prime Minister announced the biggest shut down of the UK since the Second World War, urging people to work from home and stay away from pubs, restaurants, cinemas and other social gatherings.Asked whether they had left their house, 73 per cent said yes on Monday, rising to 75 per cent on Tuesday and down to 72 per cent on Wednesday.On Wednesday, 26 per cent said they had visited family and friends at their home or out and about - up from 20 per cent on Monday.There was also no significant increase in people self-isolating between Monday and Wednesday, with 17 per cent saying they were not leaving their house at the beginning of the week compared to 16 per cent two days later. Londoners and women were found to be most likely to self-isolate.The findings suggest that the majority of the public is not heeding the Prime Minister’s warnings that coronavirus could kill 250,000 people if they do not change their behaviour. Around two thirds of people have been watching the Prime Minister’s press conferences, either live or on catch-up later.Just under half (46 per cent) approve of how Mr Johnson is handling the outbreak, compared to a third (31 per cent) who disapprove. Similarly, 45 per cent approve of how Chancellor Rishi Sunak is handling the outbreak, although significantly fewer (16 per cent) disapprove. Over half (53 per cent) approve of the UK government’s handling the crisis. Nearly four in five (79 per cent) approve of how the NHS has reacted to the outbreak, while England’s Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty has a 56 per cent approval rating, and Chief Scientific Advisor Sir Patrick Vallance has a 52 per cent approval rating. Only around 8 per cent disapprove of each of them.The poll found the public is growing increasingly anxious about coronavirus, with 70 per cent saying they were worried on Monday, rising to 74 per cent on Wednesday.Asked if their disposable income had decreased, one in five said yes on Monday, rising to over a third by Wednesdays.The findings came as Mr Johnson last night announced all entertainment venues would close and Mr Sunak announced a new coronavirus job retention scheme for employers to apply for an HMRC grant to cover 80 per cent of wages up to £2,500 a month.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/03/20/TELEMMGLPICT000228265873_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq92hKO6jAtmPrz4xYdDrmelEinND3d9VDjwHpSwOWrdA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"stakes high rishi sunak has made right big gesture","story":"\u0026#39I would say that this Government so far deserves the benefit of the doubt\u0026#39When there is a crisis, all of us call on the Government to listen to what people need and help provide it. This is not necessarily a “statist” thing to do. If you believe in the state at all, you believe that its power to lead is most crucial in an emergency. Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak tried to exercise that power last night.When we make these calls, we need to adopt a different tone from that of normal life. In good times, we feel free to moan loudly about anything, often impugning the motives of politicians as we do so. We do this, oddly, because the stakes are quite low. Paradoxically, we need to be less extreme when the stakes are very high.Right now, they are very high indeed. We need to avoid the political equivalent of panic-buying – rushing wildly for dramatic solutions, grabbing whatever we think would suit ourselves, elbowing weaker fellow-citizens out of the way.Just as ministers need to understand our worries, we need to understand theirs. Their normally self-serving motives are not so relevant in a real crisis. They have just as much interest as anyone in getting this right, and even less chance of survival if they get it wrong.Ministers worry, obviously, about practicalities – supply chains, money, medicines. Slightly less obviously, they worry about their exact choice of words. They must tell the truth – though not always the whole truth – but it matters terribly how they tell it. With every single remark they make, they can upset the necessary balance between hope and fear. If we understand this delicacy, we shall be more restrained ourselves when they “mis-speak”.Bearing all that in mind, I would say that this Government so far deserves the benefit of the doubt. Some will say that Boris Johnson tends to facile optimism. It is probably true that – like many people, particularly many men – he first approached the subject more from the “What’s all the fuss about?” end of the spectrum than from the “We’re all doomed!” one. But ask yourself, “Would I have felt better about the handling of Covid-19 if Theresa May had been prime minister?”…Looking back at the Boris headlines over the past tumultuous 10 days, one finds a reasonable balance between the grave – “Many more families are going to lose loved ones” – and the hopeful – “12 weeks to turn the tide”. The Prime Minister has shown roughly the right deference to the experts who flank him at press conferences, and asserted with roughly the right emphasis his own role as leader.Last night, he offered relief to millions on the verge of unemployment, but at the same time reminded us that “thousands of lives could be lost needlessly” if health advice was not followed. Again, a balance.Although the Government’s reluctance to clamp down on everything all at once worried many, it did have the effect which a free society should always seek – voluntary buy-in. With little intervention by police, army or action of the courts, and little disorder, most people have decided to do what is asked of them.It is much better if people do the right thing because they want to help than because they are made to do so at the point of a gun. It means they will feel empowered to go on helping. That is happening. The reality – both virtual and actual – is that the British are looking out for one another in this. “It’s on all of us,” as the Chancellor said yesterday. That “it”, of course, includes the enormous, but justified bill.This public acquiescence is all the more remarkable if – as many allege – the Government got its earlier analysis of the disease wrong. It thought at first that it could manage the peak of the disease by delay, so that “herd immunity” could develop. Last weekend, confronted with the Italian example, it changed its mind, and switched to “suppress”. People noticed all right, but the remarkable thing was how little execration there was.On Monday evening, Mr Johnson admitted, but played down, his change of strategy by telling the press that the experts had decided the virus had reached “the fast-growth part of the upward curve”. Fiercer measures were therefore needed, he said. Most people seemed to accept his change of tune without serious protest. That suggests that trust is quite high.When this is all over (which as Boris rightly reminded us, it eventually will be), a study of the sequence of events may show that our Government made culpable errors here. I do not feel I can judge. Nor – more to the point – should people in general waste time doing so at this moment. It will be a matter for historians.What is true, however, is that from the beginning of this week, the Government has finally “owned” the coronavirus crisis. It has decreed that the moral need to save as many lives as possible overrules our normal attitude to choice and to cost. It has moved from being a key player to putting itself fully in charge. So it cannot duck the responsibilities.The first of these, of course, is medical. But the second, affecting more people than the first, is economic. If you shut down large parts of the economy, even mostly by nudge rather than by law, you are responsible for the consequences.Concern about coronavirusThe coming crash and its consequent redundancies are quite unlike the collapse of hopelessly inefficient and unionised British car firms in the Seventies, or even the banking collapse of 2008. In both of those examples, the businesses affected were largely responsible for their own disasters. In the hospitality or travel sector in 2020, however, you could be the best pub or airline in the world and still get taken to the cleaners (if there are any cleaners still open) by circumstances virtually 100 per cent beyond your control. This is not a shake-out, but an act of God, an earthquake.So what the affected businesses need is money now, and the element within the businesses which need the money most are the people they employ. It was a pity, I think, that the Chancellor began his rescue earlier this week with offers of easy loans. These will certainly help some businesses, but if your takings have suddenly slumped to zero, with no immediate prospect of respite, why would you be looking for more debt if you could avoid it? You want actual cash, and so do your workers. It would have been better if Mr Sunak had offered that as his priority. His decision to pay 80 per cent of the wages of all workers laid off by the economic effects of the virus is the right big gesture: it should also have been the first one.If that cash does not reach the right people soon, two things will happen. First, there will be a sharp and deep downturn and it will be shaped, as one senior minister puts it, “Not like a V, but like an inverse L”. That could undermine the very structure of the economy and remove the skills that sustain it. Second, there will be huge and justified resentment at the sheer unfairness.The comparison has been made, by the Government itself, with a war. The needs are absolute and urgent, and victory must benefit everyone. As we end the first week of full hostilities, the Government seems to be living by the old family motto, “Late, but in earnest”.Coronavirus latest news: Social distancing could last for rest of the yearHow many coronavirus cases are in your area?

In the 90s, there was an occasional one, but now there are more introspective men in their late 20s coming in with a little bit of puffiness wanting to have surgery, which I try to avoid because they usually have problems with their body image.“I would try to refer many of them to a psychologist. They can then assess them and look at underline anxiety images and that might be what they need.”Campaigners have warned that waking up in the middle of the night to check messages can negatively affect young people\u0027s moods and makes them look more tired the next day.A spokesperson for the Royal Society for Public Health said: “Taking a break from social media when in the bedroom or during sleeping hours can be a great way to ensure that social media use does not override a young person\u0027s ability to get a good night\u0027s sleep, which is a vital component to overall health and well-being.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/03/15/08/coronavirus-london.jpg","title":"interest rates bank of england coronavirus today latest","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.The central bank will also buy £200bn\u0026nbspmore UK assets, restarting its quantitative easing policyThe Bank of England cut interest rates to a new historic low of 0.1 per cent on Thursday amid the UK’s spiralling coronavirus economic crisis.The central bank will also buy £200bn more UK financial assets, restarting its quantitative easing policy, in an bid to calm British bond markets where were “bordering on disorderly”.The bank’s Monetary Policy Committee voted unanimously for the emergency action to support the British economy at a special meeting.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHow to be productive if you have to work from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your handsShould you be taking paracetamol or ibuprofen to treat coronavirus?What are symptoms of coronavirus – and where has it spread?The rates move follows a 0.5 per cent cut\u0026nbspannounced on 12 March by the bank, to coincide with the Budget, which took rates from 0.75 per cent to 0.25 per cent, the previous record low.The new asset purchases, which will be mainly made up of UK government debt but will also include investment-grade corporate bonds, will take the bank’s stock of assets to £625bn, around 30 per cent of GDP.Government debt – known as gilts – have fallen in price in recent days amid heavy selling by investors.

The crash mirrored the fortunes of traditional markets and came amid\u0026nbspglobal economic turmoil caused by the Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic.Bitcoin’s recovery saw it return\u0026nbspabove $6,000 on Thursday, having briefly traded as low as $4,000 a few days earlier. Other major cryptocurrencies, including ether, XRP and bitcoin cash, also saw significant price rises as investors returned capital into digital assets.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“Bitcoin’s crash was a knock-on effect of the stock market collapse, as panicked investors sold any assets they had for cash, so they could pay off urgent debts to their broker,” cryptocurrency expert and author Glen Goodman told\u0026nbspThe Independent.The coronavirus outbreak, which has seen more than 230,000 confirmed cases and close to 10,000 deaths around the world, has caused chaos across global stock markets and seen major currencies like the pound fall to their lowest levels in decades.There has not been an economic downturn of this magnitude since the 2008 financial crisis and some central banks are already considering similarly drastic measures in order to prevent complete collapse.\u0026nbspThe Reserve Bank of Australia and the European Central Bank are\u0026nbspreportedly considering emergency monetary policies, including quantitative easing. This would see the banks artificially increase the money supply by essentially printing new money.The finite supply of bitcoin – no more than 21 million will ever exist – has led some investors to consider it a so-called safe-haven asset, similar to gold.“For the longer term, investors are now starting to worry about central banks cranking up the money printing machines,” Mr Goodman said.\u0026nbsp”This could send investors to assets that can’t be endlessly printed, like gold and bitcoin.”Created with Sketch.Bitcoin\u0027s volatile history in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Satoshi Nakamoto creates the first bitcoin block in 2009On 3 January, 2009, the genesis block of bitcoin appeared.

It looks outwardly near-identical to the current model, but it offers better value, increased storage and faster performance. But even these things are not the game-changer: that’s the new keyboard.The pricing first: where the previous MacBook Air, on sale until just days ago, cost £1,099 and came with 128GB of internal storage, the entry-level Air is now £100 less, £999, and has 256GB of storage. There’s also a 512GB model available, with a faster processor, for £1,299. There are still lots of laptops out there for much less money, but this price represents good value. Note that Apple has education pricing for those in class as students or teachers, so it’s possible to get that price even lower if you qualify.The look is the same as before: sleek and classy. It comes in three colours, silver, space grey and gold. The space grey is the best: solid and businesslike without looking boring, though the gold, warm with a peachy hint to it, is also a head-turner.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe build quality of the MacBook Air is exceptional, an all-aluminium casing that’s sculpted to the slimmest of edges to make it easy to pick up. Like all MacBooks, and unlike many other laptops, you can open it with one hand, the build is so perfectly balanced. Other machines require a finger to hold down the keyboard as you open the lid or the whole thing swings up as it opens.This MacBook Air continues to have a power button with Touch ID built in – a fingerprint scanner that ensures your computer screen locks when you’re away from it and only unlocks to your finger. Apple Watch wearers can also use their smart timepiece to unlock the MacBook Air, which is cool. Both mechanisms feel intimate and secure.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

The Air has two Thunderbolt USB-C ports. For other connections, such as USB-A, you’ll need an adaptor. That’s not always convenient, though it gets easier all the time as more accessories switch to USB-C, and it helps to keep the Air thin.The MacBook Air has been preposterously slim and light since it was first unveiled by Steve Jobs in 2008 when the then-CEO slid it out of an envelope to an admiring crowd. It was so much thinner and lighter than the competition that it drew gasps of excitement. Over the next decade it slipped behind, especially in terms of the screen resolution, though that’s been fixed. Now, the 13in display is bright, rich and superbly high-resolution.Apple releases iPad with 3D scanner and a trackpadApple and Netflix pull out of SXSW over coronavirus fearsAnd then there’s the new keyboard. Apple keyboards were traditionally outstanding, using a scissor-switch mechanism, with lots of travel and a great feel. Then, a few years ago, Apple changed to a whole new system, using a butterfly mechanism. The first-generation of this was quite noisy, but this was overcome in subsequent versions. But then, problems arose which led to keyboards being replaced as users complained that there wasn’t the same reliability.Last year, on the MacBook Pro 16in, Apple introduced the Magic Keyboard – a name taken from its desktop wireless keyboard – which changed everything. The new keys were quieter, more stable and had more travel – a full 1mm. That’s not quite as much as the keys moved before the butterfly landed, when it was 1.2mm. But it was enough, and it was a revelation.It’s the same here. Using the new keyboard subtly transforms the typing experience. It’s not that the butterfly keys were bad: unless they failed, they worked well and were comfortable to use.But as soon as you use the new Magic Keyboard, you recognise how comfortable and inviting it is. The downside is it’s quite hard to go back. Having typed this review on the MacBook Air keys, I picked up a previous Air to make a comparison. As soon as I started typing, my fingers told me I was missing the new experience. The keys on the old Air, which I had used happily before, just couldn’t match the luxurious and satisfying feel of the new one. The gentle scoop on the top of each key that helps your fingers find the right place to touch, the crisper inidual backlighting to make typing in a less bright room a breeze and the clearer lettering on each key – all of which are small, subtle improvements that Apple has made with the Magic Keyboard – add up to something big.The processor has been improved on the latest models with a 1.1GHz dual-core Core i3 processor on the £999 model and a 1.1GHz quad-core Core i5 chip on the £1,299 version.In practical terms, this means that the Air is a real performer. Not that it was a slouch before, but it handles tasks easily. It’s true, the MacBook Pro is still the go-to laptop for those doing advanced video processing or running other power-hungry programs. But the Air is now very fast and effective. To the extent that many customers may ask whether they really need to spend £1,299 on the entry-level 13in MacBook Pro rather than a £999 MacBook Air that isn’t that far off. Sure, there are other extras in the Pro range, like the spiffy Touch Bar instead of function keys, and four Thunderbolt USB-C sockets instead of two on the Air, for instance.Battery life on the MacBook Air is exemplary: it just goes on and on all day where other laptops, including some MacBook Pro models, don’t last as long. It’s so good that you may not even think about checking how much charge is left in the battery. It gives a great feeling of peace of mind.The new MacBook Air is available for order now, with deliveries starting next week. It represents a big step forward for the super-slim Apple laptop, combining sumptuous good looks with real performance and, above all, an unbeatably appealing keyboard.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The government needs to protect the right to life and at the same time consider the impact on human rights as it strives to protect the country in this unprecedented time.”The committee said quarantine and self-isolation had an impact on the right to liberty and right to life, while a potential ban on public gatherings affected freedom of assembly and association, and school closures hit the right to education.Restricting people’s ability to work has a “disproportionate impact” on the self-employed and other groups, while the impact on small businesses engages the “right to peaceful enjoyment of one’s possessions”.The committee said that any future moves to prioritise or ration healthcare must be “justifiable and non-discriminatory”, and that the prevention of timely funerals could violate freedom of religion.Members said the government must consider the wellbeing of people held in prisons, immigration detention centres and mental health units, as well as the right to\u0026nbspjustice – after new trials of more than three days were stopped.The committee warned that homeless people and those in temporary accommodation will find it difficult to comply with any formal instruction to self-isolate.It called for evidence to be submitted on the steps taken to ensure the government’s plans comply with human rights and to address the impact on groups that will be disproportionately affected by emergency measures.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

These iniduals will not have a right to live in Britain after the deadline of June 2021, unless they successfully appeal the decision.The number remains proportionately small, as there have been nearly 3 million applications processed overall, but it marks a considerable jump from the previous monthly figures, when just seven people had been refused.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAt that point the refusals were all on the grounds of criminality, but most of the latest refusals were due to issues around eligibility –\u0026nbspusually because the applicant has been unable to provide the relevant\u0026nbspdocumentary\u0026nbspevidence.While the number is still proportionately low, campaigners have raised alarm at the sudden increase, and it is likely to prompt concern around difficulties more vulnerable people face when obtaining evidence.Charity helping children in care stay in UK has to stop taking casesEU settlement scheme delays leave people unable to get jobsNine out of 10 EU settlement scheme appeals successful, data showsWithout physical proof of our status, EU citizens like me live in fearThe Home Office said officials had made every attempt to obtain the necessary evidence before refusing applications, and that decisions to refuse were not taken lightly and signed off at a high level.Maike Bohn, co-founder of campaign group\u0026nbspthe3million, told The Independent she was concerned by the fact that while there had been no refusals on eligibility grounds before February 2020, there was now a sharp rise.“This is hard to explain. We urgently need more explanation from the Home Office as to why those cases have been refused,” she said. “It is concerning that as soon as the UK left the EU we see people being refused settled status.”Christopher Desira, immigration solicitor at Seraphus law firm, said there were likely to be more and more refusals beyond criminality grounds, which may worry a lot of people in uncommon family arrangements, which tend to be the most complex applications.\u0026nbspHe also raised alarm over the gaps in free outreach and advice services that are likely to form due to the coronavirus outbreak, which may cause problems for those receiving requests for further information from the Home Office, but not know how to respond, and called on the Home Office to pause any refusals until the emergency is over.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They are our families and friends, our colleagues and carers.

This time, it is different.It will involve the state providing a vast sum. For businesses, support should replicate what business continuity insurance would provide. It should allow workers to continue to be employed. It should offer cash for paying the demonstrated wage bill.Meanwhile, Labour called for state to underwrite up to 90 per cent of wages in return for a guarantee from employers that they will not lay off staff.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Our Games are not next week or two weeks from now. They’re four months from now. I think a lot may change in that time period. So we are affording the IOC the opportunity to gather that information and expert advice, and at this point in time we do not feel it’s necessary for us to insist that they make a decision.”USA Swimming is a huge draw when watching the Olympic Games given the level their athletes perform at, with former\u0026nbspswimmers including Michael Phelps, who is the most decorated Olympian of all time. So the organisation speaking out against the continuation of the Games comes as\u0026nbspa huge blow for the IOC while it weighs the difficult decision.Jacob Pebley, a swimmer on the 2016 US Olympic‘s team, released a statement about why the Games should be postponed this year.\u0026nbspTeam USA and role models for hundreds of thousands of young athletes, attend Olympic Trialsthe Olympics in good conscience?” he wrote. “To do so would fly in the face of all emerging evidence and best practices for social distancing and protecting the health of vulnerable communities.”US Gymnastics team has not publicly taken a position on if the Olympics should be postponed this year.\u0026nbspThe British Olympic Association (BOA) recently said it would not “endanger the health” of its athletes by encouraging them to train for the Games if it was not in their best interest to do so.\u0026nbsp“We can be categorically clear that we will not endanger the health and wellbeing of the athletes or wider delegation at any point,” the BOA said.\u0026nbsp“It is imperative to preserve competitive integrity for athletes, but it is clearly only wise for athletes to continue to prepare for the Games where it is safe and appropriate to do so, within relevant Government and public health guidelines.”But the organisation said it\u0026nbspstill respected the IOC and its decision-making process when ultimately deciding if the Games should be postponed or continue.\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

People can be seen hanging laundry. Children play. One man eats noodles. Another smokes a cigarette.Chinese officials and some public health experts have credited the draconian confinement measures on a city of 11 million, and much of Hubei province, of which it is the capital, with slowing the spread of the disease and turning the tide of infection across China.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOther countries, including Iran, Italy and the United States, are struggling to manage their outbreaks.\u0026nbspBut even as the number of new reported cases stops in Wuhan, people in the city remain suspended in an isolated new normal.Residents are forbidden from venturing out of their homes even to buy food, which must be delivered.

However, China this week\u0026nbspreported no new domestic cases – meaning the strict isolation measures have been working.\u0026nbspBut the outbreak has also exacted an unquantifiable psychological toll on people in Wuhan as families cope with loss, children are unable to go to school or play outside, and livelihoods are imperilled as people can’t go to work.Reporting by\u0026nbspCarlos Garcia and Tony Munroe, ReutersNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And you’d also hope they take more care than they did with the actual production, which started to betray a “will-this-do ” attitude with almost its first caption of the night.“Dermot Munaghan.” And the next one: “Colston Smith.” .A foretaste of what was to come, because the event had technically unravelled within the first hour when Lineker had to introduce a comedy sketch about VAR and the  World Cup final.First it appeared, then it vanished. So Lineker explained the punchline: VAR had not just found in England’s favour it had decided to award the  World Cup to Scotlandand Euro  to Wales.Then the sketch suddenly reappeared again and took six minutes to reach its bloody, teeth-pulling conclusion: “I’m going to change my name to Jamie VAR-dy.”In such circumstances, you can sit and hope the rest of Sport Relief moves, inspires and thrills with a perfect blend of laughter, compassion and entertainment.And I can also hope Scotland are going to win the next World Cup. It ain’t going to happen.Sport Relief is never ever over quickly, ’cos there are a whole load of BBC formats to be put through the ringer, like Line Of Duty, and far too much dancing, featuring everyone from Lineker and McGuinnes to a “social media influencer”, called “HRVY”, which wasn’t another spelling mistake. I think he’s just an RSHOL.At ious other points in this back-of-a-fag-packet evening: Hockey player Sam Quek took , football penalties against a short fat bloke, from point-blank range, and contrived to miss more than a quarter of them. Mel Giedroyc farted on a Question Of Sport special. Rylan accused Romesh Ranganathan of being over-exposed, before playing Andy Murray at crazy golf. And they flagged up an Action Line number, for people who were feeling “emotionally vulnerable”, after the Killing Steves parody, which may have been the most benevolent gesture in the event’s history.What really irks about Sport Relief, though, is that, evencompassion fatigue has never been more of a problem, they’ve decided it’s a triumph before it’s broadcast and the “Best Bits” Sunday show is all ready to go.Corporate backing also means there’s little risk of them not beating the previous total either, which, I hope, doesn’t sound like I’m diminishing the sincere efforts of the public.If there’s one thing I’ll remember about Sport Relief , however, it’s the contribution of David Beckham, who, infor a y advertorial for his new MLS franchise and some crashing product placement , offered two entire people the chance to attend an Inter Miami game and win a shirt signed by such global talents as Lewis Morgan and A J DeLaGarza, who’s played  entire games for Guam.There are moments when the generosity and humanity of celebrities simply overwhelms me.This wasn’t one of those moments.Bloke.CHANNEL  seemed to have all bases covered for its hugely entertaining new dating show Five Guys A Week, at least in terms of complete bellends.So, crammed into a semi-detached house in St Albans, hoping to win the heart of its owner Amy, it had: Christian, whose job “isn’t as glamorous as it sounds” . Uber-woke Glen, from accounts. A stuntman called Michael, who seemed to have mistaken the show for SAS: Who Dares Wins and voluntarily withdrew on day two. Mad, goggle-eyed surfer Trystan, who appeared to be casing the joint for a “kill room”. And the lowest form of le known to any single thirtysomething man – the bloke with the acoustic guitar, Scott, who used to be a bank manager, but now earns a living as a country and western singer and will be performing under the stage name Johnny Cashpoint,he’s got an ounce of sense.The five were chosen for their ability to get right on the viewers’ nerves rather than real boyfriend potential, obviously.And it made for a cracking hour of TV, because they all competitively fancied the pants off Amy, who looked like a younger and much hotter Camilla Parker Bowles,you can imagine such a thing.The show’s greatest strength, of course, is also its biggest format failing, as I’d imagine no one wanted any of them to win.In the event, however, it came down to a straight fight between the lesser of two evils and, probably wisely, Amy chose cocky Christian, who’s looking to whisk her off for breakfast in France, ahead of grovelling Glen, who, rather than looking for “the Michelle Obama to my Barack”, should probably be aiming for the Michelle Collins to his Ian Beale.Five Guys A Week, C, tonight, .pm.The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “What caused the cancellation of six Wimbledon championships in the s ”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “Which city in north-east England shares its common name with the body of a ship ”Spin To Win, Phillip Schofield: “What Saturday night TV show is Anton du Beke most famous for ”Hunted, Dan: “Who painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel ”LISA NANDY wasn’t born stupid. She volunteered to be, by standing for Labour Party leader.It means noisily backing every woke cause of the day, until their interests collide, as they did spectacularly on last Tuesday’s Good Morning Britain, where Piers Morgan hit her with two innocuous-sounding questions.“Are babies born either male or female ” and “Would you be happyUsain Bolt and Floyd Mayweather self-identied as women, spent a year having testosterone treatment and competed against women ”Correct answers: Yes and no.But Lisa couldn’t say that for fear of offending either the transgender or feminist lobbies.So instead she blathered, lied, evaded, shouted, demanded an apology from Piers , accused him of laughing and describing transgender people as “grotesque”and at one point muttered: “I don’t know what . . . I don’t know what, well, you know, I don’t know what.”Others would’ve let her off the hook at that point, as she was almost crying at her own stupidity by then. Chunk didn’t.To his eternal credit he ignored two ad breaks and kept up the pressure for a spellbinding  minutes that only ended when Nandy offered to settle the issue of whether Floyd Mayweather should be able to box women by “setting up a commission”.To which Piers responded: “It’s not a commission issue, it’s a common sense issue.”But that, as a wise man once said, is the problem with common sense, Piers. It’s not all that common.Ian Wright: “At this stage, I think three points is three points.”Jamie Redknapp: “Switching off from football is always beneficial sometimes.”Piers Morgan effectively ending Lisa Nandy’s Labour leadership bid on TV’s most consistently entertaining show, Good Morning Britain.Saturday night eye balm from BBC’s Ireland: Edge Of The World. Larry David ending up in the “ugly section” of Tiato’s restaurant, on Curb Your Enthusiasm.Sky’s Breeders managing to make a comedy about children bearable.And John Humphrys’ opening curveball on Saturday’s Celebrity Mastermind: “Name ” “Bez.” “Occupation ” Pass.This Morning, Holly Willoughby: “What should a ‘support neighbour’ look like  ’Cos my mum’s older than me.”Andyour mum isn’t older than you, self-isolate immediately.THIS week’s winner is Future Stewie, from Family Guy, and Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty.All those self-defined “experts” whose coronavirus response is framed not by their humanity or expertise but the desperate need to be proved right.Every selfish moron in the country being filmed panic-buying toilet rolls.Firebrand left-wing stand-up Guz Khan taking the gig economy advertising shilling from Uber Eats.The comically awful use of Photoshopped throwback pictures in BBC drama The Split.And the never-ending queue of fantasists and egomaniacs at E’s Sex Clinic, like third person-speaking Drew, who announced: “I’m not having vanilla sex. That’s not what the Drew brand is about. Le’s too short, man.” The shorter the better . . . man.The Sex Clinic, Matt: “I think I need to learn to love myself.”Five Guys A Week, Glen: “My talents aren’t obvious. They’re not tangible things.” On account of the fact they don’t exist. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They are resilient. You aren’t going to like it, but you’ll get through it.“You can compare it to the Blitz. People got through the Blitz. It was very stressful but they did it.”My elderly mother lives just a few roads away from me and, like so many with similarly vulnerable relatives, I’m making sure she’s OK.“Just pop a tin of Spam through the letterbox, and I’ll be fine,” she joked in reference to her time growing up during World War Two.But yesterday, three of her immediate neighbours — one of whom she’s never met — put notes through her door to say she should give them a callshe needed anything.In times of such crisis, our first thought is naturally of ourselves and our immediate loved ones.But it seems the upsideof the world slowing down and re-grouping might be that, no longer distracted by the busyness of our normal working days, we will “look up” and “reach out”, as they say in business circles, to those in our communities who might need help.There are plenty of people who already do sterling work in their area, but the onslaught of the coronavirus will perhaps lead to everyone now doing their bit.Quite right too. But the onus can’t solely rest on the shoulders of iniduals, so it’s only right the Government has stepped up to offer some practical help to businesses that will suffer throughout the coming weeks and months.Boris Johnson’s advice that people shouldn’t go to pubs cafes theatres etc is understandable in health terms, but will leave businesses facing a critical downturn in custom through no fault of their own.Yesterday, London restaurateur James Chiaini urged him to “crack open the war chest” and allow local businesses to stay afloat while simultaneously channelling efforts towards helping out in their immediate communities, and it seems that new Chancellor Rishi Sunak has listened.In James’s case, he has staff on hand and lots of food supplies, so instead of shutting down because there are no customers, he and other restaurants across the country could potentially now operate a batch-cooking and delivery service for those in need.Equally, the skill sets of many other businesses can be channelled into providing much-needed, state-funded help where it’s required.And the Government shouldn’t stop there. It should repurpose certain facilities too.Last week, it was reported that the £million Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre in Loughborough, Leics, is currently seriously underused because only current personnel can access it and only  have done so in the past  months.Madness. At the very least, it should be thrown open to all injured veterans who currently have to go through the overstretched NHS.Or how about temporarily repurposing it as a treatment centre for anyone who could benefit from its facilities, thereby alleviating some of the pressure on local hospitals The Government is clearly in uncharted territory right now because it is dealing with an unprecedented situation.But a continuation of joined-up thinking on how best to get us through this critical phase in our history will ensure that Britain’s enviable “Blitz spirit” is encouraged and kept strong for as long as it needs to be.PRINCE Harry is now back behind the closed doors of his rented Canadian mansion, licking his wounds after his public humiliation at the hands of phone pranksters.During a chat with what he thought was climate change activist Greta Thunberg and her father, Harry pledged his support to the non-existent island of “Chunga-Changa” and failed to question why the hoaxers wanted to ship penguins to the North Pole when they’re actually native to the South Pole.Poor Harry.Still, it perhaps explains why, despite attending Eton, he got D at geography A level.Indeed, on all our faces in these challenging times.Heartfelt congratulations to her and husband Chris.FORMER All Saints star Nicole Appleton has given birth to her second child, a girl called Skipper, at the age of .“After hiding my pregnancy for the last nine months – which was so dficult and keeping her a secret from all my friends – I can finally announce our incredible news!” she wrote on Instagram.Fascinating. It’s one thing wearing a big coat out in public, but how do you hide a growing bump from “friends” Has Nicole, whose boyfriend is Stephen Haines, been in pre-emptive self-isolation for the past few months Or is it simply that her petite frame and enviably taut stomach muscles meant she just looked like the rest of us after a big meal Personally speaking, by month seven I looked like I had a medicine ball stuffed up my frock.STORMZY reportedly ripped up his travel plans after meeting Victoria’s Secret model Yasmine Aisha Khala Holmgren backstage at a gig in Stockholm.The pair are said to have holed up in a hotel room for two days where, according to a friend of the grime star, they wanted to spend “quality time” together.That’s one way of putting it.A NEW biography about former Commons Speaker John Bercow claims that he didn’t speak to a female aide for the entirety of a nine hour flight – because he was furious that his toothpaste had been confiscated at airport security.Quite what it had to do with her is anyone’s guess.But one imagines she was grateful for the prolonged period of peace.HANNAH SMITH, a -year-old mum of one, has been handed a suspended sentence after admitting the crime of harbouring a criminal.Her boyfriend, violent robber Luke Harvey, scaled the wall of HMP Sudbury in Derbyshire, where Hannah was waiting to drive him to Skegness for a weekend away.They were later pulled over by police and Harvey, , had ten months added to the -year sentence he received in .Leicester Crown Court was told that the couple had now split up.Presumably, actually spending time together proved too much.HERE is yet another photograph of the singer and actress Jenner Lopez looking sensational at .

This is a time for unity and for respecting others, especially the most vulnerable.As the Queen put it yesterday in her admirable statement: “I am reminded that our nation’s history has been forged by people and communities coming together to work as one, concentrating our combined efforts with a focus on the common goal.”As the emergency deepens, abuse of privilege should play no part in our national response.But that is exactly what is now happening, as is graphically demonstrated by the saga of private Covid- tests kits.One of the biggest problems the Government faces is the shortage of capacity for testing.To prevent the current system from being overwhelmed by demand, NHS policy is only to test people with a “high chance” of having the illness, such as those who have ed from high-risk countries or are displaying symptoms.Even doctors and nurses working in the front-line are not routinely tested.But to evade such official restrictions, a growing number of the rich and famous are forking out for private coronavirus kits, which can cost anything between £ and £.According to one report this week, more than , wealthy figures in Britain have ordered such kits.Dr Mark Ali, director of the Harley Street clinic, said: “We have private iniduals – some recognisable names there – and we are testing lords and ladies and even doctors and dentists who are worried about catching the disease.”It is the same story of privileged access in the US, where, just as in Britain, shortages of supplies mean that many health care workers and sick people are unable to get diagnoses.But some stars seek to bypass rules that limit tests to those most at risk.A huge controversy erupted this week at the news that eight top NBA basketball teams has been tested, making a mockery of the rationing.Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York, spoke for much of the public when he said that “an entire NBA team should not get tested for Covid- while there are critically ill patients waiting to be tested. Tests should not be for the wealth, but for the sick.”On both sides of the Atlantic, this two-tiered approach is wrong on so many levels.It is a deep insult to healthcare workers. It is profoundly isive.And it does not lessen the burdens on the NHS here in Britain, as some apologists pretend.Those who test positive will still have to be treated in the health service, since the British private medical sector does not have the resources for this crisis.Selfish and irresponsible, the Covid-test queue jumpers are the equivalents of the supermarket stockpilers or the social distancing refuseniks who still insist on going down to the pub.During the Second World War, when the Blitz spirit was at its peak, there was fierce hostility to rich iniduals who tried to cheat on rationing regulations or avoid national service.The same contempt should now be shown to those who try to dodge the rules that promote fairness.But it is not just in testing where the narrow self-centredness of the rich can be found. They use their wealth to insulate themselves in other ways.Some are buying special private medical care, like intravenous infusions of vitamins and minerals to boost their immune system.Lansherhof, a private medical facility at the London Arts Club, reported this week an  per cent increase in enquires for its Immune Plus Support Infusion, which costs £.The rich are also using private jet travel to avoid the rest of the public as they conduct business or fly to remote havens.Inquiries for international flights by private jets are estimated to be up nine-fold since the outbreak began, while Hong Kong International Airport reported this week its busiest day for private jet activity.Nor do the rich have to endure the normal airport ordeal suffered by other passengers.A spokeswoman for Quintessentially, a concierge company for millionaires, said: “Members who are travelling commercially are choosing to book elite services at airports, not your typical first-class lounge.For example, private terminals where guests are greeted and given their own suite.Check-in, customs and security are all done privately and guests are taken to the doors of the aircraft.Members can request for the jetty to be cleared so they minimise the interactions with other passengers”.Most Brits have no choice over where they live in the midst of this crisis.But that is not true of the wealthy who can find sanctuary in one of their many properties or rent out an expensive rural bolt-hole.Some are now paying £,-a-month for a luxury base in the Cotswolds.Nor does self-isolation have to be the imprisoning experience that it is for ordinary citizens.The rich can bring in private chefs for their dinners, or expensive tutors for their children.The company Tutors International, which provides elite tuition services, says it has seen “a massive upswing in requests” since the outbreak began.The elite even have luxury face masks. The fashionable Airinum Urban Air Mask costs £ and claims to protect “against airborne particles as small as .mm.”But in this rarefied world, problems are faced by the elite that would never be considered by others.Wailing that she now has now chance to show off her expensive jewellery, one female financier in London says: “I’m just not sure when my next ball will be.”The experience of the affluent is in dramatic contrast to the misery faced by people at the other end of the scale.While the rich cocoon themselves, it is the wage-earners, the straitened households, the poor and the unemployed who are now in the eye of the storm.Our society is just beginning to realize the terrying consequences of this disaster, where the mounting death toll is matched by economic meltdown.Vast numbers of people – from hotel cleaners to airline cabin crew, from bar staff to retail assistants – are going to lose their jobs.The ranks of the five million self-employed will be decimated. Small businesses across the country will collapse.Food banks are already running short of supplies, while the plight of the homeless – who cannot isolate themselves on the streets – is desperate as shelters close.At worst, our prosperous civilisation could slide into a kind of modern feudal structure, with only the aristocracy at the top enjoying a decent standard of living.At a press conference in the White House on Wednesday, President Trump was asked whether “the well-connected go to the front of the line”.He replied philosophically: “You’d have to ask them that. Perhaps that’s been the story of le.”But it should not be that way, especially when mankind is facing one of its darkest hours.We should all be in this together.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That applies to children just as it does to the rest of us.”She said it was fine for siblings or children in “household groups” to play together.Dr Harris added that team sports should be avoided by both children and adults.The stark warning was issued in a document from a Scientic Pandemic Influenza Group, dated this Monday.But just three days later, the PM said the UK could “turn the tide” on the outbreak within  weeks.The experts say restrictions could be imposed or lted to control the spread of the virus and may y in dferent UK countries and regions at dferent times.However, they warn there is a risk of a second wave of infections later in the yearthe Government enforces too many restrictions at once and then lts them later.They also say school closures alone will have little impact on the epidemic and hit poorest families hardest.It could delay the peak by up to three weeks and reduce cases and deaths by five per cent.However, they also argue classroom shutdowns would be “most effectivestarted as early as possible” — a revelation likely to anger critics questioning why they were not shut sooner like in other European nations.Isolating sick households is predicted to reduce the peak of the outbreak by a quarter and deaths and cases by ten per cent.But getting people to work from home and avoid pubs, restaurants and cinemas has the greatest potential impact — reducing the peak by up to  per cent and deaths by  per cent.Researchers found Brits were most likely to catch coronavirus in family gatherings.

MUM-OF-ONE Bessie Antclfe, , runs Bessie’s Cafe and Bistro in Sheffield.She is taking meals to her customers in isolation and needs help with deliveries.Bessie says: “Anyone on lockdown can call us and we will leave meals at the door.“If you want to get out of the house and are not showing symptoms, then helping out would be cool.”. MORE than  people have joined Kirsty Gill’s Facebook group to help the sick and elderly in Gillingham, Kent.Mum-of-three Kirsty, , and her army of volunteers will bring essential supplies to anyone unable to leave the house.She says: “We all need to come together.“I support The Sun’s campaign  per cent.“Help each other, do not exploit people. Show some kindness.”“The small business who does everything they can not to lay off their staff.“The student who does a shop for their elderly neighbour.“The retired nurse who volunteers to cover some shts in the local hospital.“When this is over, and it will be over, we want to look back on this moment and remember the many small acts of kindness.“We want to look back on this time and remember how we thought first of others, and acted with decency.“We want to look back on this time and remember how, in the face of a generation- defining moment, we undertook a collective national effort and we stood together. It’s on all of us.”More than a million over-s and vulnerable people are facing lock-in for  weeks within days.There have already been many inspiring stories of kindness.Schoolboy Jimmy-Dean Hudson, seven, is the perfect Helping Hand Hero.He spent his pocket money buying dozens of toilet rolls — then GAVE them away to elderly neighbours in Southend, Essex.Milkman Tony Fowler has been delivering loo roll and hand sanitiser and collecting prescriptions for elderly customers on his round in Melton Mowbray, Leics.Many elderly people are trapped behind closed doors, terried.Age UK’s advice line has seen a  per cent increase in demand, while The Silver Line has experienced a  per cent rise in calls from anxious older people in need of reassurance and friendship.Elderly people have already been swindled out of more than £, by coronavirus scammers, says the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau.Many older people are right to be wary of offers to run errands.So, please, only ask to help old folk you know and who trust you.THERE are lots of brilliant organisations, big and small, desperate for people to help out by donating their time.By being Helping Hand Heroes we can make Britain feel a better place.Try one or more of these ways to help an elderly neighbour:CARE PACKAGES: Drop a surprise one to a neighbour.Give them a call to say you have left it.FLYERS: Make some with your number on and give to neighbours so they can callthey need help.WHATSAPP: Join or start a community WhatsApp group to help vulnerable neighbours.GET CREATIVE: Design cheerful cards with your kids to send to care homes to boost morale.BUDDY UP: Create a buddy system to check in daily with an older person by phone to beat loneliness.FLOWERS: Place a bouquet on the doorstep of someone in self- isolation to brighten up their day.Don’t go in, just knock.OLD PHONES: Offer old mobiles to neighbours and buy them a cheap SIM so they can stay in touch.Clean properly first.NEWSPAPER: Let housebound people know about The Sun’s -week free delivery offer so they can keep up with the news in Britain’s favourite paper.TAKEAWAY: Order food for someone who is vulnerable or self-isolating so they do not have to cook.MEMOIRS: Ask older family members to write down their le story and read it to you over the phone to keep them occupied.But it is not just the elderly who need your help.With most schools closed, possibly until after the summer holidays, give a hand to a struggling mum or dad, too.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.BABYSIT: Leave a note under the door of a neighbour you know well, offering to look after the kids.FOOD BANK: Managed to find supplies at the supermarket Put some in the food bank basket as they are short of stock.SHOPPING: Help out a nurse or a health worker by popping to the shops for them.WALKIES: Offer to take a neighbour’s dog out, or pet sitthey are a key worker.DONATE: If you are working from home, consider donating the money you would have spent commuting to a charity that helps the needy.KEEP QUIET: It is tempting to do loads of DIY when you are stuck in the house — but turn down the volume.Let neighbours get a good night’s sleep.BINGE WATCH: Add more users to your Netflix and Amazon Prime accounts so friends can watch too.VIRTUAL PINT: At the end of a day working from home, hit the phone and check on your workmates or share a “virtual pint” on FaceTime.SMALL BUSINESSES: Support firms that are still trading in your community by buying gt cards.And we can all follow the advice of milkman Tony.He says: “In  years as a milkman I have never let anyone down and I don’t intend to now.“I know how a small act of kindness can make a huge dference to people who need a bit of help.”HISTORY tells us that battles are won by people – people with the determination to see things through to the end.Beating coronavirus is one of those battles that requires determination to the end.However, there is one weapon we need to see in greater use.It is the power of kindness.Set against the chaos of people fighting and jostling in supermarkets to claim the last pack of loo rolls is the example of the unknown shopper who overheard a gentleman asking for a pack of mince.There was none left on the shelves so she followed him out of the shop, insisting he took one of hers, at no cost.That is the sort of kindness we need to see right across the country.When all this has died down, will you be remembered as a hoarder or a helper Many people up and down our country need help right now: Those who are lonely because they are self-isolating, those who are ill, those who are frightened and those who are running out of money to pay bills or buy food.This is where charities and community groups can make a real dference – on the ground, on the front line, where people are in real need.But just at the time they are needed most, many charities themselves are struggling to survive.Their traditional means of fundraising have dried up.Social distancing means jumble sales and quiz nights are cancelled, the London Marathon, which raises so much for charities, is postponed and, just like businesses, charities are wonderingthey can survive.Perhaps the Government will realise the extent of this crisis in the voluntary sector and put in some money.Just a fraction of what is going to businesses would be transformational. So far this is not forthcoming.But this is where we can all get involved, show our kindness, help others and help ourselves.The National Emergencies Trust , set up after the Manchester Arena bombing and the Grenfell Tower fire, launched an appeal on Wednesday, brilliantly promoted by The Duke of Cambridge.Already more than £million has been donated by the public and generous corporations – and the figure is steadily rising.We are “all in this together” but now there is the opportunity for us all to get stuck in and help each other through this crisis.The power of your kindness will help us all get through these dficult days and back to the kind of le that we all want to lead again.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The dramatic partial lockdown of Britain came as the coronavirus death toll continues to rise with  more deaths today taking the total to . The Prime Minister told a press conference today that people should stay at home as he warned of the fatal consequences for the communitypeople flouted the new restrictions. So what does the lockdown mean in practice and where can and canapost you go  What is closing and where      The PM ordered all social venues to close their doors today. It means that the following are all expected to close their doors as soon as possible today and not reopen:Food and drink venues Pubs, bars and clubs Cinemas, theatres, concert and bingo halls Spas, indoor leisure and gyms Casinos and betting shops Museums and galleriesThe closures will happen across the UK with the government taking the step with the agreement of the four nations of the UK.  For how long  To start with they will be closed for  days, that is two weeks, but the government has said it will keep the policy under review. Realistically the government believe that the peak of this virus is about three months away and so it is hard to see it ending after the two weeks that they have set out. How will it be enforced     A ban on pubs and restaurants staying open during the coronavirus outbreak will be enforced strictlynecessary through licensing rules, When asked by reporters how the ban would be enforced, he said clearly there are licensing arrangements which will make it relatively simple to do should that really be necessary. He said the ban would be enforced strictly but stopped short of elaborating on measures that could be taken other than possibly indicating that revoking licences may be an option. The licensing system is run through councils and could be a very messy way of enforcing anyone who disobeys. However, emergency laws being rushed through Parliament next week will give the government far stricter and more direct powers to order venues to closethey disobey. Will supermarkets, pharmacies and shops still be open     Yes. Supermarkets will remain open and shops will do too. But the government is advising people to be cautious in these settings, to try and go at a quieter time and to wash their hands. Can I still get a takeaway  Yes, the PM was very clear on this they want restaurants to continue doing takeaway food. In fact, Mr Johnson said he specically wanted restaurants to do this. Earlier this week the government announced it was suspending regulations which mean restaurants have to apply to become takeaways in order to ensure food delivery continued. Why are they doing it now     As coronavirus ramps up around the country - with cases increasing every day - the government said these steps are necessary. Tthe Prime Minister said the measures were needed to reduce unnecessary social gatherings by % in order to have an impact on the infection rate. The speed of our eventual recovery depends entirely on our collective ability to get on top of the virus now and that means we have to take the next steps on scientic advice, he said. And following our plan, we are strengthening the measures announced on Monday. We need now to push down further on that curve of transmission between us. The announcement came after scientists advising the Government warned that restrictions to control the spread of the virus will need to be in place for most of a year - at least. But I have plans to go out this weekend or host a party... Do. Not. Go. Out. Do. Not. Have. People. Over. The government doesnapost plan to personally stop you hosting a party - but it is telling you how irresponsible this is. Healthy people can still carry it and spread it to others. Mr Johnson said: aposYou may be tempted to go out tonight and I say to you please donapost, you may think that you are invincible - but there is no guarantee that you will get it. But you can still be a carrier of the disease and pass it on. Mr Johnson said those who flouted the rules could end up causing fatal consequences Can I visit my mum on Motheraposs Day     Boris Johnson said you should think very carefully before paying a Motheraposs Day visit during the coronavirus pandemic. Advice to the public includes avoiding all non-essential contact, a measure which is particularly important for the over-s and others who are most vulnerable to succumb to the infection. Mr Johnson was asked at his Covid- press conference on Friday what his advice was to people thinking about visiting their mother on Sunday. I think my advice would be that people should really think very carefully, irrespectively of whether theyaposre visiting their mother, any elderly person who will be in a vulnerable group, he said. Mr Johnson said he would see his mum, but on Skype. aposBut what about my freedomapos you might say Mr Johnson tried to deal with this point directly. He said: I do accept that what weaposre doing is extraordinary - weaposre taking away the ancient inalienable right of freeborn people of the United Kingdom to go to the pub. And I can understand how people feel about that. But I say to people who do go against the advice that weaposre getting, the very clear advice that weaposre getting from our medical and scientic experts, you know youaposre not only putting your own le, the lives of your family, at risk - youaposre endangering the community. And youaposre making it more dficult for us to get on and protect the NHS and save lives.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor more information on how we use your data and your data protection rights.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailThe biggest, absolutely worst news I have this week is that our wedding has been postponed. It’s due in July and with so many family members coming from around the world, it’s unlikely that it will be able to go ahead. It’s been such a massive decision but last night, I had a voicemail from my sister who lives in Melbourne and who has battled breast cancer alongside me since my recurrence. . She was absolutely devastated on the phone and it broke my heart into a trillion pieces. She has always been pretty pragmatic and solid as as rock and she has always bloody mothered me. so to hear her sobs was just awful. Our wedding for her is massive and we just can’t do it without her. Our beautul venue, Hobbit Hill, is looking at rescheduling all weddings and so we asked about the possibility of changing our date until July  but all summer dates are booked up. Nooooooooo! We’d really wanted to get married in the summer as the venue has so many gorgeous outdoorsy treats. We were going to be married in the outdoor woodland. Buuuut what can we do  We have changed it to th April and all we can do is hope for some lovely April spring. The devil on my shoulder was there straight away telling me I won’t even be alive to see . Ugh, cancer I hate youI don’t know about anyone , but this has really triggered my cancer anxiety again. Homeschooling Ivy and having her so close to me all the time - it makes me frightened that something bad will happen and she’ll have to be without me. She just couldn’t cope. So many emotions at the moment, stress, worry, fear, anxiety, hope, anger, love. Allll the feels. But anyway, wow - absolute meltdown across the globe. We’re witnessing something we’ve never seen in our letime - toilet roll hoarders, greedy capitalist pigs. It’s bringing out the worst in a lot of us. My brother is stuck in Spain - Ryanair have offered to fly him home for an additional £. My friends ran out of her £. baby formula, but it’s okay because someone is selling them on Ebay for £.!!! These guys in Aldi were allowed to fill their trollies with wipes and nappies last week which they then loaded into their van. You guessed it - Aldi nappies and wipes now on sale on Ebay for a disgusting amount. How the hell is this not illegal  It’s children’s necessities FFS. Ebay have been contacted with no reply, Aldi too. They’re just reaping all the profits from our despair. Do you think the staff will be seeing anything extra in their pay-packet  It is not right. And I’m very happy to say that in contrast - there is so much bloody loveliness coming out of the world too. Facebook groups being set up to help neighbours or vulnerable. I’m social distancing because of chemo and this week, so many people have askedwe need help. I’ve had nappies and hand gel and school books for Ivy delivered - even some flower-seeds to spread in the garden with Ivy. I’ve seen people doing shopping for others and free teaching support being offered and meals being left on doorsteps. I absolutely adore this side of the human race.  I’ve been home-schooling Ivy and although I set out to keep it as ‘schooly’ as I could, I’ve found so many fun activities to do that we both actually enjoy Pizza fractions, writing and then learning all the words to her favourite songs, writing stories and drawing together. We’ve learnt to measure out ingredients on the scales, we’ve learnt about Ireland for St Patrickaposs day and we’ve learnt about bees.There’s so much to learn from once you get going! I’ve been looking here for fun learning games and activities www.brightminds and there’s soooo much!  We’ve also bagged ourselves one of these whoopass Roccbox pizza ovens. OMG I cannot wait to give this a go. They’re portable so you can take them to the beach or the park or wherever you find yourself isolating.

Here, Dr Miriam Stoppard answers your questions on everything from self-isolating to risk groups and future plans... We are told deaths relating to coronavirus are people with underlying health problems. Can you clary what these might be  Brenda Tiley, , from Luton Underlying health problems mean any chronic medical condition such as heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, lung disease, kidney disease and liver disease. Cancer and cancer treatments like chemotherapy would also make a person vulnerable. These conditions put a strain on the immune system and make the body less resilient, so you should follow all the advice the Government has given us – e.g. self-isolating, not mixing with people, not going out and not travelling.I’m  and have had three heart attacks but feel healthy, should I self-isolate  I also had Asian flu in , will I still have the antibodies from this and will they protect me against Covid-  Frank Robinson, Swinton, Manchester Despite feeling healthy, your three heart attacks put you in the vulnerable group, so you should self-isolate. I wish I could say having Asian flu in  would protect you but I’m afraid it won’t. Each virus is specic and the only thing that would protect us is a specic vaccination for Covid-. My daughter and daughter-in-law are pregnant. Both are going to work from home but are pregnant women more at risk from this virus and are there any precautions they should be taking  Tina Wallman, , Camberley, Surrey Pregnant women are always considered a special group that requires special attention. In this outbreak, that doesn’t change. In fact, the Chief Medical Officer has put pregnant women into the “vulnerable” group, alongside older people and those that have underlying medical conditions. Soyour daughter and daughter-in-law can, I suggest they self-isolate, stay in their homes, do not mix with other people and do not go outdoors unless necessary.  I’m  with underlying health conditions and I play golf regularly. Should I carry on while avoiding physical contact with playing partners, and avoiding the bar and clubhouse  I enjoy the fresh air and exercise. Peter Sidebotham, Stalybridge, Cheshire It’s great that you play golf to keep fit butyou have underlying health conditions I wouldn’t advise you continue to play – there will always be mixing with other people and you’d be exposed to contaminated surfaces. If there’s any way you could play entirely on your own, without any contact with others, it might work. If this isn’t possible you should stop playing golf altogether for the time being. Those experiencing coronavirus symptoms, such as a cough or fever, should self-isolate for  days.You should stay at homeyou or or anyone in your household has a high temperature or a new and continuous cough - evenitaposs mild. Everyone in your household must stay at home for  days and keep away from others DO NOT go to your GP or hospital.Go to NHS.UK to check your symptoms and follow the specialist medical advice.Only call you canapost get online, you feel like you canapost cope at home, or your symptoms do not get better after the seven days. If you are pregnant you should call you have any concerns about yourself or unborn baby during self-isolation. Pregnant women are advised to contact their midwe, out-of-hours helplines or a maternity team who will provide information on whether you need to go to hospital.  I have mental health disorders including depression, as well as underlying physical health conditions. I’m worried I’ll become more depressed, anxious and vulnerableI self-isolate. Should I stop going out because of coronavirus already, and what can I doI do to help my mental health  Name withheld I’m very sympathetic but with your medical background you’d be well advised to self-isolate and put in place some things that could protect you from loneliness. First, I think you should make a resolution to Skype family or friends at least once a day. Phoning a friend a couple of times each day would help as well. Be more active on social media s and engage with your online friends. Make sure you’re eating a healthy diet, not too much coffee, no alcohol – and get a good night’s sleep.  Is delaying the spread the best policy  Won’t it just prolong people’s anxiety  Ian Mussett Delaying the spread is the strategy to take pressure off the NHS. There are downsides and you describe one of them. I don’t think anyone will relax until we hit a peak of some sort. As it happens, it might not be possible to delay the spread. The Government may have acted too late with restrictive measures. To my mind, we should be going further, as they are in France and Spain, with almost total lockdown. It worked in Wuhan and South Korea. Why aren’t we doing it  I’m  with type  diabetes and on insulin. I’ve had an aorta valve change and I’m on blood thinners. I have high blood pressure too. I’m due to look after my granddaughterher school closes but would that be wise  Alan Bebb, Runcorn, Cheshire With all your medical complaints, you’re vulnerable. I think you should be self-isolating, only going out to shop for food or get your medication. I don’t think it is a good idea to look after your granddaughter, she’ll probably be OK but she might carry the virus to you. The latest advice is not to even meet up with your family. My we and I are in our s and she has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We have a holiday booked for June . I have paid a deposit and need to pay the balance in April to keep the holiday. Should I  Graham Newnes, Rutland The NHS has stopped advising coronavirus patients to take ibuprofen amid concerns the anti-inflammatory painkiller could only make things worse. A statement read: There is currently no strong evidence that ibuprofen can make coronavirusworse. But until we have more information, take paracetamol to treat the symptoms of coronavirus, unless your doctor has told you paracetamol is not suitable for you. If you are already taking ibuprofen or another non-steroidal anti-inflammatoryon the advice of a doctor, do not stop taking it without checking first. I don’t think so. The Government’s guidelines say because of your age, you and your we fall into the vulnerable category – especially as she suffers from COPD. This means you should self-isolate, not travel and not mix with other people, like eating out in cafés and restaurants. It’s a shame but I think you’ll have to lose your deposit. I’m  and my we is  and she is susceptible to pneumonia. We’ve recently moved and don’t have any friends or relatives close by. In the case of self-isolating, we’ll have no one to help. What should we do  Roger Baber, Bideford, Devon You could stay in touch by phone, Skype, WhatsApp and social media. By doing this you speak to someone every day. You can also keep your family and friends alert to feeling unwell and they can help you get support. You or your family could phone the local council to seethere’s a service that would do your shopping. I know it’s hard because a lot of us are going to feel bereft in the coming months but we just have to do what we can. What’s the best way to help your immune system cope with the virus  Ray Baguely, , Newport There’s nothing you can do from the outside to boost your immune system. The only way would be to have a vaccination so your immune system produced antibodies specically against coronavirus. Exposure to the virus could stimulate your immune system to produce those antibodies itself.  With over-s spending more time at home, will those without access to a garden be advised to take vitamin D  Linda Rachel, , Ipswich With so little sunshine during the winter, people in the older age group are already advised to take mcg of vitamin D every day in the autumn and winter months. For people confined to their homes it’s even more important to follow this advice. My daughter is in her s and expecting her first baby mid-May.

And everyone in the UK has now been told to avoid all unnecessary social contact, travel and attending work where possible. But there does appear to be some hope on the horizon... Here are eight feel-good stories that should put a smile on your face. Robots use light beams to zap viruses In China, a robot was used to kill microbes with a zap of ultraviolet light. The incredible test took place in a mock-hospital room, which sees the self-driving machine destroy viruses, bacteria and any other microbes that damage DNA. It uses eight bulbs full of UV-C ultraviolet light, with the machines being distributed across the world - including Europe. Each robot costs , to make, and although it has not yet been proven to kill coronavirus, doctors are confident it will, reports the BBC. It take the robot around  minutes for the robot to clear the room of any viruses. China reports no new cases  On Wednesday, China reported that there have been no new cases of coronavirus for the first time since the outbreak. China has been on lockdown, meaning people can only go outside for food shopping or essential work. Businesses are rewarding NHS staff We cannot thank the NHS staff enough for their hard work during the crisis, and businesses are saying thanks you to them. Companies like Pret, Starbucks, Leon and Dominoaposs are offering the NHS discounts on lunches, hot drinks and even hair cuts just to say a massive thanks too. Air pollution has rapidly dropped As many across the world are working from home and flights being cancelled, the European Space Agencyaposs Copernicus Sentinel-P satellite estimates that the level of nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere has declined somewhere between  to  per cent in February. This is compared to previous measurements for the same month in , , and . Responses to future pandemics should improve Coronavirus has been an eye opener in terms of how healthcare systems have responded to the pandemic, so a faster global response, better and quicker distribution of testing kits, and more coordinated and coherent public messaging should be expected the next time around.

The most common symptoms of the coronavirus are: a dry, persistent cougha feverIf you experience these symptoms, you should immediately self-isolate yourself for seven days.

They adhered to strict social-distancing guidelines, sitting two metres away from people, and sanitised their hands twice during the visit. Speaking to a group of handlers, Kate said: Itaposs amazing. Youaposre doing such a great job bringing everyone together and providing that, the support system for the whole public. The Duchess wore a pink trouser suit with a white top for the visit. Prince William thanked the team on behalf of his grandmother the Queen and dad Prince Charles. He said: The last few weeks, and more recent days have been understandably concerning with the continuing spread of coronavirus. “It’s at times like this when we realise just how much the NHS represents the very best of our country and society – people from all backgrounds and walks of le with dferent experiences and skills, pulling together for the common good.  “Not only are NHS staff and emergency workers responding to the needs of the public, they – like the rest of us – are concerned about their families, friends and loved ones. “They need our support as much as we need theirs. Passing on thanks on behalf of the royal family, William daid: “That is why Catherine and I were proud to visit staff working at NHS , to pass on our personal thanks, along with those of my grandmother and father, to staff working around the clock to provide care and advice to those that need it most.  “It was also brilliant to see the great online tools for those with mild symptoms or worries. “All of us have a part to playwe’re going to protect the most vulnerable. “That means acting on the latest expert advice, staying homewe or those we live with have symptoms, and avoiding non-essential contact to help reduce the spread of the virus. At the moment the  service - which in London is run by the ambulance service - is dealing with about , calls a day across the capital.  Normally that figure would be about ,. More than % of calls are normally answered within  seconds but the unprecedented pressure on the service means most people are holding on for more than an hour. While the couple sanitised their hands twice during the visit, one member of staff forgot the new rules when she asked William and Kate for a photograph and without thinking reached out to shake their hands. “Don’t shake hands!” William remonstrated with a laugh as he brought down his other hand to cut her off.  But he swtly added as they posed for a picture: “We can do a photographwe are not within a metre of each other.” Dr Agatha Nortley-Meshe, a GP and the assistant medical director of the London Ambulance Service, told the couple the call centre had a multi-disciplinary team with GPs, pharmacists, nurses and paramedics who were working “extremely hard”.

Ingé Kirsten, from Newcastle, posted harrowing video showing her coughing while hooked up to a ventilator with a mask over her face in hospital. In another clip, the -year-old, who has a heart condition, repeatedly coughs and struggles to breathe as she begs people to self-isolate and follow social distancing guidelines. She hit out at those who are ignoring the governmentaposs Covid- advice, telling : I think it’s really bad. I don’t think people have realised how serious it is. Iaposm sure no one would want themselves or their loved ones in this position or worse. Have you been affected by the coronavirus outbreak  Email webnews@mirror. Why aren’t pubs or bars realising the impact that they are having by staying open  Why would people put their lives and others at risk  It’s bizarre to me. I think people think they’re immune to it. No one is. It’s doesn’t discriminate who it takes hold of. “And I understand people are scared and panicking buying but not sparing a thought for other is awful. I’m glad I can’t leave my house to witness it first hand. People have been leaving care packages at my door for me.I’ve seen so many lovely posts of people helping others, older people, with care packages. I shared my story as I was sick of people not taking it seriously and still putting themselves or others at risk. Hopefully they’ll be a bit more mindful now. Ingé, who works in a call centre, said doctors told her that she is likely suffering from coronavirus. She was sent home without being tested and told to stay away from others. Her -year-old daughter, Macey, and her cousin have been ordered to self-isolate away from her due to potential exposure to Covid- Ingé said: It started last Thursday, I think. The day after my birthday. I didn’t do anything on my birthday as I’ve just moved into my new house. But I slept for almost  hours and just generally felt really unwell.Then sat I started to get a sore throat and losing my voice. By Sunday afternoon I could barely breathe for coughing. I had to call  again last night and they sent an ambulance pretty quick as I couldn’t breathe for coughing. They ran some tests for blood pressure, temperature, etc but as it wasn’t bad enough to be admitted they’ve told me to carry on as I am isolating at home with the steroids and paracetamol.  Ingé desperately misses her daughter and has been trying to cope with loneliness while self-isolating. She said: It is really hard being away from Macey. She came to hospital with me and my cousin and the doctor told her to take my daughter home to her house as she cannot be around me for  days. So she’s currently at my cousinaposs home. We’ve been FaceTiming but she’s only  and missing being with me a lot.  In one of her videos, Ingé coughs repeatedly and struggles to breathe. She wheezes with every breath and holds her hand to her chest as she coughs in pain. She tells the camera: I just wanted to make a video of how bad it actually is because I know a lot of people out there donapost really believe that itaposs a serious virus or anything like that. This is me breathing. The most common symptoms of the coronavirus are: a dry, persistent cougha feverIf you experience these symptoms, you should immediately self-isolate yourself for seven days. It is not necessary to call NHS  unless your symptoms get more severe. Some patients have reported fatigue, headaches, shortness of breath and aches and pains. Sneezing is not a symptom of the coronavirus. Itaposs absolutely horrendous so any advice to those who donapost believe it or arenapost taking any safety precautions, seriously do. None of this is worth your health. In a post, she wrote: I realise that this is all a very worrying time and some people are not that concerned. I didn’t want to share my experience so publicly however people should know that this virus disease is no laughing matter. It began last week without me even realising I may have been infected. Thursday I slept for almost  hours, Saturday I started with a sore throat and began to lose my voice. For those concerned they have coronavirus in the UK, Public Health England has issued advice about how to self-isolate. . Stay at home: Donapost leave your house except when you need to seek medical care. Ask for help buying groceries or have them delivered.. Stat away from your housemates: Stick in a well-ventilated room away from others, with the door closed. Use a separate bathroom and wear a facemask when it shared areas..

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor more information on how we use your data and your data protection rights.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid Email The Government has announced a full shutdown of all schools with the exception of children of key workers as of tomorrow amid the coronavirus pandemic.This announcement came as the Education Secretary said people will be able to go to college and university without having sat GCSE or A-level exams. Gavin Williamson reiterated last nightaposs announcement that no exams will take place this academic year, before the summer term. Askedhe anticipated people still going into higher and further education without undergoing a formal exams process he told Sky: Yes, thataposs right. He added further guidance about how to do this will be published on Friday and talks with school leaders are still ongoing. The Education Secretary said there will have to be an appeals process for any pupil who feels theyaposve been wronged. The Mirror understands it is possible universities could use predicted grades,they resume as normal in September, but this is not confirmed. But what will the schools closure mean for children, parents and families Here is everything we know so far, as reported by Bristol Live.  What schools are involved  The Prime Minister made it clear that all schools would be involved in the shutdown across England, following announcements in Scotland and Wales. Mr Johnson also said that he would be aposexpectingapos childrenaposs nurseries, pre-schools, sixth-forms and colleges to also close their doors.  How long will the shutdown be for  The Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said that schools will shut their gates at the end of Friday and then be shut indefinitely - the Government are careful not to put a time frame or date on when they may reopen. When asked by journalists at the Number  briefing that happened simultaneously, Mr Johnson appeared to rebuff the suggestion, made in Wales and Ireland, that the school closures could be for as long as six months - that Friday would effectively mark the end of the school year, and the summer term after Easter would simply not happen, with schools reopening in September. He said he would hope that schools could reopen before then, but with the coronavirus pandemic rapidly spreading throughout Britain, there is no certainty at all on when they would reopen.  Who will still go to school  The Education Secretary said that schools would remain open for the children of keyworkers, to ensure that people who the country needs to continue to go to work and not worry about childcare, will be able to do so. The Prime Minister said these would be the children of NHS workers, police and emergency services personnel and aposdelivery driversapos who are critical to ensuring the continuing working of the food supply from farm to factory to shops. The Prime Minister said exactly who would be in this list would be revealed this week, before Friday - but there are no firm details as yet, on Wednesday evening.   What about grandparents  There was a specic warning from the Prime Minister that, under no circumstances, children should be now looked after by their grandparents, once they are home from school. That generation of older people are the most vulnerable to coronavirus, and the message from the scientists is that young people and the elderly should be kept apart to avoid older people catching the virus.  What should parents do  One of the key reasons why schools are now being closed is to further ensure that a partial lockdown of society happens. Parents are being asked to look after their children at home, and not leave them with grandparents, and this move is designed to increase the numbers of people who largely withdraw and remain in their homes, to stop the further spread.Most controversially, however, Boris Johnson again held back from making lockdowns and closures of businesses an order - even though all other countries in Europe are pursuing those more severe measures.  What about exams  The Prime Minister confirmed that, given schools will be closed for a considerable time and exams start in May, this yearaposs  GCSEs and A-levels would be scrapped. This does mean that exams will not take place in May and June as planned, but we will make sure that students get the exams they need and deserve, said Mr Johnson. Quite how that happens is unclear, but the most likely explanation will be some kind of grade awarded from coursework already completed, or predictive grades or grades from mock exams.  What about vulnerable children  School children who are classed as vulnerable will be still be allowed to go to school - this includes children who have an EHCP - children with special needs - and children who have a social worker or are in care.  What about Free School Meals  The Prime Minister outlined that they would be rapidly drawing up plans for a voucher scheme for children who are entitled to free school meals - but who will now not be at school to receive it each day - to get that food or support. The details of how exactly this works are yet to be revealed.

In an emotional appeal that shamed the culprits, Dawn said: “I’ve just come out of the supermarket – there’s no fruit and veg. “I had a little cry in there. I’m a critical care nurse and I’ve just finished  hours of work and I just wanted to get some stuff in for the next  hours. I just don’t know how I’m supposed to stay healthy. “Those people who are just stripping the shelves of basic foods – you need to stop it because it’s people like me that are going to be looking after you when you are at your lowest. Just stop it. Please.” Tesco has now said the hour before official opening every Sunday will be a shopping slot exclusively for NHS staff, with ID checks to keep out hoarders.  The firm said: “We know those working for the NHS may be finding it hard to find time to shop at the moment. “So from this Sunday we’re going to introduce a special hour for NHS staff as a thank you for all they are doing. All we ask is they bring ID. We will be asking all other customers to be respectful and to shop in the usual hours.” MS is setting aside its first hour on Tuesdays and Fridays “for our brilliant NHS and emergency workers”. The chain will also be asking for ID to stop stockpilers. Speaking yesterday on ITV’s This Morning Dawn, from York, said she was “overwhelmed” by the response to her plea. She said: “I understand the fear but we are not a Third World country. People need to have a bit of awareness and remember other people actually need to survive this virus.”  Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who has repeatedly tried to assure the nation there is no shops supply crisis, said: “I stand with Dawn. I think she has put it better than anybody  could. It’s vital that people act responsibly.” But the message continued to fall on deaf ears as thousands carried on stockpiling. Yesterday, we revealed how stunned shoppers branded panic-buyers “locusts” after shelves were stripped bare, sometimes in  minutes. And we told of how staff were abused over queues and purchase restrictions – while there were even reports of shoppers fighting and attacking workers. The Royal College of Nursing and Royal College of Physicians have now urged  major chains to create priority shopping times for all frontline workers. In an open letter referencing Dawn’s video, the RCN said: “Sadly, her experience is far from unique.  “Health and care professionals are faced with empty shelves. Our frontline staff ensure the health and wellbeing of our country and we must do all that we can to support them in their efforts.” Union Unison welcomed the move to help NHS staff. But chief Dave Prentis said: “The time has come for ministers to take more decisive action to avoid key workers and vulnerable people being without food. While some supermarkets must be praised for setting aside time, the initiative is patchy and doesn’t account for sht patterns. More must be done.” According to trade magazine The Grocer, we splurged £million on essentials in the first week of March – compared with £.million last year.  Profiteering off pandemic panic Shops, online retailers and eBay sellers are accused of profiteering from essentials such as toilet paper, baby milk and hand sanitiser. Some shoppers have been spotted buying vast quantities of key items, leading to fears they plan to exploit shortages to make quick profits online. One eBay seller is offering an g tub of Aptamil baby formula milk for £, when it normally retails for around £. They are also selling an “NHS-approved” ml bottle of hand sanitiser for £.. One eBay user posted: “Vile bulk buyer bumping up prices during a pandemic.” Another is selling an g tub of Cow  Gate follow-on milk for £.. One shopper said: “What kind of human being does this at a time when everyone needs to band together ” Another said: “You try to make a profit when some people can’t feed their babies.” "},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus poignant moment locals line","story":"NewsCoronavirus: Poignant moment locals line streets two metres apart for womans funeralAn entire parish paid their respects to \"beautul\" Betty Ryan by lining her final km journey to the church and singing traditional Irish song Óró, Sé do Bheatha Bhaile as the hearse passed because they could not attend her funeral in personShareCommentsByRosaleen Fenton:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsBetty and husband Denis Ryan \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

Ahead of the funeral, family friend Tor Cotton wrote: As you may know sadly Betty Ryan has died.

An emergency declaration under the National Emergencies Act unlocks sweeping presidential powers, like the ability to seize control of the internet or suspend laws, while a Stafford Act declaration deals only with FEMA.

FEMA could use that funding to help build medical facilities and transport patients, among other measures.

Speaking after completing a night sht, exhausted Mr McAinsh, who works at the Gavazzeni Hospital in Bergamo, which is only treating Covid- patients, said an endless stream of people has been arriving. As soon as one patient dies and is removed from the ward, they are immediately replaced with another one fighting for their le, he said, and burials are happening every  minutes in a local cemetery. Have you been affected by the coronavirus outbreak  Email webnews@mirror. Italy is now the worst-hit country after its death toll surpassed that of China, hitting , with more than , confirmed cases amid a nationwide lockdown. Mr McAnish told ITV News: The rate of deaths going up so high, as soon as there was a death or that we could transfer a patient from our hospital to one of the first hospitals that was taking people with infectious diseases because they had wards for that, immediately we would take in new patients. It’s just an endless stream of people coming in and as soon as we have a bed, we have a new patient coming in who needs critical care.  So it’s much less personal, there’s less of a one to one relationship with our patients now, they’ve just become, you know, numbers. Recent photos and video have shown distressing scenes in Italyaposs hospitals, with critically ill patients hooked up to machines that are keeping them alive. At the main hospital in Bergamo, footage shows patients on the apocalypse ward wearing plastic bubble helmets and gasping for air.  Medics in hazmat suits dash from patient to patient to offer help as the bubbles equalise the air pressure in the lungs. Mr McAnish said the hospital has set up a tent for the dead and there are burials every  minutes in a local cemetery. The victimsapos families are not there when they are laid to rest, and the last time they see them alive is usually when they are collected at home by ambulance, he added. The most common symptoms of the coronavirus are: a dry, persistent cougha feverIf you experience these symptoms, you should immediately self-isolate yourself for seven days. It is not necessary to call NHS  unless your symptoms get more severe. Some patients have reported fatigue, headaches, shortness of breath and aches and pains. Sneezing is not a symptom of the coronavirus. Mr McAnish has warned British medics to take the coronavirus threat seriously. Italy wasnapost ready for the pandemic, he added. The president of Lombardy said the government had agreed to deploy the army in his region to enforce the lockdown against the coronavirus epidemic, which is not slowing down. For those concerned they have coronavirus in the UK, Public Health England has issued advice about how to self-isolate. .

Desperate toto Britain, grandparents Kaye and Margaret Larbi could remain stranded in the locked-down capital of Quito for several more days or even longer after planes were grounded. Theyaposve had no luck contacting staff from Britainaposs embassy in Ecuador and havenapost been able to get answers from airline KLM as up to a million Britons are trapped abroad due to the crisis. Speaking from a hostel where other Britons are staying, Mr Larbi, from Ilford, north-east London, told : In some respects we’re probably better off here than in England. Have you been affected by coronavirus  Email webnews@mirror. We’re not short of food, there’s tons of lavatory paper. It’s just that the place is very quiet and there’s not an awful lot to do apart from read, but at least we can go into a garden [at the hostel] and the climate is sunny and warm. Mr Larbi suffers from hypertension - which makes him more vulnerable to coronavirus - and he is running out of medication. He said: I take three tablets and there are two that I can buy here. It’s not le or death, I can get by on the two.  The retired couple - Mr Larbi aged  and Mrs Larbi aged  - booked their trip in December when the new strain of potentially deadly coronavirus, known as Covid-, hadnapost yet emerged. They left London on March  and were due toon Thursday, but KLM had to cancel the flight, leaving them stranded. Hundreds of Britons are trapped in neighbouring Peru and begging the Foreign Office to send a plane to rescue them after being told they could be forced to pay more than £, to get home. Israel sent four planes to Lima to repatriate its citizens free of charge.    A Manchester woman in Lima wrote online that one airline was charging more than £, for a one-way ticket to Europe. The Foreign Office had earlier warned that Britons may be stuck in other countries during the crisis as airlines cancel flights, airports close and countries close their borders. For the Larbis, they began their trip in Quito and then moved on to Cuenca last Saturday. Mr Larbi said: When we went around the streets on the Sunday we were taken aback to see that the churches had closed and there were notices saying people could follow the mass on the radio. That was a but disconcerting. There was no sign of other measures. On the Monday we went to some thermal baths and on the way the taxi driver said he had heard that there was going to be a lockdown. The most common symptoms of the coronavirus are: a dry, persistent cougha feverIf you experience these symptoms, you should immediately self-isolate yourself for seven days. It is not necessary to call NHS  unless your symptoms get more severe. Some patients have reported fatigue, headaches, shortness of breath and aches and pains. Sneezing is not a symptom of the coronavirus. So we got him to turn around and take us to the bus terminal where he contacted officials from the bus companies. They did suspect that the government was going to order a shutdown. Taking drastic action, Ecuador closed its ports and banned all flights from Sunday to stop the spread of Covid-.  Mr Larbi said the couple watched President Lenín Morenoaposs announcement on the measures, adding: At that stage we knew the game was up, so we packed up and took our bags and caught the last bus to Quito on Monday night. It was a citizen lockdown. At their hostel in Quito, the couple have been trying to contact KLM and the UK Government to find outthey can offer any kind of assistance.  KLM told the couple to book a new flight, but that proved fruitless, they said. Mr Larbi said: We called and called and called the British embassy but could not get through at all, there’s only one line. I went to the embassy on the other side of town - itaposs not easy to get to [during the lockdown] and on their door there was a piece of paper saying staff are working remotely due to the pandemic and one should call a certain number - the same number we had called from the hostel. Outside the embassy, he met other Britons in the same predicament. Mr Larbi said: One said they had managed to contact the embassy through the phone and their advice was worse than useless - contact the travel insurers or airline.  Since the th we’ve been going on the KLM app sending messages - we’ve got nothing. Yesterday we tried the embassy again. We asked the hostelaposs receptionist to call and the line was out of order. At that point we gave up. They have contacted their MP, Wes Streeting, for help. Itaposs not all bad, however. Mr Larbi said: The weather is beautul, the hostel is great, it’s got a lovely garden. UK citizens have been told not to travel anywhere in the world for at least the next  days. The Government has changed its advice to ban all non-essential travel as it attempts to clampdown on the spread of the coronavirus. If your journey has been cancelled, check the terms and conditions of your booking or travel insurance to see what the small print says. If you have a package holiday booked and part or all of it is cancelled by the organiser airline, you must be offered a refund within  days. Some organisers are offering alternative holidays or allowing consumers to reschedule but this is not a legal remedy. If you booked a flight separately that has now been cancelled, the following rules apply:If your flight was due to depart from the United Kingdom, European Union, Iceland, Norway or Switzerland or was due to arrive in one of these countries via a UK EU airline, you should be offered a choice of three alternatives. If it was a non-EU flight, you will need to check the terms and conditions for the airline.If the FCO advises against all but essential travel to your destination and youaposre flying out from a UK airport, or ing to one, and your flight is cancelled, youaposll be entitled to a refund under a European Union regulation, called EC. Your airline will inform youthis happens, and in some cases you may be able to negotiate to postpone your flight to later in the year. Weaposve got a full guide on your coronavirus travel and refund rights, here. For coronavirus advice on school closures, sick pay, working from home and holiday or event cancellations, click here. But weaposd like to get home because we’ve got all sorts of responsibilities. People are looking after our home and our cats. As far as we know there arenapost any flights out. We’ve just got to fill in our time as best as we’re able to until we can leave. If we can we are going to go out for a walk, but I don’t think the authorities really like people walking around. There are adverts on the TV telling people to stay home.

We’re all in the same situation.“I’ve been nipping to my mum’s and using the gym to keep me occupied but I know I can’t keep doing that.“It’s the best job in the world being a footballer and when you’re not able to do it, it’s rubbish.“However, you have to realise there is a bigger picture. It’s easy to look from a selfish point of view and moan but there is a bigger issue of people’s safety and their health.”He added: “I get cabin fever at the best of times, never mind with this situation.“Anyone who knows me has been saying ‘you’ll go off your head in the house’, I always need to be doing stuff. I’ve been pottering around the house but I struggle to sit around.“I’m already missing going into Dens and seeing everyone, there’s always plenty of banter. I’d usually get a bit off Gowser so it’ll good to get a rest from him!“You think about these things but at the back of the mind you are always aware there are more important things than football, it’s about keeping things in perspective.“That might be good for me in the long-term, I would always have a bad game in my head and people would say ‘there are more important things than football’ and I can definitely see that now.”Training has been cancelled all week at Dens Park and, with no indication from the authorities of when it will be safe to restart playing, Kerr and his team-mates have had to find ways to fill their time away from the football pitch.For a young man like Kerr who is dedicated to his job and keeping himself in the best shape possible for his boyhood club, that’s not been easy and he knows it will get harder over the coming weeks as everyone gets to grips to such a massive change to normal le.The -year-old added: “My usual routine is to head to Dens early doors about am, recently I’ve been doing a bit with the physio Gerry Docherty after the problem with my knee, and start training at am till lunchtime.“Then it’s gym in the afternoon and home before maybe heading to the pool or sauna in the evening. Changing that for me has been dficult.“Since we’ve been off I’ve been getting a longer lie and going to meet up with some people.“Fin Robertson is one of the local boys so we’ve gone for coffee.“It’s the same struggles that everyone is having – going to the shops and not being able to get handwash and stuff like that.“It’s dficult to do anything really because there is nothing concrete to say when we are going to restart.”When the Dark Blues do finally get back out on the pitch, Kerr expects the good form since the start of February to continue as Dundee look to put their up-and-down start to le in the Championship behind them.“I had said from day one we had a really good group of players at the club and I don’t think it was expected we would be so inconsistent,” he added.“The boys who came in in January have all brought something and we had been doing well up until the shutdown.“We have a standard to meet every day and,we were still playing, we would expect to be getting better and better.”PODCAST: Twa Teams, One Street – What the coronavirus could mean for Dundee and Dundee United\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp podcast-twa-teams-one-street-what-the-coronavirus-could-mean-for-dundee-and-dundee-united embed # secreteTtVElWoIb\" data-secret\"eTtVElWoIb\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\""},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/thecourier/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2020/02/SNS-19831837-Dundee-v-Partick-810x564.jpg ","title":"dundee jordon forster","story":"Dundee defender Jordon Forster has opened up on the surreal nature of the football shutdown.With the sporting world brought to a halt by the coronavirus, the -year-old admits the Dee squad are stunned by the events of the past week.The   campaign was put on hold just as James McPake’s side had started to find form in the Championship.He told the Edinburgh Evening News: “We’re basically playing it by ear at the moment. We’re just taking it day by day, trying to maintain fitness and looking after ourselves as best we can.“It’s a really hard situation to explain. It doesn’t feel real.“We’ve just been told football’s now stopped and we don’t know when we’ll be playing again.“Everything’s just been shut down all of a sudden and it’s a really weird feeling. It’s not really sunk in yet.”Dundee have gone six matches unbeaten, with five consecutive clean sheets, and sit third in the table.The Dens men are just four points behind second-placed Inverness Caley Thistle, who they were due to play this weekend before the cancellations.Forster said: “The season as a whole hasn’t been good enough for us but the way things were going recently, it was starting to look positive for us with regard to hitting form in the lead-up to the play-offs.“There was a real bit of optimism building and it’s frustrating that that momentum has just been stopped with no indication of when we’re going to be able to play again, andwe are going to be able to play again this season at all.“I’m a big believer that whatever is going to be will be. You can only worry about things you can control # and this situation is definitely out with our control.”The loan signing of Scotland international Christophe Berra from Hearts has made a huge dference.Berra, , was bombed out by Daniel Stendel after the former Barnsley manager’s Tynecastle appointment in December.Forster said: “Big Christophe has done well for us. He’s got a lot of experience and he’s played at a high level so it’s good for defenders like myself to play alongside him.“You can learn loads from a guy like that. We’re similar types of players, we both like to defend first and foremost.“We pride ourselves on clean sheets and things were going reasonably well for us before the shutdown.”Forster – who was in Celtic’s academy before making the senior breakthrough at Hibs – feels he was held back by injuries in the early part of his career and he is delighted to put that frustration behind him.He said: “I feel the best I’ve ever felt physically and mentally. I take a lot of pride in my performance and I feel like over the past couple of years I’ve found a way of managing my body that works well.“I don’t think I’ve missed a game through injury for two years now so long may it continue.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united louis appere scotland u 21","story":"Dundee United manager Robbie Neilson is thrilled that Louis Appere has been called-up to the Scotland U  squad – evenit means his forward could miss a title-clinching night in Arbroath.The -year-old has enjoyed a career-transforming season after being farmed out to Broughty Athletic juniors.On histo Tannadice, the Fer took his chance in pre-season and has gone on to make  appearances, scoring six goals.Also picked by Scot Gemmill for the U s is Cha’s Billy Gilmour, who had been tipped for a senior call-up ahead of the Euro  play-off semi-final against Israel.Scotland play Croatia at Tynecastle on Friday, March , the same night that United travel to Gayfield.They then face Greece away on Tuesday, March .Neilson may also have to do without Lawrence Shankland,he keeps his place in the full squad for the Euro  play-offs.“It’s phenomenal,” said the United boss.“Louis has been brilliant.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column january 31 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsEver since it was #temporarily# closed to new admissions around two years ago, there has been the suspicion that plans were afoot to close Knapdale Ward completely.The HSCP claims to have consulted widely on the future of the ward, yet patients# relatives, front-line nurses and medical professionals say they were never asked for their views.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column february 7 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDog walkers on the banks of the Crinan Canal need to take collective responsibility for lting their canine companions# mess.There is no excuse for leaving it lying for others to tread in, push a pram through or meet while cutting grass.The bins are there, so use them.We wish Rhona Love all the best in her shooting career.

The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"ormsary man in oman endurance event","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAn Ormsary man is about to embark on the challenge of a letime as he cycles over ,km in a bid to be crowned BikingMan Oman .Lindsay McCrae, , will be one of only  cyclists to take part in BikingMan Oman, part of a series of ultra-endurance cycling events where competitors test their limits of strength and stamina.In , Lindsay bought a road bike through his employer#s cycle to work scheme and what started out as an active commute with a few local races thrown in for fun, soon became an opportunity to challenge himself in some of the toughest races on two wheels.His first big win came in the gruelling City to Summit duathlon from Edinburgh to Ben Nevis. The race was a half marathon of road running, km ride through Glen Coe then back on foot for the final off-road marathon summitting Ben Nevis and finishing in Fort William.Bitten by the cycling bug, he went on to win Revolve  at Brands Hatch race circuit, completing  miles and ascending , feet in  hours. Adding a second-place finish in last year#s BikingMan Portugal event against some of the sport#s top athletes means Lindsay has truly made his mark on the endurance scene.Lindsay said: #In my first few races I just wanted to see how I would get on but now I#m definitely in it to win it. I think I#m just stubborn and that#s what keeps me pushing on when other people take rest breaks.#Lindsay, who works in sales technical support for an aquaculture equipment company in Inverness, fits his training around his job, spending one to two hours on a turbo in his garage three or four times a week, with longer rides of two to five hours at the weekends. His father#s greenhouse in Ardrishaig proved to be a useful training venue to shelter from the elements over the Christmas holidays as he prepared for his biggest challenge yet.The BikingMan Oman race starts in Muscat, Oman#s capital city, before heading out on the Arabian Peninsula, through the Hajar Mountains, across the Ash Sharqiyah Desert and along coastal roads back to the capital. The competitors will climb over m during the race, that#s the equivalent of climbing Ben Nevis almost seven times.Unlike cyclists on the Tour de France, BikingMan athletes are unsupported so must carry all their food and equipment with them.For Lindsay, one of the biggest challenges will be the weather. #Temperatures at the moment are around - degrees but can reach higher which can be dficult to manage on the steeper sections of the course. That#s where my nutrition and hydration strategy will need to be spot on.#But in case it all sounds like hard work, Lindsay highlights one of the main benefits of his high-octane adventures: #The best part is definitely refuelling after the race. I will burn about , calories over the -hours of my target time, so my recovery will mainly involve eating cakes and other calorie rich foods.#Lindsay grew up on the Ormsary Estate and attended Lochgilphead High School. His family still live in the local area and will be following his adventures closely over the five days of competition.The race takes place from February  to  and Lindsay will cover ,km in a bid to take the title."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Keith Mitchell picked up the ball on the left and released McFadyen down the left flank, from where he produced a fine low cross which substitute Donald McCallum struck low into the Neilston net with his left foot to make it -.But with some  minutes to play and the Pupils cruising, Neilston halved the deficit, a visiting striker gambling on Ferguson’s kick, and blocking it, the resulting break of the ball landing in his path for an easy finish, providing a leline to the men from East Renfrewshire.But their hopes of an equaliser would quickly fade, after a Neilston player-coach – already booked on the touchline for dissent ­– was sent off for a foul on Mitchell within a minute of entering the field of play.The same player then proceeded to throw a running punch as he left the field, before both teams became embroiled in an on-pitch melee.After the fisticuffs fizzled out, the game of football resumed and a healthy Kintyre Park crowd watched a settled final  minutes of action as the Pupils did enough to seal a welcome three points, over the team they had beaten on the road in front of the BBC Scotland cameras a month previously.Finally, midfielder Ryan Gilchrist, enjoying a regularto first-team action, was given the man-of-the-match award, with the creative energy of McFadyen another highlight for the Pupils.Tomorrowthe Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils travel to Busby on league duty, with kick-off at pm.

He put them in his pockets and went on his way.But that evening, the child who had given the apples to the traveller was chastised by her parents. ldquoWhy did you do that  Now that man will come back with his family and take our apples.ldquoBut the tree gives us more apples than we can eat, the girl said, ldquosurely a few can be shared with people outside the village. Besides, the tree is by the side of the road, arenrsquot the apples for everyone, thatrsquos what yoursquove always said ldquoYes, they are for everyone, her father replied, ldquobut not just for anyone.His daughter was confused by this answer she didnrsquot understand what it meant. However, it seemed such a small and unimportant issue that she said nothing more of it. She knew that there would be more than enough apples for everyone, and even anyone.A few days later, when the girlrsquos grandmother went to collect ripe apples for a pie, she met the stranger with his we and two children. They had a small basket full of apples. The family were friendly and greeted the grandmother, but she ed a forced smile. She quickly collected her apples and rushed home.She told about the strangerrsquos family collecting the apples and the girlrsquos father was angry.ldquoSee, he said to his daughter, ldquoI told you they were not for just anyone. Now there will be none left for everyone .But his daughter was still confused. There were always many hundreds of apples. ldquoYou are young and donrsquot understand, he said. ldquoTomorrow we will get up early and make sure we can collect our share of the apples.The following day the family were up at the crack of dawn. They took all the baskets they could and went to the apple tree. Their neighbours peered out of the window, wondering what the family were doing.Then they saw them at the apple tree, filling many baskets of ripe apples. Later in the morning, some children from the village joined them.One of them went to pick up an apple that had just fallen. But the grandmother rushed and snatched it first and put it in her basket. So the child just smiled and gently shook a branch and another fell.When the familyrsquos baskets were full, they carried them back to the house. But it took them three trips, and the father left his daughter to guard the full baskets while he and the rest of the family carried as much they could.ldquoWhy are you collecting so many apples at once  asked one of her friends.The young girl nibbled her lip and looked at the ground. ldquoDonrsquot know really. My father says Irsquom too young to understand, but he says the apples are for everyone but not just anyone.ldquoWhorsquos anyone then She looked up and shook her head: ldquoNot sure, but anyone is taking our apples so we have to get them first.When the children of the village ed home with their apples, they told their parents what had happened.ldquoAnyone is taking our apples, so there will not be enough for everyone.The next day, more families got up early and set off for the apple tree.This time, the apple picking was very dferent to the way it had always been. In the past, people would pick the apples with each other, because everyone knew there was enough to go round. This time they were picking them for themselves.Fights started and people began to pull apples that were not ripe. So many people climbed onto the branches to get the apples that the tree started to creak.Soon, not a single apple remained on the tree. For the first time ever, there were none left for the animals or insects. Some peoplersquos homes were so full of apples that they hardly had room to move inside the house.Other people, who were not quick enough, had no apples at all. Some of these were people who really needed the apples. But those who had many wouldnrsquot share them for fear that anyone would get them.The houses of the people who collected more apples than they needed became full of fruit flies and other insects as their piles of apples began to rot.But the next year, everyone was ready. They had made big baskets and were determined not to miss out. But when they arrived at the tree it was surrounded by a hastily built wall with a guard at the gate.ldquoWho has done this  they cried.It was the king. He had heard of the apple tree and how crisp and sweet the apples were, so much so that people would fight and hoard the fruit. So, as the richest and most powerful man in the kingdom, he decided he would make sure the apples graced his table.ldquoBut there are more apples than the king can eat! protested the people.ldquoIndeed, said the guard ldquoand the King is generous. He will sell you the apples he does not need.ldquoSell them  But the apples have always been free for everyone!ldquoNot any more, said the guard.The young girl went up to her father. ldquoNow I understand, she said, ldquoanyone is the king."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-gp-practices-east-lothian-introduce-new-measures","story":"North Berwick Health Centre has announced that none of its registered patients have tested positive for coronavirus and asked that people phone the Edington Hospital in advance before paying it a visit.Those who think they have been in contact with someone with the virus are asked to not visit the surgery and phone  for advice.From Monday , all GP and advanced nurse practitionerappointment requests will be triagedby phone call.Lammermuir Medical Practice in Haddington has also taken this approach.People who call either practice will be asked for a summary of their symptoms, information about recent travel andthey have been in direct contact with a person that has been tested positive for coronavirus.The inidualrsquos GP will thenthe call anddeemed safe and necessary, they will then be given an appointment for that afternoon.Those with pre-booked appointments with a GP will be contacted by the health centre to discuss arrangements.North Berwick Health Centre has removed its self check in service -people now have to check in with a receptionist.It has also launched a new online prescription ordering service, those not registered can visit northberwickhealthcentre.scot.nhs.uk news,.htm, download a form, fill it in and hand it in.Lammermuir Medical Practice has also disabled its online appointment service.Tranent Medical Practice has made its surgery pod, a self-service device that allows patients to get their weight and blood pressure checked, unavailable for use.Those with routine appointments at Harbours Medical Practice in Cockenzie are asked to phone the practice, pressing option two, as it is making changes to its routine appointment system.It has also asked that people with symptoms, those who have had contact with an infected person or those who have been in an affected place to not enter any of its buildings.Prestonpans Group Practice has also given this advice and asked that evenpeople have mild symptoms they should not visit the surgery.Meanwhile, Orchard Medical Practice in Haddington is asking all patients not to attend the practice but instead to phone to request an appointment.

At a crucial time in the survival of the language, graduates have helped create a Gaelic speaking workforce that now holds key posts across a wide range of sectors in Scotland.Sabhal Mograver Ostaig is one of the key partners in fulfilling the governmentrsquos objectives in the National Gaelic Plan, which aims to increase the number of people speaking the language and accelerate the growth of Gaelic.Many people are keen to learn more about the language because of its rich culture and the college provides a wide range of short courses in Gaelic language, song and traditional music. Ceilidhs, workshops, conversation circles and music sessions all create an encouraging atmosphere that bring together students from  countries across five continents.As a modern, innovative college, Sabhal Mograver Ostaig has excellent learning resources on campus including an exceptional library collection, residential student accommodation, broadcast and recording facilities and a Gaelic medium childcare facility on site. It also has a growing international reputation for academic research.The college was founded on the principle of being part of the local and wider community and its activities are greatly enhanced by co-operative links, being home to a number of signicant national creative and cultural projects such as Tobar an Dualchais, Ainmean Agraveite na h-Alba and Cagravenan Graphics Studio. It plays a leading role in the promotion of the Gaelic arts and culture and also offers an international exchange programme with universities in Canada and Ireland.The collegersquos graduates include Seumas Greumach , Chief Executive of An Comunn Gaidhealach, which runs the Royal National Mod, who studied the Cugraversa Comais in  and then ed for another year to study Cagravenan is Cultar na Gagraveidhlig.

Countries with a more dirigiste approach, like France, and outright authoritarians, like China, are taking the lead with hyper-lockdown backed by fines and riot police and sweetened by bold promises that firms and workers will not lose out.Whether that is possible or just vain-glorious hot air from the Elyseacutee Palace remains to be seen. The Scandinavians are taking a typically communitarian approach and promising people that the state will provide calibrated compensation to bolster incomes. But their social safety net was anyway far more generous than in neoliberal Britain.We have the lowest pensions, the lowest sick pay, the most miserly unemployment benefit and income support. And still millions are unable to access it in the gig economy or because they earn too little. Britain after a decade of austerity is a low-wage, low-security economy, and that isnrsquot going to change overnight. Or could it The country will have to be mobilised as in a war. The Second World War was actually very good for the economy ndash or at least good for GDP. The United States turned industry into a weapons-making machine of unprecedented productive power. The Arsenal of Democracy turned out hundreds of warships, thousands of tanks and bombers, millions of guns, billions of pieces of ammunition.Wages and profits soared during the war economy in America and in those parts of the world not actually devastated by the fighting. It was war production that finally brought the Great Depression to an end. Indeed, it arguably laid the groundwork for the next  years of global economic growth.Full employment became the default policy for western governments. John Maynard Keynes was vindicated. We had the NHS, welfare, mass consumerism. Then came inflation, globalisation, neoliberalism and the financial crisis.After , the Government and the Bank of England mobilised some pound. trillion to stave off a collapse of the financial system. That was a very crude way of dealing with the crisis and created moral hazard by rewarding bankers for their reckless greed.But that isnrsquot going to work this time, evenwe wanted it to. The banking system is not the epicentre of this crisis. And the inconvenient truth is that the Covid- crisis is not going to be like the Second World War.Battleships and Sherman tanks are useless against an enemy like a virus. We can produce respirators and intensive care units in large numbers and probably quite quickly ndash quicker than many people seem to believe. But that is not going to make the economy boom.The coronavirus economy is more like the Great Depression, when millions were out of work, demand dried up in the shops, the economy went into a deflationary spiral and even loose credit and money-printing become pointless. Put simply:no one has any money to buy stuff, stuff doesnrsquot get made. Money needs to get into peoplersquos pockets, and fast. What we did for the banks in  we must now do for people.However,you simply throw printed money at a situation like this, the danger is that we will end up with what they have in Zimbabwe: hyperinflation. So we are going to have to create a simulacrum of a war economy. People will have to be remunerated for the socially responsible task of staying at home for the duration.This is a bit like Universal Basic Income, only more so. The trouble with UBI, advocated by right-wing economists like Milton Friedman, in Capitalism and Freedom, and sponsored by tech billionaires today, is that it is essentially universal basic poverty. The sums talked about in the UK, or deployed in the experiments such as in Finland, are nugatory ndash around pound a month. That is too little either to keep body and soul together or provide effective demand in the economy.What we need is more like Universal Average Income. People will need to have something approaching their remuneration pre-Covid to stop them going into spontaneous spending lockdown. If that happens, the demand shock across the economy ndash and itrsquos already happening to airlines, restaurants and hotels ndash could destroy the economy within a couple of months.The good news is that ndash unlike the Second World War ndash we do know who is going to win in the war against Covid , and we know it will not last for many years. Around  per cent of us will get it the vast majority will be fine and the epidemic should be over in  months at the most. We didnrsquot know that about Hitler.In the aftermath, the Government might also have to consider job creation on an industrial scale. One way would be to go with the flow and recruit redundant service workers into the caring professions. The Government could create a kind of National Social Care Service to parallel the NHS. People could retrain as psychologists to treat the growing problem of mental illness.In the s, Franklin D Rooseveltrsquos New Deal measures to combat depression, economic and psychological, included investment in the arts. Unemployed writers, artists and performers were put to work by the Federal Arts Project to improve the quality of le. That gave us Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, Orson Welles, John Housman. The arts may seem low on the priority list, set against food supplies and the health service, but it would be a tragedytheatres closed and talent went to waste.We need something to elevate the spirit. There is a serious risk that with the malign effect of social media, people are going to be subject to waves of paranoia, fear and depression. I feel it myself. We live in a spiritually-deprived culture where we are not accustomed to living with death. The churches were where people turned in moments of crisis in the past.

Onlookers cheered as she was led away in cuffs. You have to find entertainment where you can these days.Which brings us to a documentary on BBC last night. Taking Control: The Dominic Cummings Story, was a look at Boris Johnsonrsquos chief aide by Emily Maitlis. Quite the accolade. An hour-long film in a prime time slot by the slayer of Prince Andrew. Must be a very important chap.You would think so by the talking heads asked to sum Mr Cummings up in a word. Determined, said one. Challenging, said another. Unreasonable. Renaissance man. A myth maker. Unpleasant. Genius. Dangerous.: Johnson promises help for rentersThe producers had even dug up Peter Mandelson, who was once to Labour premiers what Mr Cummings is supposed to be to Boris Johnson, but with infinitely better clothes. ldquoHe could just completely blow himself up, purred the Labour lord as he stroked an invisible white cat, ldquobuthe doesnrsquot hersquos going to be a very signicant figure over the course of the next ten years.While a familiar canter through the Cummingsrsquo cv, starting with his work on the Nocampaign, and taking the story through to Vote Leave, Brexit and into Number , it was worth watchingonly for Maitlisrsquos interview with Colin Perry, who told of his now famous encounter with Mr Cummings decades ago.During a heated discussion on  Live, Mr Perry, chair of the CBIrsquos small business council at the time, called Mr Cummings ldquoa young politician on the make. Their spot over, Mr Perry said he was walking down the stairs from the studio when he felt Mr Cummingsrsquo hands on his shoulders. ldquoHe was trying to push me down the steps, he claimed. At the bottom of the stairs he said he turned to confront Mr Cummings only for the younger man to seize him by the tie, push him against the wall and raise his fist. Mr Cummings said they had merely stumbled into each other.: Holyrood spring conferences axedThe programme asked what Mr Cummingsrsquo ldquoextraordinary rise told us about how politics was changing. Its central idea was that he was among the first to detect and then ride the wave of populism that led, among other things, to Brexit and the election of Boris Johnson. Scotland played a part in this tale in as much as Mr Cummings, then working for Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith, suggested his boss visit Easterhouse in a bold move to show how the party had changed. Easterhouse, then, was the early prototype for the ldquored wall that delivered a huge majority for Mr Johnson in .Going back to those one word assessments of Mr Cummings, Irsquom with the journalist Peter Obone who described him as ldquodull. It is hard to take seriously the idea of Mr Cummings as a genius, the sage of Downing Street, in large part because he has committed the most basic error of any adviser and become the story. Being visible, he is expendable.Moreover, one cannot help thinking thathe was that smart he would be in Boris Johnsonrsquos job and have a lackey of his own. Mr Cummings is not the messiah. Hersquos not even an especially naughty boy . He just happens to be the latest catnip mouse for the media to play with till it gets bored.: Schools to close by end of weekThe main feeling on watching Maitlisrsquos documentary was that the concerns it highlighted were dated and irrelevant. Not so much five minutes ago as five months. Much has been made of how the coronavirus crisis is changing our lives and will have a long term impact in ways we have yet to fully appreciate. I donrsquot know. The triumph and tragedy of humans is that fundamentally we do not change that much. Capable of great kindness and empathy, as in the many people who are volunteering to help others, they can also be the same grubby, panic-buying shower to be seen in every supermarket.That said, the crisis is having an impact on politics. I donrsquot mean the suspension of party hostilities. That will not last. As yesterdayrsquos PMQs showed, there is growing pressure on the UK government to help the poorest and most vulnerable to the same extent that it is aiding business.The crisis is, however, shaping the way Mr Johnson does political business, from the new ministerial structures and implementation committees to the daily televised press briefing. I would not be surprisedthese White House-style events became permanent fixtures, like televised debates during elections, in London and Edinburgh. Any chance to hold governments to account is good for democracy.One way and another, the man who a couple of weeks ago was being slated by critics as a part-time Prime Minister is putting in quite the sht.So, too, is Nicola Sturgeon, and though it is hardly a competition she is coming out of the process better. All over the world the virus crisis is testing leaders and governments as never before. Whatrsquos that Warren Buffett quote  ldquoOnly when the tide goes out do you discover whorsquos been swimming naked.Thus we have the so-called strongmen of politics, from the US president down, exposed as vacillating and unconvincing. The most prized government commodity today is trust, and we can see who inspires it and who does not. Mr Johnson is beginning to look tired and bowed. If this crisis does prove to be a marathon not a sprint he needs to pace himself.If the past weeks show anything about politics it is that in times of stre people still look to inidual leaders for guidance. No-one ever responded to a crisis by saying, ldquoSend for the PMrsquos chief aide. That reliance on leaders is fine, as long as the right man or woman is in the job.From Edinburgh, London and Paris to Tehran, Washington and further afield, we will soon see the proof of that."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-positive-cases-covid-19-say-symptoms-start-simple-sore-throat---people-can-recover","story":"The virus has so far infected  people in Scotland, and , in the UK.Some nurses have blasted the attitudes by people across the country who are ignoring government advice and continuing to attend pubs, clubs, and not work from home when they are able to.Now, those who have tested positive have begun sharing their journey to diagnosis to remind people of the symptoms that may not appear early on.One man, who wishes to remain anonymous, has been in self-isolation since Monday, March , and is concerned about complacency.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Which surfaces are spreading Covid- \",\"description\": \"Which surfaces are spreading Covid- \",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media zTzISD poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests zTzISD.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": :Dominic Raab warns COP climate summit in Glasgow could be postponed\"I am a group three patient, the only symptoms I had was a cough and a slight shortness of breath,\" he told the Basingstoke Gazette.\"I am a -year-old healthy person.

Where services are completely suspended, a full refund will be applicable.Mr Hinkles continued: “I would strongly advise our affected customers to manage their booking through our website as we are experiencing exceptionally high call volumes into our call centre.“The situation is incredibly serious and alongside the obvious health and safety implications, puts the future of the entire aviation industry in jeopardy.#With this in mind, we have joined with other UK carriers to seek emergency measures from the Government to support all airlines in the sector.”Hinkles revealed that Loganair staff have been asked to consider a series of measures aimed at protecting employment levels — including reducing working hours by  per cent and accepting a  per cent reduction in salary as a result or taking a period of unpaid leave.He said: “We are working hard to avoid redundancies and lay-offs as have already been seen at major international airlines and as are likely to follow at several UK airlines in the coming days.”It is expected that a quarter of Loganair’s fleet of  aircraft will be put into temporary storage as a result of the schedule reductions.Full details of how to manage your booking are available on its website at www.loganair.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Dima is in the Ethiopian regional state of Oromia, the homeland of the Oromo people: a large minority ethnic group who have been subject to political oppression, cultural suppression and the victims of internment and state violence. He had been taking part in a student protest at the technical college where he was studying electrical engineering, carrying a placard that read Stop Killing Oromo People, when the military arrived and opened fire on the protest group.

He claimed asylum, but refugee status and the stability that comes with it has not yet been granted.All of this was written in a statement he’d made for the Home Office through an interpreter. It will form part of his application to be granted five years leave to remain. He sat in silence as I read it all in a coffee shop on the Ormeau Road along with our running coach at Annadale Striders, Michael McKnight. We had gotten to know Eskander well in the preceding year and his positivity and enthusiasm for running had won us over. The scale of the horror he’d been through was until then unknown to us. After he arrived in Ireland, a doctor in the south suggested that running would be a good way of helping to manage the trauma of his experiences, and he was a natural.“I ran my first race on St Patrick’s Day, , in Dublin, with no training,” he told me, “and I ran eighteen minutes for k. I wore thin shoes from Lidl.”He was a natural and he stepped up his training while living in Monaghan, winning many races, and the medals and trophies he won adorn his bedside table in his small room in Stranmillis, along with newspaper cuttings about his athletic achievements. His dedication to running is unwavering, and to those who know his story his successes have been inspirational. He has been on the podium of many road races in the north, including the Laganside k and the Armagh International k, and has matched the course record time at Ormeau Parkrun. The week after he matched the record, dragging me along with him to a personal best of under sixteen minutes, the two of us ed and he was treated like a celebrity: I was approached by several people excitedly asking “do you think Eskander can break the record this time ”For all his talent on the road, it’s cross-country racing where he really shines. At the McConnell Shield race in Ballyclare, one of the north’s oldest and most prestigious races, he put in a stellar performance against some of our best runners. When I crossed the line at that race, Paul Lawther, an original Annadale Strider, and a one-time NI record holder at every distance from m to ,m, immediately said to me with sheer delight: “Did you see what Eskander just did ” He had put a ten second gap on the field in the last four hundred metres, beating two Northern Ireland international athletes. Recently, he finished in second place overall at the prestigious NI and Ulster Senior Cross- Country Championship.It would appear that this is barely scraping the surface of his potential. Michael McKnight has talked with Athletics NI officials about Eskander’s talents and the international representation that could easily follow. Eskander himself dreams of running for Ireland at the European Cross-Country Championships.“I want to make a story for Belfast, for athletics and for Ireland,” he told me.For any of that to happen he needs to negotiate the dficult process of gaining refugee status. He often jokes with me that next year he’s “going to Kenya to train withEliud Kipchoge”, but when it comes down to it he says that what he really wants is “independence and safety, to be free from distress and to be able to breathe in peace again”.Eskander’s gentle manner belies the deep effects of the events of the last decade, of the toll they have taken on his body and mind. He tells me that he continues to require medication to manage the effects of the trauma, to cope with depression and to allow him to sleep. He feels that this is his last chance to make a le for himself he is committed to studying several days each week in Belfast Met, developing his spoken and written English. He tells me that he cherishes his friends and the sense of community he has found in Belfast, that he has been accepted to continue with his study of electrical engineering that was ended abruptly at the time of his imprisonment, but it depends on the Home Office’s decision. He tells me with increasing desperation that he hopes the Home Office will give him another chance at le."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/a81a8305-8941-4184-938b-d8cf49594400-e1584361711502.png","title":"keep the virtual presses rolling by subscribing to our e papers","story":"OVER the coming weeks, as the Coronavirus crisis most likely deepens, our priority will be to ensure our communities stay safe and healthy.As newspapers based in the heart of vibrant communities on both sides of the Atlantic, we recognise our special role in providing a measured, vital news service to our readers.We also have an obligation to bolster small businesses — the advertising backbone of our papers — who face uncertain times.Already many of those small businesses have either signicantly reduced their operations or, in the case of many entertainment venues, closed their doors for at least two weeks.That in turn will mean a precipitous drop in the display advertising revenues we depend on to keep thepresses rolling, pay staff and meet our overheads.One way in which you can support our teams is by taking out a subscription to our epapers.

Mental health charity Mind says you can still get outside and benefit from fresh air and the natural environment while minimising your risk of catching the virus.. BirdwatchingBirdwatching is a good way to get out in the fresh air and interact with nature, says Phil Carson, policy officer for sustainable farming with the RSPB.I think it#s a good thing to do because you get away to quieten your mind and it#s quite a mindful activity. It allows you to tune out, appreciate the things that are around you and focus on something that isn#t on TV or negative news, he explains.If you#re going to a shoreline or estuary, you can still see some of the wintering waders and wildfowl.You can see curlew along the shoreline, which is pretty brilliant to look at, and there are redshank, another iconic bird,you are around Belfast Lough.Coming into spring,you are in woodland you#re starting to see migrant species coming back, such as the chfchaff, a warbler from northern Africa which is starting to make its way through.Rewarding places to birdwatch include the RSPB#s Portmore Lough nature reserve which has plenty of wide open spaces where you can stay clear of other people while getting your wildle fix.Some of the waders are coming into breed there at the moment - you could see little grebe along the lake shore, reed bunting in amongst the reeds and wigeon and teal as well.Anywhere that has woodland would be quite interesting this time of year, such as Belvoir Forest or the woodlands in the Glens of Antrim are always pretty good, Phil adds..

You can go it alone with the One You Couch to K app, which gives you a choice of coaches and helps you track your progress.. ArtDrawing or painting can be a great way to connect with nature without stomping through miles of mud.Artist blogger Ella Masters advises bringing a small sketchbook and using drawing materials that dry quickly, such as pencils, pastels or thin layers of watercolours.. Tai chiWe#ve all seen footage of people in China outside in parks performing the elegant moves of tai chi.Bangor-born Tai Chi teacher Michele Gibsonsays: Normally we do our classes indoors because the weather in Northern Ireland is not generally very suitable, but it can be practised outside - in China they do it outside all the time.But you can do it in snow as long as you#re well wrapped up - you can do it outside at any time.Michele says Tai Chi is a series of exercises that work on dferent parts of the body.They tend to be breathing exercises as well as movement. The movements are aerobic without being like an aerobics class, so they#re good for your heart and lungs in a very gentle way, she says.Tai chi is good for high blood pressure. It massages all your internal organs and it#s very good for your balance.It#s good for your muscles and tendons, keeping them strong and keeping your bones healthy. It#s an all-round good exercise which can be done by anybody. It can even be done sitting down, although it#s mostly done standing.I would recommend it to anybody who feels they need a little exercise but doesn#t want to pound it out in the gym. It#s not overly taxing. If you get up sore the next day you are not doing it right.. Go on a picnicThere#s nothing stopping you from wrapping up in a warm coat and hat, filling a thermos of hot tea and talking yourself up to the top of a mountain.There are loads of places off the beaten track for a picnic with a view, from Divis Mountain and Cregagh Glen to the rugged Kearney coastal walk on the Ards peninsula..

It was bizarre... my le seems to be shaped by geopolitical disasters.About nine months ago, his team at Boston Children#s Hospital received a €m federal government grant to help develop an influenza vaccine for elderly people and children.However, the Co Wicklow man had been keeping a close watch on coronavirus developments in China, and three months ago his team got government approval to turn it into a dual project.There are now dozens of projects worldwide working around the clock to create a coronavirus vaccine, but Dr Dowling is co-leading a project which is specically targeting the most vulnerable in society - the elderly.Older people and those with pre-existing medical conditions are more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with Covid-, according to the World Health Organisation.Together with Dr Ofer Levy, director of the precision vaccines programme at the hospital, Dr Dowling is designing a coronavirus vaccine that uses special molecules to boost the immune system.The coronavirus gets its name because each cell is covered with spiky formations that make it look like a crown, or in Latin #corona#. These are called spike proteins.The vaccine will use the virus#s spike protein along with known vaccine adjuvants - small molecules that increase a patient#s immune response.He and Dr Levy#s team have taken blood samples from patients aged between  and , are separating their white blood cells and testing dferent adjuvants to see which work best.The unique vaccine will build on vaccines from prior coronavirus outbreaks and work to make them more effective.I reached out to Dr Peter Hotez at Texas Children#s Hospital and we got his Sars antigen from the  outbreak, Dr Dowling said.He made a vaccine and never got it all the way into clinical trials and ran out of funding as it [Sars] wasn#t an issue any more.So using the current Sars vaccine and mixing it with our best adjuvant, we hope it can make a dference.As for a timeline on when the vaccine may be ready, Dr Dowling says it largely depends on funding.I spent  hours filling out a grant application for this coronavirus project, when that time could be spent far more practically, he said.Dr Dowling thinks developing a vaccine is imperative, as he believes coronavirus could become a seasonal virus.I do believe that it may have been circulating for a long time and has only come to the forefront now, he said.Right now we are heading towards the peak of it, people are social distancing and we#ll see it relax coming into summer, but there is a distinct possibility it could come back again in winter.That#s why we have to keep working and can#t take time off. I have great confidence in my colleagues and the US government that we can push through to develop a vaccine.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.RegisterAlready have an account Log in Independent.ie  Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland d .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bbf--de-af-dafc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland d .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bbf--de-af-dafc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland d .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bbf--de-af-dafc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland d .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bbf--de-af-dafc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland d .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bbf--de-af-dafc_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Republic of IrelandHealth chief says Covid- war ‘can be won with communities’Health Service Executive chief Paul Reid has said the country faces into a “an uncertain, unprecedented and unpredictable” time during the Covid- pandemic.,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We simply have to. Lives depend on it and that message has to get through.That#s why Retail NI will be asking the Executive to set up a specic website and social media channel to make sure the correct and relevant advice is there for all.At the minute advice is coming from all dferent departments and there#s so much out there that#s irrelevant or wrong.

We have those who are working in the retail trade, the people serving us in shops to think of as well.They are providing an invaluable service by remaining open and we owe it to them all to abide by the rules as much as we possibly can.The Public Health Agency also warned of the threat posed by Covid-the social distancing guidelines are not followed.Dr Van Woerden said: We understand that this will be dficult, particularly with Mother#s Day this weekend for example, so it is worth looking at keeping in touch using your phone, the internet and social media.If you are outdoors, stay more than two metres away from others.As part of the effort to reduce the spread, only use the phone or online facilities to contact your GP or other essential services.We strongly advise you to follow the measures as much as you can and to signicantly limit your face-to-face interaction with friends and familypossible, particularlyyou are over , have an underlying health condition or are pregnant.Scientists said social measures will need to be in place for most of a year at least in order to control the spread of Covid-.The Scientic Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling agreed on Monday that, while the severity of measures could alternate during the period, stricter measures would need to be enforced for at least half of the year to keep cases at a level the NHS can cope with.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadCoronavirus: Ballyclare businessman stranded at South Africa airport after visa restrictions Coronavirus: We need clarity, says Belfast gym owner as she closes upBallycastle is best place to live in Northern Ireland, claims guideKincora files destroyed as institutional abuse inquiry was set in motionDeath of Northern Ireland man on honeymoon in Las Vegas was drugs-related ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I#m going to assume that means you should closeyou have a business like ours but he doesn#t want to say it because I think that means that they will have to up their compensation.The right thing to do is to close to protect the public but everyone is reluctant to do so because we#re not sure what funding we#re going to get,any.Mrs Rea, who is six months pregnant, feels the Government#s advice to those who are expecting a child - to remain home for the next  weeks - is just not feasible.She felt thatshe decided to follow that advice and stay indoors for three months, her business could close permanently.We would be finished because by that stage, and okay, we will have clients who willto us, but we would have to start again by building our reputation and everything, she stressed.As part of Stormont#s Covid- package of measures to delay the spread, Finance Minister Conor Murphy announced an emergency £m rates package to assist businesses. But Mrs Rea doesn#t believe that will do any good.Our rent is almost £, a month but the rates aren#t anywhere near that so deferring a rate payment is really just the tip of the iceberg, she commented.Gym owners across Northern Ireland are now deciding whether to close their doors to protect the public or remain open for a source of income. And while Think Fit is a small one-to-one gym, Mrs Rea sympathised with those in the same position as her and her staff.It#s a really, really tough call because you#re being asked by the Government to choose which to prioritise, the health of the public or you and your livelihood, she said.That#s a really tough call to make because of course you want to say: #Yes I care about public health more than anything #. But how can you say that  It would mean that caring about the public health is going to potentially bankrupt you.We#re in a better position than bigger gyms [in terms of cleanliness] but we#re in a worse position financially because bigger gyms rely mainly on monthly payments coming in for people using the gym.We#re relying on people paying for a block of sessions which no one has been buying in the last  days because they don#t know when they#re going to be able to use them.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadCoronavirus: Ballyclare businessman stranded at South Africa airport after visa restrictions Coronavirus: We need clarity, says Belfast gym owner as she closes upBallycastle is best place to live in Northern Ireland, claims guideKincora files destroyed as institutional abuse inquiry was set in motionDeath of Northern Ireland man on honeymoon in Las Vegas was drugs-related ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In an interview with OK! magazine ahead of Mother#s Day tomorrow, the Derry popstaralso refused to rule out a Girls Aloud reunion. Nadine, who is mum to six-year-old Anaiya, said: Being a mum is the most important role in my le, Anaiya is just like me when I was her age.Last year Nadine finished in fth place on I#m A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! and has also released a new single, All That I Know.When askedshe was always meant to be a mum, Nadine said: Definitely. Before I was in Girls Aloud, I wanted to be a nanny. But then Girls Aloud started and that ruined that dream!She spoke of how she hopes Anaiya might one day follow in her musical footsteps. She says she#d like to be a singer when she#s older and I can see her being an opera singer as she has an operatic voice.Nadine also appeared to rule out a sibling for her daughter. Right after I had Anaiya, I definitely wanted more kids. I was like: #I think I could do this professionally#. Because I loved being pregnant so much. I used to love watching that programme  Kids And Counting and I thought I might just keep going and have  kids myself. I had these big plans to home-school them all and I even wanted to be a surrogate as well. But then the reality set in after being up all night, and I was like: #Okay, maybe not #.Last September Nadine and boyfriend Jason Bell announced their split after  years together.She and the American football star, who is Anaiya#s father, reportedly ended their relationship after they realised they were leading increasingly separate lives.Nadine started dating Bellin  when she moved to America to pursue her singing career. The pair were briefly engaged between  and , but split for a short period before reuniting in  and later welcoming Anaiya in early .Despite the split Nadine says the pair still have a great relationship.It#s really good. Co-parenting is working really well for us as we always put Anaiya first. Jason moved over here, too, when I moved back from LA, and he lives up the road. We still do lots of things together, we even go away together. Our relationship evolved into a friendship, but he#s definitely part of the family and always will be, she added. While remaining tight-lipped on whether she is dating anyone at the moment, Nadine has ruled out walking down the aisle in the future: I have been on Tinder in the past. I was trying to get some of my single girlfriends to go on it and they were like: #Why don#t you do it#  So I did and it was quite fun. I ended up arranging to meet this guy who was a model, she said. I thought I was being catfished and he couldn#t possibly be the guy in his pictures, but it was him. We went on one date, but nothing came of it.I like somebody who makes me do things that I wouldn#t do myself and takes me out of my comfort zone. They don#t have to be in the industry either. I like a guy who does a nine-to-five job.I have never really been into marriage, I just don#t want to do it. I find it really cheesy and cringe, so I#d have to be forced into it! I have been engaged, but the thought of planning a wedding or walking down an aisle [pulls a face].While a wedding might be off the cards, Nadine hinted at a possible reunion with her former Girls Aloud bandmates in  for their th anniversary. It#s been seven years since the last reunion tour and it feels like seven years! she said. It#s always been really fun and we#ve always had a really good time, but there would have to be a lot of organising to get us all back together. It would take a lot of work.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadCoronavirus: Ballyclare businessman stranded at South Africa airport after visa restrictions Coronavirus: We need clarity, says Belfast gym owner as she closes upBallycastle is best place to live in Northern Ireland, claims guideKincora files destroyed as institutional abuse inquiry was set in motionDeath of Northern Ireland man on honeymoon in Las Vegas was drugs-related ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

There, I’ve said it. It wasn’t that hard really. The truth is that I don’t always wear my Catholic badge with pride. There are things that I like and dislike about the Catholic Church, but I am a practising Catholic, and in a world where that isn’t always the coolest thing to say, I don’t mind saying it, out loud.I’ve always been a believer, I was raised in a devoutly Catholic family. I remember the pride in my parents’ faces at church when a woman pointed at me and my brother and sisters, and said she’d never seen a family so well-behaved at Mass.My faith had good foundations because of the people around me. My earliest memory of church is being taken to Benediction with my granny, nose pressed to the seat in front of me as I knelt, listening to the priest recite lines and lines of Latin phrases that I couldn’t understand. The memory of my granny’s wrinkled hand in mine guiding me through the Rosary beads, and the smell of incense is as real to me now, as it was then.As a teenager, I went to Mass every night, something I kept a closely-guarded secret from all my friends. I didn’t want to be called a Holy Joe. While my friends were all getting part-time jobs in what was the newly-opened Foyleside in the early s, my first job was in the priests’ house, where there was always a stack of black shirts that needed ironed.After moving to Belfast in  to attend Queen’s University, my faith seemed to drt. I did attend a few events in the University Catholic Chaplaincy, but the freedom of living away from home and the pub culture meant my churchgoing took a hit.It didn’t bother me. I attended Mass sporadically over the years – Christmas, weddings, funerals, and whenever my parents forced me to. I hadn’t stopped believing, but that need to go to Mass just wasn’t there anymore. I suppose as I’ve got older I had been thinking about my faith more, and a chance opportunity to attend Lough Derg in  changed everything for me. I was working as a journalist and was asked to attend with a group of pilgrims from the Derry Diocese along with Bishop Donal McKeown. I thought nothing more of it than that it would make a good story.The three days I spent on the island ended up being much more than research for a newspaper article. The peace of Lough Derg, and the break from the constant distraction of the modern world gave me the space to reconnect with my faith. I hadn’t been to Confession for over  years believing it to be outdated and unnecessary, but at Lough Derg, I experienced a new, grown-up type of confession that dfered from my childish practice of rhyming off sins.Now, aged , I hope I have a much more mature attitude to my faith. I don’t hide the fact that I go to Mass, because I really don’t care what other people think about that.But being a Catholic, and someone who is not afraid to say they are a Catholic comes with its own challenges. The Church has been through dficult years with issues that can never be brushed under the carpet. Friends of mine have told me they’ll neverto Mass because they’ll never trust the Church again. Many of my friends, while they don’t share my faith, have the deepest respect for it. On a recent weekend away to England with buddies, I announced on the Saturday night that I was going to find a chapel to go to Mass. Instead of going alone, I ended up taking ten people along with me.Having faith isn’t always something that comes naturally – there are days when I feel I’m just going through the motions and doubting everything, and there are other days when I feel completely connected to God.I know that in the most dficult situations in my le I have felt God’s presence with me. That can sometimes be a dficult statement to make, when being a card-carrying Catholic and a woman of faith is something that is so easily ridiculed in modern society. I can’t say I do, or will ever agree with all aspects of the Catholic Church. The Church has much work to do. More recognition must be given to the vital role played by women, and I hope some day that church will be more accepting of same-sex relationships. I’ve seen first-hand the upset caused to my gay friends who have felt abandoned by the church. My faith will always be important to me. Because I’m so vocal about it, I’m often stopped by people who ask me to pray for a special intention for them, light a candle, or even asked where is the nearest place they can buy a Mass card  Faith is something that should be cherished. I feel hugely grateful for having it in my le. I enjoy volunteering for my parish by the little bits and pieces I do to help. I am very grateful for the people around me who respect my faith, and those who share it with me. I suppose I still fear the Holy Joe label, because I know I’m far from a Holy Joe, but I suppose there are worse things I could be called. googletag.cmd.push Erin Hutcheon is PR and marketing officer with the North West Regional College.

There, I’ve said it. It wasn’t that hard really. The truth is that I don’t always wear my Catholic badge with pride. There are things that I like and dislike about the Catholic Church, but I am a practising Catholic, and in a world where that isn’t always the coolest thing to say, I don’t mind saying it, out loud.I’ve always been a believer, I was raised in a devoutly Catholic family. I remember the pride in my parents’ faces at church when a woman pointed at me and my brother and sisters, and said she’d never seen a family so well-behaved at Mass.My faith had good foundations because of the people around me. My earliest memory of church is being taken to Benediction with my granny, nose pressed to the seat in front of me as I knelt, listening to the priest recite lines and lines of Latin phrases that I couldn’t understand. The memory of my granny’s wrinkled hand in mine guiding me through the Rosary beads, and the smell of incense is as real to me now, as it was then.As a teenager, I went to Mass every night, something I kept a closely-guarded secret from all my friends. I didn’t want to be called a Holy Joe. While my friends were all getting part-time jobs in what was the newly-opened Foyleside in the early s, my first job was in the priests’ house, where there was always a stack of black shirts that needed ironed.After moving to Belfast in  to attend Queen’s University, my faith seemed to drt. I did attend a few events in the University Catholic Chaplaincy, but the freedom of living away from home and the pub culture meant my churchgoing took a hit.It didn’t bother me. I attended Mass sporadically over the years – Christmas, weddings, funerals, and whenever my parents forced me to. I hadn’t stopped believing, but that need to go to Mass just wasn’t there anymore. I suppose as I’ve got older I had been thinking about my faith more, and a chance opportunity to attend Lough Derg in  changed everything for me. I was working as a journalist and was asked to attend with a group of pilgrims from the Derry Diocese along with Bishop Donal McKeown. I thought nothing more of it than that it would make a good story.The three days I spent on the island ended up being much more than research for a newspaper article. The peace of Lough Derg, and the break from the constant distraction of the modern world gave me the space to reconnect with my faith. I hadn’t been to Confession for over  years believing it to be outdated and unnecessary, but at Lough Derg, I experienced a new, grown-up type of confession that dfered from my childish practice of rhyming off sins.Now, aged , I hope I have a much more mature attitude to my faith. I don’t hide the fact that I go to Mass, because I really don’t care what other people think about that.But being a Catholic, and someone who is not afraid to say they are a Catholic comes with its own challenges. The Church has been through dficult years with issues that can never be brushed under the carpet. Friends of mine have told me they’ll neverto Mass because they’ll never trust the Church again. Many of my friends, while they don’t share my faith, have the deepest respect for it. On a recent weekend away to England with buddies, I announced on the Saturday night that I was going to find a chapel to go to Mass. Instead of going alone, I ended up taking ten people along with me.Having faith isn’t always something that comes naturally – there are days when I feel I’m just going through the motions and doubting everything, and there are other days when I feel completely connected to God.I know that in the most dficult situations in my le I have felt God’s presence with me. That can sometimes be a dficult statement to make, when being a card-carrying Catholic and a woman of faith is something that is so easily ridiculed in modern society. I can’t say I do, or will ever agree with all aspects of the Catholic Church. The Church has much work to do. More recognition must be given to the vital role played by women, and I hope some day that church will be more accepting of same-sex relationships. I’ve seen first-hand the upset caused to my gay friends who have felt abandoned by the church. My faith will always be important to me. Because I’m so vocal about it, I’m often stopped by people who ask me to pray for a special intention for them, light a candle, or even asked where is the nearest place they can buy a Mass card  Faith is something that should be cherished. I feel hugely grateful for having it in my le. I enjoy volunteering for my parish by the little bits and pieces I do to help. I am very grateful for the people around me who respect my faith, and those who share it with me. I suppose I still fear the Holy Joe label, because I know I’m far from a Holy Joe, but I suppose there are worse things I could be called. googletag.cmd.push Erin Hutcheon is PR and marketing officer with the North West Regional College.

I came up with an idea for an initiative to try to promote a more positive perspective for people at what feels like a very dark time for everyone. Its my suggestion that, while we remain in this time of social distancing, people place a set of Christmas lights in a front window of their home to promote a feeling of togetherness, mutual support and as a gesture of gratitude for all those who are out there still working to help all us through this dficult time.She believes this simple gesture could have a powerful effect, especially for children.At night when we look out and see the lights twinkling from our neighbours windows, well be reminded that were all in this together and united in our support for one another. It will also be symbolic of our hope and a reminder that there will be light at the end of the tunnel. googletag.cmd.push This message and initiative is particularly important for children who, while they seem to be relatively unaffected by this virus health-wise, can be massively affected by anxiety, both their own and that of the people around them.Ms Doherty has set up an instagram page Light Up Initiative where people have already been sharing pictures of their lit up windows. Its such an important message so Im encouraging everyone to continue share the light @lightupinitiative, she added. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Like many others at present, the drama student at Ulster University’s Magee Campus is working from home due to the coronavirus pandemic but her mind is firmly focussed on the task at hand on Saturday night. She’s having ‘withdrawal symptoms’ from not seeing her two biggest fans, grannies Peggy and Sheila, who have also become household names thanks to their guest appearance on the show. googletag.cmd.push But Brooke has been calling them on a regular basis and wants to ensure they’re kept safe.  The -year-old is from Bellaghy Co. Derry but lived in the Rosemount area for two years while studying and has family connections in the city. Her love of music developed at home, growing up her father ‘almost burnt the house down’ when he fell asleep as a child listening to the record player. None of her family are singers but they’re all passionate about music and listen to the ‘golden oldies’. Brooke’s own taste has been informed by those cherished records and she’s been fortunate enough to see idols live such as Dolly Parton, Cher and Tina Turner. Other favourites include the Eagles, Aerosmith and John Mayer. googletag.cmd.push She never envisaged a career in music - ‘every competition I entered I never got through, except from one year at Ballymena Festival which I won’, she said. Unbeknown to Brooke a friend submitted an application of her to audition for The Voice UK . She was shocked to get call back from the producers before going across to England in April last year, where she secretly filmed her Blind Audition – an experience shrouded in secrecy from her wider friends and family. AFFIRMATION  At the beginning of January Brooke’s first appearance was aired on ITV. All four coaches were visibly moved by her performance. First to turn were will.i.am and Meghan Trainor and they were quickly followed by Sir Tom Jones and Olly Murs. A tug-of-war took place between the coaches but American singer-songwriter Ms Trainor convinced the Derry woman to join her team and quickly declared that she had a potential winner on her hands. That cover of Lewis Capaldi song Bruises was a breakthrough moment and one that changed her outlook. “I’m so grateful for everything because it really has shown me that by getting turns from all the coaches, it has reassured me and reaffirmed everything that I want to do, it has given me that push and urge to say, ‘I should be doing this, I will do it and be as good as I can’.” It has already proven a seminal moment in her le and one which she now uses as motivation. “I watch that back on my phone when I’m going to perform on the show again, “ she reflected. “It gives me that lt and belief that I was worth the four chair turn. “I genuinely didn’t think it was a good performance of that song because as soon as they turned I went into panic mode. I’ve sung it so much better. “But the crowd were standing applauding, it was a surreal moment and one I’ll never forget.” Directly after the performance the -year-old’s sense of humour shone through, while speaking to the coaches she joked to Tom Jones and Olly Murs that her grannies were both single. Her own harshest critic, Brooke also wasn’t happy with her performance during the Battles round and views this Saturday night as an opportunity to redeem herself. Saturday’s Knockout performance is set to be special as she sings a song that is close to her heart. “It’s a song with a lot of meaning for me, it was the first song people heard me sing in school and has had a lot of luck for me. I hope it does again on Saturday,” she added. ROLE MODEL The reaction in her hometown and further afield has been humbling and spurred her on. She explained: “People have been so supportive, particularly over the last few days when I’ve noticed my social media followers going up. “To think that people want to listen to me is amazing. I’m so glad I have the local support and want people to be proud of me and able to relate to me because I live in the same place.” A woman of many talents she also plays camogie having represented the county team and Bellaghy’s senior team. She shares the interest in sport with family members including her younger brother and two older sisters. However, The Voice remains her primary focus at present with her time split between Derry and London. If she didn’t grasp the opportunity with both hands and devote herself to it entirely she feels it would always be a source of regret.  Brooke said she may be biased but believes choosing Meghan Trainor as her coach was the ‘best decision’ because they share a lot of similarities. “She FaceTimes me, messages me on Instagram, she is unbelievable and is here to make a point. I believe she’ll look after me in my career and is just a brilliant, brilliant coach.” Although only nearing her st birthday, the young Derry woman has ambitions of pursuing a career in music, or acting, regardless of the outcome on Saturday night. “I want to act, I want to sing, I want to bake, everything that comes at me I want to say yes because you never know what will come out of it. “I just want to help people, I want to give them something that takes them away from their worries. “It’s about growing as a person and artist, and being a good role model to young people who are looking up to me most, like Meghan has been for so many - that would be my dream achieved.” Tune into The Voice on ITV this Saturday at :pm as Brooke takes on the Knock Outs for a place in the Live Semi Final. The semi-final and final which were due to air on March  and April  have now been postponed until later this year.

So why not take the opportunity to watchsome classic films on Netflix. Our suggestions below arent necessarily suitable for younger viewers but will keep the adults entertained. Blade Runner A truly classic science fiction filmdirected byRidley Scott and starringHarrison Ford,Rutger HauerandSean Young. The Crying Game Neil Jordan’s  hit was a success at the time and it boasts one of the most surprising twists in the tail in any film. googletag.cmd.push GoodFellas Martin Scorsese’s  masterpiece is a must watch film about the Mafia with an all star cast including Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro. GroundhogDay A brilliant  comedy where Bill Murray relives the same day over and over again.... Funny and fitting for the situation we find ourselves in. Jaws A classic and the music alone makes it worth watching. The Silence of the Lambs Not one for the kids.... and probably not one for some adults either. T Four Weddings and a Funeral A rom-com starring Hugh Grant and a theme song that launched a thousand first dances at weddings. googletag.cmd.push When Harry Met Sally Famous for THAT scene and a cracking comedy all round The Le of Brian Once banned in this country, it is still hilarious to this day and signs off with a tune fitting for the times we are in now. Platoon Oliver Stones epic film about the Vietnam War has more than stood the test of time with an all star cast ofTom Berenger,Willem Dafoe,Charlie Sheen and Johnny Depp.  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Seven years later, he would be the first Maghera senior footballer to lt silverware after their MacLarnon Cup win over Omagh CBS. Back to back Ulster minor winner Laverty played on the Derry senior team of the mid-s, picking up two senior medals. His first cousin and godfather Colm Mulholland, who turned  in December played for Derry in the  All-Ireland final. Lavertys Derry senior debut came by chance. Jim McGuigan was organising the transport to Sligo for the opening game of the pre-Christmas section of the   league. googletag.cmd.push He asked Lavertyhe wanted to go to the game on the bus, just to watch. After all the ious pick up points passed, there were only  players on board, including Anthony McGurk who was nursing a sore ankle. “Do you want to play,” McGuigan asked in the direction of Laverty. Before he had a chance to reply, manager Paddy OHara told McGuigan to get him togs and socks a pair of boots from somewhere. “So there I was playing my first game. I remember the game was moved to Tobercurry, because of a waterlogged pitch. We won the game and remember Michael Kearns was playing for Sligo.” googletag.cmd.push It would be a further four years before he would make his championship debut. During that time, as a student at St Joes in Belfast, he won an All-Ireland Fresher medal and three Ryan Cupmedals. Regrettably, despite having a team capable of winning the Sigerson, the Ranch werent permitted to enter. With his native Lavey, he played for over  years, winning two championships, but for the last  years he calls Portrush his home. Every day, he will walk down the Coleraine Road to the shop, passing back over from County Antrim to his native Derry. He will pass the home of John Eddie Mullan, a league winner with the Oakleafers in , and the pair would often chat. Last week, when Lavertys phone rang and the opportunity arose to rake up the memories of  again, there was an excitement in his voice. Last year he had the thyear gathering of the  minor winning team that were defeated by Cork in All-Ireland final. “Brendan Kelly, Mickey Moran, Vincent Conway, Frankie McCotter and myself were on that team,” Laverty remembers. “The MacLarnon Cup final was a really good game of football compared to the MacRory which was dour and not very interesting.” Martin ONeill, who would later that year play alongside Laverty for Derry minors, played on the winning St Malachys team, managed by Phil Stuart, that lted the MacRory Cup. “Hugh Cudden, our goalkeeper, is now in Canada and Liam Harbinson is away in South Africa or Zimbabwe and Frankie McCotter lives in London.” Laverty scored one goal in the final with Harbinson, who played some Irish league soccer, notching the other, after dribbling clear of Omagh defence. “Liam is a relation of Sean OConnell and had a swagger like Sean OConnell. He was a very good soccer player, as was Mickey Moran. Playing in the school playground, you would know they had a bit of skill from soccer about them.” In those days, as Laverty remembers, organised games against other schools didnt come into vogue until third or fourth year. “What struck out for me, when we started in St Pats Maghera, there was only  pupils at it. We went into the assembly hall, there was no floor in it, we were standing on the grass as the school wasnt totally finished. “Frankie Kearney and Brian McKevitt took us in the early years. Then we had Sean Murphy and Eamon Small coaching us as well.” There were few highlights of the football in the early years but soon there was a greater enthusiasm and more boys were taking an interest. Frankie Kearney left the staff, going to St Pauls Kilrea. McKevitt went back to teach in the Abbey. Sean Murphy, with Jim B Bradley assisting him, took over the running of the senior team. “It was brilliant,” enthuses Laverty. “We were the first senior team and got Maghera into the MacRory. Adrian Boyle was still at Maghera the following year and remembers playing in the MacRory. “It was a fantastic feeling to win it and Omagh had a great team at that time. It was a ding dong game. We had a good team and were all very determined to win on that day.” Laverty was the captain and refers to manager Sean Murphys qualities in the classroom being transferred to the dressing room. “He was a good teacher and then he was a good manager as well. Everybody wanted to play for him. He had a good way of getting things across and he was a good motivator, you wanted to play for him.” Another ingredient for success, which Laverty mentions, was the school basketball team. Under the watch of Charlie Murphy, they won the Ulster title, with a - win over Methody. “It was up in San Souci Park, in Queens,” he adds, with the details floating down the phone-line asit were yesterday. There was a hiccup before the final. Maghera didnt have numbers on their vests and wouldnt be allowed to compete until a local intervention saved the day. St Colms Draperstowns U team were there and coach Seamus Kelly, loaned them their vests. Kelly, who passed away recently, would have an influence on Lavertys Derry career under Frankie Kearneys tenure. “Seamus was a shrewd man and was one of the mentors of Derry teams of ,  and . Sean OConnell would have been helping out with training – while still playing – and big Liam Hinphey was the motivator. Seamus Kelly was the tactician, he was very quiet but was shrewd operator.” “Methody came out in silk tops and togs, with all their fancy numbers. The vests we got were as tight as a fiddle string and too small for us. “There was a Methody boy who got a few tackles that day, that werent part of basketball, but thats another story,” added Laverty, with a hearty laugh. On the basketball starting team of five, were Mickey Moran and Eugene Laverty. Tommy McCloy of Lavey was another footballer but would leave school before the MacLarnon winning season. Also at the school during that era was current Lavey man Paddy Shivers, who went on to play for Derry as well. Laverty cant understand why Shivers wasnt on the Maghera team at that time. “I wasnt good enough,” Shivers has recently told Laverty. “He was a good footballer. He coached the team and played on the Lavey team for years. He was a PE teacher up in St Colms in Draperstown, took teams and did very well.” Laverty never forgot Shivers. He knew his footballers and, especially, a midfielder when he saw one. Winning captains names will continue to go up on the walls of St Patricks Maghera, but Eugene Laverty will always be the first. From the team on , who set the standard for others to follow. READ ALSO - Match report - Omagh - Maghera - Click here...

The closures will take place with a phased approach from today and over the coming days. The decision comes less than a week after council closed all its buildings to the public and cancelled a number of up and coming public events. Members met again today to get an update on council services and contingency measures being put into place by council to protect its staff and the public and help reduce the risk of COVID- across the Council area. Members heard that while play parks will be closed over the coming days, public parks and cemeteries will continue to remain open. googletag.cmd.push Other essential services such as bin collection services will continue to operate. Recycling centres remain open however some adaptations have been made to limit the number of cars entering sites at the one time in an effort to encourage social distancing. Members also agreed to postpone the Foyle Maritime Festival and the Strabane Summer Jamm both scheduled to take place over the summer months. Earlier this week Clipper Ventures confirmed to Council that the Clipper   Race is postponed. Members also heard that a number of signicant events including the Worker’s Rights and Social Justice Week and the Battle of the Atlantic VE Day commemorations planned for May have also been cancelled. googletag.cmd.push Events scheduled beyond the summer months will remain under review. In line with Government guidelines, many council staff are working from home while others providing front line services continue to report to work where internal working arrangements that include social distancing and additional health and safety measures are being implemented. All of this is being done in full consultation with unions, with a commitment to provide as many essential services as possible. Members were provided reassurance by council officials that adaptations have been made within council services to facilitate the continued delivery of vital services and that any operational changes to any service will be communicated to the public. While some council committee meetings have been postponed, new arrangements have been put in place for a Full Council meeting to take place later this month. Members were of the view that the key decision making process should continue for as long as possible. Members were also informed that while the City of Derry Airport is open and fully operational and council in partnership with the CODA Board is looking at contingency measures to mitigate against the severe and immediate financial impact of COVID- and is engaging with Ministers and officials over the coming days to discuss options for protecting this vital service. Elected members were informed that the council’s Business Support team are currently disseminating the information from Central Government in relation to rates relief and business support and will be available to offer advice and guidance to local business. In relation to community resilience and community support members were informed that Council is currently looking at mechanisms of how it can provide support to the local community sector at this time. Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Cllr Michaela Boyle chaired the meeting and welcomed the update and praised the efforts of Council in making key decisions at this challenging time. She spoke about the dficulties being faced by the local business community sector and made reference to the decision by O’Neill’s in Strabane to close its doors. “This is hugely sad news for Strabane and not an easy decision for Kieran and his team to make but I think it’s the right one and we will hopefully see the business up and running again in the near future.” The Mayor added: “The Council continues to provide strong leadership and is putting the health and safety of its staff and the public to the fore as it responds to this crisis in a responsible and proactive manner. The Council is also being proactive in working with our statutory agencies and partners in terms of contingency planning and service provision.” Providing reassurance to the public, the Mayor said that while Council facilities are closed to the public, essential services will continue for as long as possible and they can contact the Council directly at    or follow Council on Twitter and Facebook and on the Council website atwww.derrystrabane  coronavirusfor regular updates. She encouraged the public to take note of the advice from the Public Health Agency and to watch out for elderly family members, neighbours and friends. She praised the efforts of health workers, shop assistants, bin collectors, delivery men and all those providing the essential services during this dficult and challenging time. “By working together and looking out for one another we can all do our bit to limit the spread of this virus and protect our local community by taking the necessary precautions to stay safe,” she concluded.

Just last week, the Judges Road club were preparing for their All-Ireland League game with Sundays Well, hoping for a win which would take them away from relegation uncertainty and into a potential play-off position near the top of Division C. But the worldwide events of the past few days have not only ended sport locally, nationally and beyond, it has also put any game into context, with peoples lives at risk because of the spread of the Covid- virus.Rather than sit around and wait for the latest news however, City of Derry Head Coach Paul OKane, his staff and his players have made a public offer to go out into the community to help in anyway needed. OKane himself has already been out delivering groceries and prescriptions to the most vulnerable unable to travel in a bid to keep them safe during these uncertain times. “Its just something that we thought we would like to do,” he explained. “I spoke with the president and I spoke with the vice-chair of rugby, and there have been plenty of the players who have stuck their hands up. Were all at a bit of a loose end now and we know that theres vulnerable people out there and to be honest theres been a very good response. “Its certainly opened my eyes to how vulnerable in particular the old people are, even for simple things such as getting their shopping done or getting their prescriptions done and weve been out and about getting a few things done today. I think its just important we try and do something.”The importance of sport to the local community has never been more evident than in recent days with most sporting events and clubs taking a necessary step backwards. Sport however, can still give back, according to OKane.“Were really an extended family when you see how far and wide it reaches and people maybe dont realise that sometimes because were so erse,” he continued. “Were here for the whole community, were cross community, were cross-border and we have people involved in the club travelling from everywhere. “Its just important to try and help anyone we can, eventheyre not attached to the club, eventheyre just a part of the city or wider area. “We have players from Inishowen, Letterkenny, Strabane and Limavady, and from both sides of the water in Derry itself. We have footprints on every side of the community here. This is the least we can do for the wider rugby family in the city and the city in general.”It could be weeks or even months before the sporting calendar resumes, but in the meantime, OKane is hoping that the crisis will bring out the best of our community.“Its not just rugby because Im a Derry City fan and I try to get to every game I can,” he said. “Im from a gaelic background as well. I helped coach Doire Colmcille and Im originally a Limavady Wolfhound, so its great to see all those wee communities trying to do their bit, and were a part of that. “Were at a bit of a loss at what we do at the minute so we have to try and make the best of it and help whoever needs help and try to rally around. From a sporting point of view, you dont know what you have until youve lost it. “Its crazy how much it affects us, evenits sitting watching sport or going training. Some of the guys are going out of their mind because they cant train. Its been massively impactful and when we get back at it, I think we will appreciate things a lot more.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

St Maryrsquos High School in the town is closed today only for an exceptional closure.Some schools are working to continue lessons for Year - students to prepare them for their forthcoming examinations but have asked that all other children are kept at home.Despite the current government advice to keep schools open, attendance is likely to be down from Wednesday onwards as worried parents keep children at home for their protection or other more vulnerable family members.Principal of St Patrickrsquos Primary School in Saul, Mr Mark McGrath, said: ldquoWe are open again on Wednesday but we fully respect parentsrsquo right to do what is best for their own family situation.Down High School is closed today for a school development day but is open tomorrow and Friday for Years - only.

A ten-day trip to South Africa has also been cancelled by the school.Mr Peter Dobbin, principal, told parents that the schoolrsquos primary duty of care was to ldquothe health and safety and to the wellbeing of each and every student and member of staff.ldquoThese are unprecedented times and we are navigating unchartered waters, so please bear with us as we try to ensure that we maintain learning and teaching at this time, said Mr Dobbin.He said that he and his staff were also preparing for ldquoan inevitable school closure in due course and would ensure that no external visitors, including parents, would be allowed past the entrance foyer, unless it was under ldquoexceptional circumstances.He revealed that the school had implemented ldquoenhanced cleaning procedures since the beginning of the month.The school has also cancelled all extra-curricular activities and postponed the Year  and Year  parent teacher meetings, scheduled for next Tuesday.Mr Kevin Lambe, principal of Shimna Integrated College, Newcastle, confirmed on Monday that the schoolrsquos sky trip to Austria had been cancelled.Outlining his schoolrsquos response to the current coronavirus threat level, Mr Lambe said that additional cleaning protocols were in place and that all evening activities involving community groups had been cancelled until further notice.He added: ldquoOur current priority is to put in place arrangements to support studentsrsquo continued learning and revision should schools close..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th March 2020 Cemetery.jpg","title":"Cemetery blaze report due out  ","story":"POLITICIANS will be provided with an update on the recent blaze which ripped through part of a building at Struell cemetery in Downpatrick.The blaze mdash which is believed to have been started by an electrical fault ndash has left Newry, Mourne and Down Council with a repair bill running into tens of thousands of pounds.The Fire and Rescue Service carried out a detailed examination of the building in the aftermath of the blaze and members of the local authorityrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee are expected to discover its initial findings tomorrow night.Mechanical equipment, including a small digger, was destroyed in the blaze at the Old Course Road cemetery three weeks ago, with firefighters able to prevent flames from spreading to a toilet block which remains operational.The cemetery was temporarily closed by local authority officials in the wake of the fire but was subsequently reopened. Council insurers also visited the site to inspect the scale of the damage.The roof of the cemetery building which was badly affected by the fire contained asbestos tiles which resulted in debris falling within the structure and on ground immediately beside it.Council staff erected fencing around the damaged part of the building to prevent access to the asbestos material with arrangements made to remove it off site by an approved asbestos contractor.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said politicians will be keen to hear tomorrowrsquos update and how soon the main building will be fully operational. He also hopes that councillors will be provided with an estimate of the cost of the repair work.ldquoThis is Downpatrickrsquos only public cemetery and I hope that once the insurers have completed their assessment and the Fire and Rescue Service report is discussed, that repairs can get underway, said Cllr Curran.ldquoThe cemetery is widely used by people from across the district and while the scale of the damage was signicant, it is somewhat comforting that the blaze is being blamed on an electrical fault and was not as the result of an arson attack..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th March 2020 Cheltenham.jpg","title":"Cheltenham joy  ","story":"THERE was local success at the Cheltenham Festival last week.Ravenhill, bred in Comber by Aaron Metcalfe, won the National Hunt Chase on the opening day of the Festival last Tuesday.The  year-old, ridden by leading amateur jockey Jamie Codd and trained by Gordon Elliott, romped home at  .

I also think it is ludicrous that you only have schools and public buildings closed on one side of the border, he said.ldquoI know that from talking to parents last weekend, especially those with vulnerable children, that they are really fearful about sending them to school and into public buildings. People are effectively voting with their feet and taking decisions themselves.Cllr Clarke said elected representatives had to listen to what the public was saying and that confusion had been fuelled by conflicting medical advice from across the globe.He added: ldquoWe simply have to look at restrictions on public buildings and even perhaps how many people go into play parks. This council needs to send out a strong message that it is taking this issue seriously following. We have already cancelled of this weekrsquos St Patrickrsquos Day parades. We have to start by getting our own house in order.The DUPrsquos Billy Walker mdash who initially said that his party would ldquoreluctantly support the closure of leisure centres mdash subsequently agreed that all council buildings should go into lockdown following the Prime Ministerrsquos statement.He said that in the interests of the publicrsquos health and safety ldquothis is the right thing to do, even though Northern Irelandrsquos chief medical officer, Michael McBride, said that leisure centres could remain openthey were properly managed.ldquoAll the political parties need to work together to make sure that the people out there are properly informed as there are mixed messages. To be honest, some have attempted to turn this issue into and Orange and Green situation and that is wrong, declared Cllr Walker.ldquoThe bottom line for us all is that we do not want any member of the public to get infected with this virus. We want to come out the far side of this crisis unscathed and prevent as many as people as possible from contracting coronavirus. We have to send out a united message.The UUPrsquos David Taylor said while politicians could ldquodebate all day about who was right and who was wrong in relation to conflicting medical advice, they had to approach the issue in a collective manner and give confidence to the community that they are united in their approach.He added: ldquoThis is not a political issue. It is one that affects each and everyone of us. It is a very serious issue given the potential damage it could cause to peoplersquos lives and we could actually lose some as a result of this. We need to take collective approach and act responsibly.ldquoI have serious concerns about the way the virus is impacting the business community and some of the stories I have heard are frightening, with some businesses down by as much as  percent and jobs at others at risk. We need the Assembly to provide a package of measures to help.SDLP councillor Pete Byrne said that at this time the public need clarity with the overwhelming majority of them of the view that acting early is better than acting too late.ldquoPeople want us to show leadership and while we are taking about closing leisure centres, we have an obligation to protect the interests and health of people and our staff, he said.ldquoWhile I support the closure of leisure centres, we also need to look at community centres, many of which are visited by huge number of our senior citizens for a range of activities and programmes. We need to send out a clear message to people.Cllr Byrne said there also needed to be a focus on the criteria for reopening public buildings following their closure, suggesting that an alternative venue needs to be found for future council meetings to promote social distancing, suggesting the Down Leisure Centre as a possible location.ldquoWhen we close public facilities we are going to push people into parks but we must ensure that there is social distancing in these locations. We need staff there to assure people and perhaps we could redeploy those from our leisure centres to make sure are parks are up to scratch, he added.Cllr Henry Reilly highlighted the great deal of anguish in the community, suggesting that a two-week closure smacked of ldquotokenism as the coronavirus issue will not be over by the end of March.He also highlighted the need to ensure that frontline staff, especially those who work in refuse collection and household recycling centres, are provided with appropriate protective equipment.Cllr Jarlath Tinnelly urged the Public Health Agency to provide information leaflets on the coronavirus to every household in the country, while Alliancersquos Andrew McMurray said his party supported the decision to close all council buildings, excluding those which deliver statutory s.He added: ldquoMoving forward, it is imperative that we enact and support the decision made by the council. On the wider issue, I would ask all residents to follow the advice given by the Public Health Agency, to shop responsibility in order to avoid shortages and to look out for the most vulnerable in our communities.Other councillors who spoke at Monday nightrsquos debate included Roisin Mulgrew, Michael Savage, Oonagh Hanlon and Harold

Fountain Foodbank has launched a new drive through facility in response to the coronavirus epidemic.The cross-community facility mdash which has seen an upsurge in demand over recent days and handed out almost  food parcels last week mdash introduced the new service this week in the wake of Mondayrsquos advice from Prime Minister Boris Johnston that people should avoid all ldquonon essential contact.Volunteers from the foodbank, who are appealing for more donations to help them cope with the increase in demand in what are unprecedented times, are asking people with cars to drive into the car park at Downpatrick Presbyterian Church where the foodbank is based.People are being asked to remain in their cars and once they have handed over their voucher, the food parcel will either be left beside their vehicle or placed in the boot.The volunteers have confirmed that they will also be changing the way they hand over parcels to people who arrive at the foodbank on foot or accept the generous donations people from across the district provide them with.Foodbank co-ordinator Shirley Lennon said people continue to be generous and revealed that she was heartened this week to see collection points the charity has at a number of local stores filled with items.She also revealed that while in the Asdarsquos Downpatrick store yesterday morning, she was approached by a woman who gave her an envelope with money it which her grandfather had donated.Shirley explained the woman approached her after spotting that she was wearing her Fountain Foodbank hoodie.Shirley has been at the helm of the foodbank since it opened and described the impact of the coronavirus issue on the community as ldquochallenging.She also confirmed that the volunteers who provide the food parcel service are committed to continuing to help others across the community in need.She described the climate the foodbank is currently operating in as ldquodficult and revealed that it was extremely busy last Friday.ldquoOn Tuesday of last week we gave out  food parcels which was busy but not unusual, but suddenly on Friday everyone seemed to panic and there were  parcels given out to help  people.ldquoTo put that number of parcels in context, it was like the Friday before Christmas when we give out around  parcels. This is the only time that we would distribute that many.Shirley said she believes that this is as a direct response to what is happening across the community, explaining that measures had been put in place to restrict the time volunteers speak with people in a bid to protect their health.ldquoWhile I was not there last Friday when people were calling I believe that there was a sombre atmosphere. We gave out a lot of food and we reckon that we will be busy from here on, she continued.ldquoIt has been dficult to replace the food that was given out. We do not have that big a store, but we have managed and it is quite well stocked again just now, but it is dficult. Normally we have financial donations which lets me buy what we need, but there is no long le milk to be had anywhere. It has been hard for me to do that normal shopping for the foodbank.Shirley explained that while she collected an order from the Asda store in Downpatrick yesterday, she was unable to get the quantity of some items that she would have liked.The foodbank co-ordinator saidshoppers would think about the charity when they are shopping it would help, explaining that people are being good, with messages coming in from people saying they will make donations. Shirley said that local churches have also been helping.ldquoThere has been a good response from people which is very much appreciated, but the increase in demand is having an impact on our stock, coupled with the inability to get the food, she said.ldquoPeople should not be panic buying, but it seems to be the way they react at times like this.She said that the Downpatrick foodbank and the Pantry foodbank in Newcastle are anticipating greater need and with people having no jobs and no money coming in, ldquothey are going to be in more dficulty.Shirley added: ldquoEveryone who used the foodbank over the past few months do not have the reserves to go and panic buy, that is why we are going to be busy.Donations can be left at the Fountain Foodbank on Tuesday or Friday mornings between am and noon.

The distance is approximately six miles on an out and back course, majority of the race on the flat with a brutal climb of  feet in half a mile.A new registration venue meant a slight course change which avoided the road section, crossing a few fields and down a lane that took competitors back onto the river path.Leading out the runners was Newcastle ACrsquos Seamus Lynch and Mourne Runnersrsquo Johnny Scott. Once on to the open mountain section, Lynch showed his climbing ability with a one minute lead at the summit before descending with devastating effect, leaving the opposition in his wake and an easy run home along the river bank.The rest of the field swapped places as everyone fought for grip on the steep mountain side.In the ladiesrsquo race it was Newry ACrsquos Esther Dickson who dominated, showing many a good fell runner a clean pair of heels on the descent.At the end of the track back along the river it was Lynch, well in the lead taking his fourth win and third in a row in :, Scott held his position for second in : closely followed by Mourne Runnersrsquo Adam Cunningham in :.Making the top ten for NAC were David Hicks in seventh place in : and Gary McEvoy ninth in :.

He was asked about NHS staffing, and concerns that we are nowhere near where we need to be.These are all legitimate and indeed important questions.But at the same time, it is vital that we all understand a few elementary things about this crisis.The first is that while of course it is crucial that the Province gets every penny of funding it possibly can from the Treasury, we must realise that this is a massive global health challenge for every country on earth.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...It is all very well to observe that the NHS faced huge pressures even before the coronavirus, which it did , but we must also recognise that no healthcare in the world could cope with perhaps % of its population being infected in a short period of time. If % of them are hospitalised, then % of any nation’s population could be in hospital within a short period of time. No health system has the ventilators it will need, not even the richest countries in the world. Germany or Japan or the US.Therefore we must do our part in flattening the curve, and the single most important element in that in this voluntary stage is that people observe prudent movements and social distancing. There is not yet a bar on people visiting one another or going to cafes and other such public settings. We all can try to observe a one or two metre distance from other people in that context, as well as relentless washing of hands. Across Northern Ireland, people are gathering together less closely than they did. But there is still some conduct that suggests many people do not know the seriousness of this. To maintain freedom of movement that is helping keep businesses alive we need to observe these simple rules. Otherwise lockdown will come sooner rather than later.\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Michael said: “People think, the music is dark and intense, they’re going to be really dark and intense.The band’s original line-up of Michael, Andy and Fyfe \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...“The most messed-up people I find are people in pop music. A lot of them are horrible twisted people with weird agendas and they become quite damaged iniduals. Then they go on stage everything is rosy.“It’s really the old cliche – never judge a book by its cover. With us the lyrics are kind of twisted, but there’s a big, dark sense of humour there.“We let off steam when we go on stage and jump up and down for  minutes. You tend to be pretty chilled afterwards.”When the band first got together in  lead singer and guitarist Andy Cairns was a pupil at Ballyclare High. Michael, who attended Larne Grammar with Fyfe Ewing , wasn’t present for the band’s first recording though he was there in spirit.On the front cover of metal magazine Kerrang! in He said: “Fyfe and I were in the same English class and would have traded records. He was in a band, I was in a band. “His band and Andy’s band had played a gig at Jordanstown Uni. They had more in common than they did with their own bands. “They did a demo together. I was there in spirit because Andy didn’t have a bass guitar so Fyfe asked me and I lent Andy my bass. Andy played it on the first demo.” Michael soon joined to play his own bass and things clicked from the start: “Our first gig was at Giro’s supporting Decadence Within. It went down really well, I was flabbergasted. “We weren’t trying to be U or Guns N’ Roses – those were the two big musical things at that time in , . I don’t mind U and I quite like Guns N’ Roses but we had our own little thing going on.“You kind of gravitated towards anyone who liked something that wasn’t Bryan Adams at school. In Larne where I grew up the metallers hung out with the goths, the goths hung out with the indie kids and you heard Joy Division, The Dead Kennedys and Slayer. We clung together as musical outsiders.”The friendship between Michael and Andy has extended more than  years: “I think I was  or  when Andy and I first met. When the first album came out I’d just turned . I’ll be  later this month.“One thing we did find quite early on is that we tend to be huffers. We got that out of our system. If you don’t like something you say then, you don’t leave it for six months and have a meltdown in the middle of eastern Europe.“There’s a lot of rock and rolls myths and stereotypes out there that people love. One of them I think which is not correct is that you need to have creative tension in a band. Maybe that’s works for one or two albums, but that burns itself out really quickly.“It’s really great working together as part of the band, what I get out of it is quite special, I think I’m very lucky.”Michael contrasted the crazy intensity when the band shared a house together in Belfast’s Holylandswith the situation now where they all live in dferent parts of the UK.He said: “I think there was one time me and Andy worked out over an -months period we’d been within  metres of each other every day with the exception of Christmas Day.“Now I live in Larne, Andy lives in Cambridge and Neilour drummer lives in Derby. When we meet up there’s lots of interesting stories and dferent experiences to share rather than walk down the main street in Larne going, ‘oh there’s the lads’.”On Fyfe, his original bandmate who left in , he said: “I haven’t spoken to him since he left. We have friends in common. He’s doing alright I believe. He moved to Brighton, he’s been there  years now. He’s had very little involvement in the music business.“It’s a real pity because he was such a great drummer, it’s just he couldn’t really get on with the lestyle. Somewhere down the line we’ll meet again.”Family man with attic of collectablesLast year Michael contributed a recipe to a celebrity cookbook to support his nephew Matthew who had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia.Michael said: “Matthew is doing well. The family is getting things back on track. It was a big thing, he’s still a bit traumatised as you’d expect but he’s doing well.”Of family le at home in Larne he said: “My we works full time soI’m at home I’m daddy day care. The only downside is when I’m away, I’m away   so there’s a whole dferent set of challenges for my we who’s an absolute saint.”Askedhis children, aged nine and five, were excited about their dad being in an band, he said: “They saw us at a big festival in Europe which was great because they were at the side of the stage and they were able to see , people from the other side. “They’re quite blasé about their dad being in a band. They’re not into music that much, they’re more into games, football and karate.”Michael went on to discuss some of the Therapy  treasure trovecontained in his attic: “I’ve got Fyfe’s original snare drum that he used on Babyteeth, the basses that I used on Troublegum. I’ve got a lot of the flyers, posters, tour passes and recordings and audio stuff I’ve kept over the years. The attic is a disaster area.”In the early days of Therapy  a pair of denim dungarees were Michael’s stagewear of choice. Askedstill had them, he said: “I actually do. I’m quite pleased that I’d still fit into them but I never wear them.“When we did the Troublegum shows a while ago there were some bets that they’d turn up again, but it didn’t happen for whatever reason. But never say never – right now I don’t think the world is ready for that.”Michael explained that there were in fact two pairs of his trademark dungarees, one of them he referred to as ‘the good pair’ then immediately burst out laughing.“Can you imagine denim dungarees after three weeks of touring ” he said. “It’s hard to find a -hour laundrette when you’re on the road. They were crunchy. I’m surprised they’re still in one piece.”Dates cancelled due to pandemicTherapy  have had to cancel some European tour dates later this month because of the coronavirus.Michael said: “We’ve had to cancel where the crowds would have been above ,, some of the big festivals we were really looking forward to. As it stands we’re still planning to play some of the smaller shows unless told otherwise. “It’s something that you just can’t account for. Gigs sometimes have to be cancelled because of illness or injury but this is beyond the band’s control. It’s a bit of a headmelt.”Touring major European cities is a far cry from the band’s gigging schedule in : “When we started there was the Warzone Collective in Belfast and Hope Promotions in Dublin. They worked in conjunction and would bring hardcore punk bands over like Fugazi and Concrete Sox. “We knew the Warzone people and that led to us being invited down to Dublin to play with the likes of Babes In Toyland. “They’d rent rooms above pubs for gigs, in Belfast they used the Art College and the Conor Hall. “We were quite lucky to get in at that DIY stage.”It’s okay not to be okayMuch is currently being done to raise awareness and funds for musicians suffering from mental health issues, particularly through Aware NI, PIPS and Help Musicians. As a band Therapy  have been tuned into the struggle from day one with many of Andy’s lyrics exploring the pressures that weigh on the human mind.Michael said: “It’s something that we’re all very aware of and very sympathetic towards. Being a young male in Northern Ireland there’s a bit of a ‘come on, man up’ vibe. That has been very damaging for a couple of generations now.“There is a rock and roll myth that everyone’s an all-singing, all-dancing, all-fighting gunslinger – you roll into town decimate it and move on. It’s not really like that.“I don’t think anyone hasn’t been touched by themselves or someone  who has had a mental health issue.“It’s such a fragile thing. It’s right there, there just seems not to be the widespread acknowledgement that it exists and for treatment. It’s so underfunded. It’s a real tragedy.”He added: “We’ve always had a lot of empathy, we take people as they are, we don’t have the answers, but we do try to let people know that it’s okay to not be okay. “Just talk about it, talk to your friends, talk to someone, reach out. Thankfully that stigma is moving away.“We’ve always been celebrating the outsiders – be yourself, do you own thing, what makes you happy, self preservation, looking after yourself.”Michael continued: “It’s one of these rock and roll myths that people want their musicians to be messed up and die young and leave a pretty corpse. “None of us subscribe to that at all.“We like to have a good time when we’re on tour, but doing it for so long there’s a massive element of self preservation.“It’s about doing a good gig. People don’t come and see you againyou’re stood there looking bored or hungover. It’s not pleasant for anyone – the player or the watcher.“We all feel a big responsibility to put on a good show. There’s people who have seen us  plus times.“We want every show to be as goodnot better than the last time. You make a rod for your own back with that.”• Therapy  will play the Limelight on September  to celebrate the band’s th anniversary• To coincide with the ‘So Much for the  Year Plan’ tour the band re-recorded  of their UK Top  hits in Abbey Road with producer Chris Sheldon, who produced the original Troublegum album.

The short list of potential locations for e-bike stations includes Penarth Town Centre, Cogan Train Centre, Penarth Train Station, Llandough Hospital, The Esplanade, Cosmeston Country Park, Cardf Bay Barrage, and Pont-y-Werin Bridge.The scheme hopes to encourage people to switch from their daily car journey to e-bikes, saving on average g of CO for every  kilometre travelled.The average round trip from Penarth to Cardf is km, which would save ,g of COused daily.Nextbike Managing Director, Krysia Solheim, said the Penarth scheme would be great for those who commute into the capital.ldquoWe know from our research that a lot of commuters already cycle from Penarth into Cardf, said Ms Solheim.ldquoE-bikes will make that journey easier and quicker than ever before, which will hopefully persuade more people to switch from four wheels to two on a daily basis. Picking up an e-bike instead of jumping in the car is also a great way for people to reduce their own personal carbon footprints to help our communities tackle climate change.ldquoPenarth will play an important part in leading the bike share revolution in Wales - itrsquos an exciting time - and we want the community to be as involved as possible.\"Councillor Peter King, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, said: ldquoFeedback from the Nextbike consultation was overwhelmingly positive, with many residents hoping to see the expansion of the scheme to the wider Vale.ldquoHaving declared a climate emergency last year, and having recently proposed a pound.m investment into tackling environmental issues, the Nextbike scheme will be a leading example of our commitment to tackling climate change and improving the wellbeing of our residents. We hope this will inspire the launch of similar schemes in future.The Nextbike project is being funded by Section  sustainable transport contributions. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

As the rain lashed down pretty much all day Friday and the wind did too much howling and yowling for my liking, we went to bed and then awoke to roads that looked like rivers between Sully and Barry and fields resembling lakes in Dinas Powys.My son and I played lsquospot the tops of the treesrsquo as we drove a erted route to get to his football match on Saturday morning and discussed climate change and the power of nature atas we drove through sun, hail, wind, and rain to get him to his match.The third weekend of storms has taken its toll. It feels tiring and worrying to be soaked once more.But it occurred to me as we left the house early and crawled along with other erted drivers that just a few miles up the road in Pontypridd and indeed in other parts of Wales and across the UK, people are witnessing their homes and business, their lives, being washed away and so as irritated and fed up as I may have been, I scrabbled for perspective.Perspective is a tough one. There will always be someone worse off and someone better off and whilst you can sympathise and empathise and seek to understand, you can only really know your own lived experience.But this is in part why I am so interested in the news, because in dealing with, embracing, enduring, revelling in my own le, I appreciate that window on the world to open my mind, teach me things and remind me that there are others in similar, same, better and much worse situations than me. It doesnrsquot stop a flooded road being frustrating, but it does remind me that in the midst of chuntering and muttering, because I do indulge in a chunter and mutter, thatpossible, it is important to take a moment to think about a world outside ourselves and our immediate surrounds.It can feel depressing. It is easy to feel powerless. But I do believe that as citizens in a democracy, it is important to have an idea about what is going on becausewe always turn a blind eye, eventually I fear, we might stop seeing anything at all. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The aim is that these virtues help to form them.With such a vast space at its disposal, the school ensures that children are given a rich and versatile experience.In the orchard, pupils pick fruit from pear, apple, plum, and damson trees which they use in cooking lessons during the autumn.They also grow  dferent kinds of fruit, salad, and vegetables in a polytunnel.Earlier this year, St Josephrsquos Primary was awarded a gold award in the UNICEF Rights Respecting School programme.The award is granted to schools which show a commitment to promoting childrenrsquos rights and raising awareness of these amongst young people.It recognises efforts to place the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child at the heart of a schoolrsquos policies and practice.ldquoAlongside our work on rights is the fact that we want our children to be aware of their responsibilities, said Mr Rein.ldquoYes, they have rights to be heard, but they also have a responsibility to listen to others.St Josephrsquos was the first school in Wales to develop a pupil parliament.Every child is a member of the parliament, and elected representatives from eight student groups form a cabinet which has decision-making powers.ldquoThe school parliament is a vehicle for the pupils to have a voice, so they can decide how the school can be a better place, how the local community can improve, and how we can help the UN to achieve their global goals, continued Mr Rein.ldquoSo the children are looking inward ndash at themselves and how the school environment can improve ndash and looking outward at how we can develop better links with the parishes and the areas of Penarth and Dinas Powys.ldquoOur Eco Ministry has been involved in a project to tidy beaches and pick up plastic, and our Healthy Schools and School Mission team have given food to local foodbanks.St Josephrsquos Primary is one of  innovation schools which have been chosen to contribute to the Welsh Governmentrsquos new curriculum framework, which will be rolled out to every school in Wales by . As part of the new framework, schools are required to design their own curriculum based upon the needs of specic learners, rather than adhering to a national learning program.St Josephrsquos curriculum is lsquoresearch-ledrsquo, meaning it is based on findings in child development and cognitive science.Teachers have undertaken training on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop, and lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social, and physical development.Mr Rein said: ldquoWe want our children to develop physically in terms of their gross motor skills, their fine motor skills, and their locomotion skills.ldquoWe have apparatus on which they can hang, climb, and swing, to build up their core strength.Mr Rein called the schoolrsquos curriculum lsquoreally ambitions.rsquoldquoWe are one of sixteen innovation schools in Wales helping to implement the new curriculum and develop special projects to do with the curriculum, he said.ldquoWe have taken that on by focusing on a knowledge-rich curriculum, so that we develop childrenrsquos knowledge, skills, and give them fantastic experiences.ldquoWe have taken good, rich materials from lots of dferent places, and developed some of our own, which we have implemented to a high standard.ldquoBehaviour in the school is exemplary partly because we have spent a long time asking what good teachers do.ldquoWe practice together as staff, so our teachers are working at a high level using a very well-researched curriculum.In last yearrsquos maths reasoning test,  per cent of pupils at St Josephrsquos scored higher than the national average, and  per cent of pupils scored above average in the National Reading TestldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos, said Mr Rein.ldquoEverything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.The schoolrsquos curriculum has recently been praised by cabinet member for education and regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, who said St Josephrsquos had done a lsquobrilliant job.rsquoShe said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning.ldquoIt encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It will cut planned capital spending to pound million from a budget of pound million and will work to grow online.MS said in a statement: \"Whilst we remain confident that the post-crisis future of the business and our transformation programme remains as strong as ever, trading over the next nine to  months in our clothing and home and international businesses is likely to be severely impacted.\"As a result, it is not possible to provide meaningful guidance on future earnings, although we are taking every step to secure future value for shareholders, colleagues and suppliers.\"The chairman of Wetherspoon has said that a decline in sales was accelerated when prime minister Boris Johnson told people to stay away from pubs.After rising in previous weeks, sales fell by . per cent in the week to March  and the slowdown has picked up further since the Prime Ministers statement, Tim Martin said.It came as the business reported profit before tax rose  per cent to pound. million in the half-year to January  on revenue of pound million.Health secretary Matt Hancock has warned that coronavirus will keep spreading as long as people continue to socialise.Speaking on talkRadio, Mr Hancock said: \"If you stay at home you are saving lives.\"I know, of course, this is a more dangerous disease for older people but not exclusively, some young people get it too.\"But, more importantly, the more that people continue to go out and continue to socialise, the more it will spread and the longer were going to have to keep these measures in place.\"So, were urging people to follow the public health advice.In the emergency Bill thats in front of Parliament right now, we are taking the powers to be able to enforce these measures, so we can make it happen by lawwe need to.\"Id rather not do that and the evidence so far is that the vast majority of people are following the advice, are doing what is sensible and right.\"The company said it was cancelling its interim idend, which had been p a year earlier.Mr Martin said: \"It is obviously very dficult to predict, in these circumstances, how events will unfold in future weeks and months, but we now anticipate profits being below market expectations, so long as the current health scare continues.\"As a result of this uncertainty, it is impossible to provide realistic guidance on our performance in the remainder of the financial year.\"The company has decided to delay most capital projects and to reduce expenditure, where possible, including the cancellation of the interim idend.\"As a result of these actions, combined with the Governments proposals on business rates relief and credit guarantee facilities, the company believes it has sufficient liquidity to maintain operations at a substantially lower level of sales.\"Nicola Sturgeon has urged anyone who left the medical profession in the past three years to consider ing to help the fight against coronavirus.Sharing a plea from Scotlands chief nursing officer Fiona McQueen, the First minister tweeted: \"Scotlands NHS needs our help to meet the #coronavirus challenge.\"Mr Hancock said some retired medics whoto work in the NHS to fight the coronavirus will be able to come \"straight back in\".Asked on the BBCs Breakfast programme when workers couldto the NHS, he said: \"Well, over the next couple of weeks because for some theyll have very recently left and they can come straight back in, their annual trainings been up-to-date and they can just restart.\"Imagineyouve left at Christmas, for instance, you can restart straight away.

for instance, how do you go about still getting your chemoyou have cancer whilst also social-distancing \"If you have cancer its particularly important to stay away from other people, but you also of course have got to keep going with your chemotherapy.\"He added: \"These are some of the most dficult and challenging cases so well be getting in contact with them, butpeople think that they are on this list and dont receive a communication from the NHS, then they also need to get in contact.\"So that is under way, the money was announced for it yesterday.\"A combination of money to the NHS and money to councils because theyve got a very big part to play in keeping people safe.\"ASCL general secretary Geoff Barton said schools will have first worked to identy vulnerable children, as they will know who they are, and will then be looking at the \"key worker\" category.He said the ASCL is telling members: \"You have to do your best to negotiate the key workers list. Youre doing this to a tight timescale, and what you offer children on Monday may be dferent to what you offer next Wednesday.\"Mr Barton said that initially, schools will be doing all they can so that pupils who need to can still turn up to their own school after the weekend.In the longer term, there will be more strategic planning of school provision, he added.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers , said: \"The Government has made clear that every child who can be safely cared for at home should be. And their advice makes clear too that this applies to children of key workers.\"For the vast majority of children and young people, school buildings will close tonight and not reopen for the foreseeable future.\"Taking up a place at school during this time of wider closure is the offer of last resort, for the minority of key workers, who have no alternative.\"School leaders have many questions that remain unanswered about how this will work in practice. We will continue to work with the Government throughout the day to provide greater clarity to schools to enable this reduced offer to be up and running as soon as possible.\"Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, added her voice to calls from school leaders urging parents to only send their children in as a last resort.She said: \"This is a very long list and could result in some schools having the majority of pupils attending. This will not achieve the goal of slowing the spread of the virus.\"So it is vitally important that parents follow government advice to keep their children at home, wherever possible.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Fear and uncertainty is widespread throughout this community,” she said.“There will be a long term impact on the mental and economic health of the citizens of this City and Borough but the measures we have enacted so far are within the scope of our organisation.”Members then heard from the Chief Executive, Roger Wilson who reminded elected representatives of their duties in a time of crisis.“We are Council, we are the form of government closest to its citizens and, as civic leaders, we need to lead our community through this,” he said.“We are not the only people who have a role in this but we need to make sure we are all pulling in the one direction.“Many people are scared and are looking for information. Speaking to many of you, I know that you are being inundated by people looking for help and I would seek members approval to make decisions quickly as things are moving at a very fast pace.“There willbe a big impact on our communities mental well being and health and that is a challenge we will all have to face. We need to accept that and find a way to support our community.”The motion to support Council’s ongoing approach to thecoronavirus situation was proposed by Councillor Paul Berry and seconded by Councillor Sam Nicholson.Speaking after the motion was passed Sinn Fein’s Catherine Nelson thanked Council staff and officials for their tireless work and implored Council to consider using its cash reserves to help the local community through this crisis.“The rule book goes out the window at a time like this,” she said on behalf of her party.“Big decisions will need to be made and time will be no friend of ours. We give the Chief Executive and senior management team our full support. We have trust and faith in you.“I would ask for an imaginative and exhaustive approach. We don’t have to try and reinvent the wheel but we should be mindful of the mental health of our citizens and think about what we can do to help them.“We should think of walks, the appropriate use of our open spaces, drive in cinemas and even the use of our reserve fund to help those in need.“We talk about saving the reserves for a rainy day, we will never get a rainier day than what we are about to experience.”Her sentiments were echoed by independent Councillor Paul Berry who also urged Council to do what it could to keep businesses informed.“I would request that the information is kept flowing daily,not hourly because the message from businesses is clear, very few of them have more than a very short space of time to go.“Urgent intervention is required as we speak.It is important we try and keep SMEs and large businesses up to date on a daily basis to encourage them to try and hang in there.”The Ulster Unionist Party’s Julie Flaherty also urged Council to unite for the good of the community.“This is a time when we need to come together like never before,” she said.“We need to maximise the community response. We also want to extend our thanks to the Chief Executive and senior officials. You have our full support and we will strive to keep people informed.“The impact of this will be felt in our communityfor a long time and the UUP, along with this council, will be at the forefront of this issue.”The Alliance Party’s Peter Lavery also outlined his party’s support for the Chief Executive and said now is the time to set aside political dferences in order to protect le.“We look forward to hearing how we can help support local businesses,” said Cllr Lavery.“Council will play a strong role in lobbying central government on behalf of our community and we all know this situation will get worse before it gets better.“We must do all we can to support our community.”Democratic Unionist Party colleagues, DarrynCausby and Steven Moutray also extendedtheir appreciation to the Chief Executive, senior management team and all Council staff for their efforts.“Thistsunami is sweeping across the world and it will have a negative effect on our businesses,” said Cllr Moutray.“We need to know what we can do to help them and we, as councillors, will ensure that everyone is made aware of the help on offer.”Cllr Causby commended Cllr Nelson for her suggestion on using Council funds.“I would like to say that the idea of a community fund already mentioned by Catherine Nelson is something we should look at going forward,” he said.“As we move forward in this very dficult environment, we will work as best we can to take the dficult decisionsand provide support to those who need it.”The SDLP’s Thomas O’Hanlon also thanked the Chief Executive and the senior managementteam but warned that bigger decisions would need to be made in the near future.“Our community face very dficult times, they are scared and frightened, just as we all are.None of us are medical experts but it is a civic leaders duty to be calm and measured and ensure we respond with compassion.“We will get through this. Roger, you have made timely decisions so far and you will have more to make but you have our support.”\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most
