Dame Kelly was responding to a tweet by Good Morning Britain in support of Martina Navratilova who had suggested that trans women who competed in women\u0027s sports were \u0027cheating\u0027 because of a biological advantage          Trans cyclist Rachel McKinnon calls out Holmes\u0027 sponsors Garmin and Specialized for supporting and suggests they drop her for not holding the same values          McKinnon, who also has academic pursuits, is one of a few transgender world champions across the sporting world. She achieved a 2018 UCI Masters Track Cycling gold medal at a competition in Los AngelesShe wrote on Twitter: ‘So hey Specialized and Garmin have you been following how your athlete Kelly Holmes has been extremely transphobic lately on Twitter?’ She added: ‘Specialized, you have a trans athlete. Garmin, you cool with this?’Miss McKinnon urged the companies to ‘take a stand’ as Dame Kelly was ‘trying to ban trans women from competing in women’s sport’ in breach of International Olympic Committee (IOC) policy.Miss McKinnon has argued that since IOC rules introduced in 2003 allowed trans women to compete, ‘not a single trans athlete has even qualified for the Olympics, let alone won a medal’.           Holmes responded to the criticism by saying she felt strongly about competitive sports, and wanted evidence there was no disadvantage before she would back downCycling specialists Specialized said it would investigate Dame Kelly’s comments, posting on Twitter: ‘Thanks for flagging this, Rachel. This is not representative of our brand values.’Dame Kelly, who won gold in the 800m and 1,500m running events in the 2004 Olympics, hit back – telling Miss McKinnon that involving her sponsors was ‘going about this in the wrong way’. In a tweet, she questioned why she had been blocked by a fellow athlete ‘if this subject is open to debate’.She added: ‘Calling me transphobic is just ridiculous – far from it. I have an opinion you don’t like... that’s that!’ Dame Kelly has lent her support to the Fair Play for Women campaign, which insists that female athletes are at a clear disadvantage against trans rivals.Tennis star Miss Navratilova has already clashed with Miss McKinnon in a row over male-born transgender athletes competing against biological women, branding it ‘cheating’.The Wimbledon champion and LGBT campaigner deplored the ‘tyranny’ of transgender activists who ‘denounce anyone who argues against them’.Miss Navratilova – who faced abuse and prejudice after coming out as gay in 1981 – accused Canadian Miss McKinnon of sending ‘bullying tweets’, and said her views had now ‘strengthened’.Long distance runner Miss Radcliffe has said tighter rules need to be applied if transgender women are to compete. IOC guidelines say transgender women must suppress testosterone levels for at least 12 months before they compete.She told the BBC: ‘People will manipulate this if there is an opening there to make money and win medals and we’ve seen the lengths people go to, the lengths Russia went to cheat in sport.’    Sharron Davies says the argument about trans women competing in female events is simply a matter of ‘biology’.The former Olympic swimmer, 56, claimed it was unfair to compete against those ‘who were born into a male body with all the advantages that will bring’.She told Radio 4’s Today programme that simple biology meant a transgender competitor would have a better ‘red blood cell count, increased lung capacity, better hand-eye co-ordination, longer limbs, denser bones, leaner muscle, bigger hearts’. Miss Davies, pictured, added: ‘Take swimming. Michael Phelps has got size 15 feet, your average female has size five or six feet, so if we were to move a man into swimming they would totally dominate all the women’s events.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"May urges EU leaders help persuade MPs Brexit deal","story":"Theresa May was in Grimsby today begging Brussels for concessions on the Irish border backstop and warned MPs who sink her deal there may be no Brexit at all if they do  The EU\u0027s chief Brexit negotiator outlined his position on Twitter.

That has been repeated across many people, with many developers.’ Mr Brokenshire’s comments will heap further pressure on housebuilders such as Taylor Wimpey and Persimmon, which have faced fierce criticism for selling toxic leasehold homes while raking in record profits.Persimmon, which last month revealed profits of more than £1billion, already faces losing its right to sell homes under the Government’s Help To Buy scheme – mainly aimed at first-time buyers – because of concerns about its practices.Last night a CMA spokesman said: ‘The issues around ground rent clauses are well known and a market study would shed little further light.‘We have worked closely with the Government and are continuing to build on our work to help people buying or renting property get a fair deal.’An SRA spokesman said: ‘People who feel they have been let down by their solicitor when buying leasehold property can complain to their law firm or to us.’A spokesman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government declined to comment last night. "},{"url":null,"title":"Birmingham tattoo artist 26 inked face day different job","story":"    Kayleigh Peach, 26, had the word \u0027cursed\u0027 tattooed above her eye on her first day as a tattoo assistant          She wanted her first tattoo to be so visible so that she would never have to do another job          The Birmingham artist\u0027s chest tattoo was a point of contention with her father who no longer wanted her to be a bridesmaid at his weddingAt 24, on her first day as an apprentice tattoo artist, Miss Peach had her face inked for the first time so she would never leave her dream job.She told The BBC: \u0027I got it so that I couldn\u0027t get a normal job so I would have to persevere with what I was doing.\u0027I definitely get some looks.

He feels any UK extension would have to be conditional on a satisfactory explanation from May  as to what she will do with the extra time. Photograph: Reuters The prospect that the UK will seek an extension to the Brexit negotiation process, whether or not a deal can be sealed by British prime minister Theresa May in the next few days, has risen significantly.Ambassadors from the other 27 EU states have begun to consider the ramifications of what will be far from an automatic process. An extension under article 50 prior to the UK’s departure may be requested by the UK, but an extension and its duration must be approved unanimously by the 27 – the simple act of the House of Commons next week demanding more time will not make it happen. Under one scenario, the process is likely to be straightforward and uncontentious. Should May secure support for the withdrawal agreement and seek time to pass the implementing legislation – what has been called a “technical” extension – then approval from the 27 is likely to be easily forthcoming. However, what makes ambassadors and EU leaders nervous is the likelihood of a demand from the UK in the event of May being defeated of more time either to renegotiate a deal or to put the issue to a second popular ballot. France’s President Emmanuel Macron has publicly made clear what many leaders feel, that such an extension would have to be conditional on a satisfactory explanation from May – who is increasingly distrusted in Europe – as to what she will do with the extra time, and that it will result in a definitive decision about UK membership one way or another. Such an assurance will be far from easy as May has clearly not got control of her parliament. And leaders have seen how MPs have been willing to run down the clock to defer decisions, and fear that an extension will simply allow further indefinite prevarication. Financial yearThere are different views about how long any conditional extension might be, with most, including Ireland, favouring only two to three months, while Germany is reported to have suggested nine months to the end of the financial year. A suggestion for a 21-month extension – effectively to the end of and replacing transition – is reported to have been floated by European Commission secretary general Martyn Selmayr, but is widely seen as a ploy to scare Brexiteers into voting for the withdrawal agreement for fear that Brexit might be indefinitely postponed. One major complicating factor is the European Parliament elections due on May 23rd. The prospect of having to contest these if the UK is still a member, if only to elect very temporary members, fills British politicians with dread – not least because the board could potentially be swept by Brexit-supporting candidates, further destabilising the mainstream parties and injecting a dangerous new dynamic into the incomplete Brexit process. Should the UK’s extension to article 50 last beyond May 23rd, or more significantly July 1st, the treaty requires that MEP elections take place in the UK. It is argued by some that were these not to take place the new parliament – which will meet for the first time on July 2nd – might be deemed by the courts to be improperly constituted, and if so its acts might all be declared illegal.Yet while all are agreed that the elections are mandatory for the UK if it is still a member, the legal services of the EU institutions have come to a common, less cataclysmic interpretation. They agree that to suggest that one member state should be able hold the parliament hostage by refusing to conduct elections would be so absurd as to be legally unarguable. British limboThat means crucial early tasks for MEPs – such as approving a European Commission president and interrogating a new batch of nominated commissioners – should be able to carry on uninterrupted despite the British limbo. Ultimately, however, the courts would almost certainly be asked to decide the issue, if only by disgruntled voters in the UK deprived of their vote. Former Ukip leader Nigel Farrage is said to already have briefed his lawyers. Should the UK decide not to contest the polls, it is likely that after July 2nd the commission would, as the defender of the treaty, be under an obligation to take infringement proceedings to prove the UK was responsible for depriving citizens of their rights. Some have argued the alternative to the UK conducting elections would be for the British government to simply nominate people to fill the vacancies, as happens at present in the gap between new states joining, most recently with Croatia, and the next European election. Not so, say EU lawyers.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

I request to the British people, please forgive her.Ms Begum’s father pointed out that she was a child when she left Britain to join Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil) in 2015.Speaking from his home in the village of Dovroy, in north-eastern Bangladesh, he told the BBC: She was underage at that time, she couldn\u0027t understand that much. I suppose someone influenced her to do that. I admit that she might have done wrong without realising it.Mr Ali urged the British government and public to take her back and punish her if she had done any mistake.Shamima Begum\u0026#39s father Ahmed Ali urged the British government and public to \u0026#34take her back and punish her if she had done any mistake\u0026#34.He said he had “no idea” how his daughter had come to be radicalised by Isil, saying he only visited London for between two and four months at a time.The time I stayed with Shamima, I never felt any such behaviour of going to Syria or joining IS.Mr Javid has been condemned for refusing to allow Ms Begum to return to the UK with her child, named Jarrah.She has blamed terrible conditions in Syria’s refugee camps for the deaths of two of her previous children.In three months, more than 100 people have died on the way, or soon after, arriving at the camp, with two-thirds of those aged under five.Sajid Javid has been condemned for refusing to allow Ms Begum to return to the UK with her child, named Jarrah.Dal Babu, a former politan Police chief superintendent and a friend of Ms Begum\u0027s family, said: We\u0027ve failed, as a country, to safeguard the child. This was an entirely avoidable death of a British citizen.There was no attempt to help by the Home Office. I think it\u0027s shocking how the home secretary has treated this situation.Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, also criticised the actions of the Home Office.She tweeted: It is against international law to make someone stateless, and now an innocent child has died as a result of a British woman being stripped of her citizenship. This is callous and inhumane.On Friday, before the death of Ms Begum’s baby was confirmed, Mr Javid said: Sadly there are probably many children, obviously perfectly innocent, who have been born in this war zone.I have nothing but sympathy for the children that have been dragged into this.This is a reminder of why it is so, so dangerous for anyone to be in this war zone.Couple arrested in Iran for shopping centre marriage proposalKnife crime offenders evade justice as murder rates soarBodies of British climber Tom Ballard and his Italian partner found in PakistanAdnan Syed, of Serial podcast, denied new trial by Maryland courtVladimir Putin rides unruly horse for International Women\u0026#39s Day eventComment: Politicians don\u0026#39t lie as much as you\u0026#39d think, they\u0026#39re actually far more slippery than thatIsraeli former general Benny Gantz silently rising in the polls as Netanyahu destroys himselfMartha Stewart switches cherry pie for pot as she enters the booming cannabis businessDuchess of Sussex loses third key aide in just months Explorer who spent 60 days living on the streets for Channel 4 documentary says some beggars made £200 a nightThe search for justice for the \u0026#39stolen children\u0026#39 of communist East GermanyComment: Mrs May’s deal is our only way out of the EU, Brexiteers have to take itComment: From knife crime to \u0026#39sex addiction\u0026#39, our urge to pathologise is destroying personal responsibilityQueen speaks of \u0026#39confidence and optimism\u0026#39 thanks to stable links with Commonwealth on 70th anniversaryExclusive: India\u0026#39s most wanted man Nirav Modi - accused of £1.5bn fraud - living openly in LondonNorth Korea \u0026#39poised to conduct new missile test\u0026#39Actor Idris Elba pleads for an end to \u0026#39stupid\u0026#39 knife crimeComment: Revealed: How the Foreign Office kept the door open to staying in the EEA as a no-deal Brexit Plan B \u0026#39Megbot\u0026#39 army linked to Russian conspiracy theories tweeting \u0026#39obsessive\u0026#39 support for Duchess, says report Silver Spitfire – The Longest Flight: Do you have a Spitfire part in your garden shed?We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"politicians dont lie much think actually far slippery","story":"As the board game Diplomacy proves, the real skill of MPs is to avoid outright liesWhen I tell people that I am playing Diplomacy with a group of MPs, the usual response from non-politicians is: “Ah, they must make good liars.” In fact, almost the opposite is true: the real skill of an MP is to avoid outright lies.Diplomacy, for those who don’t know it, is the nastiest strategy game ever devised.

At one point during the event, Putin\u0027s horse walked backwards which he was seemingly unable to stop.They cantered gently around a training facility for horsebacked police in Moscow followed by other uniformed officers riding in rows.Putin afterwards gave the police officers a horse named Golden Ray, Russian news agencies reported.Ahead of International Women\u0027s Day on Friday, Putin said women were increasingly taking an interest in working in law enforcement agencies and that just over a quarter of employees at the Interior Ministry were now women.Pollsters say Putin\u0027s ratings have dipped recently due to years of falling real incomes and an unpopular move by the government last year to raise the retirement age.Couple arrested in Iran for shopping centre marriage proposalKnife crime offenders evade justice as murder rates soarBodies of British climber Tom Ballard and his Italian partner found in PakistanAdnan Syed, of Serial podcast, denied new trial by Maryland courtComment: Politicians don\u0026#39t lie as much as you\u0026#39d think, they\u0026#39re actually far more slippery than thatIsraeli former general Benny Gantz silently rising in the polls as Netanyahu destroys himselfMartha Stewart switches cherry pie for pot as she enters the booming cannabis business\u0026#39Please forgive her\u0026#39: Shamima Begum\u0026#39s father apologises to Britain on her behalfDuchess of Sussex loses third key aide in just months The search for justice for the \u0026#39stolen children\u0026#39 of communist East GermanyExplorer who spent 60 days living on the streets for Channel 4 documentary says some beggars made £200 a nightComment: Mrs May’s deal is our only way out of the EU, Brexiteers have to take itComment: From knife crime to \u0026#39sex addiction\u0026#39, our urge to pathologise is destroying personal responsibilityQueen speaks of \u0026#39confidence and optimism\u0026#39 thanks to stable links with Commonwealth on 70th anniversaryExclusive: India\u0026#39s most wanted man Nirav Modi - accused of £1.5bn fraud - living openly in LondonNorth Korea \u0026#39poised to conduct new missile test\u0026#39Actor Idris Elba pleads for an end to \u0026#39stupid\u0026#39 knife crimeComment: Revealed: How the Foreign Office kept the door open to staying in the EEA as a no-deal Brexit Plan B \u0026#39Megbot\u0026#39 army linked to Russian conspiracy theories tweeting \u0026#39obsessive\u0026#39 support for Duchess, says report Silver Spitfire – The Longest Flight: Do you have a Spitfire part in your garden shed?We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/03/06/16/Corbyn.jpg","title":"jeremy corbyn economic policies wealth inequality","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

Most were friendly\u0026nbspand willing to have a chat, and several shared stories. One, though, stood out resolutely as always not wanting to know.\u0026nbspWhile I knew left-wing MPs and was able to share a cup of tea or a beer with them, Jeremy Corbyn remained aloof. Attempts to engage with him came to nought.\u0026nbspIt wasn’t personal. I checked with colleagues and journalists at other papers, and he would not talk to them either. His preferred contact was with the Morning Star. The rest of us, it seems, were puppets of the capitalist money-making machine.\u0026nbspReading Tom Bower’s insightful new biography,\u0026nbspDangerous Hero:\u0026nbspCorbyn’s Ruthless Plot for Power, I was reminded of his isolation and single-mindedness.

The group lists its purpose as the following: “To increase awareness of issues surrounding the dairy industry and focus on economic issues affecting the dairy industry and producers.”It’s a memory that has stayed. Talk to business people and they cite their fear of John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor. Corbyn, they dismiss as lacking the intellect and robustness of his lieutenant. But that’s the point, as Bower makes clear –\u0026nbspCorbyn is the leader, the orchestrator, the politician who has travelled a long, singular road to the top. He may not have the academic qualifications, he may seem to lack gravitas and at times appear woolly. He is undoubtedly surrounded by people sharper and brighter than he is, like McDonnell. None of it matters. They answer to him.\u0026nbspThere is a fascinating section in Bower’s book that focuses on Corbyn’s economic beliefs. What makes it especially interesting is because it’s rare for Corbyn to expound on domestic policy –\u0026nbsphe’s much more at home discussing a conflict between socialist rebels and an incumbent administration in some far-flung territory.\u0026nbspCorbyn believes that the UK wealthy do not pay enough tax. Writes Bower, he would like a return to the James Callaghan era, when the country’s richest paid a top rate of 98 per cent tax on income. Bower tries to counter that with the correct assertion that the top 1 per cent of British taxpayers already contribute 27 per cent of the nation’s income tax take, and the top 10 per cent pay 59 per cent a higher proportion than the richest 10 per cent of Germany’s population pay.\u0026nbspSuch comparisons almost certainly count for little with Corbyn –\u0026nbspthe man who would rather sit on his own reading the Morning Star is not going to be easily persuaded, not least with a glance in the direction of what he must regard as the loathsomely financially corrupt and socially unjust Germany.\u0026nbspLikewise, when Corbyn proposed “people’s quantitative easing”, the printing by the Bank of England of new money sufficient to meet the government’s requirements he brushed aside the possibility that this would lead to hyperinflation, and repetition of what occurred in Weimar Germany in the 1920s, Zimbabwe after 2010, and more recently, Venezuela. He simply did not want to listen.\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn should realise Labour’s heartlands want a Final SaySimilarly, he would like to recreate a new national investment bank pumping hundreds of millions of pounds into Britain’s motor industry. The route to prosperity “is a collective process between workers, public investment and services, and yes, often innovative and creative iniduals”. You can feel the hesitancy and reluctance accompanying the citation of that last grouping.\u0026nbspIt is true that in the 1970s, Britain did make cars. But the sector now is a shadow of its former self. Worse, Nissan will not be using Sunderland to manufacture its new X-Trail SUV, and Honda in Swindon has signalled its intention to shut completely.\u0026nbspIt’s as if Corbyn has failed to register the onset of globalisation, the closure of factories across the land caused by cheaper labour and greater productivity elsewhere, and the fact that a large measure of what success Britain has achieved economically in the last few decades is down to the growth of the City of London and financial services.\u0026nbspIn his eyes, the City was to blame for the crisis of 2008 and its aftermath. That may be so but he chooses to discount the explosion in jobs in finance and the success it enjoyed before and since. Indeed, without the City, the UK would be in far worse shape.\u0026nbspBut the rose-tinted spectacles of this class warrior only see romance in metal-bashing and the honest sweat and toil of the shop floor. Quite how he intends to deal with the advent of the likes of artificial intelligence, robots and 3D printing is not clear.Reading Bower, you’re left in no doubt that Corbyn wants to turn the clock back, that his solution to those problematic examples and awkward developments that upset his path is merely to ignore them. This makes him very dangerous indeed, hard to reason with, oblivious to criticism and\u0026nbspset in his ways. It’s a troubling account, one that should give every entrepreneur pause and anyone who works in business pause. I want to scream and tell Corbyn to follow current events in Venezuela, and examine the chaos and strife that have befallen that country. I would, I fear, be wasting my time.\u0026nbspChris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational, and communications advisory firmWe’ll tell you what’s true.

A street is marked “dark @ night” and another “hangout spot”. The groups are identifying what’s already available in neighbourhoods and what is desirable. It is part of the social action lab, a project with the British Council and the University of Central Lancashire to encourage Preston residents to become more active within their communities by offering them seed funding to develop projects.\u0026nbspThe social action lab, which brings together artists, community activists and residents, is exactly the kind of thing Ruth Heritage hoped to support in Preston when she opened the People’s Production Lab in November 2017. The next step is to turn the many businesses and artists\u0026nbspworking within the Lab into a cooperative, owned and run by the people who work there, to make it sustainable.\u0026nbspThe design secrets of the UK’s biggest cooperativeCould co-operative shops be the answer to expensive organic foods?Preston has become a testing ground for a new way to run a local economy. The “Preston model” is rooted in the development of cooperatives, or businesses owned by workers, rather than shareholders in remote locations looking to extract value with stocks and idends.Cooperative startups have been shown to be more resilient during times of economic stress. While 44 per cent of new businesses survive their early years, 80 per cent of cooperatives go on to thrive, according to a 2018 report on the cooperative economy by Cooperatives UK.\u0026nbspPreston Council has just announced up to £1m in funding to support the development of cooperatives in the area. The funding will come from Preston City Council, the University of Central Lancashire and the Open Society Foundations, which was started by hedge fund billionaire George Soros. It will create 10 new cooperatives, owned and run by workers in Preston, building on the work of community businesses with ambitions to become cooperatives, like the People’s Production Lab and others.\u0026nbsp“We want to provide equitable employment for graduates in the first instance,” says Mark Porter, a senior lecturer in web design at the University of Central Lancashire who is starting a cooperative called Preston Digital Foundation.\u0026nbspMr Porter believes working at the People’s Production Lab will provide the basis for cooperation between cooperatives, one of the seven basic principles of working in this way. “Our next steps are to complete the registration process to get the coop up and running in time for summer and the next cohort of graduates and enable us to start generating revenue.”Heritage started producing and commissioning arts and culture in Preston a decade ago under the name They Eat Culture. She began to imagine a fully-equipped creative space for the people of Preston, where digital businesses and artists could share resources and work together. In 2017, Michael Conlon, the manager of a local construction firm, suggested Heritage take on the multi-storey building at 55 Guildhall Street in the town centre. The building, previously used as offices by Lancashire County Council, had been empty since the departure of a faith school.\u0026nbspWithin a year, Heritage and They Eat Culture have transformed the commercial building into creative spaces. Peering through the windows, I see white walls of former corporate spaces\u0026nbspfilled with equipment for a\u0026nbspwood shop and tool library, a co-working space with desks and chairs donated by a local solicitor, a hack space with 3D printers and a sound studio with a green screen for video work. Art hangs from a washing line from the ceiling of one of the offices\u0026nbsp– now a screen printing studio. In the hallway, Heritage gets inside a makeshift photo-booth that went on tour with accompanying interview cards saying “talk to me about crime” and “talk to me about loneliness”.“There are artists studios and shared spaces in Preston, but we’re trying to evolve a way of creating shared facilities that people can use rather than inidual spaces,” Heritage says.Anthony King runs a startup screen printing studio called Priestown Press from the People’s Production Lab. “I was out of work for quite a while after some surgery,” King says. “My wife suggested I get back into art. The Lab has allowed us to expand and have the space to be artists. It’s subsidised, so it’s beneficial for artists who are struggling. There aren’t that many in Preston.”Priestown Press prints garments for street artists in Preston and London. Through the social action lab, King has been working on turning the studio into a community resource and a place for art therapy.\u0026nbsp“It’s evolving into a social enterprise,” King says. “Especially for mental health, art can be very therapeutic. Suicide is on the rise among men and younger people, so if we can do projects that get kids doing things, rather than keeping themselves to themselves, then it can only help.”Tom Stables is the chair of Digital Lancashire, a non-profit organisation that supports the digital economy in Lancashire. Stables says the area is already home to multiple agencies, software houses and creative enterprises. Digital Lancashire has worked with accountants and TV companies, helping them develop their digital clientele and acquire funding to expand.\u0026nbspStables is considering basing Digital Lancashire within the People’s Production Lab where it can nurture partnerships with other businesses. “Having the People’s Production Lab on our doorstep is terrific,” he says. “As well as being a place that our board meet, a number of our members have the space to grow and thrive.”Heritage talks breathlessly of plans for live storytelling projects, comedy programmes developing new talent, a community culture guide and a vegan pop-up experience. “I want there to be a lot of action on the ground,” she says. “Preston has been held back by being off the beaten track and by not having relationships with central government but the tide is turning. The time is now.”We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

Norway has sought to project an image as a responsible environmental steward while pumping millions of barrels of oil and gas.Catherine Howarth, chief executive of ShareAction, said Norway\u0027s announcement showed that investors are growing impatient\u0026nbspwith oil exploration companies.Institutional investors are withdrawing their capital from oil and gas companies on the grounds that quicker-than-expected growth in clean energy and associated regulation is making oil and gas business models highly vulnerable.This announcement will put pressure on investors to ramp up their engagement with integrated oil majors ahead of the AGM season.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

They killed many of the 123 British soldiers and 42 Royal Ulster Constabulary police who died there\u0026nbspbetween 1970 and 1997. Described by British home secretary Mervyn Rees as “bandit country”, the area\u0026nbspwas so dangerous for British forces personnel that they only travelled by helicopter. \u0026nbspBritain Before Brexit: a portrait of Northern IrelandThose lethal wires linked to explosives are long gone thanks to the Good Friday Agreement (GFA) of 1998, but in a broader sense the 310-mile-long border that ides Northern Ireland from the Irish Republic itself constitutes a trip wire which, if touched or interfered with in any way, has the capacity to trigger a political explosion that could end 20 years of peace.\u0026nbspThe removal of the physical border with its hundreds of blocked and cratered roads and blown bridges, channelling traffic through a few heavily guarded military checkpoints, was an essential part of the GFA.Protestants and Catholics, unionists and nationalist communities, which each make up about half of the 1.9 million population of Northern Ireland, could choose to be British or Irish without either being able to dominate the other. A stable balance of power between the two was held in place by an elaborate structure of institutions and laws negotiated by the leading nationalist and unionist parties of the day and buttressed by the British and Irish governments\u0026nbspacting in cooperation along with the EU.\u0026nbspThis structure has maintained a hard-won peace for over two decades, but it is now crumbling under the impact of Brexit. The referendum of 2016 opened the way for – indeed made it difficult to avoid – the resurrection of the border as an international frontier between an Irish Republic as a member of the EU, with all its rules and regulations, and the UK determined to be outside it.\u0026nbspThe radicalism and gravity of what is proposed by the Brexiteers is masked by mumbo-jumbo about “backstops”, “hard borders”\u0026nbspand “max fac” (maximum facilitation) borders that will somehow be automatically monitored by technical gadgetry which, though\u0026nbspyet to be invented, will apparently be sure to make any human presence unnecessary.The debate about the “backstop”\u0026nbspin the UK ignores the political and demographic realities on the ground in Northern Ireland.Ryanair boss calls May and Corbyn ‘idiots’ and demands end to BrexitThe threat to a hard border is often portrayed as coming from dissident Republican groups that never accepted the GFA.But these are small, fragmented, under surveillance by MI5 and lack popular nationalist support. More likely are spontaneous protests by farmers and local people on the border determined to prevent an international frontier once again cutting through their neighbourhoods.\u0026nbspAll this stuff about bar codes and cameras is nonsense because only the good guys will obey them.\u0026nbspMuch of the border runs through land populated (on both sides) by a majority of Catholics and nationalists.\u0026nbspAny new barrier would probably in practice require the deployment of military force.After all, the EU is like a club which requires porters at the door to keep non-members out\u0026nbsp– or ensure that, if they do enter, they abide by the club’s rules and regulations. In the case of\u0026nbspNorthern Ireland, s at the gate would be customs and other regulatory officials, but these could not be stationed there in the face of local nationalist opposition without police protection and the police would not come without the deployment of the British Army, which\u0026nbspwould presumably operate from a network of fortified positions,\u0026nbsppotentially even\u0026nbspblocking many of the 300 roads crossing the border – as they did in the past.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThe “backstop” is portrayed as an insurance policy under which all of the UK would remain in the customs union if the UK and EU cannot agree some other way of avoiding a “hard border”. But the latter could not be recreated without reigniting the Northern Ireland conflict, something that neither nationalists nor unionists want to happen, but that might be brought about by the momentum of events, just\u0026nbspas it was in Northern Ireland in 1968-69.\u0026nbspSome supporters of Brexit argue naively that the UK government could solve the problem by allowing almost free passage of people and vehicles and relying on cooperation and goodwill to ensure that their passage, and the goods they carry, will be registered electronically.Feeney is scathing about such plans, saying: “All this stuff about bar codes and cameras is nonsense because only the good guys will obey them. The rest would cross the border from Cavan and Monaghan where there are no bar codes or anything else.”Cheap but illegal Brazilian beef and American chicken would thus flood out of the UK and into the EU through the unguarded Northern Ireland breach in its defences. The EU could not permit a trade deal with the\u0026nbspUK that allowed Northern Ireland to become a smugglers’ paradise.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

Total constitutional constipation. Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.But the problem of the Irish border is not primarily about trade and commerce, important though these may be.What is really at issue here – and the “backstop” is unwittingly at the centre of this – is the shifting balance of power between the Catholics and Protestants on the island of\u0026nbspIreland.\u0026nbspBrexit may be isive in England but is even more so in Northern Ireland because it plugs into the 400-year struggle between the two communities, a historic confrontation which over the last hundred years has\u0026nbspgained its most visible expression in the island’s partition.\u0026nbspMany observers in Northern Ireland are frightened by the seeming carelessness with which the British government and the Conservative Party have presided over the rebirth of\u0026nbspthe Irish Question. They appear to ignore its toxic legacy as an issue that has bedevilled British politics from the First Home Rule Bill in 1886 until the partition of Ireland in 1921, and again during the 30-year conflict from the first Catholic civil rights march in 1968 to the GFA in 1998. \u0026nbspThe latter agreement was under pressure but was working until the Brexit vote in the UK reopened old issues and old wounds. Northern Ireland voted Remain by 56 to 44 per cent but sectarian isions have widened.Why looming collapse of cash as a means of payment is a Brexit issueJust how bad tends to be underestimated in Westminster because British politicians, aside from Tony Blair, have traditionally had a blind spot about Ireland until things go irredeemably wrong and it is too late to do anything about them. The same is largely true of the British media according to commentators in Belfast.“Those that covered the conflict 20 years ago catch on pretty quickly about what is happening here,” one local journalist told me. “Those that are here for the first time are completely bewildered because they don’t know what happened in the past.”\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspPeople who live in Northern Ireland have an acute sense of how problems that had been neutered, though\u0026nbspnot resolved, by the GFA are stirring into life.“I am grappling with the idea of a hard border which I would call a Second Partition of Ireland,” says Tom Hartley, a Sinn Fein veteran and former lord mayor of Belfast. He is baffled by British actions that appear so much against their interests, saying that “they had parked the Irish problem, but now Ireland has moved once again into the centre of British politics”.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

Neither the nationalist community nor Sinn Fein, which has won more than two-thirds of the nationalist vote in Northern Ireland in recent elections, wants to go back to war.Nationalists have done well out of the peace. Catholics\u0026nbspno longer face religious discrimination when it comes to jobs, housing and justice, as they did in 1968.Irish TV host tears up as she lists Troubles victims in Brexit warningSinn Fein are conscious that demographically the nationalist community is growing faster than the loyalist one:\u0026nbspalready 51 per cent of school children are Catholics compared to 37 per cent who are Protestants. Within two years, the Catholics may be the majority of the voting population, though this does not necessarily guarantee political power.I lived in Belfast between 1972 and 1975 writing a PhD about Joe Devlin, the northern nationalist leader in the first decades of the 20th century, at the Institute of Irish Studies which was part\u0026nbspof Queens University. These were the worst years of the Troubles. In 1972 alone some 479 people were killed, including 135 soldiers, and 4,876 were injured.Everybody in Northern Ireland has a lot to lose and not a lot to gain, but some of the most important struts of the agreement that established long term peace have been cut away by the British government in pursuit of BrexitI got used to the sounds of bombs and gunfire and the sectarian geography of Belfast became imprinted on my brain. Along with the rest of the population, I automatically calculated the real proximity of danger without giving the matter much thought.I once showed a visiting American publisher around the city and, years later, he told me that he had been struck by one moment during our tour when he had queried me about the route we were taking, saying: “I thought you said this street was dangerous?” And I had replied, as if stating the obvious: “No, I said that that side of the street was dangerous, but the side we are on is safe.”\u0026nbspAlmost everything is safe in Belfast today, though the sectarian boundaries are largely the same as they were 50 years ago.I drove through the site of Harland and Wolff shipyard that at its peak employed 35,000 men, almost all Protestants from east Belfast. Today it is the site of the Titanic exhibition which is, along with other developments, dwarfed by the enormous yellow gantry crane marked H \u0026amp W in giant letters. Housing is, and has always been, segregated in Belfast and east Belfast remains a Protestant stronghold, aside from a small Republican nationalist enclave called Short Strand pressed up against the Lagan river. It is protected by one of the many peace lines or walls in the city topped by metal staves.“They got higher when the Protestants discovered catapults,” said a local observer, who pointed to the grills over the windows and the slates on the roofs that look normal but are made out of metal so they do not break when stones hurled over the peace wall hit them.\u0026nbspI once had a shabby flat off the Antrim Road in north Belfast, but I could not remember the name of the street. This used to be a particularly murderous part of Belfast because of the jigsaw puzzle of Protestant and Catholic districts permanently engaged in low level war against each other, most often in the shape of tit-for-tat or retaliatory killings.“Get your retaliation in first,” was an old Belfast joke, though retaliation was not necessarily local. If a Catholic was killed in Short Strand where the Catholics were weak and outnumbered, then the retaliatory killing of a Protestant might be arranged from Ardoyne, where the Catholics were strong and well organised.Likewise, if a Protestant UDR (Ulster Defence Regiment) soldier was shot by the IRA in County Fermanagh 70 miles to the west, there might be a tit-for-tat revenge murder of a Catholic in Belfast.\u0026nbspPeace may have come but militant commemorative murals showing fallen heroes and historic scenes on the side walls of houses are repainted every few years.“The Republican ones became rather ethereal a few years ago, but now they are showing more guns,” commented a friend. One enormous mural on a wall in the Ardoyne shows a wounded James Connolly, the socialist leader, in the GPO in Dublin during the Easter Rising in 1916. \u0026nbspDerry Girls and MPs stage Northern Ireland abortion protestWhy abortion remains illegal in Northern IrelandMPs urge government to redraft new domestic abuse billElaborate\u0026nbspcommemorative shrines to fallen Republican martyrs, who died fighting the British security forces, are common all over west Belfast, the political heart of the northern nationalist community. But the British Army fortresses in the area have all gone, the places where they once stood used for public housing or community centres. The Falls Road, which\u0026nbspused to be one of the world’s most menacing streets, looks spruce and cheerful with fewer closed shops than most British cities.I had mostly lived close to Queens University during my three years in Belfast, but when I went back the houses along University Road had been demolished, which was no great loss, and replaced with better looking buildings. The pub where I used to drink, the Club Bar, had been replaced, so far as I could see, by a small Tesco store.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCould Belfast and Northern Ireland go back to the three-cornered battle between Protestants, Catholics and the British security forces which I had witnessed?Everybody in Northern Ireland has a lot to lose and not a lot to gain, but some of the most important struts of the agreement\u0026nbspthat established long-term peace have been cut away by the British government in pursuit of Brexit or because some in its ranks see the GFA as a Labour project that mistakenly diluted British control over Northern Ireland. \u0026nbspThe bits of the GFA that have been abandoned are important.\u0026nbspThe British government is meant to be neutral between unionists and nationalists so as to enable it to play a mediating role between the two communities. David Cameron and later Theresa May have shown their support for the unionists, a bias that became total when Ms May\u0026nbspbecame reliant on the DUP for her parliamentary majority.Similarly, the British and Irish governments were supposed to cooperate if local power sharing arrangements failed, as they have\u0026nbspbut the government has shown increasing hostility to the nationalists in the north and to any role by the Dublin government.The most destabilising factor in Northern Ireland today is the British government itself.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Norway has sought to project an image as a responsible environmental steward while pumping millions of barrels of oil and gas.Catherine Howarth, chief executive of ShareAction, said Norway\u0027s announcement showed that investors are growing impatient\u0026nbspwith oil exploration companies.Institutional investors are withdrawing their capital from oil and gas companies on the grounds that quicker-than-expected growth in clean energy and associated regulation is making oil and gas business models highly vulnerable.This announcement will put pressure on investors to ramp up their engagement with integrated oil majors ahead of the AGM season.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

This\u0026nbspallowed\u0026nbspthe screen to blend into the wall behind it.TVs are turns on for only five hours a day on average, yet they occupy a large space on the wall in the living room,\u0026nbspthe firm\u0026nbspsaid at the time.\u0026nbspThis means TVs hang on the wall just as a black screen for more than 19 hours every day. With a TV turned off, it is easier to see dust or fingerprints on the screen – especially when the screen is large.Efforts to minimise the visual impact of wires trailing behind the TV have also been made previously, with high-end sets now shipping with Samsung\u0027s OneConnect box.Galaxy Fold: Samsung plans two more foldable phonesIt works by combining all the wires into one cable that can be threaded relatively tidily up to the TV.\u0026nbspSamsung already makes use of wireless power technology in some of its devices, including its flagship range of Galaxy S10 smartphones.There is no word yet on when a wireless television\u0026nbspmight be released and Samsung does not comment on rumours surrounding unreleased products.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is now\u0026nbspcounting on SpaceX and Boeing to start launching astronauts this year.\u0026nbspFriday morning’s splashdown was the final hurdle of SpaceX’s six-day test flight.Minutes earlier, Crew Dragon deployed its four parachutes successfully.“Everything happened just perfectly, right on time the way that we expected it to,” Benjamin Reed, SpaceX\u0026nbspdirector of crew mission management, said in a live stream from California.The test mission was a crucial milestone in a government programme that paves the way for SpaceX’s first crewed test flight. The flight is due to take place in July with astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken.SpaceX launches historic test flight for future manned missions“This really is an American achievement that s many generations of Nasa administrators and over a decade of work by the Nasa team,” said Nasa\u0026nbspadministrator Jim Bridenstine after the splash-down.Steve\u0026nbspStich, also from Nasa, said: “The vehicle is doing well. The recovery crews are out.”A boat was ready in the area where Dragon hit the Atlantic and was set to lift our the 16ft spacecraft using a crane. It will reach land with the craft on Sunday.The first-of-a-kind mission brought 400lbs of test equipment to the space station, including a dummy named Ripley fitted with sensors around its head, neck, and spine to monitor how a flight would feel for a human.The space station’s three-member crew greeted the capsule last Sunday, with US\u0026nbspastronaut Anne McClain and Canadian astronaut David Saint-Jacques entering Crew Dragon’s cabin to carry out air quality tests and inspections.Nasa\u0026nbsphas awarded SpaceX and Boeing Co a total of $6.8bn (£5bn) to build competing rocket and capsule systems to launch astronauts into orbit from American soil, something not possible since the US Space Shuttle was retired from service in 2011.The launch systems are aimed at ending US\u0026nbspreliance on Russian Soyuz rockets for $80m-per-seat rides to the $100bn\u0026nbsporbital research laboratory, which flies about 250 miles above earth.Bridenstine told Reuters the cost per seat on the Boeing or SpaceX systems would be lower than for the shuttle or Soyuz.Privately owned SpaceX was founded in 2002 by Elon Musk, who is also a co-founder of electric car maker Tesla.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The UK has put forward clear new proposals. We now need to agree a balanced solution that can work for both sides.”The offer by Mr Barnier for a unilateral exit for Great Britain, but not Northern Ireland effectively lets the UK revert to the original EU plan for the backstop – which would have put customs checks on the Irish sea between Northern Ireland and the mainland.PM says Brexit could be cancelled in last-ditch plea to MPs- liveTheresa May should be offering Brexit concessions to EU, says Irish PMMay says \u0027we may never leave the EU\u0027 if MPs reject her Brexit dealThat plan was scrapped for\u0026nbspthe current UK-wide backstop after months of lobbying by the British side, but when it was taken back to MPs, they rejected that too – with Brexiteers worried that it would trap the UK inside a customs union with the EU.Michel Barnier laid out the proposals in a series of tweets on Friday afternoon – an unusual move but one which came after Ms May’s speech which challenged the EU to give ground.“The EU commits to give UK the option to exit the single customs territory unilaterally, while the other elements of the backstop must be maintained to avoid a hard border. UK will not be forced into a customs union against its will,” he said.He added that the\u0026nbsparbitration panel already included in the withdrawal agreement can,\u0026nbsp“under Article 178 of the withdrawal agreement, give the UK the right to a proportionate suspension of its obligations under the backstop, as a last resort, if EU breaches its best endeavoursgood faith obligations to negotiate alternative solutions”.Gentiloni: \u0027Brexit biggest mistake by a European country since war’He said the bloc would also “give legal force to all commitments from the January letter from the European Council president and European Commission president through joint interpretative statement”.“The EU will continue working intensively over the coming days to ensure that the UK leaves the EU with an agreement,” he concluded.In her speech in Grimsby on Friday, the prime minister turned her fire on European leaders demanding they make a move to get the Brexit negotiations moving again.She said: “European leaders tell me they worry that time is running out, and that we only have one chance to get it right. My message to them is: now is the moment for us to act.“We have worked hard together over two years on the deal. It is a comprehensive deal that provides for an orderly exit from the EU, and that sets a platform for an ambitious future relationship.“It needs just one more push, to address the final specific concerns of our parliament. So let’s not hold back. Let’s do what is necessary for MPs to back the deal on Tuesday.”On that day the House of Commons will again vote on Ms May’s Brexit deal – after rejecting it last time by a historic margin of defeat. If the agreement is rejected again the government has promised to give MPs votes on whether to rule out a no-deal Brexit, and whether to extend article 50. These votes are expected on Wednesday and Thursday of this week respectively.Polling commissioned by The  and conducted by Ipsos MRBI shows Northern Irish votes overwhelmingly reject a hard Brexit, and that 67 per cent think the DUP is doing a bad job of representing Northern Ireland in\u0026nbspWestminster.\u0026nbsp69 per cent of Northern Irish people – including 57 of those with a protestant background, say they are dissatisfied with DUP leader Arlene Foster. Notably, more voters favour checks on goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland than do\u0026nbspchecks at the Irish border.Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar\u0026nbspsaid on Friday morning that it should be Theresa May offering the UK concessions if she wanted changes to the withdrawal agreement. He said talks were really “a question of what they are willing to offer us” and that he withdrawal agreement as it stood was “already a compromise” that had taken a year and a half to negotiate.We’ll tell you what’s true.

There can be no more playing for time.”EU says Britain can leave backstop but Northern Ireland must stayHowever, he also insisted Labour was not “obsessed” by Brexit like other parties – pointing to poverty and climate change as the issues that really matter.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliament“Turn on the news at the moment and you’ll hear endlessly about constitutional issues. Brexit. Independence. It borders on the obsessive,” he told a conference in Dundee.“You don’t hear so much about the children arriving hungry to school or how the teachers at one nursery have had to arrange for Tesco and Greggs to donate their leftovers so they can feed the kids.”On climate change, Mr Corbyn said: “Fundamentally the destruction of our climate is a class issue.“It’s working class communities that suffer the worst pollution and the worst air quality. It’s working class people who will lose their jobs as resources run dry.“And it’s working class people who will be left behind as the rich escape rising sea levels.”Theresa May should be offering Brexit concessions to EU, says Irish PMMay says ‘we may never leave the EU’ if MPs reject her Brexit dealWhy can’t EU and UK find a solution to the Irish backstop controversy?Strip Home Office of immigration policy post-Brexit, report suggestsGordon Brown calls for year-long Brexit delayNevertheless, the dismissal of Brexit as for “obsessives” will alarm Labour MPs desperate for Mr Corbyn to swing indisputably behind the campaign for a Final Say referendum.He made only a passing reference to backing “a public vote to prevent disaster”, while insisting: “We favour a general election. We’ll push for our alternative plan.”The government is braced for another heavy defeat on Tuesday, having failed to win concessions from the EU to solve the Irish border controversy.MPs have then been promised a vote to veto a no-deal Brexit and, after doing that, a vote to delay it by extending the Article 50 process beyond 29 March.If the Commons rejects all options next week, it could leave space for the prime minister to have a third go at passing her deal – particularly if the alternative is a long delay imposed by Brussels.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Political editor Joe Watts explain whyClick to followIndy PoliticsGeoffrey Cox has found himself in the growing dictionary of BrexitismsThere was a bizarre moment in the Commons on Thursday when MPs appeared more concerned with an item of Tudor attire that covered a man’s dignity, than they were with governing the country.The codpiece, as modelled by Henry VIII in almost any portrait, is a sort of upturned pouch designed to shield and also draw attention to a gentleman’s crotch.But the word’s vague similarity\u0026nbspto\u0026nbspattorney general Geoffrey Cox’s surname\u0026nbspand to a particular legal device, means it has now entered the growing dictionary of Brexitisms that afflicts our news copy.Phrases such as “the Malthouse compromise”, “the Brady amendment”, “Canada plus, plus, plus”, “Maximum Facilitation”, “Max Fac 2”, \u0026nbsp“the backstop” and “the backstop to the backstop” will now be joined by “Cox’s codpiece”.It manifested out of Cox’s efforts to secure a new addition to Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement – he wants to use a legal instrument to create\u0026nbspa legally binding way for the UK government to say it wants Britain to leave the dreaded “backstop”\u0026nbsp(an arrangement the UK could otherwise be trapped in indefinitely if it fails to secure a future trade deal with the EU by 2020).Created with Sketch.

Total constitutional constipation. Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.But the device he is seeking to use is in legal circles called a codicil – which no-one really knew how to say beyond a courtroom until this month – and so it was replaced with “codpiece”.The phrase finally sealed its place in the Brexit dictionary when the man himself told MPs on Thursday: “It is government policy to achieve the necessary change in the backstopBrexit department’s top civil servant to retire just as UK to leave EU“That is government policy, that is the subject of the discussions that we are having. I would say that it has come to be called ‘Cox’s codpiece’. What I am concerned to ensure is that what is inside the codpiece is in full working order.”A canny way for the attorney general to avoid answering what had actually been quite a difficult question on the government’s approach.The problem for Mr Cox is that as far as anyone can tell at this point, it does not look like his negotiations to secure a codicil or an addendum or an annexe or anything else to\u0026nbspthe agreement are going anywhere.The EU – which is adamant that the backstop in its current form should remain untouched – said that there is no solution to the impasse in sight.If Cox cannot achieve an adequate change, the government will\u0026nbspnot get the support of Tory MPs and the DUP, and the government’s deal falls.The irony maybe that, given the intransigence in Brussels, whatever the attorney general does come back with in a bid to convince Tory Eurosceptics, may represent an altogether different item of biblical attire.

The UK has put forward clear new proposals. We now need to agree a balanced solution that can work for both sides.\u0026nbspMs May had been seeking legally binding assurances that the UK could not be tied indefinitely to the EU through the backstop in an attempt to win round MPs. But in a sign ministers are preparing to go back to the Commons on Tuesday without fresh concessions, chancellor Philip Hammond said such fears about the backstop were overblown.In an interview with the Financial Times, he urged Tory MPs to back the agreement anyway, saying it would enable him to start spending the insurance fund built up in case of a no-deal break.There is nobody in the EU I\u0027ve ever come across who thinks the UK could be held in perpetuity in an arrangement that was detrimental to its interests against its will. Who is going to enforce such an arrangement on this? he said.We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

But we are still asking the SMEs and all other parties to wait. Do the necessary export to your customers before 29 March,” he told Belgian business newspaper De Tijd.Mr Vanderwaeren said larger industries “such as pharmaceutical companies and car manufacturers” had been “storing stock in the UK for months” to avoid having to get parts through after Brexit but that the vast majority of businesses were not well prepared with just weeks to go.Belgium’s main port of Zeebrugge is expected to have to deal with around a million additional import declarations and 4.5 million extra export declarations once the UK leaves the single market and customs union.Huge queues for Eurostar passengers after no-deal border checks trialThe warning follows chaos and hours of delays at Calais and the Eurostar terminal in Paris after French customs officers carried out a trial of the sort of checks they would have to impose under a no-deal Brexit.The customs chief also warned that many small businesses that dealt with the UK were simply not prepared to export and that it would be better for them to pause operations.“Our customs authority has written letters to some 20,000 companies that trade with the UK telling them they have to apply for an EORI number, which is necessary to be able to import and export,” Mr\u0026nbspVanderwaeren told the newspaper.“But today, three weeks before the Brexit, customs received only 4,700 positive answers. Customs has even set up a call centre that answers questions and calls companies to get them to register for customs licences.”France, the Netherlands\u0026nbspand Belgium have all hired hundreds of extra customs officers to deal with the potential disruption caused by the UK’s decision.Unless Article 50 is extended or revoked, Britain is set to leave on 29 March. If Theresa May’s Brexit deal is approved by MPs, the UK will enter a transition period and little will change immediately – but there are few signs the government has the numbers in the House of Commons to get it approved.If there is no extension of revocation and no transition period, the UK will crash out and the expected chaos at ports and airports will materialise.Created with Sketch.

The only other time it has been evoked by the British government was during a bitter dispute over the nationalisation of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company by Iran in the 1950s in a chain of events which ended with the overthrow of a progressive democratically elected government by Britain and the US.Created with Sketch.Revolution in Iran: in pictures Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A demonstration against the Shah in 1979Armed women on guard in one of the main squares in Tehran at the beginning of the Iranian RevolutionDemonstrators hold a poster of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, in January 1979, in Tehran, during a demonstration against the ShahIranian rebels pose with a U.S. flag they bayonetted upside down on trees at Sultanabad Garrison northeast of Tehran on February 12 2019A gun battle in Khorramshahr during the revolution, 1979Ayatollah Khomeini\u0027s supporters demonstrate in the streets of Tehran against the Shah among tear gas.

They are carrying posters of the Ayatollah Khomeini, the Iranian religious and political leaderThe Foreign Office has stated that Mr Hunt’s declaration of diplomatic protection was the first time it had occurred in “recent memory” but has not provided details of its previous use.The official response, so far, from the Iranian government has been from the country’s ambassador to the UK, Hamid Baeidinejad, who said in a tweet that the British move “contravenes int’l law”, adding that “Govts may only exercise such protection for own nationals.“As UK Govt is acutely aware, Iran does not recognize dual nationality. Irrespective of UK residency, Ms Zaghari thus remains Iranian.”The ambassador, who is not regarded as a hardliner, was restating the Iranian government’s position on dual nationality and his message is being seen by diplomats as measured and non-aggressive.But there are rising internal tensions in Iran. Donald Trump’s jettisoning of Iran’s nuclear agreement with international powers, and re-imposition of sanctions, has led to severe economic problems in the country, strengthening the hands of the conservatives who have long opposed the deal.Iran foreign minister Zarif back at work after withdrawing resignationThe isions led to the temporary resignation of the foreign minister,\u0026nbspMohammad Javad Zarif, who was the chief architect of the deal from the Iranian side. He has since stayed in his post for the time being, after President Rouhani refused to accept his resignation.British officials have privately stressed that there had been no liaison with the Rouhani government before the announcement of diplomatic protection. The decision was taken, Mr Hunt said, to demonstrate “to the whole world that Nazanin is innocent and the UK will not stand by when one of its citizens is treated so unjustly”.Diplomatic protection raises Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s situation from a consular to a state-to-state issue and also opens the door for legal action, with the possibility of compensation if it is proved that she has been mistreated.Any case would be dealt with by the International Court of Justice in The Hague. But senior British officials wanted to stress that there is no desire to go down the legal route for the time being.“We are puzzled as to why this is being done, at this time. The UK knows that there are people in Iran in responsible positions who have been trying hard to resolve this matter. Jeremy Hunt has said this himself to a lot of people, we know,” said an adviser to the Rouhani government.Mossadeq, pictured in 1951 (Getty)“It is difficult to know what this will achieve in trying to get her released. But we know that some people (hardliners) are saying this is an attempt at outside interference which must be resisted. The tactic the British are using has bad colonial meaning, especially in Iran –\u0026nbspthis is unfortunate.”Diplomatic protection was exercised by Britain for employees of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company after it became the Anglo-Persian Oil Company – which later became British Petroleum and then BP – and was nationalised by the Iranian government of Mohammed Mossadeq. The government in London took the measure after failing in a case disputing the nationalisation at the International Court in The Hague.Mr Mossadeq, democratically elected, was subsequently overthrown by a coup organised by MI6 and the CIA, codenamed Operation Ajax. Many of his supporters were tortured and his closest associate, the foreign minister Hossein Fatemi, was executed by a military court of the\u0026nbspshah of Iran whose position had been strengthened by London and Washington.In December 1953, Mr Mossadeq was sentenced to three years solitary confinement by a military court, which rejected the death sentence sought by prosecutors, supposedly at the instigation of the shah and his western advisers. The former prime minister was, however, kept under house arrest until his death in 1967.Mr Mossadeq’s funeral was forbidden by the shah’s regime and he was buried at his home. He had wished to be laid to rest in a public cemetery among victims of political violence and state oppression.We’ll tell you what’s true.

In  she had to apologise for failing to declare earnings from the show of £,.Many were surprised when she joined the  Labour leadership race, but she insisted: “If not now, when  Andnot me, who ” She came fth as Ed Miliband was elected leader.In  Abbott came third in the contest to be Labours candidate for London Mayor, which was won by Sadiq Khan.In  her old friend and left-wing ally Jeremy Corbyn became leader and she was picked for his frontbench team as Shadow International Development Secretary.It emerged Mr Corbyn and Ms Abbott had a brief fling in the s when they went on a motorcycle camping trip in Europe.Ms Abbott was made Shadow Home Secretary in Mr Corbyns frontbench reshuffle in October .She had a high-profile role in Labours  general election campaign, but was reportedly banned from going on air after a number of embarrassing gaffes.She suggested it costs £ a year to hire a policeman in an excruciating interview with LBC, and said on the Andrew Marr show changing her views on the IRA was like changing her hairstyle.She was also left tongue-tied on her policy on protecting London from terrorists in a car-crash interview with Sky.Two days before polling day she withdrew from the campaign due to illness, but later ed to her home office brief.She later blamed her gaffes on type  diabetes and out of control blood sugars.Last September she shocked viewers by using the N-word in a live interview on ITVs Good Morning Britain.She was discussing the vile racist and sexist abuse she and other MPs have received on social media.Abbott said: And when I say abuse, its not people saying you know I disagree with you about nationalising the railway, its people calling you a n***** b****, its people threatening acid attacks, its rape, its death threats.Its upsetting for me but its also upsetting for my staff who have to see all this.Amber Rudd called Diane Abbott coloured during a radio interview about online abuse.Speaking on BBC Radio s Jeremy Vine, The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions said: It is worseyoure a woman and its worst of allyoure a coloured woman.I know that Diane Abbott gets a huge amount of abuse and I think thats something that we need to continue to call out.Rudd was forced to apologise for using the outdated term, tweeting: Mortied at my clumsy language and sorry to @HackneyAbbott. My point stands: that no one should suffer abuse because of their race or gender.Abbot hit back at the use of the word which is now considered offensive.She wrote on Twitter: The term coloured is an outdated, offensive and revealing choice of words.Speaking on Question Time in November, she said: “I will say this about the second Referendum. You should be careful what you wish for.“If we had a second referendum now the same people who voted leave last time, who are not largely speaking in London, would vote leave again saying: ‘Didn’t youShadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott will promise to axe the Government’s “tens and thousands” target and introduce a new work visa  Jeremy Corbyn wins the keys to No.This would allow unlimited numbers of overseas workers into Britain – from care workers to scientists –there are skills shortages.Migrants will also be offered “residency and accelerated citizenship” and the promise of an end to “exorbitant” fees for visa applications.Ms Abbott insisted Labour would want businesses to advertise jobs locally first – and businesses to train up Brits.But campaigners last night warned the proposals were a “kick in the teeth” for Labour’s traditional working class support.Currently, the UK limits the number of skilled workers able to come to the UK from outside the EU at , a year.Ministers lted doctors and nurses out of the cap in June because of staffing shortages in the NHS.Ms Abbott said: “We have economic needs that dictate we need migrants to help skills shortages and labour shortages.“I am announcing that Labour in government will establish and completely reformed work visa policy.“Under our new system anyone with specied bona fide skills can come here to work.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If Theresa May were to win such a vote for a second time then there is no ­obligation for the Government to follow mere motions of the Commons.Similarly, ­ministers who cannot support Government policy are entitled to leave the Government, as the honourable recent example of George Eustice shows.Naturally, the Government must prove that it is committed to the referendum result, for that is the authoritative ­constitutional voice.No responsible government ought to allow the constitution to be subverted because of its own weaknesses. The ­conventions are there for good ­reasons and,ignored, confidence in the system that has served well for ­centuries will be damaged — with ­consequences that could include the rise of extremist parties. Failure to deliver Brexit would be a gt to Tommy Robinson.Fortunately, it is in the power of the Government, and especially of Mrs May, to deliver Brexit.  Votes in the House of Commons cannot override the law.If they could we would have arbitrary government and the law says we leave at the end of this month.The Prime Minister could simply refuse to ask for an extension or to move the ­Statutory Instrument that is needed to change the date. Mrs May may choose to fulfil or to break her promises to the electorate and will be held to account accordingly.Eurosceptics must similarly be guided by the electorate — it is our duty and obligation to those who trusted that the vote in  would be decisive and would be implemented.This makes it necessary to vote against the current deal as well as efforts to move the date beyond March .The people have spoken. The case ought to be concluded. Let’s have lt-off.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

All forbidden under the new rules.The Farmdrop episode is an early sign that there is more to the crackdown on so-called “junk food” than we have been led to believe.Last year, the Government proposed a ban on junk food adverts on television before pm, a ban on junk food being displayed at the entrance of shops or at the end of supermarket aisles, and a ban on junk food being sold at a discount.But junk food has no legal definition. It is a pejorative term used by campaigners such as chef Jamie Oliver to push their nanny state agenda.In practice, the legislation will apply to all food or drink considered to be high in fat, salt or sugar— and that includes the kind of food your grandmother would have approved of, such as butter and jam.The official definition of HFSS was drawn up over a decade ago, when Tony Blair banned junk food advertising on children’s television.A system was devised in which food products were given a mark out of , with points added for “negative” nutrients — such as saturated fat, sugar and sodium — and points subtracted for “positive” nutrients such as fruit, vegetables, protein and fibre.Calories are also counted as negative nutrients. If a food gets more than four points, it is classed as HFSS and cannot be advertised on children’s TV.The system was never intended to be a measure of “junk food” or “unhealthy food”. It was only supposed to distinguish “less healthy” food from “more healthy” food for the purposes of encouraging children to eat better.Nevertheless, the system has since been adopted by the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, for his ban on junk food advertising on public transport.It could also soon be used to decide which products can be advertised before pm, which products can be included in discount deals and which products can be displayed in prominent areas of shops.In reality, the system sets the bar for “healthy food” so high that it condemns hundreds of everyday products as junk.Nearly all bacon, burgers, sweets, crisps, desserts and biscuits fail the test, but other products classied as HFSS include ketchup, mayonnaise , jam, honey, Marmite, soy sauce, mustard, gravy, stock cubes, butter and olive oil.I have never met anyone who thinks that raisins, sultanas, hummus, walnuts, pesto, olive bread, dressed salads and tomato soup are unhealthy, yet all would be covered by the Government’s proposed bans.So too would dried fruit, cereal bars, margarine, most tinned fruit, most yoghurts, nearly all cheese , many pasta sauces and one in four sandwiches.Asthis system were not puritanical enough, Public Health England is in the process of making it even harder for food and drink to be classed as “more healthy”.A new version will soon come into effect that will classy all yoghurt drinks, a quarter of pasta brands, a quarter of noodle brands, most high-fibre breakfast cereals,  per cent of coffee and  per cent of fruit juice and smoothies as HFSS.This will leave the Government in the absurd position of officially advising people to drink pure orange juice as one of their five a day while banning adverts for it because it is junk.Some snacks Public Health England recommends as part of its £.million ChangeLe campaign will be classied as HFSS, as will most of the soft drinks that have been reformulated with less sugar.Under pressure from the Government, and to the fury of many loyal customers, brands such as Irn-Bru and Lucozade have had their sugar content cut dramatically, and yet they will face severe restrictions on price and promotion under the Government’s plans.Looking at the range of food and drink products that are classied as HFSS, it becomes clear that what is being proposed is not so much a crackdown on junk food as a crackdown on food in general, with exemptions for raw ingredients and health food.Politicians and the public have been sold a pig in a poke by those who campaign against the meaningless category of “junk food”.When askedthey agree with a ban on junk food adverts that are targeted at children, most people say they do, but that is not what is being proposed.If they were asked whether they would support a ban on olive oil being advertised during the Channel  News, they might take a dferent view.We are sleep-walking into legislation that is far more extensive than most of us realise.Hysterical claims about junk food have been used as cover for tobacco-style regulation being rolled out across the food supply.The nation’s biggest and most important industry could soon be banned from advertising most of its products during daytime television, costing broadcasters tens of millions of pounds and lowering the quality of programming.The ban on HFSS products being positioned at the entrance, checkout and end of aisle will cause shopkeepers all kinds of headaches, and the ban on discounts, such as buy-one-get-one-free, could cost consumers hundreds of pounds a year.Surely a rethink is in order Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We’re interested in the result.The Frenchman then took the unprecedented step of tweeting out the EU’s offer over the backstop in a bid to avoid looking responsible for the break down.He offered a new legal document to guarantee the backstop would only be temporary, as well as a unilateral exit clause for Great Britain from the border fix.But in a provocative move, the plan would see Northern Ireland forced to stay in it – enraging Ulster politicians.Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay hit back on Twitter to tell Mr Barnier that he should stick to the UK’s “clear new proposals”, adding: “With a very real deadline looming, now is not the time to rerun old arguments.The Barnier offer won’t allow Attorney General Geoffrey Cox to change his legal advice and declare the backstop is no longer an indefinite trap.Seething DUP Deputy Leader Nigel Dodds dubbed Mr Barnier’s offer as “an attempt to get ahead of a possible blame game and appear positive when in reality it is going backwards”.Earlier, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt lashed out at EU chiefs to say: “If this ends in acrimony, people will say the EU got this one wrong.Irish PM Leo Varadkar hit back to demand “a change of approach by the UK government”.Officials will continue with technical talks in Brussels through out the weekend in a desperate final bid to bridge the gap.The PM will work through the weekend, hitting the phone with calls to EU leaders to press her case.She talked to the leaders of Bulgaria, Denmark and Portugal on Thursday night.But No aides have all but given up hope of winning the race against time to win enough backstop changes by Tuesday.One said: “We’ll know by Monday morningthere’s any point in continuing with this process.”If the deal is voted down a second time, Mrs May faces disaster with Remainer Tories allying with Labour to seize control to signicantly soften Brexit.Meanwhile the Government’s internal isions over Brexit has been blamed for undermining negotiations with Brussels.A damning report by the Commons EU Scrutiny committee found conflicting policies developed by No and the Brexit department had “left the Government vulnerable to internal ision”.This had “compromised the British position” and limited the UK’s ability to secure its fundamental negotiating objectives.The Commons Northern Ireland Committee today finds that a technical solution to the Irish border conundrum “is possible and that it could be designed, trialled and piloted within the  month implementation period.It would not be a simple quick-fix, but would constitute a highly sophisticated “world first”.But trust and goodwill in Brussels is currently holding it back.WHO’S to blame for the Brexit deal shambles  Almost everyone.

The EU thinks, with justication, that MPs won’t allow No Deal so it feels under no pressure to make signicant concessions.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, is telling the UK thatit doesn’t like the backstop, it can have a Northern Ireland-only version of it — which the UK has already rejected. One minister fully briefed on the negotiations tells me: “We’re at ‘what the hell do we do ’ time.”But without a change to the backstop, Theresa May’s deal is going down to another heavy defeat on Tuesday.That won’t be the end of the matter, though. For the very next day Parliament will vote against leaving on March  with No Deal. Parliament will then almost certainly vote to request an extension to Article , the two-year process for leaving the EU.At this moment, the UK would be in the EU’s hands. As one weary No source admits: “They’d be in a position of being able to dictate terms.”It would be up to the EU to decide whether to grant an extension, how long it would be for and what conditions would be attached to it. How humiliating: This country’s future would be being determined in Brussels, not Westminster.The EU would almost certainly grant an extension. But what terms it would come with remains to be seen.What should worry those MPs who are voting against Mrs May’s deal because it is not a clean enough Brexit, is what Parliament would do with this extension. I understand that unless the Government indicates that it will allow the Commons to vote on ious Brexit options, an amendment will be tacked on to the extension vote to ensure that “indicative votes” are held.These votes would be on March  and the Commons would move to bind the Government to negotiate what it wants it to.Ministers would have to report back regularly to the Commons on the progress they are making. Mrs May might be in office, but she would not be in power. It is inevitable that the Brexit the Commons would mandate would be softer than Mrs May’s deal.So why, then, are so many Brexiteers not voting for her deal  Well, the problem is that many of them regard it as so flawed that they have no desire to rescue it. They would, in the words of one Cabinet minister: “Rather their hands be clean of all this.”But this isn’t PRACTICAL POLITICS. If Brexiteers won’t back Mrs May’s deal, then Brexit is ONLY GOING TO GET SOFTER.Is there any hope of avoiding this crisis  Today, it looks unlikely. But the DUP does want a deal.While they won’t accept the backstop as it currently is and were, in the words of one source, “not entirely happy” with the proposal Geoffrey Cox took to Brussels, they are eager for an agreement.If progress on the backstop was combined with a commitment from Mrs May that she would step down before phase two of the negotiations, then the deal might pass.I understand that a leading Brexiteer backbencher conveyed this message to influential figures in the Government this week. One normally loyal minister tells me: “If there’s nothing , that is the thing that has to work.”One outcome next week would avoid a crisis: Some progress on the backstop, Mrs May’s deal passing and a new PM coming in to do the next phase of the negotiations. All other roads lead to crisis.But right now, that is where we are headed.LABOUR will, officially, back a second referendum next week.But with as many as  Labour MPs opposed to the idea, it isn’t going to pass the Commons.Jeremy Corbyn has never been enthusiastic about a second referendum – he only backed one to prevent more defections to The Independent Group of MPs.Once he has gone through the motions of supporting one, he will feel free to pivot to other options.This was demonstrated by the fact he had a meeting with the Norway Plus group of MPs this week, who want the UK to stay in the EU single market.A soft Brexit has an obvious appeal for Corbyn. It would offer a solution to the issue while splitting the Tory Party.IT is now looking increasingly likely that the UK won’t be able to get anything on the backstop.“The EU are just not budging,” one of those intimately involved in the negotiations tells me.Bringing back a pretty much unchanged deal for a vote on Tuesday would lead to a heavy defeat for the Government, and probably by a three-figure margin.But there is another option being discussed in government. Gavin Barwell, the Prime Minister’s chief of staff, told ministers this week that one option was to bring to the Commons the proposal that the UK has taken to Brussels. The idea would then be to try to win a vote on that, to prove to the EU that such a change would get the deal through.Right now, one Downing Street source says, there is a “chicken and egg problem” as the EU doesn’t think that what the UK is proposing would get the deal through the Commons, and so doesn’t see the point in engaging with it.Some in government think that doing this would offer a way out of the votes on No Deal and an extension that threaten to create the bitterest Tory split yet over Europe.This strategy is not without risks. It isn’t certain that the Government would win this vote. There is also a danger that holding a vote on a proposal that has been rejected by the EU would end up looking absurd.But walking into a vote knowing that you are going to lose heavily is rarely a sensible governing strategy.ON Wednesday, Alan Duncan urged the Prime Minister’s chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, to have the Government whip against No DealMrs May’s deal is defeated next week.Duncan warned of an eruption from the “moderate” wing of the partythis didn’t happen. Barwell pointed out that Leave ministers have accepted a lot of compromises over the past few years.The exchange demonstrated how dficult the next week will be for the Tories. The votes that would follow Mrs May’s deal failing would make every previous Tory argument over Europe look like small beer.I understand the Government is looking to contain the row through a motion that would say the UK would not leave on March  without a deal, but would try to make clear that it was still an option after that.AS Mrs May was saying there was “no direct correlation between certain crimes and police numbers”, a leaflet from the Tories’ mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey was dropping on London doormats declaring thatthe party took City Hall they would hire , more police “Helping to bring an end to rising crime”.This pledge shows the position the Government has got itself into is politically preposterous.What is needed is more police to deal with the current crisis, then action to stop children from being drawn into these gangs.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mr Courtice told Bristol Live: I am from Stockwood, I am a Bristol fan, and I am also a fan of Leeds United. But I havent seen Leeds since God knows when, for years and years. He explained that he bought the tickets as a celebration for being discharged from hospital after having surgery. I got a ticket at Dolman Stand - I was really lucky because there were only  tickets left at the time I bought one, he said. “I wanted to take my daughter, as she is a big Bristol City fan, but when I went back to get another they’d sold out.   Mr Courtice said he couldn’t understand why, or even how, his unusual dual support for both teams was an issue. He said that, sitting in among the City fans in the Dolman Stand, he would be cheering on Bristol City. “If Leeds scored I wouldn’t do anything. If Bristol City scored I’d applaud them. “I just thoughtthey had any evidence of me being a hooligan, or being involved in any kind of trouble before, then fair enough. But I haven’t been to a football match in years. I just watch it and support them from my armchair usually. “I couldn’t work it out. I did tweet something about the fact I’d got a ticket, so maybe they saw that.He suspected that Bristol City had researched his Twitter profile after he replied to a tweet from Leeds Uniteds official account saying I will be at Ashton Gate on Saturday but in with the City fans I will have to be discreet.A spokersperson from Bristol City confirmed it was not about the tweet however a cross-reference check of names showed that Mr Courtices name was not on Citys but was on Leeds Uniteds. “Our head of safety and security received credible intelligence that several hundred Leeds United supporters had managed to purchase tickets in the home end of Ashton Gate. “We provided a list of people who had never purchased tickets here before at Ashton Gate to Leeds United. They then cross referenced this with their database of supporters. “Once Leeds United had confirmed these people were on their database a decision was made to revoke all tickets attached to those bookings in accordance with English Football Leagueregulations. “The decision to revoke tickets for any match is not one which is taken lightly and we only do this once we have positive confirmation from the opposing club that iniduals are indeed on their database,” she added. Scores of tickets have been revoked this week following that review and on Friday went back on sale at Ashton Gate - but only to season tickets and Forever Bristol members.

I’m pleased that rather than trying to justy its use, you moved quickly to apologise and spoke of being “mortied” you said it. No doubt your team are keen to draw a line under things and move on. But many aren’t as keen to quickly sweep it under the carpet and pretend nothing has happened. As someone who was once married to a prominent journalist, you of all people should know the power of words. It worries me a Cabinet Minister - one who was previously in charge of a Home Office that was presided over the Windrush scandal which saw Caribbeans wrong deported and denied legal rights - can so casually bandy around a term like coloured.   I cringed when I heard you say it in your BBC interview with Jeremy Vine. It’s the kind of language you might expect to hear from a great-grandad who doesn’t know any better. And it makes me think,you can use that word publicly, without skipping a beat, what kind of language do you use in private  In making your wider point, ironically in defence of Diane, you said it was awful that “black and minority ethnic people suffer in this way”. You know what, I feel using terms like “minority ethnic” to describe people are just as isive. They have become an acceptable way of reminding people that they are dferent, not the norm and by extension less than what is considered the mainstream.  BAME and BME are politically correct acronyms that sprung up in recent years to allow politicians, squeamish about using the word black, to have a get out of jail free card. But can you tell me what it actually means  Is it Black and Minority Ethnic  If so, where do Asian people fit into this description. Or is it Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic. In this case, who are the minority ethnic people that we are constantly trying to point to as being dferent  You come from the party of Anne Marie Morris, the Conservative MP who in  used the N-word in during a discussion about Brexit and Boris Johnson who has referred to black people as “piccaninnies” and having “watermelon smiles”. As I heard someone say on the radio, this has to be a “teachable moment”. It can’t simply be yesterday’s news.

MPs are then set to then vote on whether we leave on March  with No Deal. Then, finally, MPs could get a vote on delaying Brexit - something the Prime Minister says could lead to a second referendum or no Brexit at all.The high-stakes drama in the House of Commons will send shockwaves down the country - affecting everything from whether you keep your job to when you renew your passport.Heres how you can expect it to unfold. The story so far...  UK and EU officials are set to hold frantic last-minute talks this weekend after an utterly torturous week.Since her Brexit deal was defeated  days ago, Theresa May has been trying to win concessions from the EU over a crucial clause - the Irish backstop.In order to stop ato the violence we saw in the Troubles, there need to be no checks along the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Sotheres no agreement to ensure this, the backstop will kick in on  January . It is a clause in the -page Brexit deal that, essentially, will trap the UK under the same customs rules as the EU. Tories and the DUP say its unacceptable because it will stop us striking trade deals around the world and split the United Kingdom indefinitely. Theresa May wanted either a time limit, an exit clause, or alternative arrangements to replace the backstop.  But UK-EU talks reached deadlock with both sides admitting they had been dficult and robust. And Theresa May then gave a speech which appeared to accept things wont get much further. She blamed the EU, urging them to give one last push and refusing to accept any responsibility for the mess. Her Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt deepened the anger by warning the EU not to inject poison into the relationship - and saying history would judge Brussels. Michel Barnier, the EUs chief negotiator, hit back on Friday with a diplomatic bombshell - presenting his entire offer in full public view on Twitter .He said the UK would be allowed to quit the customs unionit wanted - but Northern Ireland would have to stay in the backstop. That would split up the UK - enraging Theresa Mays core allies, the Democratic Unionist Party . Furious Westminster leader Nigel Dodds said hed rejected exactly that plan a year ago and branded it neither realistic nor sensible. He added: It disrespects the constitutional and economic integrity of the United Kingdom. And Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay hit back within minutes, tweeting: With a very real deadline looming, now is not the time to rerun old arguments.  This is the last full day that talks can take place between the UK and the EU before the deadline. Despite the dramatic developments on Friday night, frantic talks are continuing over the weekend in a bid to reach some kind of last-minute breakthrough. Brexit is expected to dominate the airwaves, with Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Labours John McDonnell set to appear on the BBCs Andrew Marr Show. Despite Michel Barniers statement provoking a furious backlash, there was hope of some small movement. The EU chief pledged to strengthen obligations on Brussels to let the UK quit the Irish backstop in good faith. The EU will continue working intensively over the coming days, he added. Downing Street officials did not rule out the possibility of a last-minute dash on Sunday night, or even the early hours of Monday, to Brussels to seal the deal. Monday  March  Dawn on Monday appears to be the last possible time Theresa May can agree a Brexit deal with the EU. She has to table a motion in the House of Commons by teatime, promising a meaningful vote by MPs on whatever stage her Brexit talks are at. If theres no breakthrough, then that simply means voting on the same deal again - almost exactly two months after it was defeated. Shes added some extras, like a pound.bn fund for left-behind towns and a commitment to seek alternative arrangements to the backstop after March . But Brexiteers will look for changes to the deal itself. The Prime Minister, or her Attorney General or Brexit Secretary, could well give a statement to Parliament at .pm outlining what progress shes had. If so, the debate that follows will be the key moment for those watching how the vote is going to go. Tory Brexiteers and the DUP, who are the key to unlocking support for the deal, may break cover and give a final indication on how they will vote.On Monday night at pm theres the meeting of MPs in the Parliamentary Labour Party, a chance to gauge the strength of any Labour rebellion - plus the partys tactics for the week ahead. Tuesday will be the first of three huge days in Westminster. At pm, MPs are due to hold their final meaningful vote on the UKs Brexit deal with the EU. If it passes, we will leave on March  at pm with a deal - and pretty much nothing will change until the end of . Butit fails, that creates what Theresa May herself calls a crisis. And dont forget, the deal was voted down by an all-time-record  votes last time. Before the big vote itself, we have a busy day. Cabinet is at .am and the debate could run for six and a half hours from .pm. All thats not to mention the big sub-plot. First thing in the morning, well learn what amendments have been tabled to the deal itself. This may well include the Kyle Wilson amendment by two Labour MPs calling for a second referendum, which Labour could well support. That vote - held at pm, just before a vote on the deal itself - would be a key test of support for a second referendum in Parliament. But its not widely expected to pass, because too many Labour MPs are against it.All that may not be the end. If he wanted to, Jeremy Corbyn could stand up at around pm and call a no confidence vote in the government.Labour sources were last week sceptical this will happen -its going to succeed, it needs the DUPs support which looks remote. But anything is possible.  If the Brexit deal is voted down on Tuesday night, then MPs will hold their second crucial vote at pm. They will vote on whether to leave the EU without a deal - which weve spend more than poundbn preparing for. MPs are expected to reject the prospect of leaving without a deal, which moves us on to the next stage . But its going to be a busy, dramatic day all the same.First of all, the crucialquestion is how Theresa May will vote on a no deal Brexit .For years she said no deal is better than a bad deal. But will she put her vote where her mouth, and a huge sum of taxpayers money, is   Secondly, theres the question of how she whips Tory MPs to vote. If she whips in favour of No Deal, then a string of Remain-backing Cabinet ministers will have to resign. If she whips against No Deal, its an admission of failure. If she holds a free vote shes ducking the issue.Thirdly, there are other big distractions today. PMQs is at noon, plusJeremy Corbyn did call a no confidence vote, it would somehow have to be squeezed into today too.  And all thats not to mention... the Spring Statement. Yes, in a move we can only assume was designed to punish everyone in Westminster for their sins, the Chancellors annual non-Budget economic forecast begins at .pm. It was originally to be used to spell out no-deal emergency planning, but now its set to be a much more low key affair.  If the prospect of no deal is defeated, we come to the final big vote at pm on Thursday. MPs will be given the chance to delay Brexit - and theyll be able to say for how long, too. Theresa May said she wanted any delay to last no longer than three months, but MPs could amend her motion to make it longer. They could also amend it to attach conditions - including, crucially, a cross-party bid to keep the UK in a customs union. This is known as a soft Brexit, as it would leave us much closer to the EU. Ahead of the vote, Jeremy Corbyn was holding back-channel talks with Tory MPs in a bid to force Theresa May to back the customs union plan.  Amendments will be revealed first thing in the morning, and narrowed down to ones actually facing a vote at around .am. This could be the vote that really steers the course of the future. Labours policy is currently a customs union, but not a Norway-style EEA deal, which in a nutshell is an even softer Brexit that would mean being tied to the EUs single market and not ending free movement. There has been talk that Jeremy Corbyn, in his talks with Tory MPs, has been inching closer to this model. If so, Thursday is the first test it may face in Parliament.  Theresa May has said voting for a delay will open us up to a whole new world of unknowns. A delay wont be automatic - it has to be requested from and agreed by all  nations of the EU. It would likely be signed off at an EU summit on March . But the Prime Minister claimed Brussels could attach a string of conditions to the delay, such as pushing towards a softer Brexit. EvenBrussels doesnt demand it, a delay could well lead to a softer Brexit anyway because that may be the only thing that commands a Commons majority. A delay could also lead to a second Brexit referendum, the PM claimed - and therefore no Brexit at all. Despite all this, one minister told the Mirror Mrs May could even try for a THIRD meaningful vote before formally requesting the delay. Whether true or just speculation, it shows we are in a world of deep unknowns. Buckle up and prepare for a bumpy ride.

We hear from prominent women about good ideas that, very shortly, a man will re-announce like it was hisShareCommentsByFleet Street FoxColumnist:,  MAR Newsopinion\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIt is hard to be positive about the prospects for the planets biggest minority when it is represented on the world stage by females best described as not quite up to scratch. When Karen Bradley first says that British soldiers who shot unarmed civilians were following orders, then that she doesnt think that, and finally that she doesnt even believe herself, an observer from out of space could be forgiven for thinking that,she was the best person we could find to juggle with highly-explosive Northern Irish sensitivities, the whole species is heading for the blender.Were you to inform E.T. that Andrea Leadsom thinks British Muslims are the concern of the Foreign Office and Amber Rudd implies darker-skinned people are that way because of marker pens, hed be on his spaceship and getting to a safe distance before you could add that Katie Prices highly-monetised balloon boobs have somehow landed her poundm in debt.Butyou despair of the quality of womanhood in general, you are forgetting something. Because just as they have throughout human history, the women who grab our attention do so because when theres something wrong with them. Rudd is stuck in the s, Leadsom is so th century she lacks only a crinoline and marriageable daughters, and Bradley, plainly, is a malware-infected bot.Theresa May is in the news not because shes spent  years holding her self-immolating party together and dealing with the most dficult political crisis of our letimes, but because men arent happy with how shes doing it. Hillary Clinton is a prominent failure, rather than a ceiling-smashing lawyer who came within a whisker of the White House and was considered such a threat by the men of Russia and Wikileaks that they conspired against her personally with a man who lived in a golden phallus. Oprah Winfrey is fat. Ivanka Trump says stupid things. Angela Merkel isnt much of a looker. Name me ONE GUY about whom you could say all that. But the fact womanhood is a mixed-ability class is not in itself reason to despair. Masculinity has its fair share of fat, stupid, ugly people who do things wrong all the time, and unlike women they rarely apologise for it.Trump expressed no regret for employing criminals, praising Nazis or groping women. Putin murders his critics rather than listen to them. Kim Jong-Un never worries about the size of his cheese-saturated, un-fatshamed bum.We hear from men all the time. We hear from prominent women, too, about apologies, hopes, and good ideas that, very shortly, a man will re-announce like it was his all along. We do not hear from the others.  If human beings were left to procreate naturally, the world would be about % female. Instead its .%.Thats million women. Missing, presumed dead.They are missing because they were aborted for not being boys, killed after birth for the same reason, denied health care, refused education, raped, murdered, brutalised, and left to die from disease and malnutrition. They include Jodie Chesney, stabbed to death on a park bench aged  in an apparently motiveless attack, as well as females who die in childbirth, women killed for the concept of male honour, and teens in cars crashed at speed by men to prove their masculinity. Then there are invisible women who survived long enough to live unnoticed in slums, refugee camps, mud huts, multi-occupancy housing, brothels, massage parlours, prisons and in ordinary streets behind ordinary doors where it is perfectly ordinary for them to suffer and die. Those with better luck get to go to school, except when they have periods and they stay at home. They get to have jobs, so long as they dont ask for too much money and dont mind getting laid off before men. They get to fall in love, so long as they dont complain too much when he mistreats her. And in many countries they get to enjoy all of that for longer and die a little later. The country I live in is better to women than most. Women text to let their mums know they got home without being raped, those who use their legal rights to get better treatment are considered unemployable or unmarriageable, and girls are bullied into sending naked pictures to boys who share them with their friends. Vaginas are stretchy, guys, but not THAT stretchy.Females here are told they dress wrong, think wrong, talk wrong, interrupt wrong, and work wrong. About all a female can be guaranteed to get praised for is dancing in her knickers, a fact which makes me want to stowaway on the first space ship that lingers too long over its crop circle. But dealing with all that for centuries has done something rather brilliant.In much the same way as the women who survive infancy can expect to live longer than men, it has bred a super-race. Women who run countries, corporations, and the international economy as easily as they can run a tap. And millions more who run their homes and lives just as well, but a lot more quietly.For years the only women who succeeded were superior beings, and in their wake have come more who learned by example. Those who tried to have it all, and mostly managed it, have been replaced by women for whom the definition of all has expanded like the Kardashian empire, which turned one instance of sexual exploitation into a billion-dollar female powerhouse.So successful have women been that those born with male genitalia now wish to be reclassied as female. Put aside whatever thoughts you have on the social, physical or cultural acceptability of that - for the first time humans are campaigning NOT to be men.We should be delighted that a woman in Karen Bradleys position is such a remarkable idiot. It at least proves that were used to brilliant women. If we are noticing women who arent up to the standards we expect of frontline troops, it proves women have set a high standard. We are now arguing about a woman presenter on Question Time, a pregnant princess with opinions, pink power tools and period poverty. When I was growing up not a single one of those things existed in the national consciousness or had any hope of doing so.Even better, we are noticing the women who have never been noticed before. The superwomen will have to fix that problem, too, because the guys sure havent got very far. The presence of a few idiots does not mean womanhood is regressing. It means more of us really do enjoy equal opportunities, oies arent holding so many people back, and were judging women on their ability rather than their knickers. Besides, being a moron never stopped a man. Stop the spaceship, I want to get off. Theres work to do.

It was a time when community was everything, housewives proudly competed to scrub their doorsteps clean and children turned derelict houses into playgrounds.In a new memoir, Cobbled Streets  Penny Sweets, she remembers how people made the best of what little they had and tells stories of family, friendship and getting through the hard times with a healthy dose of Geordie humour...When I was around five years old I looked at a photo of my parents in their wedding gear. “Where was I ” “You weren’t here yet.” Fern Britton: ‘Take every challenge – you’ll only be doing the ironing otherwise!’ Whatever did they mean, how could they be somewhere without me  This was disgraceful. But I was there alright. The receipt for Mam’s wedding ring, purchased at The Northern Goldsmiths, Westgate Road, Newcastle upon Tyne, price pound, is dated September  . I was born on February  . I never understood why being a single mother was frowned upon but a couple, like my parents, who had married while the bride was pregnant was acceptable. In those days it was necessary for every houseproud housewe to “donkey stone the front step”. In other words, they scrubbed it clean on their hands and knees, bucket at the side, before a yellow rubbing stone was applied. You weren’t allowed to step on it when it was newly done. The fanlight received the same diligent attention – apparently, a dirty step and fanlight meant you had a dirty home. Folks really took a pride in their meagre dwelling places.   The women were regularly seen out on the street, wearing Paisley pinnies with scarves tied with a knot at the front, covering their hair curlers , sweeping their part of the path. Of course, this was also an excuse to gossip . They would stand around gassing about this one or that one: “Who does she think she is, the cat’s mother ” “Aye, man, aal fur coat and nee knickers!” I enjoyed listening to tales of local characters. There was the rat catcher who called in at the pubs, went into the cellars and placed a lantern with a kipper over the top. He hid in the corner until the rat came snfing, then grabbed it with his bare hands and chucked it in a hessian sack. The charge to the publican was dfor a little rat and dfor a large one.  If the payment wasn’t given, the catcher tipped them all out on to the bar counter – “Here then, have your rats back!” Sure enough, this would clear the place. The chimney sweep was a favourite of mine. A father-and-son team visited homes in the area. To me, it was fascinating how they carried a long fabric bag, unravelled it and inside were all these poles and a huge circular brush. The bag doubled as a cover to protect flooring and half-covered the fireplace. The sweep slotted all the poles together and the fabulous brush was the crown. This snake of a man went up the chimney and then the excitement began. I ran outside and half the street was shygathered around our back door in the lane. Everyone knew which house the sweep was working in, so word got around. Then the long-awaited event happened: the brush burst forth from the chimney pot, doing its pirouette. A massive cheer would go up. Folks were easily pleased in those days! I never understood why everyone did their washing on Mondays and placed it on long lines, criss-crossed over the lane. This was the day the coal van called so the women ran out with their props held aloft to allow it through.  Woe betide any driver who didn’t give a warning and sailed through those white sheets. Angry females would beat the side of the lorry. The women were also out in forceus kids decided on a game of “Run Through”. It was a great feeling to charge into the freshly laundered cotton and feel the flap on our faces. I wonder now how any of those women got any work done between attending to us and the coal men. There was generally a woman in the street ready to organise a trip out. The bus would be booked and everyone paid their share. Once on the beach, a plateau of sand was made and a tablecloth placed over the top. The sandwiches were usually egg and tomato. Us kids referred to them as “soggies” – by the time you got there, the tomato had soaked into the egg and bread – or “sand sandwiches”. Women enjoyed playing darts in the pub and had their own teams. Folks would sing around the piano and continue singing up the street after closing time.  After a while chatting outside someone’s home, a suggestion was made to continue inside. The rug was rolled back and they danced and sang until the early hours. This was a time when folks didn’t rely on TV or digital devices for entertainment and storytelling was a staple of the community. I liked nothing better than listening to the adults having a chinwag about the good old days, sharing family stories and gossiping. The walls of the haberdashery store were lined with wooden doors with glass  and tiny little drawers which held ribbons, buttons and metal zips.  Women who wanted to knit a jumper asked at the wool shopthey could buy a ball a week – “Put the balls away”. This meant they had worked out how many were needed, then collected one a week, paying as they knitted. Folks couldn’t afford to buy everything at once. Tobacconists sold single cigarettes to those who couldn’t afford the pack. The winters in Benwell were usually severe but none more so than when the snow of  arrived. As homes had no central heating, snow covered the rooftops. From this, icicles up to a couple of feet long spiked down.  I was aware of those big buggers staring down at me as I knocked on a friend’s door.“Are yi comin’ oot ter play ” “Nah, me Mam says the snow’s too bad.” weather conditions than mine. I was generally the last one playing out while others were long since by the fire.Sometimes, the slam of the door was enough to send the whole lot thundering down. But it wasn’t so bad then as I had a free ice lolly. Back home, a bucket was kept next to the back door so that ash could be sprinkled to guide the way to the outside toilet – “the netty”. The seat would be covered in ice, so unless you wanted to slide about mid-pee, the surface needed to be scraped off.  In summer, the danger was sitting on the woodworm holes: the preparation to kill them was smelly and would be transferred to the backs of your legs. If I banged on the seat, little worms would pop their heads out and I was waiting with a pin to try and stick one. Many of the flats and houses in the West End had long since been deemed unfit for human habitation but landlords were still able to rent out to folks who couldn’t afford a better place. A five-year-old lad called Larry had a younger brother of three, who was playing in the lane. The lad bumped into a backyard wall, the whole lot came tumbling down and killed him. When police arrived, they knocked down  walls in the lane using a wooden clothes prop. Cobbled Streets  Penny Sweets by Yvonne Young is out now at pound. from John Blake Publishing.

Once discharged from the RVI to continue his recovery at home, Chris struggled to cope with the isolation and suffered with depression. The team leader was advised to take up counselling sessions, an offer he was initially resistant to. Chris said: When I got out of hospital, I didnt do anything for about three months. I was just so depressed and my face was still burned. I felt like I looked like a monster. Once I started healing, I started to ease myself into going out more. I was offered counselling and I didnt want to do it at first. It really worked, Id definitely advise anyone going through a bad patch to do the same.Chris also benefited from the support of Dans Fund for Burns UK after the charity donated him cash to help his young family with transport costs and Christmas presents. Dicksons have since agreed an out-of-court settlement with Chris, who now works at a cash and carry. The -year-old felt forgotten by the company after the accident, and claims the firm prioritised profit over his wellbeing. Chris finished: I feel as soon as it happened I was forgotten about, the company cared more about making money than me. “If you have a job, dont be stupid and wear your PPE. If I was not wearing mine, it could have been much worse. If you dont know how to do a job, say no until you have been trained. Chris Hayman, managing director of MI Dickson, said: “Mr McCormack was employed by MI Dickson from June  to May  and was involved in an accident in our South Shields factory in December .  Following the accident, MI Dickson was subject to a full investigation by the Health and Safety Executive of our South Shields production facility over an eight month period. “MI Dickson was not prosecuted by the Health and Safety Executive and in July  was issued with a notice of contravention highlighting improvements to be made to the factory environment and our internal systems, which we are implementing. “We are sympathetic to the injuries experienced by Mr McCormack and every effort was taken to provide support in the period following the accident. Mr McCormack was contacted by the business on several occasions both in hospital and at home to offer physical, psychological and financial support. “Mr McCormack made the decision to terminate his employment and resigned from his role at MI Dickson. Subsequently, a financial settlement was offered to Mr McCormack, which has now been accepted. “MI Dickson cooperated fully with both the health and safety executive and Mr McCormack, both during the investigation into the accident and its subsequent conclusion and we remain wholly committed to the safety of our customers and employees going forward.” "},{"url":null,"title":"kate middleton queen announce rare","story":"NewsKate Middleton and Queen announce rare joint engagement - their first in seven yearsKate Middleton will join the Queen when she visits Kings College London to reopen the newly renovated Bush HouseShareCommentsByZoe ForseyAudience Writer:,  MAR NewsKate and the Queen visited Leicester in \"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email The Duchess of Cambridge and the Queen will spend some quality time together on their first joint engagement in seven years.The two royal woman will visit Kings College London to reopen the universitys Bush House following a renovation.

Darren Bonner was killed by his employer, Richard Spottiswood, who left him to suffocate in the cruel attack. Darren, , posed for the image taken by Spottiswoods girlfriend during a weekend away in a rural caravan park. But shortly afterwards Spottiswood, , ambushed the young mechanic and placed him in a headlock before throttling him until he passed out. He then dumped him naked in a hole behind a dry stone wall and left him to suffocate under a mound of soil.  Darren was found by a passing hiker walking along a coastal path. He was pulled to the surface, but had already suffered severe brain damage and he died  days later in hospital. It emerged Spottiswood, of South Shields near Newcastle-upon-Tyne was running a drug trafficking racket and wrongly believed Darren had betrayed his operation to a rival dealer. This week the victims fiancee Donna Churchill spoke for the first time about the tragedy after Spottiswood was jailed for le for murder.  Spottiswoods girlfriend Lucy Burn, , was jailed for  months after admitting assisting an offender. She was cleared of murder. Miss Churchill, , of Sunderland said: The whole thing was heartbreaking but that chilling picture of them together almost killed me. I felt sick to my stomach at the sight of it. Darren looks absolutely tiny next to his hulking boss. My Darren didn’t stand a chance against him that night. I’d never liked the way Spotty treated Darren and never really understood why Darren stayed involved with him or continued working as a trainee mechanic at the garage Spotty owned.  All it took was a message from him to completely change Darren’s mood. He spoke to him like dirt and gave him all the awful jobs he didn’t want to do himself. I begged Darren to cut ties, but he wouldn’t. Shortly before he was murdered, we’d had a bit of an argument about it and I’d told him to leave because I didn’t want him around my kids. My heart ached but I couldn’t condone something illegal going on under my roof. He was brilliant with my children, which made my decision even harder. When I met Spotty I hated him instantly, so I asked Darren to come back to my house where I felt he belonged. But Darren told me he couldn’t, and his eyes were filled with sadness. I knew he feared Spotty but couldn’t understand why. Something was holding him back.” Newcastle Crown Court was told the killing occurred in July  after Darren had joined Spottiswood and Burn for a weekend away at Cresswell Towers Caravan Park.  A “heated argument” broke out during which Spottiswood choked Mr Bonner and then believing he was dead, loaded him into the back of a van before dumping him in the shallow grave he had dug nearby. Mr Bonner was found lying in the foetal position with a broad ligature mark around his neck and his body was covered with bruises, scratches and  blows from a ‘rod-shaped weapon’ on his back. Miss Churchill said: Darren had tried to call me before he went away but I’d been with friends and missed it. I was sick of hearing about Spotty anyway, so I was partly glad I didn’t have to listen to anything more about it. Two days later though, I still hadn’t spoken to him and began to feel uneasy. Just then, I spotted two men walking across the car park towards me. One of them was carrying a folder and when I spotted the words ‘serious crimes unit’ and I had a gut feeling something was terribly wrong. I remember my mouth going dry as they walked in and watched as they approached my boss. Then, I was called over and taken into a back room where they told me they had bad news about Darren. As soon as they said it, I told them Spotty was responsible for whatever had happened. I just knew. I just cannot comprehend the circumstances in which he’d been discovered. It seemed so sick to imagine that he’d been buried alive. He was treated like an animal.  Spottiswood, who denied murder, told the court he had killed Darren in self-defence but ordering him to serve a minimum of  years in jail, Judge Stephen Ashurst told him: Mr Bonner died an untimely, violent and undignied death. He wanted to fit in and belong. He was much-loved and looking forward to the future but by your actions, he was deprived at such a young age of making something of his le. Detective Chief Inspector Andy Fairlamb of Northumbria Police, said: The fact that Darren was left in such a critical condition, barely breathing and lying in a shallow grave, absolutely shows how truly cold and despicable Spottiswood is.

Meghan, talking about a range of issues that affect women, has said that from the young age of  she knew she wanted to do something about inequality and sexism. The Duchess has also spoken of the importance of access to education for young girls, arguing it really does solve so many of the world’s problems. She talked about how vital it is to de-stigmatise menstruation in communities, saying its  per cent of the population thats affected by something that can also end up creating the most beautul thing in the world. And Meghan said its important for men to understand they can be feminists as well and be part of the conversation, adding my husband certainly is. The -year-old also revealed during the discussion that she does not look at Twitter, saying: I don’t look at it. Sorry no. For me that is my personal preference. Those joining the Duchess for the chat include Annie Lennox and former prime minister of Australia Julia Gillard.  Meghan has been described by the s host as a royal not afraid to embrace full-on feminism. Asked how her pregnancy was going, she said: Very well. Its funny, Id actually been joking these past few weeks Id seen this documentary on Netflix about feminism and one of the things they said during pregnancy was I feel the embryonic kicking of feminism. I loved that. So boy or girl, whatever it is, we hope that thats the case.   The group today are talking about the positive opportunities that come when women are given wider access and equal opportunities. Annie Lennox is founder of The Circle, an organisation supporting and empowering womens lives around the world, while Ms Gillard is chairwoman of the Global Institute for Womens Leadership at Kings College London, which is hosting the event. Other members of the  include Adwoa Aboah, who set up the open social discussion  Gurls Talk and Chrisann Jarrett, founder of the equal access to higher education campaign Let Us Learn. Also on the  is Angeline Murimirwa, executive director of the Campaign for Female Education in Africa and co-founder of Cama, a pan-African network of young female leaders. The  is chaired by Anne McElvoy, senior editor of The Economist and columnist with the Evening Standard.   Asked about her own personal journey, Meghan said: “At the age of  I had seen a commercial at the time that I thought to be very sexist. Truth be told, at , I didnt even know what sexism meant. I just knew that something struck me internally that was telling me it was wrong, and I knew that it was wrong. She said she used that as her moral compass, adding: It really set up the trajectory for me to say,there was a wrong,there is a lack of justice, and there is an inequality, then someone needs to do something. And why not me  Once I became old enough to travel, specically to developing countries and see what was happening abroad, I think for me what really resonated was the lack of education for girls, and how that has a ripple effect on so many things, she said today. Meghan added: It really does solve so many of the world’s problems when a girl has access to education. You look at it and you can say, here are the vulnerabilities and the challenges that come about when they don’t have access to education, she continued. Early childhood marriage, susceptibility to trafficking, modern slavery, all of that. But equally look at all the positives that come out of it when you do have access to education for young girls. How it affects the economic development, the GDP. Billions of dollars on the table are lost by girls being pulled out of education.   Meghan spoke about work in India she did a few years ago with a grassroots organisation trying to de-stigmatise menstruation. She said: Giving them access to be able to get these products, but in the same construct having these women mobilised to set up microfinance to sell these pads and other things that are needed to other women in the community. So again it feels like its one issue but it ends up solving so many. Because when you see how many girls are hindered and taken out of school simply because theyre ashamed about going through that transition in le, or because no-one wants to talk to them about it because they dont have what they need and theyre using old rags - literally. Which of course is propelling disease and so many other symptoms that come from this. At the end of the day, we are doing our part just to normalise the conversation. Thats the first step. Because again this is  per cent of the population thats affected by something that can also end up creating the most beautul thing in the world. So its a strange one that its ended up becoming so stigmatised. Remember its also in our own communities that its happening, and the only way we sht that is by talking about it which is why the work you do with Gurls Talk is so important.  Meghan has today become vice-president of the Queens Commonwealth Trust, the organisation has announced. The Duchess has joined her husband Harry, who is president, at the body, while the Queen is its patron. In this new role, the Duchess will highlight the trusts partnerships with young people across the Commonwealth, and in particular its work supporting women and girls, the trust said in a statement. The announcement was made a few hours before the discussion , organised by the Trust, of leading feminists and national figures to mark International Womens Day. Nicola Brentnall, the Trusts chief executive, said: We are particularly delighted that the first opportunity of formally working together with Her Royal Highness comes on International Womens Day. This squares perfectly with our focus on amplying the work and contribution of those furthest away from power. Women across the Commonwealth and the globe often face the biggest impediments to success. So we are delighted to have our vice-presidents support in helping others to overcome those obstacles.  Today Meghan told the  she felt privileged to have her role. She said: And I think, you know, looking at my role, and Im very very privileged to have now with the QCT, just expands that  to be able to go to  Commonwealth countries and do this level of work all across the globe because again, it is about global feminism, it is about a parity and equality for all of us. It started at , but still feels like its just beginning. Meghan has made womens empowerment a key part of her campaigning work and during her recent tour of Morocco with the Duke told a group of female executives and entrepreneurs: Women have to challenge everywhere in the world.

It can revolutionise how a company works in so many areas, from more efficient front line production to improved data analysis. But with technological advances moving at a faster rate than human skills, it is vital for small and medium sized businesses to keep up. So to help, Yorkshire Bank’s Group Business Banking Director, Gavin Opperman, is here to answer your questions... Q How can small businesses reduce costs associated with new technology  A Every small business needs technology to support them to make their business more efficient. Technology is moving faster than human skills are, which is why it is necessary for small businesses to weigh up exactly what piece of technology they want to own, its longevity and whether its development can be outsourced. Q Is understanding the latest technology essential for all small businesses  A Most small businesses will need to adopt some level of technology to make their business run efficiently. However,small businesses get caught up in the technology race too much they can move away from their core business. Remember to find a balance between what is needed and how to make the businessoptimally. Q What technology should small businesses be looking out for  A Every small business is dferent. There’s a number of exhibitions that they can attend to see what technology is most suited to them. Small businesses should look for options that will give them long-term sustainability at an economical rate and ultimately make their business more efficient. Q Many small businesses are struggling with the complexity of new technology – how can they simply the concept  A At Yorkshire Bank, we strive to bring industry experts and like-minded people together. Many of the sectors or businesses are prepared to share their knowledge to others in the industry. It is about finding the right technology to fit your business, and one that is suitable over a long period.

We as bankers aren’t there as technology experts, but what we can do is share best practice. We can introduce small businesses to experts in our portfolio who can advise on the latest products and services available. Q Many small businesses are hindered by time and internal resources – how can they still embrace new technology  A The biggest challenge Yorkshire Bank has identied with small businesses is the skills shortage, which puts pressure on internal resources. A lot of universities are developing skills in technology, but it’s how small businesses can retain the talent within that. The aim would be to keep the intellectual property within \u2028the region, so small businesses can embrace new technology without added time or training.Find out more about a business bank that works for you at YBonline business"},{"url":null,"title":"shamima begum sajid javid slammed","story":"NewsShamima Begum: Sajid Javid slammed after ISIS brides baby dies in SyriaHome Secretary Sajid Javid was accused of putting aspirations of becoming prime minister ahead of the needs of a \"helpless\" infant amid calls for the baby to be rescued by BritainShareCommentsByChris kitching:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video isis-bride-shamima-begum-pleads-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Sajid Javid is facing a torrent of criticism after ISIS bride Shamima Begums newborn baby died at a detention camp in Syria.The Home Secretary was accused of putting aspirations of becoming prime minister ahead of the needs of a helpless infant after the death of the weeks-old boy named Jarrah. Labour said the boy died as a result of a callous and inhumane decision and others said the UK had failed to safeguard the baby.Mr Javid revoked Islamic State runaway Ms Begums citizenship after she surfaced heavily pregnant at a camp in mid-February and said she wanted towith her son, having already lost two children.The -year-olds family vowed to appeal the decision and pleaded with Mr Javid to allow a safe passage for her son to come to the UK to no avail.  News of the babys death emerged on Friday, and it is said he had been rushed to a clinic with breathing dficulties, apparently caused by a lung infection, before dying on Thursday.Human rights lawyer Clive Stafford Smith told thethat Ms Begum, who was a -year-old schoolgirl when she left east London to join ISIS, made very stupid decisions, but she is still a teenager.He added: “It is also sad to see Sajid Javid trying to better his chances of becoming prime minister by illegally stripping her of her passport, rather than maturely focusing on the needs of a helpless infant who might have been rescued.  Indeed, it is just this kind of ill-considered populism that is further alienating many Muslims when we should be proving that we really do believe in human rights for all.Former Met Police chief superintendent Dal Babu, a friend of Ms Begums family, told BBC Newsnight : The family reached out to the Home Office and requested help.The Home Office sent a reply and said Youve come to the wrong department, you need to speak to Foreign and Commonwealth Office. There was no attempt to help by the Home Office. What we have here is a totally innocent child, whatever you may think of Shamimas shortcomings, the mistakes she made as a -year-old child when she was groomed on our watch.  We failed to safeguard her and now we have failed, as a country, to safeguard a child - a totally innocent British subject. Weve failed, as a country, to safeguard the child - a totally innocent British subject.Mr Javid faced criticism from shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott , who tweeted: “It is against international law to make someone stateless, and now an innocent child has died as a result of a British woman being stripped of her citizenship.This is callous and inhumane.”  The death of Ms Begums third child was confirmed on Friday by her familys lawyer Tasnime Akunjee. He tweeted: He was a British citizen. In response to the boys death, a Government spokesman said: The death of any child is tragic and deeply distressing for the family. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has consistently advised against travel to Syria since April . The Government will continue to do whatever we can to prevent people from being drawn into terrorism and travelling to dangerous conflict zones.  Last month, Mr Javid said Ms Begums son was a British citizen and claimed he had considered the childs interest when deciding to revoke the teens citizenship. He had told the Commons Home Affairs Committee it would be incredibly dficult for the Government to facilitate theof a child from Syria, responding to questions about Ms Begums son. Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis defended Mr Javids decision to strip Ms Begum of her British citizenship. Speaking to BBC Radio s Today programme, he said: The loss of any le of any child is absolutely tragic and is a very clear reminder - this whole case - of the danger of travelling out to that area and getting involved. The Home Secretary will have had advice and I know he made a decision based on what is in the national interest and the security of people here in the UK.  Ms Begum, from Bethnal Green in east London, joined the terror group in February , travelling to Syria with two other schoolgirls. When she was found at the al-Hol, or al-Hawl, camp in northern Syria last month she spoke of her desire toto the UK following the collapse of ISIS so-called caliphate. She told the Times she did not regret joining ISIS, but that she felt the caliphate was at an end. After her citizenship was revoked, Ms Begum pleaded for mercy and claimed she is willing to change. She told how she married her husband, Dutch ISIS fighter Yago Riedijk, , within days of arriving in Raqqa.

Ahmed Ali is begging the British Government to let his daughter come home - but accepted she would be prosecuted.He told the BBC : She has done wrong, I apologise to everyone as her father, to the British people, I am sorry for Shamimas doing.I request the British people, please forgive her.  But the -year-old stressed that Shamima, who was just  when she fled to Syria in , was just a child when she left the UK to join ISIS .Mr Ali said: She was under age at that time, she couldnt understand that much. I suppose someone influenced her to do that. I admit that she might have done wrong without realising it. Shamimas dad was speaking in Bangladesh, where he has mainly lived for several years and only visiting his home in east London for a few months at a time. At the time of his interview he did not know his grandson had died.   Mr Aii also insists he had no idea his daughter was being radicalised. Home Secretary Sajid Javid revoked Shamimas British citizenship after she was found, heavily pregnant, in a refugee camp in Syria last month. He is facing a torrent of criticism after her newborn baby died at a detention camp in the war-torn country. The Home Secretary was accused of putting aspirations of becoming prime minister ahead of the needs of a helpless infant after the death of the weeks-old boy named Jarrah. Labour said the boy died as a result of a callous and inhumane decision and others said the UK had failed to safeguard the baby.  The -year-olds family vowed to appeal the decision and pleaded with Mr Javid to allow a safe passage for her son to come to the UK to no avail. News of the babys death emerged on Friday, and it is said he had been rushed to a clinic with breathing dficulties, apparently caused by a lung infection, before dying on Thursday.Human rights lawyer Clive Stafford Smith told thethat Ms Begum, who was a -year-old schoolgirl when she left east London to join ISIS, made very stupid decisions, but she is still a teenager.He added: “It is also sad to see Sajid Javid trying to better his chances of becoming prime minister by illegally stripping her of her passport, rather than maturely focusing on the needs of a helpless infant who might have been rescued. Indeed, it is just this kind of ill-considered populism that is further alienating many Muslims when we should be proving that we really do believe in human rights for all. Former Met Police chief superintendent Dal Babu, a friend of Ms Begums family, told BBC Newsnight : The family reached out to the Home Office and requested help.The Home Office sent a reply and said Youve come to the wrong department, you need to speak to Foreign and Commonwealth Office. There was no attempt to help by the Home Office. What we have here is a totally innocent child, whatever you may think of Shamimas shortcomings, the mistakes she made as a -year-old child when she was groomed on our watch. We failed to safeguard her and now we have failed, as a country, to safeguard a child - a totally innocent British subject.

Now they might just be of equal signicance for British museums. The National Army Museum in London has agreed to repatriate the hair – cut from the head of the dead Emperor Tewodros II in  – to be interred in the Emperor’s tomb in Ethiopia. The museum insists it will not set a precedent but there are plenty of foreign countries wanting to make sure that it does as they clamour for theof antiquities taken by colonial Britain. The most famous of the disputed artefacts held in British institutions might be the Elgin Marbles but they are by no means the only ones and there are increasing requests for restitution.   Most of those requests have been rejected, often citing the British Museum Act  which protects historic collections for posterity, but pressure is building. The number of requests is also rising and is likely to be increased further by the decision of France’s President Emmanuel Macron to legislate for African antiquities held in French museums to be repatriated or, as he described it, to Africa. The hair was cut from the head of the Ethiopian emperor after the Battle of Maqdala in  when a British force defeated his troops and Tewodros fatally shot himself rather than be captured. The strands of the emperor’s hair, which were brought back to Britain along with looted treasures and the emperor’s seven-year-old son Prince Alemayehu, were eventually given to the National Army Museum in London by the family of an artist who had painted the emperor on his deathbed. And that’s where they have rested until last April when the Ethiopian culture minister made a formal request for theof the hair which was “considered to be of cultural sensitivity to Ethiopian citizens”. Ethiopia has separately asked Britain toall of the Maqdala artefacts held by the Victoria and Albert Museum and by the British Museum. This has in its collection a group of about  objects from Maqdala, some of which came via the Secretary of State for India in  and others from the collection of Captain Speedy,of Emperor Tewodros’s son. Parthenon Marbles   Known as the Elgin Marbles, they are sculptures from the Parthenon and other buildings of the Acropolis of Athens which were acquired by Thomas Bruce, the th Earl of Elgin, between  and , and which Greece is still determined to have ed. They are currently held by the British Museum. The High Court decided in  that the marbles could not legally be ed because of the British Museum Act , and yet a YouGov poll in  showed more Britonsbacked theof the marbles than opposed it . Gibraltar neanderthals   The government of Gibraltar has asked for theof Neanderthal remains which include the first adult skull to be discovered by scientists, currently on display at the Natural History Museum. Gibraltar  is an adult female skull, above, found in Forbes’ Quarry in  and is believed to be about , years old. It is described by the Natural History Museum as a “highlight specimen” in its human evolution gallery and is said to have played a crucial role in shaping understanding of Neanderthals. Gibraltar  comprises five skull fragments from a Neanderthal child and was discovered at Devil’s Tower in . A letter last September from the Gibraltar National Museum to the Natural History Museum director Sir Michael Dixon said: “It has been our desire for some time, and we feel that the moment is now the right one, that these human remains should . “You will agree, I am sure, that it is entirely appropriate for these human remains[sic] to their place of origin where they will be treated with the care and respect which they deserve.” Sir Michael refused, citing the British Museum Act . Darwins sloth  Last August the government of Chile requested theof fossilised bones from a giant prehistoric sloth that roamed South America , years ago and which scientists named after Charles Darwin. The remains of the long-extinct ground sloth – Mylodon darwinii – were found in a cave in Ultima Esperanza, southern Chile, and brought to the UK in  for “research” never to be ed. Charles Darwin had been one of the first scientists to find a mylodon fossil when he discovered a jawbone in Argentina during hiss HMS Beagle expedition. A museum spokesman said at the time: “As with many museums whose collections have developed over a long period of time and span all continents, we do receive occasional requests for repatriation. Each request is responded to inidually and the Natural History Museum is happy to undertake discussions with other institutions on these matters.” Easter Island Moai  In November last year, the governor of Easter Island tearfully begged the British Museum toone of its giant basalt statues. The museum has held the spiritually important Hoa Hakananai’a for  years after it was taken from the Chilean island by the crew of a British frigate in  and given to the museum by Queen Victoria the following year. Each of hundreds of the fourtonne statues – or moais – which were originally found on Easter Island, is considered to represent a tribal leader or deied ancestor. Tarita Alarcoacuten Rapu met museum officials and told them: “My grandma, who passed away at almost  years, she never got the chance to see her ancestor. “I am almost half a century alive and this is my first time. You have our soul. Roman marble relief  In April last year the ministry of cultural heritage in Italy asked for the theof a marble funerary relief depicting the freedmen Publius Licinius Philonicus and Publius Licinius Demetrius.

In the pediment can be seen the tools of a smith or moneyer and the tools of a carpenter. Pyramid stone  Angry at plans to display a casing stone from the Great Pyramid of Giza in the National Museum of Scotland, the Egyptian government called on the museum in January to produce certication documents for its Egyptian antiquities. Shaman Abdel Goad, the head of the repatriation department at Egypt’s ministry of antiquities, said at the time: “If we find anything that left Egypt illegally, we work to repatriate it back to Egypt, as is our right.” The National Museum insisted its curators were confident they had legal title to the stone which was removed from Egypt by an engineer working for Scotland’s astronomer royal in . Rosetta Stone  Egypt would still like theof the Rosetta Stone, a granodiorite stone inscribed with three versions of a decree issued at Memphis, Egypt, in BC – one in ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, one in Demotic script and one in ancient Greek.

Her victim, who was in bed, noticed the insulin was going to his body and managed to disconnect the pump before calling . He was then rushed to hospital from his home in Stoke-on-Trent. The court heard how the dose of insulin could have had a catastrophic impact on the mans health had he not acted so quickly.Hopkin was handed a suspended sentence. She only admitted the offence on the day of her trial last month, reports the Stoke Sentinel .The victim, a type  diabetic, called emergency services at .am on August , . He told police that the defended had deliberately tried to give him an overdose of insulin, according to prosecutor Cathlyn Orchard.   Miss Orchard said: “He said they had an argument and he had gone to bed. She was on her fourth bottle of wine when he went upstairs. “He is a type one diabetic and had been for  years. He has two devices he uses to control his levels. One is fitted to him and holds  millilitres of insulin. He has a separate bluetooth device which can also be used to deliver insulin in his body. He left the bluetooth device downstairs. “He checked his blood sugar levels and gave himself some insulin which would have kept him safe throughout the night. He sat in bed reading a book. In the early hours he became aware the device was administering insulin. “The victim disabled the device when he realised what was going on. He asked what she was doing.

In Type  diabetes, the body doesn’t make enough insulin, or the insulin it makes doesn’t work properly, meaning glucose builds up in the blood.Find out more about diabetes, including symptoms and early warning signs.  Until the day of the trial, Hopkin denied the allegations and said that her partner must have done it himself. But she later went on to plead guilty to administering a poison or noxious substance with intent. Catherine O’Reilly, mitigating, said the defendant, who has no previous convictions, acted ‘completely out of character in an absolute moment of madness’. Miss O’Reilly said: “She was in a highly emotional state after she had consumed a lot of alcohol. “It has taken her some time to come to terms with and accept what she has done. “In a moment of madness she made a terrible, terrible decision. She understands the seriousness of the position she is in. “She can’t understand she behaved in this manner.” Her plea was on a basis the relationship was strained and they had been arguing about money and family issues. She admitted administering the insulin but did not intend to cause serious injury to him and did not think through the consequences of her actions.   Miss OReilly added the defendant is now in a new relationship and is pregnant. Judge Paul Glenn sentenced Hopkin to nine months in prison, suspended for  months. He told Hopkin: “What you did was wicked. You were well aware of his condition as you had been together for a long time. It is fortunate he was awake and realised what had happened and was able to disconnect the device and call for assistance. “You took no steps at all to undo what you had done. “When you were interviewed by the police you lied again and again and again. You continued to lie until the day of your trial. “Taking . units could have had a catastrophic effect on his health. It could have led to hypoglycemia, a coma and seizeures. “Importantly, he does not want you to go to jail. Courts are not bound to follow the wishes of victims but it is right to take account of his view. “You cannot blame or justy your actions on the quite obscene amount of alcohol you drank that night. “I accept this was out of character when in an emotional state.” As part of the suspended sentence, Hopkin must complete a rehabilitation activity requirement for  days and  hours unpaid work.

Bieber, whose daughter is now eight months old and in foster care, is being held at Tarrant County Jail following her arrest.  She claimed her baby was having apnoea episodes, where she would suddenly stop breathing and go blue, the Star-Telegram reports. But the mum later told relatives she had placed her hand over the youngsters mouth to get rid of a demon, the affidavit states.And since being removed from her, the child has experienced no apnoea episodes, the document, written by an investigator, claims.Bieber had lost another daughter - Annabelle Rose Davis - in February , from what was found to be natural causes.The youngster died days after she was brought to hospital unresponsive and not breathing, according to the newspaper.A medical examiners office ruled that she suffered a brain injury caused by oxygen deprivation because of pneumonia.

But according to an etiquette expert there are a couple of things that revealsomebody is truly posh. Neil Phillips from The Jockey Club told theabout all the dos and dont of afternoon tea ahead of this years Cheltenham Festival. And he also revealed the two little signs which give away people who are actually posh. The first is how you hold your glass when drinking white wine or champagne. He explains: You see people who think they look really elegant but then they grab hold of a wine glass.   According to Neil, you should always hold the glass by the stem.In fact, thats why wine glasses are actually designed with the stem rather than just a normal rounded bowl. The same rule appliesyou’re drinking champagne or prosecco from a flute. You should also hold the glass this way when youre pouring your favourite drink from the bottle.   The second sign is how much time people spend enjoying nice things like afternoon tea. He said: It is about people taking their time. Its your moment to be here You see people rushing through the experience. I think its a really important thing. Neil also shared some advice on the correct way to enjoy an afternoon tea. Instead of cutting your scone with a kne you should break it in half with your hands. When it comes to jam or cream, he says there isnt technically a right way to do but it her prefers jam first.   For the tea, we should be moving the spoon in a straight line from the top to the bottom rather than stirring it. He said: It is about going from six to  very gently. If youre adding sugar it will allow it to dissolve properly. If you just stir it it will all fall to the bottom. You don’t need to do it for long, just a few goes. It just allows the tea and milk to blend together. Neil Phillips is a broadcaster and wine expert for The Jockey Club who will be giving tips on everything from the runners and riders to the culinary offerings at The Cheltenham Festival™, presented by Magners, which runs from Tuesday March to Friday March.

Kayleigh, who lives in Birmingham, got the unusual design on her first day as a tattoo apprentice when she was .Now , she told Birmingham Live : I had my face tattooed so that I couldnt get a normal job, mainly as a reminder to persevere in doing what I wanted to do.Tattoos are generally a lot more acceptable now than they used to be but throat and face tattoos are still seen as more extreme and workplaces are mostly against them.   So I had my face tattooed to force myself to become a tattoo artist. Id wanted to become a tattoo artist for some time but I was very shy and Id go into tattoo places and I think they were put off because I wouldnt say boo to a goose. And thats not her only face tattoo, and she also has a rose to symbolise romance and beauty and leaves to represent new beginnings. I chose the word cursed because I was a very troubled person, I felt cursed because nothing ever went right for me, especially in relationships, she said.   Ive always struggled with my mental health. Now, being in the tattoo industry has helped me so much - its saved my le. It sounds like a clicheacute but its true. My mindset is dferent. Before my glass was always half-empty, now its half full. I always felt like the underdog, I feel completely dferent now. The relationship between a tattoo artist and his or her clients is an intimate one and Kayleigh says its this connection thats made the biggest dference to her.   When you are tattooing someone, they tend to open up because they are in pain and you kind of become like their psychiatrist and help themthey have problems, she explained. Some of the things Ive heard that people have been through make me think that maybe things arent so bad for me. Kayleigh got her first tattoo at the age of  when she had her best friends surname tattooed on her ankle. She later had a huge tattoo which covers her chest. Her family werent impressed. Kayleigh explains: My dad was not happy, neither was my stepmum.   They said I couldnt be bridesmaid at their wedding. We were having problems anyway. But, since Ive started working in the tattoo industry, my dad has accepted my tattoos. Hes changed his mind so much that he now has his own tattoo, a heart with his wes name in, which Kayleigh did for him. She said: It was a nice bonding experience but I could tell he was in pain whilst I was doing it.  So, at the end, I asked him to write Dad on a piece of paper and I had a stencil done then turned to him and said now its your turn to tattoo this onto me. He was so nervous as he tattooed it onto my leg but I love it, its like a trinket tattoo, it means I have a piece of him with me wherever I go. Kayleigh has lost count of how many tattoos she has because many of them merge into each other. I think my tattoos cover around  per cent of my body, said Kayleigh, who has appeared in a music video and Skin Deep magazine.  The longest Ive ever sat for a tattoo is around five to six hours which isnt too long. Unable to put a figure on the amount she has spent on tattooing, other than its thousands, Kayleigh says the pain is actually getting worse rather than better when she has them done. I dont know whether its because Im getting older but the pain is much worse now than when I first started getting tattoos. Before I could sit for hours and not even flinch, now I find Im in terrible pain and I want to tap out straight away.  I get really fidgety too, which isnt good. Now a self-employed tattoo artist based at The Tattooed Gent on Erdington High Street, Kayleighs next dream is to cover her entire body in tattoos. I dont think Ill ever stop, I would like my whole body to be covered in tattoos. I might have two little ones by my eyes but no more on my face after that. I know some men who have lots of tattoos on their face and it suits them but I wouldnt want to completely cover my face as Id still want to be identied by my features.

sayslennon a great fit for celts job","story":"Derek McInnes believes Neil Lennon is a great fit for Celtic following Brendan Rodgers’ departure.The Dons boss takes his team to Parkhead this afternoon, attempting to beat the Hoops in Lennon’s first home match of his spell as interim manager.The Northern Irishman was appointed last month after Rodgers opted to leave Celtic after two-and-a-half years at the helm for Leicester City in the English Premier League.Lennon was brought in as interim gaffer until the end of the season.The appointment ended his short spell out of the game after leaving Hibs by mutual consent at the end of January.The Northern Irishman played for Celtic from - and managed the club for four years until the summer of .During his first spell as Hoops boss Lennon won three league titles and two Scottish Cups and McInnes believes he is a shrewd appointment.He said: “I think it’s a great fit for both just now.“Celtic are fortunate that Neil was available and they had someone that could come in and fill the role.“I think with so few games left in the season maybe bringing in a new manager who hasn’t been at the club may have complicated things.“I think Neil will also see himself as fortunate becausehe was still the Hibs manager he might not have got it.“So it’s been a good thing for both parties I think because Neil is now back at a club which he has served so well as a player, coach and manager.“I know how pleased he is and I’m pleased for him because we spoke a few weeks ago about how harsh it was losing his job at Hibs.“Now you see the flip side where it has worked out well for him, back in a job where he has done well before.”Lennon has had two matches in charge since ing to the Celtic hotseat.The Hoops have won both, beating Hearts - at Tynecastle on February  before winning - at Easter Road last Saturday in the quarter-final of the Scottish Cup.McInnes has already noticed some dferences in the way Celtic play under Lennon compared with Rodgers.He added: “I think there are little subtle changes, but it’s the same group of players.“I think Neil deserves credit for the way he has come in and dealt with the urgency of the situation and dealing with the two games he’s had.“Against Hearts and Hibs they have both been tough games and potentially very tricky.“He has dealt with that well. On the pitch there are subtle changes between a Neil Lennon team and a Brendan Rodgers team, even though it’s the same group of players.“It’s maybe not so much a slower build up and they maybe pass the ball forward more.“Under Neil they maybe ask a question of you defensively a little bit quicker.“Certainly they are playing with a lot of passion and probably epitomise their manager at the minute.”The Dons are looking to set a new club record this afternoon at Parkhead by winning eight successive away games for the first time.However, McInnes knows Aberdeen will be severely tested as they look to set a new milestone.He said: “There is a resilience about our team when we play these big games. We have to be fully concentrating and Celtic are a good side.“So although we have been very strong on the road, this game will really test us.“It’s a game we always look forward to and it’s a game where we know what to expect.“But the intention is to go there and get the result, as dficult as that is.“We want to go there and try to continue our strong away form.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/03/5c82ac8f88bf25.16481478.jpg ","title":"mcinnes tried to sign veteran before","story":"Versatile veteran Greg Halford revealed Aberdeen boss Derek McInnes has tried to sign him twice before.Halford, pictured below, joined the Reds to ease the defensive injury struggles this term.The -year-old has spent his entire career in the English lower leagues, but says there was no sales pitch needed to bring him north, with McInnes lauding his experience when the deal was announced.Halford said: “The initial contact was through my agent.“It happened very, very quickly. Obviously the team had injuries, which meant an opportunity to come up here.“The manager’s tried to sign me a couple of times before, which is always nice.“It’s a nice feeling when a manager wants you and has tried to get you at other clubs as well.“There was an opportunity when I was at Portsmouth and he tried to get me for Bristol.”Halford added: “Hedidn’t need to sell Aberdeen to be honest.“I had offers from League One and League Two clubs, but I wasn’t prepared to move down to League Two – even though they were offering more money than League One clubs.“Money’s never been a motivator for me, it’s football that’s the priority.“Coming up here, playing against the clubs we’ll be playing in the next few weeks – it’s exactly what I wanted to do.”Halford described his first training and match day experiences with Aberdeen as “good”, but “cold”.However, having not made a first-team start since he played for Cardf against Bristol in February , and having been without a contract with a club since leaving South Wales in July of that year, he’s loving being signed up and involved in day-to-day football.Halford said: “I’m settling in well, it’s just nice to come in training, seeing faces and being around a group. It’s exactly what I wanted and needed.“When I was at Sunderland we had a friendly at Falkirk, and when I was at Wolves we had a pre-season up here and played Hearts.“I came up with Rotherham as well, when Steve Evans was the manager.“I’d watched a fewgames to be fair, the televised ones against Rangers.“I wasn’t specically looking ahead, but obviously I’m a football fan andthere’s football on TV I will watch it.”Halford was on the bench for the - league loss to Hamilton, but wasn’t in the squad for the Scottish Cup quarter-final draw with Rangers at the weekend.However, he says the prospect of soon playing competitively again is “exciting”, even more sohis first minutes come against Celtic at Parkhead in the Premiership today.Halford said: “It’s going to be exciting.“I got nerves before the Hamilton game – I even got nerves before the Rangers game as well, even though I wasn’t involved.“I’m champing at the bit to get my first minutes and progress from there.“% . These are the games everybody wants to play in.“Playing the two Glasgow teams and with Celtic being the dominant champions over the last few years, it’s a place every footballer wants to play.“We’ll go there looking for the three points and to put on a good display.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 01","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe conditions being endured by refugees on a remote Greek island might seem of little importance to folk living in Argyll, but Pam Gregory spends time helping make their lives easier.More volunteers are desperately needed to assist as conditions worsen during the winter and Samos Volunteers would love to hear from anyone with the inclination to help.Pam#s dedication and the support of the Craignish community deserve great credit.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"honours even for red star in argyll derby","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Ropework played host to this keenly contested local derby which was watched by a healthy crowd on Saturday February .And for the second time this season, Red Star and Campbeltown Pupils shared the points in a match both sides will feel they could have won.Both sides were struggling for fluency in the opening stages but Red Star settled first and grabbed the opening goal after  minutes.

The unfortunate Pupils# defender could only ert the ball into the empty net, with McLean waiting on a tap in. The game continued at a frantic pace, however, there was no further scoring in the first half and Star went in with a - advantage.Pupils came out with purpose in the second half as they looked to force themselves back into the game, however, it was a howler from Red Star which allowed them back into the match.A square ball across the back resulted in a mix-up between Star keeper Luke Kalache and defender Ben Forbes which allowed Donald McCallum to prod the ball home from just inside the box and Pupils were back in the game at - with eight second half minutes gone.The home side didn’t recover from this and you could sense a nervousness that gave the visitors plenty encouragement. The equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when good play from Pupils down the right by Soudan saw him get a low cross in which was met by the on-rushing run of Ryan Deans and he finished well to level the score at -.This set up a frantic finish and both sides could have nicked it towards the end. Pupils went close with a headed effort which was clawed to safety while at the other end there was a goalmouth scramble which Star couldn’t convert and both sides had to settle for a draw in the end as referee Jimmy Litster blew for full time.Red Star were dealt a blow as it emerged that captain Aaron Moore suffered a dislocated shoulder. Hopefully this will not keep him out for too long.On Saturday February , Star have another important home game as they look to move off the bottom of the table when they take on Claremont AFC. The game will be played at the Ropework or Joint Campus G # weather permitting # with a pm kick off."},{"url":null,"title":"young argyll players make their mark in shinty finals","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowEnthusiastic crowds looked on as the  National First Shinty Championships were held across two Fort William venues.The GS Campbell finals on Saturday February  brought together more than  of the best young players from across Scotland, all vying for the coveted national P and P titles.The P and under tournament was played at the Nevis Centre and the standard of play throughout the day was of the highest order with all  teams giving a great account of themselves.Section A saw Aberdour edge out a classy Strachur Kyles side on goal dference to clinch second spot.

Documents such as rent records, estate census papers, military papers, letters, maps and legal documents can offer a glimpse into the lives of people who lived across Argyll.The two-year Written in the Landscape project is set to wind up in July this year and has entailed cataloguing and digitising the Argyll Estate and other records to make them more accessible to the public.As Hannah and Jen travel round Argyll on their tour, the intention is to offer a local flavour from the archives aimed at each venue.For the Lochgilphead workshop on February , Jen and Hannah presented such erse items as #registers of the poor# and burgh court rolls from Lochgilphead, th century wage books from Kilmory Estate alongside military commission documents from the th century and a  map of the proposed Crinan Canal, surveyed by John Rennie.Each record offers a dferent insight among a treasure trove of detail.The Lochgilphead presentation followed a similar event in Campbeltown in January. Workshops will be held in March on Mull, Helensburgh in April before travelling to Strachur, Dunoon, Inveraray and Tiree in May.Further information on the Argyll Paper records can be obtained by emailing archives@inveraray-castle.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"college staging wine fuelled feast","story":"NewsCollege staging wine-fuelled feast as job cuts loomLeaked emails tell of lavish bash at cash-strapped Ayrshire CollegeShareByStephen Houston:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCollege bosses have defended holding a celebration to honour their success amid a climate of drastic job cuts and cash problems.

Leaked emails state the claim the college is “now regarded as one of the most successful colleges in Scotland.” But our inside source said: “It adds insult to injury that this celebration is being held less than one week before the final jobs structure is issued to staff. “It is in extremely poor taste given the circumstances of potential job losses due to lack of funds.” Evening classes are having to be cancelled so the event can be staged at the Kilmarnock campus on March . Retiring principal Heather Dunk is also to be honoured during the evening. Chairman Willie Mackie said: “She has made a signicant contribution to Ayrshire for over  years.” Ms Dunk retired on February , leaving an impending restructure which will cost jobs. A consultation ends tomorrowand it has emerged the Private Finance Initiative which built the Kilwinning campus is a huge drain on funds. An email which Ms Dunk sent to staff in January read: “We need to make signicant savings to be financially sustainable due to the costs associated with the PFI, unfunded national bargaining costs and the increasing costs of pensions, utilities and other services. I am very disappointed that an organisational review is necessary, it is not what I want to be focused on in my last weeks as principal. “However, we must manage within the financial allocation we receive in this very dficult fiscal climate.” Under the consultation, one of the four vice-principals would be axed, three directors culled, heads of learning cut from  to nine, and three marketing coms staff would go. Also at risk of the chop are two posts within estates as well as a shake-up of duties among departments. The board of management will approve the final structure and staff impacted will get a severance package. Ayrshire College acknowledged finance was a major challenge for all Scottish colleges but said the dinner costs were met by sponsorship. A spokeswoman said: “Our main financial challenge for the year ahead is to meet the costs associated with the Kilwinning PFI Campus, national bargaining costs and the increasing costs of pensions, utilities and services. “While the Scottish Funding Council has agreed to provide further strategic funds to help manage these rising costs, the college still requires to make signicant savings to secure its financial sustainability and jobs for the future. “We are, therefore, considering proposals for an organisational review. “All staff are aware of the challenges the college faces, and have contributed to a consultation regarding potential efficiencies and opportunities for income generation. “We have just passed our five-year anniversary as Ayrshire College, and have planned an event, ‘Celebrating Five Years of Success. It is important to recognise this milestone and celebrate success – for learners, staff, the college and the region. “We are mindful of the costs of holding such an event and so have secured full sponsorship.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnUniversities and CollegesAyr NewsAyrEducationKilmarnockSchoolsKilwinning"},{"url":null,"title":"giant bins placed right outside","story":"NewsGiant bins placed right outside a restaurant and pub in scenic townAnger in Troon as bin squad set up town corral without asking anyone for permissionShareByStephen Houston:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA council works gang put up a new big bin enclosure – right outside a restaurant and pub in the scenic centre of town. Now a row has broken out after it emerged one council department had not even bothered to speak to another. The unsightly corral cluster for five bins was secured in place near The Cross in Troon without any consultation. Troon Councillors have now become aware after a multitude of complaints. The cleansing department is claiming they contacted the planning department about the placing of the bins. But planners are denying any knowledge of a consultation. Troon SNP Councillor Craig Mackay is now leading the charge to find somewhere  for the bins to be situated, rather than outside the Jade Garden Chinese and Macintyre’s bar. He is asking for officials to meet councillors at the spot in Templehill to try and find a resolution. Councillor Mackay said: “We are trying to develop a coherent vision for our town centre. “I’m not convinced this is the best we can manage for such a high profile location. Cleansing regrettably installed these enclosures without any prior consultation. While it is arguably an operational matter that doesn’t require any such input,they had asked any of the councillors or the community council for comment then I am certain we would not have found ourselves in this situation. “The council’s Planning service disappointingly also appear not to have been consulted on the siting or design of this bin store within the conservation area. I don’t wish to play departments off against each other, but would seek to find a community consensus about what is appropriate for our public realm. “This will almost certainly involve an alternative solution for the bins.” A council spokesman confirmed they are investigating, saying: ““We introduced communal bins to keep the litter secure and away from gulls.

close to where he first made his famous Coulters Candy - around August.And he will be joined by two additional bronzes - of a boy and girl - later in the year.The three-piece commemoration is being designed and made by Innerleithen sculptor Angela Hunter.Originally from Galashiels, Angela has worked alongside local historians Mary Craig and Graeme McIver, as well as local councillor Sandy Aitchison to champion Coltartrsquos story.Angela told us: ldquoI am delighted we now have an agreed design we are able to let the Borders public see.ldquoThe agreed design of the Robert Coltart sculpture is based on newspaper cuttings, including an image we have of him.\"While we can never be  percent certain of his appearance, the research by Mary and Graeme and feedback to our appeal means I feel I can now portray his stature and personality.ldquoI will now press ahead with producing a lasting legacy for Robert Coltart that Galashiels can be proud of.Robert Coltart was born in Dumfries and Galloway and moved to Galashiels at a young age, like many at the time, to work in the mills.It was during the s that it is thought the weaver began making aniseed-flavoured toffee at his Overhaugh Street home.As well as doing a fine trade at fairs, he would sell his candy around the streets of his adopted hometown by playing a whistle and singing his jingle - Ally Bally Bee - with a trail of children in his wake.Coltart also lived at houses in Henderson Close and Park Street, which have both since been demolished.And he was known to travel to nearby Melrose and Selkirk, as well as other Borders towns, to sell his candy on the streets.An appeal in January for further information on Robert Coltart saw Angela receive messages from across Scotland and even Canada, which helped with the final design.Historian Mary added: ldquoRobert Coltartrsquos story is one that many more people should know about and I hope this sculpture will encourage people to find out how the famous song Coulterrsquos Candy came to be written by a weaver from Galashiels.The finished tribute in the Market Square will become part of a new town trail, supported by the Scottish Government.Around pound, of improvements are planned as part of the regeneration of the town centre.Helen Calder of Energise Galashiels Trust, who has also championed Coltartrsquos story, said: ldquoWe want Galashiels to be a more vibrant, welcoming and confident community.\"The tale of Robert Coltart embodies this vision, and we are delighted progress is now being made to finally celebrate his link to our town.The funding from the Scottish Government is also supporting new visitor signage and improvements to Channel Street and Douglas Bridge, as well as helping to fund the Great Tapestry of Scotland visitor attraction.The town trail will include the location of Robert Coltartrsquos one bedroom flat in Overhaugh Street, which he shared with his family.Councillor Mark Rowley, who is the spokesman for business, said: ldquoIn line with other regeneration works going on in Galashiels, the Coulterrsquos Candy project has been taken forward with a number of partners and it was important they all had sight of the initial design before it was issued publicly.ldquoA real effort is being made to ensure visitors are attracted to Galashiels, and the wider Borders area, and it is worth noting that without the Great Tapestry of Scotland visitor attraction -

The development will tower over the bungalows in Justice Park resulting in considerable overlooking of the properties both Justice Park and Heriotfield, and loss of light to our properties, including several homes with solar .ldquoResidents are angry at the proposal which involves both the loss of green space and the loss of amenities from the demolition of the garages.In support of the application, Scottish Borders Housing Associationrsquos chief executive Julia Mulloy also appeared before the committee.

His report states: ldquoThe proposed development occupies a location within the Oxton settlement boundary, where national and local planning policies are generally supportive towards infill development.ldquoThe revised siting and design of the proposed development is considered to respect the character of the surrounding area and the amenity of neighbouring residential properties.ldquoSubject to the compliance with the schedule of conditions, the development will accord with the relevant provisions of the local development plan  and there are no material considerations that would justy a departure from these provisions.Galashiels councillor Sandy Aitchison agreed with the councilrsquos planning officers, saying: ldquoTaking everything into consideration, Irsquom reasonably happy with this and Irsquod move to accept the officerrsquos recommendation and approve.Councillors were in broad agreement and voted unanimously to approve the application."},{"url":null,"title":"colour-run-returns-to-galashiels","story":"REMEMBER to grab your running shoes this month as Galashielsrsquo colourful fun run s for a second year.The family-friendly Colour Run will take place at Heriot-Wattrsquos Scottish Bordersrsquo campus on March .Developed in partnership between Heriot-Watt University and Live Borders, the Colour Run is a six-kilometre course with the participants being treated to some colourful surprises as volunteers splash them with powdered, biodegradable paint throughout the route.The fun run is a golden opportunity to raise money for charity while having fun.Proceeds from the event will be shared between local charity Live Borders and SANE, a leading UK mental health charity.Previously, the Colour Run had to be postponed twice due to the terrible weather last year.This year, though, the organisers hope the Borders Colour Run willwithout a hitch.Lucy Graham, Vice President at the Heriot-Wattrsquos Scottish Bordersrsquo campus said: \"We are super excited to see theof the Borders Colour Run for a second year.ldquoLast yearrsquos event proved to be a great success, it was fantastic to see so many happy faces and people of all ages, join in the fun.ldquoThe Colour Run is a brilliant occasion which brings the students and local community together promoting healthiness, happiness, and while raising money for a fantastic cause.ldquoWe cant wait to see you there.\"Ewan Jackson, Chief Executive Officer at Live Borders added: ldquoThe Colour Run is a fantastic opportunity for people of all ages to undertake a challenge with a dference.ldquoItrsquos a chance to enjoy some great Bordersrsquo countryside and enhance your fitness with friends and family all for charity.ldquoA big thanks to the team at Heriot-Watt University and everyone involved in bringing the event to fruition for the second consecutive year.ldquoIt promises to be a great day.Booking for the run is essential as the spaces are limited.To secure your place visit www.liveborders.org.uk.Registration on the day will open at am with the event set to get underway at :am."},{"url":null,"title":"think-pharmacy-first-says-msp","story":"A REGIONAL MSP is encouraging Borderers to think lsquopharmacy firstrsquo when in need of professional health advice.Paul Wheelhouse, SNP member for South Scotland, is urging constituents not to take up the time of GPs unless it is necessary.And he has been visiting local chemists to find out more about the services they offer.Mr Wheelhouse told us: ldquoCommunity pharmacies are really important assets to any town.ldquoI have seen first-hand just how much support theyrsquore able to offer ndash whether thatrsquos providing advice or treatment, or just signposting people to the right NHS services.

If we did not encourage change, we would still be living in caves.Mr Howardrsquos arguments have not swayed principal planning officer Carlos Clarke as he recommends that councillors reject the application and force him to cease trading from the premises.He writes: ldquoAspects of the development are acceptable, subject to conditions, particularly to rationalise the number and appearance of the ious small structures proposed.ldquoHowever, the joinerrsquos workshop and retail sales would be contrary to the local development plan, and this conflict is not overridden by other considerations.ldquoAs these elements form a signicant part of the development proposal, it would not be appropriate to delete them from a prospective consent by condition.ldquoUltimately, therefore, the application should be refused because of the proposed retail and joinerrsquos workshoprsquos conflicts with council planning policy.The proposed joinerrsquos workshop would be contrary to the local development plan in that there is inadequate justication for the proposed use on this site, which is not located within an allocated employment, mixed-use or redevelopment area, and would be potentially detrimental to the character and amenity of the surrounding area.ldquoThe proposed retail use would also be contrary to the local development plan in that the site is not within the town centre and it is not been demonstrated that there are no sequentially preferable sites closer to or within the town centre or that the proposed development would not detract from the vitality and viability of the town centre, and because the visual impact of the retail use proposed would be detrimental to the character of the surrounding area.ldquoOther material considerations do not outweigh this conflict."},{"url":null,"title":"readers-photo","story":"This photo, entitled lsquoRainy Days... rain drops and reflectionsrsquo was posted by BorderCamera Club member Hazel Dunbar.

This was his first goal for the Pupils and just reward for his perseverance.It was good to see two teenagers making their mark for the club, with Ross Brown joining his academy teammate MacBrayne in a fine first half performance on opposite flanks of midfield.Nevertheless, the home side ‘stole’ into the lead in the st minute, a comic-cut situation that saw Ellis Robertson unbelievably penalised for stumbling over his own heels.The resultant free kick was delivered with venom and a headed deflection thundered into the net to restore the home side’s lead.The setback was short-lived as almost immediately the in-form Donald McCallum cut inside past two defenders to drive the ball high into the roof of the net for a superb equaliser.This heralded the Pupils# best spell of the match, with Ross Brown ending a great move with a volley that left the keeper rooted to the spot.But the goal, arguably the best of the match, was ruled out for offside.Ryan McConnachie was next to try his luck with an audacious overhead kick that just cleared the bar.Lady luck deserted the cause when the referee awarded a soft penalty kick to home club.The visitors were a goal behind despite dominating most of the second half.With  minutes remaining the league leaders looked to have sealed the points when a tactical long throw was forced home to give ‘the Port’ a two goal advantage.However, in an exciting end to another close fought match, Lee Allen scored a towering header from a Donald McCallum corner to make the score -.Despite a great effort in the closing minutes, the Pupils couldn’t score to get their just reward.Having played well and given everything, the visitors ed home with nothing to show for their efforts.TomorrowCampbeltown Pupilsto home action with another dficult match against third-placed Hillington at Kintyre Park with a pm kick off.  See social media and posters for confirmation of venue.Fraser MacBrayne in action earlier this season at Kintyre Park. _cpupils"},{"url":null,"title":"drama festivals farcical first night","story":"Accent Players# Grave Prospects, by Isabella C Rae, a mix of ghosts and the living, set in a contemporary graveyard, gave plenty of scope for laughs.Mission to Planet Bob, set in , staged by Dunaverty Players, cut the stage cast down to three suspended animation astronauts: Amy , Katieand Ed .Peninver Players# slapstick Melons at the Parsonage was the final Friday act with two plays within a third at an imaginary drama festival.At times Peninver#s action became confusing and caused adjudicator Jim Gibson to declare that he hoped he was not like its adjudicator Ted .Adjudicating at the end of the night, Mr Gibson said that the connection between all three plays was that they all ended in controlled lunacy.Speaking about Accent Players, Mr Gibson said: #There were very good dferent levels of set on the stage.#The make-up was nicely judged, particularly the ghosts, shades of grey but not .#I would have liked to have seen patchier lighting on stage, as it was fairly unorm, and perhaps some spots.#What was really nice was the fog coming on from stage left which reminded me of ectoplasm.#There was lots of good off-the-ball acting.

Such days are ones which have been borrowed from another month, and I think given the temperature and weather we have had recently the days have been borrowed from May.In , May will have borrowed Februaryrsquos days, so we can expect some unseasonal weather in that month as well, but in a dferent way.Sunday was a borrowed day for sure it was so mild and the later part sunny with a feeling of spring in the air. It was a perfect day for a discovery.We set off to find a place Irsquod only recently heard about. A friend had asked me what I knew about the lsquoKingrsquos Chairrsquo by Gullane. I had to admit that Irsquod never heard of it. He told me one of the holes at the golf course there has this name, but it seems it is named after a location nearby.This set me investigating. Sure enough, I found it marked on the map and searched for an image, which I found on a website called Ancient Stones: a large boulder, shaped like a throne, guarded by two other stones either side. It intrigued me and so our quest began.The starting point of our adventure was Gullane Beach car park. I knew roughly where to look but purposefully hadnrsquot brought the map so that we had a challenge to find the lsquochairrsquo. We knew what it looked like and that we needed to walk along the upper path, not the one that heads for the beach.We went the wrong way at first and got stuck in a mass of sea buckthorn, but on reflection that just added to the sense of adventure and achievement. We soon found our way and then suddenly there it was, up on Gullane Hill. The kids ran excitedly towards the stones, shouting: ldquoFound it, found it.I felt quite exhilarated at the discovery, and to be honest impressed by the sight of the Kingrsquos Chair. I can see how it got its name, as it looks something like a majestic reclining armchair. The two boulders on either side of it look like sentries keeping watch.The kids sat on it, of course, and I had to wait my turn after my we, who reckoned it could just as easily be a lsquoQueenrsquos Chairrsquo.When I finally got a chance to seat my majestic posterior on the chair, I realised the view was majestic as well, with Gullane Beach very visible in the near distance.I reflected on the fact we had recently visited Edinburgh Castle and seen the Stone of Destiny or Stone of Scone, along with the crown jewels. This rather uninspiring stone in Edinburgh Castle may be the coronation stone used for  years in England, but it is not, I am sure, the coronation stone used by ancient kings of Scotland, despite official claims that it is.I think itrsquos pretty clear that Edward I never got his hands on the real Stone of Destiny and I am convinced it has remained in Scotland, hidden somewhere, ever since. It occurred to me that this stone actually better fitted the early description of the original coronation stone at Scone than the one in Edinburgh Castle.ldquoImaginethis is the real Stone of Destiny and has been here all the time, I said fancully out loud. I know it isnrsquot, of course, but I have to saythis Kingrsquos Chair was on display at Edinburgh Castle it would certainly look more authentic.But sadly there seems to be no recorded tradition connected to this Kingrsquos Chair. I could find no story, or reference to the origin of its name. Perhaps some local people have some information on this There is an entry from the s that records the name, citing locals as the source, so there is some historic veracity in its title. But no suggestion is offered for the origin of the name, or any tradition associated with the stone. Its geology I could not say but it doesnrsquot seem to be a glacial erratic.And so we are left to wonder. We discussed how the stone got here and how it got its name. Maybe some children played here many generations ago and gave the boulder its title. Perhaps a Viking king who landed on Gullane Beach sat himself down on this natural throne to survey his warriors at their bloody work.Whatever the origin, the name, the location and the nature of the stone make this a worthwhile and fun discovery, even without a firm legend attached to it.And as I sat on the chair I watched smoke billowing from the coastline a little further to the west, close to the edge of Aberlady nature reserve. What caused the fire I didnrsquot know, but even from a distance it seemed destructive.It was a prophetic sight to witness from the Kingrsquos Chair. It looked like a burning coastline from a Viking raid. Thankfully the distant screech of fire engines told us help was on the way. The children wanted to go see the fire, but we kept our distance from the flames and let the firefighters do their job.So the trip to the Kingrsquos Chair had been an adventure in more ways than one. On our way back, the children advanced dferent theories about the origin of the name. It was universally agreed that a story must be made, but no agreement on the actual tale.ldquoPerhaps, I said, ldquowe should leave it to the imagination of those who search for and discover it, so they can sit and feel the power of the place and get ideas.My imagination was certainly ablaze. I saw the leader of the ancient Gododdin tribe, King Loth, sitting on the stone, looking out to the Firth as he watched his terried daughter in a small coracle being taken out to the open sea, his brutal punishment for her defiance of his authority.The story would fit as her journey began at Aberlady Bay, and so her small craft would have been seen from the Kingrsquos Chair as it passed by, being pulled out to sea by one of the kingrsquos boats.Itrsquos all a fancy of my imagination, of course, but thatrsquos my story.

The reaction was similar in Prestonpans and North Berwick, while Dunbar saw the least support, with only one in five backing it.In the majority of towns, the most support was to use statutory action to force private owners of buildings in multiple ownership to have external repairs carried out.Among comments about public Wi-Fi relayed to councillors, one person said: ldquoI really find it surprising that town Wi-Fi has been identied as a possible benefit for the town centre. With excellent G coverage in the town, this would perhaps be more suited at the end of the list of improvements.Another added: ldquoI donrsquot think lack of public Wi-Fi is an issue with G cover widely available.But the council responded: ldquoThe council notes that even with  per centsuperfast broadband coverage [the same goes for G G], affordability will remain a signicant challenge.

Tell you that therersquos going to be a referendum on Brexit, that the ERG are back in their box, Jezza has finally come good, and Theresa May has been put in a secure unit. But I canrsquot in all honesty agree with commentators, like the blessed Polly Toynbee, who believe we are now on the road to redemption.Yes, Labour did repeat its promise to hold a referendumJeremy Corbynrsquos ldquoworkable plan of a permanent customs union is rejected ndash as it was in one of last weekrsquos many meaningless votes. Oh, and Labour will support a referendumthere is no General Election. Anda no deal Tory deal looks likely. If, , .ButLabour really wanted to eliminate the threat of no deal, it would have moved heaven and earth to deliver the SNPrsquos motion calling for precisely that.Looking back on this dismal week, the standout, surely, is the arrant insanity of Parliament ndash a rational body of elected representatives ndash failing to take the opportunity to rule out an event which would put the army on the streets, interrupt food and medicine supplies, and cause the loss of tens of thousands of jobs.Yes, the Yvette Cooper Oliver Letwin amendmentwas endorsed by Parliament overwhelmingly, after Theresa May gave it the nod. This means that there will be an extension to Article Parliament doesnrsquot support a deal by March . Well and good. If therersquos one thing the UK Parliament is supremely good at itrsquos failing to agree.It doesnrsquot like Mayrsquos botched deal, the Norway option, EFTA or any other solution that Brussels thinks acceptable. So that means an extension is inevitable. Except that the French president Emmanuel Macron and the Brussels negotiator, Michel Barnier, have made clear that the  countries of the EU , will only contemplate delaying Britainrsquos departure from the EUit is for ldquoa purpose. Holding more meaningless votes, staging more ministerial resignations and arguing on College Green outside Parliament do not, one suspects, constitute a legitimate purpose.Still, everyone seems convinced that an extension is in the bag. This led to largely unwarranted excitement on the Remain side. With Labour calling for a Peoplersquos Voteand Theresa Mayrsquos deadline finally breached, Twitter went into orbit. Lord Adonis all but declared victory in the Battle of Brexit. Europhiles were dancing in the streets, metaphorically at least, and jeering at the nasty Brexiters who had been defeated by the forces of good. It was like the last reel of Lord of the Rings.But such triumphalism was premature. Much as I wish it were the case, there is still no majority in Parliament for a referendum. Stephen K Bush, the political editor of the New Statesman, has been counting them out and counting them back in again and he is adamant that the Labour Brexit rebels will prevent any motion for a referendum passing through Parliament. He says at least  Labour MPs are opposed. Hersquos right.ldquoRebels here is something of a misnomer since there is widespread belief that Brexit is the outcome desired by their leader. Indeed, on one interpretation of last weekrsquos events, Jeremy Corbyn has managed to find a way to secure Brexit while also appearing to support a referendum. This is because what is called the Kyle Wilson amendment.This cross-party proposal, which Labour is minded to support on March , calls for MPs to agree to Theresa Mayrsquos deal , but only on the condition that there is a referendum to validate it. Bingo. Labour can tell all its working-class Brexit supporters in target marginals that, yes, it didnrsquot block Brexit. But Jeremy can also curry favour with the Remainiacs of Islington by appearing to support a Peoplersquos Vote.Itrsquos very clever, but to my mind somewhat bonkers. Why would Labour help pass Theresa Mayrsquos deal, which Jeremy Corbyn has said is worse than no deal, would lose thousands of jobs and would lock the UK into a backstop from which it cannot escape  At least this is what he has said repeatedly in the Commons.Surely, a vote is a vote. Theresa May could legitimately say that her deal has been endorsed by Parliament, and call on Labour to campaign for it in any referendum. Not that she has the slightest intention of calling a referendum.Theresa Mayrsquos strategy is the same as it ever was: not listening, nothing has changed, take it or leave it. It pains me to say it, but the Prime Minister at least has a strategy. It is to run down the clock, while allowing the ious tribes in Parliament and in her Cabinet, to fall out among themselves.Itrsquos working. Labour is moving ever more in the direction of her deal, however much they may deny it. Parliament canrsquot agree on anything.There are tears in Cabinet and more resignations ndash  from the Government so far. But whorsquos counting  The European Research Group ndash that comically misnamed faction of extreme Brexiters ndash has reportedly split over William Rees-Moggrsquos equivocation on the Irish backstop.And while all about is chaos and acrimony, so ticks away the clock until Brexit day. Twenty-eight days at the time of writing. Goodness me, is that really the time  Yes it is. As in the film of the same name, the zombies are stirring.I accept that is an offensive way to describe Nigel Faragersquos ldquoBrexit Betrayal march from Sunderland to London. But it could get nasty on the road.What do I think will happen in the end  As Irsquove been saying in this column since Christmas, I think Parliament will block a no-deal Brexit. There will be an extension of Article , and Labour will probably end up backing Mayrsquos deal, or abstaining on it which amounts to the same thing.If Labour, by some remote chance, continues to reject Mayrsquos deal or its iants, in the meaningful vote on the inglorious twelfth, then I think MPs would still reject a referendum. There is still no majority for one, and Labourrsquos die-hard Brexiters are not for turning.Which makes the most likely option ndash about the only one Theresa May can authorise as PM under her prerogative powers ndash would be to revoke Article . Pull the plug. End it.OK, so thatrsquos wishful thinking on my part. Her Government would fall and precipitate an election. But looking at the chaos that is Brexit, and the lack of time, it seems as good a shout as any, especiallyBrussels reject a meaningless extension.If Britain canrsquot decide how to leave the EU, an extension to Article  would be pointless.

I was often asked to introduce myself and thatrsquos when it would happen. Thatrsquos when I would crumble. The easiest way to describe it is the iceberg effect. At first glance, above the waterline people might not even notice a stammer, but below the surface where people canrsquot see, it can impact everything.My stammer wasnrsquot an issue at first. It developed in my early childhood when I was told that there was a problem with my pronunciation. I was five years old at the time but it didnrsquot control my le. My school report cards always said that I was talkative, confident and participated in all of the classroom activities. I was even given a leading role in a school production.Le changed when I made the move from a small primary school of  pupils to a high school with  people. I sat in class avoiding all eye contact with the teacher, fearing the dreaded moment that I would be asked a question. Jokes were often made by other pupils about my stammer which only made matters worse. I felt misunderstood and it completely ruined my self-esteem. The teachers didnt understand my stammer and some werent even aware that it was a condition. They just assumed that I was nervous.My behaviour soon became self-destructive. My class was asked to take part in a work shadowing competition were the top ten reports would be selected and the winners were expected to give a presentation in front of everyone. I couldnt think of anything worse. I took matters into my own hands and purposely sabotaged my report by adding in mistakes to ensure that I wouldnrsquot be picked.I used to be a teacher, I ended up homeless - football saved my leWhen I was studying at university, I worried about everything from being knocked back on nights out with my friends to buying train tickets. I thought that I would never get a job or make anything of my le. I had a good circle of friends, but it was always in the back of my mind that I was going to be made fun of by others. It reached the point were I knew that I had to take charge of the situation and not allow it to take over my le any more.Although there are speech therapists, there isnt a great deal of support for people living with stammers. I set up a support group in  for other people with the same concerns. People from all walks of le attend and share their stories. Each monthly session looks at ways to cope with everyday situations that stammers can make dficult. It explores ways to desensitise stammering, build peoplersquos confidence and help them manage stress.At one point, speaking situations were the first thing on my mind in the morning and the last thing on my mind at night. Now, I work for the NHS in a job where Irsquom required to speak in public and give presentations. Irsquom at a stage where I often find that I actually enjoy public speaking which is something I never thought Irsquod say.

Itrsquos doesnrsquot feel to me much like a public house gastropub no matter how insistent the name and when semi-empty felt over-furnished and under-whelming. At weekends may fly.  Price: Small plates mean big bills and an easier le for the kitchen, but everything was packed with thought and flavour so for once I didnt grudge paying around pound a plate.  Food: More evolutionary than revolutionary but Glasgow probably needs this. Some great dishes including that sprouting broccoli, pickled walnut and English feta, those hispi and those cheeky Arbroath Smokie fingers.

A majority of all main partiesrsquo supporters backed an elected second chamber.The Bryan paper that kicks off Labours review of its constitutional policy is set to take the party much closer to backing full federalism and a new constitutional settlement for the UK \"based on the commitment to redistribute power and wealth, and that takes account of the consequences of Brexit\".In her analysis of future principles, she says a new federal set-up will \"move from the existing model, where power is devolved from the central state to Scotland\".Baroness Bryan, who is the designated lead for updating the partyrsquos policy on federalism and Lords reform says the lsquopartnershiprsquo model for Westminster and Scotland would be backed by the reformed second chamber.The peer adds: \"The point is to change the relationship so that the Scottish Parliament is no longer subordinate to Westminster. A second chamber of the Regions and Nations would change the nature of the relations to shared government on the cross territorial issues.\"UK-wide, ldquoInstead of the House of Commons having automatic primacy, this would be a new settlement of shared sovereignty, Baroness Bryan says.She believes a reformed ndash most-likely directly elected ndash second chamber would have a key role in this, bringing the nations and regions together to agree what powers should be devolved and which should be shared.Willie Sullivan, director of ERS Scotland, said: ldquoThe piecemeal, ad hoc approach to democratic change in the UK has held us back, with a constant, low-level constitutional crisis: with Scotland and the other nations pitted against Westminster, and vice versa.\"That is not a sustainable relationship and it is time for an approach the puts citizens at the centre, not the needs of politicians. What form this reform takes is up for discussion, but it is good to see parties considering this in the round.ldquoAs this briefing points out, the primary way to reform the bloated, unelected House of Lords is to replace it with a fairly-elected revising chamber, with a clearly defined remit and which can speak up for the nations and regions of the whole UK.\"Voters are tired of seeing scandal after scandal in the Lords with no way of kicking them out. A much-smaller, more effective second chamber would help draw to a close the era of unaccountable power and bring our democracy into the st century.Bryans other key claims include concerns that the Scottish Parliament has gained additional powers in response to political pressures, which can be \"curtailed as easily as they were granted\".She says that while the Sewel convention established that Westminster would not legislate on devolved issues without the express consent of the Scottish Parliament, \"we have seen from the repatriation of powers through Brexit that this may not always be adhered to\".She also states that local government in Scotland has lost powers to increasing centralisation by the Scottish Government.Nancy Platts, co-ordinator of Politics for the Many ndash the trade union campaign for political reform ndash said: ldquoThis is a fundamental step [forward] in developing Labourrsquos thinking on constitutional reform.

It is therefore unsurprising that barn owls in the north of Scotland have a hard time during the winter months, with peak mortality rates being between December and March due to starvation.As temperatures start to drop in winter, small mammals become less active, meaning a lot less food is available for barn owls, and they need to work extra-hard to find it. This often results in the owls being forced to feed during daylight, even though they are naturally nocturnal hunters.This lack of food is particularly dangerous for barn owls as they are poorly insulated and need more food in winter to provide them with enough energy to stay warm.The Barn Owl Trust estimates that between  and  barn owls are killed each year on UK roads.RSPB Scotland site manager Dave Jones recently sent a deceased barn owl to the Scottish Agricultural College in Thurso for autopsy, when some concerned neighbours reported it after finding it at the roadside.The results of the autopsy showed that the bird was fit and healthy, \"in good shape and hunting successfully\", and that the death followed trauma to its wing and abdomen ndash suggesting that the bird died as a result of being hit by a vehicle.Dave said: \"It is extremely sad to discover that a fit and healthy birds le ended in this way. The barn owls in Caithness really are at the edge of their natural comfort zone and are particularly vulnerable in winter, so it isnt an unusual result, unfortunately. Its not all doom and gloom, though. Although we still find some casualties in this way, our population of barn owls in Caithness has recovered from the particularly poor winters of   and  , and they are considered to be the most northerly population of barn owls in the world.\"While we cant control the weather, there are some things we can do to help. If putting up a nest box, please make sure it isnt placed close to any busy roads. If you see a road casualty and it is safe to do so, please stop and report the find to your local wildle officer and to the Barn Owl Trust.

We have been sharing information to help the sector prepare for that scenario.#However, Mr Carmichael is standing by his claims, saying behind the scenes analysis is a totally dferent level of depth than the full impact assessment expected to be done on such a massive change.He has branded conservative ministers #woefully irresponsible# for #failing to safeguard the sector from the impact of Brexit.#Speaking while making his claims, earlier in the week, prior to the response from DEFRA, Mr Carmichael said: #When Conservatives think of farmers, they think of the big landowners and the estates This [FOI] response shows that they have no interest in, or concern for, the hill farmers and crofters whose businesses are the backbone of so many of our remote rural communities.#To run their business, farmers need certainty. They need to know what funding is available, what standards must be met and what tarfs need to be paid.#It is therefore appalling that Conservative ministers have failed to conduct an impact assessment on the impact of Brexit on sheep farming. These ministers are woefully irresponsible. Farmers deserve better.#“Behind the scenes analysis falls well short of the in-depth impact assessment that farmers and crofters deserve. It is like not doing your homework, but trying to cover the fact by saying that you put together a mind map. Simply unacceptable. By the government’s own admission, they have done nothing, and know of no work to do an impact assessment on the industry.“They have let the industry, and our farming and crofting communities down.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He questioned Minister for Public Finance, Kate Forbes MSP, in the Scottish Parliament earlier this afternoon, Wednesday, asking how this shortfall squares with the government’s commitment to the principle of fair funding for our leline internal ferry services.According to the Orkney MSP, the minister responded by saying that the government recognise the challenges in running these ferry services and that they have been clear in their budget that adequate funding is to be delivered.Commenting after the exchange, Mr McArthur said: “We now know that the Scottish Government has cut funding for Orkney’s internal ferry services by £, compared to last year.  This has left a £.m shortfall in the Council’s budget for delivering these leline services.#It is baffling how Ministers think this approach is consistent with their commitment to the principle of fair ferry funding.  It certainly flies in the face of the will of parliament, which voted for the government to deliver on its earlier promises.“Meantime, the island communities that rely on these leline services are left picking up the tab, including a three per cent increase in fares this year.  Ministers may ‘recognise’ the challenges of running these services, but they also must recognise their obligations genuinely to provide adequate funding.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It’s interesting because, no matter where I go, these are the three predominant issues, and they are all related.”There are around  EIS members in Orkney.On Monday, EIS members voted to reject a new pay offer.According to Mr Ramsey, the next step will be to hold a ballot on industrial action, although the union remains open to further negotiation.“Assuming that our members decide to vote for a strike, there will be two or three weeks before that goes through,” the vice-president explained.“We intend to continue to negotiate.

As the airline’s marketing chief Natalie Bowman put it: “We’re excited to showcase a pilot who’s risen to super hero status - an image that embodies strength and confidence and inspires future aviators across our expansive network to go further.”Scotland may not have any female airline chiefs, and Amanda McMillan, who ran the Glasgow, Aberdeen and Southampton airports group has moved on.However, there have been signicant appointments in other areas, with Syeda Ghufran last summer becoming ScotRail’s first female engineering director.: Alastair Dalton: Experts reveal Scotland’s transport heaven – and hellHaving joined the operator from university as a management trainee nine years ago, she has talked of wanting to change perceptions and encourage more young women to consider engineering “as a viable and rewarding career”.In a further positive sign, half of ScotRail’s latest engineering apprentices are female, albeit there is a big inbalance to address.A second important development was former Scottish Prison Service and Scottish Police Authority executive Catherine Topley becoming chief executive of Scottish Canals.She has a keen awareness of the waterways’ potential to improve people’s lives, from youngsters learning boating skills and elderly people getting the chance to enjoy green space to opportunities for deprived communities along the banks.: Alastair Dalton: The vested interest blocking cuts to air pollutionOther high-profile women who provide key role models include the managers of Scotland’s two busiest stations, Juliet Donnachie at Edinburgh Waverley and Susan Holden at Glasgow Central.The latter’s profile will be raised by being featured in a six-part series on the station which started on the new BBC Scotland channel last Sunday.However, Scotland’s railways - and the rest of transport - still has far to go.

They were discovered by staff in a store at the Museum of Edinburgh, just a few hundred yards away from the Palace of Holyroodhouse, where Mary ruled for six years after ing from France in . The  documents, which are inidually dated, numbered and signed, relate to the rights of deacons and tradesmen in the city, the selling of meat at the Tolbooth and the making of salt in Newhaven.Early conservation work on the documents, which were recently discovered in the Museum of Edinburgh’s own storage facility off the Canongate, has revealed watermarks – one of a goat and another of a flower – which can only been seen when held up to light.It is thought the papers entered the archives of the local authority in the s, but were then “lost” before being rediscovered nearly a century later during conservation work. Intriguingly, some of the documents signed by Mary date from when she was still in France.Experts in the council’s museums and galleries service, which is responsible for the official archives of the city, said the recently unearthed documents revealed an “often overlooked “ aspect of her le.History curator Vicky Garrington said: “Together, the documents shed light on a key part of Scotland’s past. We all know the tragic story of Mary Queen of Scots, her eventful le and eventual execution in , but in these documents we see a dferent side to Mary.“Here, she can be seen carefully managing the everyday affairs of Edinburgh, both from France and Scotland. It’s fascinating to think of her reading through these official papers before carefully applying her signature.“They are staying in storage at the museum for now. But we hope to have them assessed by a conservator and for further research to be done on them by experts on Mary, after which we hope to exhibit them, which will be hugely exciting.”Museums and galleries manager Frank Little said: “We’re constantly reviewing, caring for and researching our collections, and look forward to sharing more of the city’s rich heritage with residents and visitors through our programme of exhibitions and online activities.” Council culture convener Donald Wilson said: “Our museums and galleries hold thousands of historic treasures, many of which are on display in our venues.

The document takes the party much closer to backing full federalism and the abolition of the Lords, with a new second chamber likely to take its place.: Antisemitism could cost Labour power in Scotland, says Jeremy CorbynBaroness Bryan was designated the lead for updating the party’s policy on federalism and Lords reform.The new federal set-up, according to the paper, will “move from the existing model, where power is devolved from the central state to Scotland.”: Scottish Labour can’t rely on voter ‘disillusionment’ with SNP, says Richard LeonardIt argues: “It should instead be a relationship of shared power based on partnership, not hierarchy. Under this arrangement there must be common minimum standards across the UK on human rights, employment rights, consumer protection and environmental protection and that the Scottish Parliament should have the power to enhance but never detract from these minimum standards.” The peer adds: “The point is to change the relationship so that the Scottish Parliament is no longer subordinate to Westminster. A second chamber of the Regions and Nations would change the nature of the relations to shared government on the cross territorial issues.”This would mean that instead of the House of Commons having enjoying primacy over the devolved assemblies,this would be a new settlement of “shared sovereignty.” Jeremy Corbyn has previously spoken out in favour of replacing the Lords with an elected second chamber.A reformed – most-likely directly elected – second chamber would have a key role in this, bringing the nations and regions together to agree what powers should be devolved and which should be shared.It comes as previously unreleased polling for the ERS shows that, when ‘don’t knows’ are excluded, support for an elected upper chamber sits at % for SNP voters and % for Conservatives across Britain . A majority of all main parties’ supporters back an elected second chamber.The Bryan Paper - published by the Red Paper collective - demands a ‘partnership’ model for Westminster and Scotland, backed up by a reformed second chamber for the nations and regions.Willie Sullivan, Director of Electoral reform Society Scotland, said: “The piecemeal, ad hoc approach to democratic change in the UK has held us back, with a constant, low-level constitutional crisis: with Scotland and the other nations pitted against Westminster, and vice versa. “That is not a sustainable relationship and it is time for an approach the puts citizens at the centre, not the needs of politicians. What form this reform takes is up for discussion, but it is good to see parties considering this in the round.“As this briefing points out, the primary way to reform the bloated, unelected House of Lords is to replace it with a fairly-elected revising chamber, with a clearly defined remit and which can speak up for the nations and regions of the whole UK. Voters are tired of seeing scandal after scandal in the Lords with no way of kicking them out. A much-smaller, more effective second chamber would help draw to a close the era of unaccountable power and bring our democracy into the st century.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

Over the last few weeks KPL staff have been busy ferrying equipment, supplies and crews out to it as part of the first such contract secured by the yard. During a visit, I expected to find a hive of activity the roar and clang of big machines.But on Thursday of last week I found the whole site surprisingly quiet. This, I am told, is because most of the activity is now taking place onboard what KPL directors refer to as the OGW.“The rig is crawling with insurance people and regulators right now,” says one of the directors, Simon Russell, as he shows me round. “They are all signing off their bits and pieces before the rig gets the final piece of paper that says it’s good to go.”Every weld is being stress tested. Every item of equipment is being put through its paces.Before the rig can face the punishing swells of the north Atlantic, such attention to detail is a matter of le and death.There are also inquisitive guests onboard, doing a little window shopping. They’ve been helicoptered straight on to the rig, the property of US firm Diamond Offshore. These VIPs are potential customers from major players such as Tarka Oil, here to see what the buzz is all about. While doing so, they may also be mightily impressed with Kishorn Port Ltd. That is the hope, anyway.As you are reading this, there is a good chance the Ocean GreatWhite, with a crew of  aboard, will be making its way back up the Minch. If the weather is favourable it may even be doing so under its own steam, without the need for a fleet of tugs to tow it to the Blackrock prospect, some  miles north west of Shetland.So advanced is the OGW that each corner-leg contains two enormous thrusters, powered by engines capable of generating , brake horse power of thrust. For non-petrol-heads that’s  Ferraris per engine. A top speed of eight knots is the result. Not bad for a structure that isn’t exactly designed to cut through the water. Stability is the name of game: even in the roughest seas the thrusters are meant to ensure that the rig doesn’t deviate by more than a metre from the drill point. West of Shetland, it may need every Newton of force those thrusters can provide. Once safely in place, the Ocean GreatWhite will be used by Siccar Point Energy and Shell UK to test for oil in an unexplored area of the seabed.“This is really cutting edge stuff,” enthuses Alasdair Ferguson, the other director in this   venture involving his own firm, Ferguson Transport and Shipping, and Simon’s LeithsLtd. “The rig can operate in , feet of water and drill a hole , feet deep.”In other words, that’s six miles into the earth’s crust. This is how far down we now have to go to get the black stuff. As the ‘Age of Oil’ wanes, rigs like the OGW could become the workhorses of the near future.However, the days of building giant concrete caissons to support them are long gone. Whatever finished products emerge from Kishorn in the next few years, another Ninian Central will not be among them. Deep water is where the action is – and that means floating oil rigs like the Ocean GreatWhite, a sixth-generation model designed specically to harvest the hard-to-reach hydrocarbons that now makes up much of what the UK still produces. Thankfully for Kishorn, that means west of Shetland.  According to Simon, this trend involves the “centre of gravity” shting away from Aberdeen and towards the west coast.KPL is ready and waiting for that trend to continue.“The same thing is happening with offshore wind,” says Simon. “If you look at the next round of Crown licenses you’ll see that most of them are here on the west coast.”“We want to create a multi-use facility,” adds Alasdair. “We want to build resilience into this facility so that it is not reliant on any one industry.”Offshore wind turbines need concrete caissons, albeit smaller than the Ninian Central’s. That’s another box ticked in favour of Kishorn.From about  metres away, the Ocean GreatWhite does indeed look like a floating hotel, to use Simon’s description. Unfortunately, this is as close as we are allowed to get. Obtaining insurance cover for non-crew is a minefield Diamond Offshore also doesn’t want any photographs taken of their cutting-edge equipment. So circling the rig aboard the ‘Infinity’ will have to do for us.Aside from ferrying crew to and from the Ocean GreatWhite, the ‘Infinity’ usually takes tourists out to St Kilda from the Stein jetty in Waternish. But that happens mostly in the summer.“We have been flat out doing this since the rig arrived,” says skipper Kenny Mackinnon.Regular work over the winter is good for those who don’t usually have it.In fact, the arrival of the OGW has been a boon for the area. Twelve locals have been taken on in ious positions. This is the direct benefit. There is a harder to quanty knock-on effect for local businesses in what Alasdair refers to as the “downstream supply chain”. Everything from additional bed nights to sandwiches bought in the nearest shops are covered by this concept. And there have been quite a few of those over the last six weeks.Food and lodgings for visiting crews and subcontracted workers might sound like small beer, however. But the temporary largesse created by the presence of the OGW could be the start of something much bigger.Nothing like the crazy days of the s and s, though, when a town of , people sprung up in accommodation blocks behind the dry dock. That kind of development, said Simon, will not happen again, partly because of the strain it would place on local infrastructure.  Instead, he envisions - people employed directly at the site.The prefabs of Kishorn’s heyday are long gone but the dry dock is still here, its original concrete floor as good as new, so I’m told. The faint imprint of the Ninian Central , once the biggest manmade object ever moved across the face of the Earth, is still visible a spectral impression of the past.KPL have more modest ambitions than trying to resurrect what was.Simon and Alasdair are building in small steps. They’re making progress, just at a slower pace than many would like to see.Further investment is required to speed things up. That, however, is based partly on more rigs using the yard. KPL have a few irons in the fire on that front, but nothing definite yet.“The revenue this will generate will enable us to extend one of the piers, out into the deeper water, so we can load and unload directly rather than having to ferry equipment and people back and forth,” says Alasdair.Just sixty metres from the shore Loch Kishorn reaches a depth of around  metres, easily enough to accommodate oil rigs which, it should be remembered, need taken apart when they’ve reached the end of their working lives. Decommissioning s is on the KPL menu too.If , jobs were a flash in the pan,  jobs might be the sustainable optimum. By definition, the slow build lasts longer than the quick buck.In this place of big numbers,  might be big enough."},{"url":null,"title":"castle tower pupils are guests of honour for ballymena s royal visit","story":"Staff and pupils from Castle Tower made memories to last a letime after they were special guests at the recent Royal visit to Ballymena.A delegation from the school was invited to The Braid to personally greet the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on their arrival in the town.With several hundred well-wishers turning out to cheer Prince William and Catherine, young people at Castle Tower were provided a unique vantage point, with many shaking hands and chatting with the couple.The pupils were joined by Castle Tower governors Councillor Audrey Wales MBE and Anne Donaghy, chief executive of Mid and East Antrim Borough Council.Cllr.

Alan Murray thanked them for their generosity and emphasised the importance of the new venture.“Last year in Northern Ireland there were almost  out of hospital cardiac arrests: an average of four a day. Only one in ten of these people survived to be discharged from hospital. However, with CPR and defibrillation within  to  minutes of collapse, survival rates can rise to % and above.Braid Valley Community First Responders aims to train and organise local people to respond to cardiac arrests in their own community while the ambulance is on its way and improve survival rates in Broughshane and Ballymena and the surrounding rural areas. This generous donation will be of great help to us in achieving our aim.”Stephen Lamont issued an appeal for local residents to ensure that their addresses were identiable.“Clear signage is vitalwe are to get to you quickly in a le threatening emergency. “Our plea is that you identy your house number or name clearly so that it can be read from the road. “ If you live up a shared drive, please talk to your neighbours and label the end of the drive with all the house numbers and ensure that each inidual house is numbered. “This will help us to help youyou are having an emergency.”  "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1462209.jpg--.jpg?1550660974000\n","title":"moy park general manager shines a light on factory life","story":" AARON Whiteman has been with Moy Park for almost  years, working his way up from weekend sht worker to front line manager, to his current role as General Manager at the Ballymena site. As Moy Park celebrates  years in business, Aaron reflects on changes in the sector and milestones along the way. He said: “I first joined Moy Park in  when I was still at school, working part time at the weekends as a factory operative. “As a student, it was a great insight into the world of work and business. It taught me the value of hard work, money earned, and motivated me to want to do more of both! “After gaining a degree in Health and Leisure from Queen’s University Belfast, I was keen to move into a business environment and decided to apply to Moy Park’s Graduate Management Programme, to find out more about a career in one of our fastest growing industries, agri-food. “The two-year programme was the ideal way to find out more about ious strands of a business, from operations to finance, HR and marketing, and what might suit my skillset best. “From my time as a sht worker on the factory floor, I had a healthy respect and interest in the processing side of Moy Park, and the opportunities and challenges therein. “Once I completed the Graduate Management Programme - which we still use as a recruitment tool today - I took up a position as a sht manager, capitalising on my people management skills and interest in operations. “Since then, I have worked my way up across a number of Moy Park’s sites – moving from factory manager to area manager and have now been General Manager at Ballymena for two years. “Ballymena is a great place to work. From a business point of view, it’s strategically located with fantastic transport links and from a social standpoint, you’ll never find yourself wanting for something to do – from shopping to socialising over a drink or a bite to eat. It’s also quickly becoming the spa capital of Northern Ireland! “While Ballymena has faced a number of economic challenges, it’s an area with a rich history and heritage of business success. This spirit is still very much evidenced by the people, businesses and organisations in the town today. “Mid and East Antrim Council has an ambitious integrated economic development strategy for the area to help encourage business growth across the borough, and it’s one we are keen to help support. “It’s a strategy important not just to Moy Park as a business, but to me personally. “I sit on Mid and East Antrim Council’s Manufacturing Task Force Team, a working group committed to supporting and fostering growth. I was delighted to attend Westminster with a delegation from the Task Force recently when Northern Ireland representatives presented their plans for a Belfast City Deal. “Hearing these plans certainly gave us food for thought when it comes to nurturing growth locally. “As Ballymena’s General Manager, I’m responsible for all business s at the site – from technical to HR and finance. “With over , members of staff, it’s a erse and busy job but that’s what makes it worth doing. In the last  years, business management has evolved signicantly. “While there might be more paperwork, regulations, travel and late nights, there is also an incredible amount of collaboration - with customers, industry, educational bodies and government and our local communications. “Managers today cannot afford to work in silos, you need to adopt an attitude of knowledge sharing and foster an environment of innovation to truly succeed. “My key piece of advice to anyone viewing management as a career is to do your research and bolster your skillsyou need to. Being a good manager isn’t a static position, you constantly need to challenge yourself, and a good employer is one who lets you not only challenge yourself but equips you with the skills to overcome these challenges. “One of my own personal highlights over the last  years was been being named ‘Young Processor of the Year’ at the Meat and Poultry Processing Awards in . “Given my background working on the factory floor, it was great to win an industry award. At a business level, I’ve been very proud to see Ballymena evolve to become a Centre of Excellence, focused on driving innovation in food manufacturing. “As General Manager, it’s my ambition to see our facilities continue to grow.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460409.jpg--.jpg?1550570234000\n","title":"children from gran canaria welcomed to ballymena","story":"A group of children from Gran Canaria have been visiting Ballymena to take part in the annual local music festival.The group of  children are pupils of the British School of Gran Canaria, and are taught by local woman Claire McDonald.Claire, who is the head of the music department at the English speaking school has accompanied her pupils to Northern Ireland to take part in the festival, sightsee, improve their English skills and experience the culture of Northern Ireland.The young people, who are all aged between  and  years old are keen musicians, with some playing the piano, drums, violins while others are singers.They have experienced success at the festival, with some winning first and second prizes and others were highly commended.The group have been travelling around NI, visiting the Giant’s Causeway, Hillsborough Castle and the Titanic museum and performed in a local concert with Kellswater Flute Band.This has been their first taste of Northern Ireland, and it did not disappoint!One of the students, Miguel said: “I’ve really enjoyed my trip. “I play the drums and the musical festival has been great.“We learn English at school so it’s good to speak it here.”Fellow student Alicia, said: “Northern Ireland is great and the festival has been a wonderful experience.“I was really excited to play with the band but my favourite part was the Giant’s Causeway and the music festival.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460481.jpg--.jpg?1550570359000\n","title":"rodney quigley announces independent candidacy","story":"Ballymena man Rodney Quigley has announced he plans to stand in this year’s Council elections.Announcing his candidacy on Facebook this week, the well known community activist posted: “I intend to stand as an Independent candidate in the Mid and East Antrim council elections on nd May.“As someone who has worked tirelessly as a community worker for over  years, and as a member of the policing and community safety partnership for  years, I feel that I have something to offer at local council level.“I have dealt with many community issues in the past and will continue to put the community first on any issues that are brought to my attention. “Ive also worked with many councillors on many issues in the past and would continue to work along side them for the good of everyone in Ballymena.“I know that many people have said its time for change and it would be good to see a few new faces within Mid and East Antrim council.“If this is the case Id like to be one of the new faces.“I can assure people thatelected, I will put my best foot forward every time and will work to resolve local issues for everyone in Ballymena.”Election datesNomination forms for prospective candidates must be ed to the Deputy Returning Officer by pm on Monday April , .The election will be held on Thursday, May , .

It is hoped that a cross-cultural comparison between the four partner countries will help to explain iations and similarities with regard to gender in entrepreneurship ecosystems. The funding was awarded under Gender-Net Plus, an EU-funded initiative that aims to strengthen links between researchers in dferent countries, and support gender equality through institutional change.Professor Maura McAdam, Professor of Management and Director of Entrepreneurship at DCU’s Business School said: “There is an assumption that all entrepreneurs have equal access to resources, participation and support, as well as an equal chance of a successful outcome. However, my latest research shows that women are underrepresented in successful entrepreneurial ecosystems, and that a persistent gender bias continues to exist in entrepreneurship discourse and practice.

The little trawlers are impounded, their crews taken hostage. But why Captain Jamie Bryson was once the Royal Navy’s most decorated and respected nuclear sub commander. But now he’s living in semi-retirement in the sleepy backwater of Donaghadee, tending his garden by day, chairing the parish council by night. When the call comes from Whitehall for him to take to the conning tower for one last top-secret mission, Captain Jamie has to make a choice between his chrysanths and his country#“Action, romance, danger, flute music. This one has it all.” The Ballymena .“An explosive tale of international intrigue that gallops breathlessly from Glengormley to Dundalk and straight to the gates of hell.” Shankill Buy and Sell.“A really cracking holiday read and, believe me, I know what I’m talking about.” Ian Paisley Jnr.“But Sinn Féin.” Slugger O’Toole.Chapter oneCONTACT‘Up periscope!’Captain Jamie Bryson’s voice was tight with tension as he barked the order. He bent and took the handles, his knuckles whitening with the force of his grip. He welcomed the cold anger, it made him feel alive he channelled it, bent it to his will. Anger and training: the fighting man’s best friends – how well he remembered that from his first day at Submarine School Newtownards.The Astute class hunter-killer nuclear submarine sat sleek and silent  metres below the cold, dark Irish Sea. Captain Jamie’s eyes narrowed as he slowly scanned the still waters of Clogherhead harbour, past the pastel colours of the little trawler fleet until at last his crosshairs came to rest on the dull grey hull of the LÉ Orla. The battlecruiser lay squat and sinister in a corner of the harbour commanding a direct view of the two kidnapped Ulster fishing boats, the Amity and the Boy Joseph, two of its four .mm heavy machine-guns trained on the wheelhouses where captain and crew lay on the floor trussed up like pigs.Captain Jamie pushed the periscope handles into the closed position and took a step backward. “Battle stations,” he rasped, “make ready forward torpedo hatches”Executive Officer Willie Frazer’s face creased into a mask of doubt and uncertainty. “But Captain, we’re under strict orders to maintain a watching brief.”He’d served under Captain Jamie for close on  years and never questioned an order – no need to, for Captain Jamie was a Man of the Sea: confident, experienced, exuding an air of calm authority that brooked no dissent.“Mr Frazer, you have your orders.” Captain Jamie’s words were low, but there was no mistaking his deadly seriousness.“Yes, Captain.”A light wind ruffled the short sleeves of Captain Jamie’s immaculately-pressed white shirt and a weak winter sun glinted off the shiny black peak of his cap as he took his place on the conning tower. He fixed his binoculars on the brooding hulk of the LÉ Orla and stood fixed and resolute as a statue. At his shoulder, XO Frazer gripped the cold metal around him to stop his hands from shaking. Though he didn’t take his eyes from the glass, Captain Jamie sensed his number two’s unease.“Mr Frazer,” he said, his gaze still on the enemy ship. “If those trawlers aren’t released by noon, we open fire. Ulster demands it.”• The Clogherhead Convention.

It is not without irony that the words spoken at that event proved this week to be prescient.Law is meant to provide a moral compass for society, allow us a set of norms by which we agree to conduct society and protect the vulnerable. We live in streets where for decades law was either disregarded or used as a tool in a weaponry of oppression. Those reading this paper who were subjected to the ignominy of its abuse will all know too well what happens when law does not work. It incites and prolongs conflict, harm and pain. But most of all the corruption of law leads to despair. Where can we gowe do not have the protection of law The single most important achievement of the Good Friday Agreement was the review of criminal justice. It was a recognition that the corruption of law needed to be endedwe were to truly ensure our conflict never happened again.When the Supreme Court in London delivered its findings in the challenge by the Finucane family to the decision by the British government not to hold a public inquiry, it was a finding in law. It was not about Weston Park, nor about governmental promises, nor about changing economic environments. It was about what was right in law. And with its clear, non-political eye, saw that an inquiry was required into this pernicious example of state collusion in the killing of an officer of the courts.When last week there was an announcement that inquests would at last have appropriate structure and funding this was because of the domestic and international courts refusing any argument that the application of the rule of law could be subject to political favour or will. Legal compliance is not subject to negotiation.No matter who the citizen is, whatever their background, they should expect the law to defend them. No matter how big the power, whatever their political philosophy, they should expect the law to hold them to account. That is how it works. And it can remedy previous imbalance.Right now, the long arm of those who abused their position and the law in the RUC is reaching into the PSNI to undermine the courts addressing the crimes of the past. Alongside elements of the military and security services these vested interests are doing it because the law, through its courts and processes such as the Police Ombudsman, is holding previous members of state agencies and the narrative of the state as upholders of law and order to account. This is a critical time.

During the piece I never mention death, I never mention anything being lost, in fact I say very little. The piece is very movement-based, it’s an interpretation of grief, because I wouldn’t be able to stand up and talk about it. I wouldn’t want to and I don’t think anyone would be really interested in listening to that either – not really.”Asked why she has chosen to take on something so raw and so close, Róisín tells me: “Well, it is something that keeps coming up in conversation. For me, it was a real compulsion to remember daddy, born out of a fear of forgetting him. I recorded him speaking when he was sick and those recordings have become the soundscape for this piece. His voice is very present in the piece. “I could just do this for myself and not show it to anyone. I could just write it all down and put it under my bed and that would be a part of my grief process. People can be in the same space and share what is a very universal, inevitable thing for every single human being.“I don’t think we as a society are really that great at dealing with grief. “There was a time I wanted to make myself a little badge saying, ‘I’m grieving, please be patient with me.’ Hopefully this piece is a good way for people to share and create conversation – some people might not want to talk and that’s fine. I think that the bottom line is about putting trust and faith in the universe, in nature and the hope and comfort that this is a cycle and we live on.I want people to feel comforted and feel hopeful in some way and I want them to see what I clung on to. Ultimately I want to do daddy justice.”• Natural Disaster is on at the MAC on March  and . Tickets for the play are priced at £.

Michel Barnier has proposed that Britain can leave the customs union unilaterally, but Northern Ireland must remain tied to the EU regulations to avoid a hard border. The idea was swtly rejected by the DUP, which props up Mrs Mays minority Government at Westminster, as \"neither realistic nor sensible\". Its deputy leader Nigel Dodds said a deal was still possible but warned there must be less \"intransigence\" in Brussels.It came as former Foreign Secretary and leading pro-Brexit MP Boris Johnson accused Mr Barnier of attempting to \"annex\" Northern Ireland. His accusation came in a message, posted in a private WhatsApp group, which has been seen by the Belfast .Referring to Mr Barniers proposals, Mr Johnson posted: \"Be careful of what Barnier is proposing now... seems to mean annexation of NI.\"Mr Johnson did not respond to requests for comment.The developments come ahead of a potentially decisive week.Mrs May will put her withdrawal agreement to the House of Commons again on Tuesday in the hope of overturning the record -vote defeat she suffered in January. However, she was left to desperately implore the EU to facilitate legally-binding changes to the controversial backstop yesterday. The Prime Minister said she needed \"one more push\" to get the deal through Parliament. However, EU sources said they remain \"hugely sceptical\" about her ability to win any vote. Mr Barniers offer includes a legal guarantee that Britain can leave the backstop at any time but it does not change the so-called Irish Protocol within the withdrawal agreement. He stressed Britain would still need to honour its commitment to preserve a border free of controls on this island. \"EU commits to give UK the option to exit the single customs territory unilaterally, while the other elements of the backstop must be maintained to avoid a hard border,\" he tweeted. \"UK will not be forced into customs union against its will.\" Sources said this would amount to a border \"in the Irish Sea\"a future UK Government decided to break the customs link with the EU.The backstop was originally designed to apply exclusively to Northern Ireland, but Mrs May convinced the EU to make it UK-wide after the DUP complained that the province was being treated dferently. A majority of business leaders and farmers in here believe a sea border would be less impactful than one on the island. Mr Dodds categorically rejected the compromise proposal last night. \"This is neither a realistic nor sensible proposal from Michel Barnier,\" he said.\"It disrespects the constitutional and economic integrity of the United Kingdom. This is an attempt to get ahead of a possible blame game and appear positive when in reality it is going backwards to something rejected a year ago. As the Prime Minister has said, no United Kingdom Prime Minister could sign up to an arrangement which annexes Northern Ireland from the rest of the United Kingdom. \"Whilst the European Union has spoken often about their value of the peace process in Northern Ireland, this proposal demonstrates that they have a one-sided approach and a lack of understanding about the isions in Northern Ireland. \"Just as nationalists and republicans oppose a new north-south border, unionists oppose any new east-west border which would place a new barrier between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.\"We need to work for a sensible deal which can work for everyone in Northern Ireland. It is possible but there must be less intransigence in Brussels.\" Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay said now was not the time to rerun old arguments.\"The UK has put forward clear new proposals. We now need to agree a balanced solution that can work for both sides,\" he said.The gulf which remains between the EU and UK was on display yesterday as both Mrs May and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar urged each other to change tact. The Irish Government last night supported the proposal from Mr Barnier, saying he continues \"to stand up for the interests of the whole of the EU, including Ireland\". \"The Taoiseach has repeatedly made clear that he would not oppose a backstop which is specic to Northern Ireland,that is deemed helpful, but that would have to be a decision for the UK,\" a spokesman said. Speaking in Dublin, Mr Varadkar questioned why the UK hasnt come forward with a concrete offer to the EU. He described Brexit as \"a problem of their creation\" and accused the House of Commons of actively going against the wishes of a majority of people in Northern Ireland who support the backstop. He said both sides had spent  months agreeing the backstop. \"Bear in mind elements of that compromise, like extending the backstop on a UK-wide basis, the single customs territory involving all the United Kingdom, these were compromises that the British Government sought. \"We were and remain happy to apply the backstop to Northern Ireland onlythey want to go back to that,\" he said. With no changes to offer Parliament, Mrs May looks set to lose her second attempt to win approval of her deal. Yesterday she issued a plea for support, saying \"no one knows\" what will happenher plan is defeated, with the possibility of Brexit being derailed completely. Mrs May said both the democratic and economic cases for backing her deal are \"clear\", and issued a plea to MPs: \"Lets get it done.\" The Prime Minister used her speech in Leave-supporting Grimsby to both urge the European Union to give ground on the backstop and call on Tory Eurosceptics to recognise that failure to back the deal could result in a softer Brexit or another referendum. \"Next week, MPs in Westminster face a crucial choice: \"Whether to back the Brexit deal or to reject it,\" she said. \"Back it and the UK will leave the European Union. Reject it and no-one knows what will happen. \"We may not leave the EU for many months, we may leave without the protections that the deal provides. We may never leave at all,\" she said. Rejection of the deal would be a \"moment of crisis\". Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned Brussels that a failure to co-operate on securing changes to the Brexit deal could \"poison\" relations with the EU for years. \"This is a moment of change in our relationship between the UK and the EU and history will judge both sides very badlywe get this wrong,\" Mr Hunt told BBC Radio s Today programme."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland and republic step closer to different time zones","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

resolving the dispute over the “backstop” insurance policy keeping Northern Ireland in line with EU regulationsno other trade solution is found is the key sticking point in reaching agreement before March .The committee published its report on Saturday.It took evidence from the former director of capacity building at the World Customs Organisation, Lars Karlsson, on proposals for managing the flow of goods on the island of Ireland.Mr Karlsson said all the separate elements which make up the proposal “have been tested somewhere in the world just not in one single border” and the border in Northern Ireland would be “the first and a leading example in the world of this kind.”His proposal included:– A bilateral EU-UK agreement on advanced customs cooperation– Mutual recognition of trusted traders– A technical agreement on exchange of customs risk data– An identication system by the border using either the mobile phone network or radio frequency identication to check goods or driver ID without leaving the vehicle– A digital single entry point for traders addressing import and export matters– Creation of a unique consignment reference number– A simplied electronic customs declaration system– Mobile control and inspection units– Border surveillance using automated number plate recognition and CCTV..\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Andrew Murrison said there should be no attempt

way of securing political advantage.“Mistrust over the backstop protocol has been heightened by lack of clarity on what exactly constitutes a ‘hard border.’“My committee is calling for clarication of the term in a legally explicit way to ensure both parties share the same understanding of how the backstop can be avoided.”"},{"url":null,"title":"labours richard leonard promises free bus network for

And under my leadership, fight it we will.”But his speech came at a time when Labour across the UK has come under fire for its stance on Brexit and for failing to tackle anti-Semitism within the party.With several English MPs having quit UK Labour to form The Independent Group, Mr Leonard said this was “a cause for regret”.He criticised the UK Government for the “calamity” of its approach to Brexit negotiations, as he insisted Labour had been “trying to steer a course through this mess”.And he stated: “If we cannot force Theresa May to change course and accept our credible alternative, let me be absolutely clear, Labour will back a public vote.”Mr Leonard was clear that “Brexit is not the only challenge we face” as he pledged the next Labour government at Holyrood would “build a more cohesive society by ending austerity”. with Jeremy Corbyn at the party’s Scottish conference. \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonardwith Jeremy Corbyn at the party’s Scottish conference.

They can’t match the SNP’s ambition when it comes to delivering for public services.“Both Jeremy Corbyn and Richard Leonard seem willing to crash us out of the EU in just  days’ time – throwing thousands of jobs on the scrapheap and damaging our NHS.“And they’re content to team up with the Tories to deny Scotland the right to choose its own future, while we get hammered by Westminster governments we didn’t vote for.“No wonder Labour are trailing a distant third in Scottish politics.”"},{"url":null,"title":"cctv captures moment rare baby giraffe is born at chester zoo","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

With  minutes remaining on the clock, Ballynahinch patiently played the ball around the back, waiting for an opening.Ashley Brownrsquos pass then found the lurking Stuart Hunter in space. Hunter was able to pick out roaming right back Leslie Harrison, who pulled a perfect pass back into Millar and he made no mistake in finding the net.Ballynahinch could easily have sat back and closed up shop, but they pinned Ballymena into their own half with a series of concerted attacks.Congratulations to everyone involved with the Ballynahinch menrsquos team, especially the supporters who never miss a game.The celebrations were short-lived as Ballynahinch have a huge game this weekend when they face Portrush in Coleraine in the Irish Hockey Challenge semi-final at pm.Ballynahinch: Aaron Donnell, Rea Coffey, Andrew Mulholland , Ashley Brown, Leslie Harrison, Matthew Martin, Stuart Hunter, William Edgar,Tim Crean, Jason Campbell, Alex Millar, Andrew McIlwaine, Luke Curry, Micheal Carney, Josh Higginson, Steven Crean.Joint men of the match: Alex Millar and Rea Coffey.Ballynahinch Ballymena ULSTER INTER LEAGUE.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"£2m tidal turbine providing energy spins in to action  ","story":"A poundm tidal turbine currently in Strangford Lough could provide electricity for between - homes, it has been revealed.The Scottish firm behind the innovative Subhub has said that energy produced from the fast-flowing lough could cost as low as p per kWH for local industrial load customers.However, the Subhub is not connected to the local electricity grid and is being tested for its environmental impact and maintenance needs.The distinctive yellow Subhub mdash which is roughly the size of of a bus mdash has been in Castleward Bay for the last six weeks.Easily seen from Portaferry, it was towed from Belfast Harbour and fixed into position within  hours on January .Jeremy Smith, managing director of QED Naval, said that Strangford Lough was chosen over the Orkneys for the Subhubrsquos final commissioning before being made available for the global market.Mr Smith explained: ldquoThe Subhub is a foundation structure for tidal turbines and provides a means of transporting and fixing tidal turbines to the sea bed.ldquoWe want to prove the environmental credentials of Subhub after developing it since .ldquoWe selected Strangford Lough as the commissioning site specically as it had the iants of conditions that Orkney hadnrsquot.

Lyng took the resultant penalty, but it was saved by a combination of Karen Haughey and then Sara-Louise Carr in the last action of the half.The second period followed a similar trend as Clonduff dominated the third quarter, Sara-Louise Carr banging over her third point and Gribben, who was picking up so much ball around the middle third, putting four between them once more from a placed ball.Gailltiacuter took over from then on, but will rue near-misses with shots for goal from Jackman, Carroll and Fitzgerald.The latter reduced the margin to the minimum with three scores, the third from play in the th minute after wonderful work by Kate Lynch, but crucially Gribben responded with a fantastic conversion of a free outside the  after a heavy challenge on Megan OrsquoReilly.Lyng made it a one-point game once more from a free, but Clonduff defended resolutely to hold out.Clonduff: K Haughey, N OrsquoHagan, J Boden, S Murphy, C McGilligan, E Rafferty, F Carr , B Fitzpatrick, C Cowan, C Fitzpatrick, SL Carr , P Gribben , O Gribben, K McGilligan.

In fact, the South Eastern Trust has been concentrating for some time on trying to find suitable day surgical services which could be delivered in Downpatrick.Miss Ritchie said it appears ldquovery short sighted to relocate services from the Downe to other hospitals, suggesting the bedding down of eye surgery will result in the increased requirement for theatre access for ENT and other services.She added: ldquoAs the Downe has high level computerised technology theatres, it is important that full use is made of them to ensure continued local accessibility to day surgery services at the point of delivery.ldquoI have already written to the Trust urging that ENT surgical clinics are retained in the Downe Hospital.Also this week, Miss Ritchie has issued a fresh call for a permanent MRI scanner to be installed in Downpatrick.She said that for a number of years the local community has been involved in trying to secure a permanent scanner which health chiefs agree is a necessity.She added: ldquoI understand that the permanent facility is subject to a business case which needs a Minister in place to approve. Whilst the devolved institutions remain in cold storage, the approval of such a facility will probably take some time.ldquoIn the meantime, a mobile scanner has been located at the Downe for a limited period to deal with a current overburdened service at the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald. I hope this unit can remain in place until the business case for the permanent scanner has been approved.A South Eastern Trust spokeswoman has confirmed that there are no plans to reduce the number of ENT sessions delivered at the Downpatrick hospital.She added: ldquoThe Trust is planning to increase ENT clinics at the Downe and to relocate an ENT day surgery session from Downpatrick to the Lagan Valley Hospital to facilitate the cataract elective care centre prototype work..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Food firm to create 125 jobs with £17m investment  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK is in line for a major jobs boost.Finnebrogue Artisan has this week unveiled plans to create  new jobs as part of a poundm investment in an ultra-modern nitrite-free bacon facility.The news comes just weeks after the firm unveiled details of a poundm investment in a new vegan and vegetarian factory to support  jobs.Already one of the districtrsquos leading employers and widely regarded as one of Northern Irelandrsquos most innovative food producers, Finnebrogue Artisanrsquos latest investment is being supported by Invest NI.The new manufacturing facility is for the production of the companyrsquos nitrite-free bacon, hailed by many experts as a breakthrough in the food processing sector when it was unveiled to wide acclaim in January last year.The Naked Bacon range is now widely available in leading supermarkets across the UK, with Invest NI offering the Downpatrick company over pound.m of support towards the capital investment in the new nitrate-free bacon facility.The  new posts are expected to be created by , supporting  posts already in place at the ultra-modern plant outside Downpatrick.Finnebrogue chairman Denis Lynn says it has been known for decades that nitrites used in curing meat can cause cancer.ldquoThatrsquos why, despite being the UKrsquos leading top tier sausage maker, we refused to make a single rasher of bacon until we could figure out a way to make it better and safer, he continued.ldquoWe always set out to make food the best it can be, without being bound by the way it has always been done.

The development proposal includes plans for almost  parking spaces, eight of which are reserved for mountain rescue team members.A new pedestrian crossing at the Bryansford Road junction with Shimna Road forms part of the proposal and while planners have received  objections, they have also received five letters in support of the proposal.In papers submitted ahead of next weekrsquos meeting, planners confirm that none of the statutory consultees, including the Department for Infrastructure, Rivers Agency, Environment Agency and the local environmental health department, have lodged any objections to the redevelopment of the former school site.They confirm that roads officials are content that the proposed development will not have any ldquoadverse impact on the existing road infrastructure and is acceptable in terms of road safety.Planners are also insisting that the indicative designs of both the new store and mountain rescue centre would not be inappropriate in this part of the resort.They say it is acknowledged that there are ldquoobvious restrictions for the redevelopment of the existing Lidl store in Railway Street and there are no alternative vacant sites in the town centre which can accommodate the supermarketrsquos needs.ldquoA suitable brownfield site has become available at the edge of the town centre which could accommodate the proposal and has met the requirements of strategic planning policy, say planners.They also confirmed that a study of the impact of the new store on existing retailers shows the proposed investment will not have any ldquosignicant or unacceptable impact on Newcastle town centre.Environmental health officials say they have no objection in principle to the investment, provided conditions are attached restricting hours of business and deliveries, with planners concluding that the overall impact of the proposal, which is close to a number of homes, is not considered to be ldquosignicantly detrimental to warrant a refusal of the application.Lidl has confirmed it plans to develop a new , square metre supermarket, explaining it opted to redevelop the former primary school site as there are limited opportunities to redevelop the storersquos current base at Railway Street in the resort.Lidl says it has been looking for alternative premises in Newcastle town centre for over a decade without success and that while properties have become available, none were suitable because they were too small.It says the current sales area at its Railway Street base is is too small for the store to carry a full range of goods, pointing to narrow aisles with limited circulation space. The company says the car park is too small and fails to meet its requirements, with the general customer experience falling short of a modern food store.Planners say that having assessed the ious planning policies and having regard to all representations made, all consultees engaged and all other material considerations, it is found that the proposal is acceptable in planning terms and approval is recommended..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Newcastle’s pop up beach back on agenda of council  ","story":"A DECISION to reject a proposal for a pop-up beach in Newcastle has been overturned.Last month, a Newry, Mourne and Down Council Committee recommended not to proceed with the articial beach mdash similar to those in Paris and other parts of Europe ndash at the townrsquos promenade.However, the decision was overturned at Monday nightrsquos meeting of the full council when it was agreed to seek funding for the pop-up beach and develop a business case which could pave the way for its introduction.But not all councillors agreed, with Sinn Fein members rejecting it. They said there were health and safety concerns associated with the beach. They expressed support for transporting sand by road from Ballykinlar to Newcastle promenade and implementing an enhanced beach management plan.The radical suggestion to bring a touch of French summer flair to Newcastle was initially discussed last September when it was agreed to further explore the idea, with the initial focus on the cost of developing such a facility.The idea was suggested because of the lack of sand on Newcastle beach.Pop up beaches along the banks of the Seine and other cities and towns across Europe are hugely popular and some local politicians believe they can be a success in Newcastle.Council officials have confirmed that while Newcastle promenade is not suitable for pop-up beaches, two areas adjacent to the Downs Road car park would be suitable and that the cost over a nine-week period would be pound,.At last monthrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee, politicians rejected the pop-up proposal and agreed to seek a meeting with the Environment Agency to discuss securing a marine licence to transport sand from Ballykinlar to Newcastle.It was also suggested that groins would be placed along sections of beach to protect the sand and a programme of better beach management introduced.

However, it is not workable.ldquoI have been advised in no uncertain terms by a iety of coastal erosion experts that importing sand to Newcastle or removing stones from the beach simply wonrsquot work due to the movement of sediment and that permission to do this work would be denied by central government.ldquoAs a councillor for Newcastle, I want to improve our tourism product and the pop-up beach proposal is simply my suggestion to try and do something dferent. I also recognise that an articial beach would have to be properly managed and maintained.Cllr Devlin added: ldquoA pop-up beach could not just be created at the start of the summer and left. It would have to be adequately cleaned and looked after. As a mother, I would not want my child playing in dirty sand so the management and cleanliness of the pop up beach is essential.ldquoThis suggestion wonrsquot be without itrsquos issues, but surely as a council it is our job to try and make improvements and better our area where possible, expressing disappointment Sinn Fein opposed her proposal.Sinn Feinrsquos Willie Clarke argued that there was no appetite for a pop-up beach and that the suggestion to move sand from Ballykinlar to Newcastle was to replace the hundreds of tonnes which drt away on a seasonal basis.He continued: ldquoHow are you going to manage a pop-up beach that will be filled with stagnant sand  There is the potential for both dogs and young infants to foul the sand and other health and safety issues which need to be addressed.ldquoWill the sand be cleaned every day  What measures will be taken to prevent sand from blowing up Main Street  Local people and traders want to see a sandy beach, not a pop-up beach. I believe it is a no brainer that we try to secure Environment Agency agreement to place sand on the beach.Cllr Clarke said part of the pleasure of going to the beach was being able to go into the water and suggested that a pop-up beach could not provide such an experience.He added: ldquoWe need to look at anti-social behaviour issues associated with pop-up beaches which could contain broken glass.

Murray launched the ball high into orbit and wasnrsquot the least bit surprised when the wind took over and helped it on its way to the top right hand corner of the net with Ross clutching at thin air.Six minutes later at the other end Anton McGrattan struck yet another free kick from just outside the box past Ryan Walsh to bring the sides level.Olympic continued to see more of the ball, but Jones, when he did receive the ball out wide, was let down on a few occasions by a lack of support in the box and some wasteful finishing from Shane Murray.Kilmore were far from out of it and the bustling Joe McKinney was proving a handful and he almost gave the visitors a nd minute lead when he shot wide after a sizzling breakaway run from Anton McGrattan.Murray missed another good chance for Olympic after Jones carved out another opening before Kilmore seized the lead.Callum Dougan foraged deep and played a delightful through ball into the path of McKinney, who had beaten the offside trap. McKinney wasnrsquot for hanging around and after shrugging off Stevie McGoran, herounded lsquokeeper Walsh to make it -.The unrelenting wind and rain greeted both sets of players back for the second half and it was Kilmore who went on the offensive with Ryan Slavin being denied by Walsh.Two minutes later Kilmore shot themselves in the foot when Murray floated a free kick into the box and Jason Noade had all the time in the world to head the ball past Ross.Things became hot and heavy for a while with the tackles flying in, but clear cut chances at either end were hard to come by.Kilmore were now asking most of the questions, but a resolute Olympic rearguard refused to budge and Walsh had relatively little to do, apart from the odd shot from distance.Extra-time produced little of note, but Kilmore could have wrapped things up in the second period when McKinney crossed for Pete Casey, but, for once, he sliced his effort into no manrsquos land.Jones, Jason and Stevie Noadersquos first three penalties were perfect for Olympic, but they were matched by McGivern, McKinney and Larkin for Kilmore.Adam McLean nudged Olympic - ahead before Anton McGrattan fired his effort wide, advantage Olympic.Murrayrsquos first attempt was saved by Ross, but the referee made him retake the penalty as he insisted Ross had moved forward off his line. Murray was not about to look a gt horse in the mouth and drilled his second attempt to the net, much to the despair of a mightily aggrieved Kilmore side.Ballynahinch Olympic: Ryan Walsh, Dalton Tate, Aaron McClean, Jason Noade, Ryan Noade, Stevie McGoran, Stevie Noade, Ryan Molloy, Shane Murray, Niall Murray.

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately. For those minor illnesses and injuries which are less serious, we hope Woody the dog helps people realise that there are other, more appropriate, services available. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

That being the case, this council, like many others in Wales, is unable to continue to provide the level of subsidy to outdoor sports provision that it has in the past.ldquoExploring dferent ways of working, including the transfer of responsibilities in appropriate circumstances to community groups is a key element of the councilrsquos strategy moving forward as it addresses dficult budget priorities.ldquoFollowing the successful transfer of responsibilities for five libraries to community-based organisations and looking at a number of successful sports clubs across the Vale of Glamorgan who operate without any subsidy from the Council, it is hoped that the majority of clubs currently using council facilities will be able to continue to provide opportunities for all to participate in sports activities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The event ran from Saturday March  to Tuesday March .The Vale brewery Tomos and Lilford produced a special beer called ldquoCarnival - Penarth Pale Ale.Meanwhile the two Penarth butchers, Thompson Family Butchers and David Lush Butchers, both created their own special Penarth carnival sausages.The organisers estimated that more than  people took part in costume in the walk through town on Saturday, which saw the coronation of the lsquoFirst Foolrsquo at am. The procession marched from Sully Terrace through town.At .am in Penarth Library, there was a presentation of the head of Bendigeidfran, from The Mabinogion. The head was made by children from Cogan and Penygarth schools.The lsquoFirst Foolrsquo was then sent by train to the Tower of London to bring news of the Carnival to the traditional resting place of the head of Bendigeidfran, where he met the Raven Master.Long distance cyclist Dave Hann was due to cycle to Harlech, north Wales to raise money for the RNLI Penarth, and bring news to Harlech that Carnival had broken out in Penarth.Unfortunately Mr Hann only got as far as Cardigan before Storm Freya made it too dangerous to continue. Organisers have one barrel of carnival ale left and will take it to Harlech by train in the next few weeks to share it and the storybook of the carnival.On Sunday, two rugby teams took part in a ldquotug-o-sausage to decide which butcherrsquos sausage was better. Congratulations were extended to the winners, Team Thompson.Congratulations were also extended to the traders Ener-chi and Lilypad by the organisers, for having the best-dressed shop windows. Particular praise was singled out for the carnival flowers at Holm House Hotel created by Lilypad.Further nights of partying, songs and dancing were spotted in the Albion, St Faganrsquos Castle, and other pubs, bars and venues across Penarth.

Carnival finished last night on Mardi Gras.ldquoThanks to everyone who took part, contributed, encouraged, sponsored, smiled and partied, especially those people who took a carnival Bank Holiday Monday.ldquoIt was fabulous to hear your Carnival Bank Holiday stories, and to all those people who have had little private carnival moments of joy over the festival, thatrsquos what it has all been about.ldquoAnd some people have already said, lsquosee you next year!rsquoldquoThere were lots of people laughing and smiling on the sidelines, telling me they wanted to take part next year ndash just with a little more notice next time.

Wersquore creating work which is not really necessary.If we want to improve the gateway there are other ways of doing it.ldquoIt really doesnrsquot begin to tackle the active travel . I do feel this is about spending the money before next February.Councillors were told the widened roundabout was one part of a wider strategy for transport improvements in Penarth.Charlotte Pugh, senior planner for the council, said the new scheme would transform the area.She said: ldquoThis whole are is going to be completely transformed. At the moment it is not very welcoming to pedestrians.ldquoI think it will go some way to transforming this gateway into Penarth and make it a safer environment.Previous plans to make part of Plassey Street one-way to incoming traffic, and removing the roundabout altogether, were dropped following opposition from the public.The committee agreed to endorse the transport scheme but requested regular updates on the wider transport plans for Penarth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This fantastic choir is run by The Aloud Charity, which is based here in the constituency, and is doing incredible work all around Wales, involving young people in music and teamwork and giving them the confidence to not only succeed in music but in their lives more generally.It was a real honour to host them in Parliament, where they sang for the Speaker, for MPs, and during the St Davidrsquos Day Service in the Chapel, before heading to the Public Gallery of the Commons to watch the St Davidrsquos Day debate.This annual debate is an important one for Wales, allowing MPs to talk about all sorts of issues. I spoke about transport and train services ndash a long running campaign of mine as you will know.I then spoke in the crucial debate on climate change. Believe it or not, itrsquos been far too long since wersquove had a debate on this issue in Parliament, and I spoke about the importance of our investments and pensions going into renewable sources, not into fossil fuels.I also pointed out my support for the young people across the UK who went on a climate strike the week before. Itrsquos their futures that wersquore concerned about here and they were absolutely right to do what they did.And then of course the Brexit shambles continues ndash we cannot escape it ndash but we were debating it again last week, with hugely important votes to come next week.But last week was a signicant one. The PM was forced into a corner, forced to concede that she might have to rule out No Deal and extend Article , and the Labour Party came out decisively for putting this issue back to the people.And this week we saw the Government attempt to win over MPs with a fund it claims will boost less well-off towns after Brexit ndash but in another shambolic aspect to this hapless attempt to bribe MPs into voting for Theresa Mayrsquos so-called deal, there is no cash for Welsh towns.Another example of the Tories letting Wales down, and yet further reason to support the push for a final say on Brexit for the public through a Peoplersquos Vote. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Last month I met with constituents over disruption to local rail services. I know that many of you will have experienced delays and cancellations to services in the weeks following the handover of the Wales Rail Franchise. I understand and share the frustration that these delays have caused. There has been a shortage of rolling stock as a result of a large maintenance backlog following the handover of the franchise together with planned changes to rail services. This has led to a signicant reduction in services and replacement bus services. I have been in contact with the Minister for Transport and Transport for Wales to raise the concerns of constituents. I have been assured that service levels are now back to normal and they do not anticipate any restrictions to services in the coming year. I will of course maintain my interest to see that those assurances are kept. I will update residents again on future plans to deliver improved station facilities, trains and more regular services.As many of you are aware Cardf Bus has recently announced changes to bus services across Cardf and the Vale. A number of bus routes are at risk as part of these changes. The removal of bus links for work, social links and public services, including hospital routes, would have a signicant impact on my constituents.Cardf Bus are not acting to deliberately hurt our communities. Far from being an uncaring organisation Cardf Bus are stuck with a legal framework that stops them from operating on the same basis as commercial competitors. Competitors can cherry pick and target single profitable routes that undermine the wider social propose that most of us want from local bus services. Cardf Councilrsquos Labour leadership has committed to supporting at risk bus services for  years. Unless the Conservative leadership of the Vale Council agrees to Labour councillors amendments to the budget and protects local bus services in the Vale then bus routes will go. The Vale Council leadership could and should act. If they donrsquot then my constituents will suffer.In future, the regulation of buses is the answer. London was the only part of the UK that was allowed to keep a regulated bus service. It is no mistake that it has the best and most coherent service. We now have the legislative powers to regulate bus services here in Wales. The Welsh Government is currently consulting on proposals to reform bus and taxi services in Wales. More information on the consultation can be found at: https:beta.gov.wales improving-public-transport. The consultation closes on th March ndash please do get in touch and take part. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

What form this reform takes is up for discussion, but it is good to see parties considering this in the round.ldquoAs this briefing points out, the primary way to reform the bloated, unelected House of Lords is to replace it with a fairly elected revising chamber, with a clearly defined remit and which can speak up for the nations and regions of the whole UK.ldquoVoters are tired of seeing scandal after scandal in the Lords with no way of kicking them out.

How did you get started in the industry  When we first opened Asia Supermarket in , it was the family’s ambition to bring a taste of home to Belfast. We brought the Chinese culture to the local community through cuisine and provided authentic and tasty ingredients for the hospitality trade here. We branched out due to demand to also provide Indian, Korean, Philippine, Thai and Middle Eastern food and are always looking for opportunities to extend our range. Typically, who are your clients or customers  Our customers would be both wholesale and retail to include restaurants all over Northern Ireland, as well as consumers who want to create some unique dishes in their home kitchens. Do you enjoy what you do, and what in particular  Yes, and in particular having just completed the new build we have enjoyed being involved in the day-to-day aspects, given the bespoke nature of the project, coupled with the hustle and bustle of the day to day challenges of satisfying our customer needs. What is the most dficult part of your job  One of the most dficult parts of the job is sourcing good quality produce at competitive prices and enhancing the range of products available. However, we’re very proud of our new supermarket and warehouse which provides even more quality and choice for our customers. What are the challenges facing your sector, and the economy in general  One of the biggest challenges facing our sector is the cost of goods from our suppliers, particularly those procured in foreign currencies which in turn has a knock-on effect on what we charge our wholesale and retail customers. To maintain our share of the market we constantly endeavour to get the best prices from our suppliers so that we can pass on competitive prices to our customers to maintain and grow our market share. With Brexit looming it will bring a major impact on imports costs and supplier prices which will present a major challenge for our business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cleaver_1.jpg","title":"is the future bright for the ni energy market","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by Ulster Business It is clear that there are a number of signicant challenges facing the energy sector in Northern Ireland but where there are challenges, there are also opportunities, according to law firm Cleaver Fulton Rankin.The ExecutiveNorthern Ireland has just completed its second year without a ing local government and in the words of David Sterling, head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, the Civil Service is “… doing everything we can in the prevailing circumstances…but civil servants cannot take the place of ministers when it comes to strategic policy development or in taking transformative decisions”.  This is very much the case with regard to energy policy. The Department of the Economy’s Strategic Energy Framework, which was endorsed by the Executive in , has over the last nine years, led to some very positive changes to the energy generation and supply mix, particularly from renewable sources.However the  year framework is nearing its end and needs to be replaced. The Department is making such preparations as it can on a draft Strategic Energy Framework across the areas of heat, electricity, transport and energy efficiency which it aims to make public some time in the spring. Whether or not this region has its Assembly back to adopt such a framework will remain to be seen, but in the meantime it will ensure the subject remains live and high on the agenda.Brexit and I-SEMThe new wholesale electricity market known as the Integrated Single Electricity Marketwent live on October , . It is designed to deliver increased levels of competition which, it is hoped, will help put downward pressure on prices as well as encouraging greater levels of security of supply and transparency. While the island of Ireland is now integrated more closely with European markets, there is a risk that Brexit could halt this integration. British and Irish business groups and energy trade associations such as the CBI, IBEC, Electricity Association of Ireland, RenewableUK, British Irish Chamber of Commerce and EnergyUK all refer to the delivery of I-SEM, or to the UK’s continued access to the IEM, as post-Brexit priorities for security of supply and or consumer protection. I-SEM is clearly a priority that must be preserved.While Brexit may present challenges and continuing uncertainty, there are certainly opportunities for investment and acquisition in the electricity market as more complex, specialist expertise will be required to effectively trade power on the I-SEM. Policy barriers or inaction cannot be allowed to prevent I-SEM from realising its potential of fully integrating the market by efficiently moving energy from producer to demand.Renewable incentive schemesDespite being on track to hit its target of % of electricity generation from renewables, Northern Ireland risks being left behind. The lack of a replacement for the development support mechanism, Renewables Obligations Certicateafter its closure in April , means Northern Ireland is lagging behind Great Britain which has established the Contract for Dference regime and Ireland, which has started work on its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme . While neither scheme is perfect, doing nothing is not an option. The devolution of energy presented Northern Ireland with the opportunity to shape its own policy but without a government, will the sector and the infrastructure be able to remain fit for purpose GasWith its development over the last  years, the gas network in Northern Ireland, with its low population density, must be seen as a success story. Consumers and businesses have been offered greater choice in terms of price and security of supply. Nevertheless there are certainly further opportunities for gas distributors and suppliers to expand the natural gas network, particularly in the west of the country and east Co Down. So despite the apparent obstacles and challenges, there is opportunity for development and progress in Northern Ireland’s energy sector. The benefits for Northern Ireland will be in terms of security of supply, price and environmental sustainability. Cleaver Fulton Rankin,  Bedford Street, Belfast BT FW.

The proposal for the work to Broadcasting House on Ormeau Avenue in Belfast was approved last March by the BBC board, with the announcement made to staff by the BBCs director general Lord Tony Hall. Now, the plans – which include the redevelopment of the exisiting BBC Broadcasting House building, including the refurbishment and extension of the buildings – will be put to the public, as part of a necessary pre-application event before planning can be submitted. It includes a new extension to the rear, including a landscaped plaza opening onto Linenhall Street. A spokesman for BBC Northern Ireland told Ulster Business: \"As part of the pre-planning application process, public consultation events will take place this month before we can move on to the next phase. The investment to BBC Broadcasting House in Belfast, announced in March last year, will transform the iconic building, its technology and facilities, highlighting the BBC’s commitment to audiences in Northern Ireland. We will share more detail in due course.\" Money invested will go towards structural work on the -year-old building to ensure its long-term sustainability, addressing what the state broadcaster has said are \"critical deficiencies\". Before the announcement last year that the BBC was to stay put and develop its existing building, it was understood the broadcaster had been eyeing up other city centre locations, or could create a new media hub in the Titanic Quarter. The event will take place at the Clayton Hotel on March , between pm and pm, and March  between pm and .pm.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pin_1.jpg","title":"pinnacle given top sage accolade","story":"Posted on Wednesday March  by Ulster Business IT firm Pinnacle has been awarded a top accolade for its Sage software and services in Ireland.The company, which has offices across the UK and Ireland including Belfast and Dublin, has been named by Sage Ireland as its ‘highest growth partner’ for sales of Sage cloud.Search Workshop Supplies, one of Ireland’s largest suppliers of garage and workshop equipment, is one of the latest firms which has partnered with Pinnacle.Olivia O’Dea of Search Workshop Supplies, said: “From our initial meeting with Pinnacle’s business development director Siobhan Marley, we were given a solid reassurance that Pinnacle fully understood the growing needs of our business.”Barry Murphy, managing director of Sage Ireland, said:“The team at Pinnacle are incredibly passionate in supporting their customers to thrive in an ever-evolving market.

Since I took on the Northern Ireland role six years ago, we’ve doubled the workforce, become the fastest-growing UK region and are now the biggest office outside London with just over , people,” he says. “Our strategy was to be the leading provider of professional services in the Northern Ireland market but there’s no way we’d be the size we are now had we only focused on that.”Instead Paul built on the legacy of his predecessors and accelerated growth in new, technology solutions, while retaining the traditional accounting, tax and consulting services. Today PwC remains the leading provider of advisory services to the region’s family-owned and owner-managed businesses and multinationals, but has also built an impressive portfolio of cutting-edge technologies, opened the door to signicant export markets and is tackling some of society’s most challenging issues. “We’ve grown in many new areas – blockchain, cyber, cloud-based accounting services – but the single biggest impact has come from developing our distinctive ‘Operate’ ision,” Paul says. ”Operate is our service delivery business, which supports and delivers technology and people solutions to large, often regulated organisations. So instead of just advising clients how to solve their problems, we now do the heavy lting for them.”Run by Ian McConnell, a partner who’s been with the firm for  years, Operate is already attracting global attention. “Clients increasingly don’t want a consulting firm just to tell them what to do: they want a problem-solving partnership.” he says. “In its first year of operation, Operate earned over £m, now has , people and is still growing.”Reinforcing Paul’s confidence to invest in Northern Ireland as a strategic location is a  forecast from TheCityUK that it could become the second fastest-growing financial services region outside London by , helping deliver £bn of additional gross value-addedto the UK economy. But that depends on the ability to recruit the right talent, and he says the challenge now is finding and retaining the skills.That’s an issue that particularly concerns Paul as he looks ahead at the economic picture with Brexit and lack of an Assembly to the fore.“The business community wants clarity and certainty. Ideally we want to see a Brexit withdrawal agreement that then gives the scope for a trade deal that offers Northern Ireland the capacity to trade both with the EU and as part of the UK. The potential competitive advantages and ability to attract investment would be terric and the kind of economic accelerator which we have sought for years, but never managed to gain.“However I do worry about the impact of political stalemate on our long term future. Failure to invest, particularly in education and skills, will impair our competitiveness and make this a less attractive place for business.The decreasing effectiveness of health, environment and infrastructure will mean that talented people will opt to make choices to live their lives where.“In my national role, I see other parts of the country fusing partnerships in innovative and exciting ways between business,education and government. Compared to that, we are already getting left behind. We should be moving forward.”Which brings us to Merchant Square, the £m, , sq ft office development which PwC takes over in . “We have great people and one reason why we’re moving to the city centre is because that’s where they want to be. By the time we’re ready to relocate towards the end of , we will have at least , people moving in to the heart of Belfast.“That makes it important for Belfast too and not just because it’s the city’s biggest-ever private sector office deal. As we were making our decision, the whole Bank Buildings issue was at its height, and we wanted to show our support for the city and its future.” The Merchant Square relocation project is led by Kieragh Nelson, a director who joined the firm in . “We’ve got serious ambitions for Merchant Square,” she says. ”There’s a sense of ‘OK, we’ve just opened flagship offices in London, and Manchester – what more can we do in Belfast how can we make it even better ’ And the vast majority of decisions on how it will look, feel and work are made by the team here. Our goal is to create the most technologically-advanced, innovative and collaborative space for ourselves, our clients, and also for the communities around us.”Doing the right thing is a maxim often repeated in PwC, but it gets backed up. On the morning of our interview, a large group of people from the firm, including Paul, took part in one of their regular ‘Darkness Into Light’ walks to raise awareness of mental health. The firm’s commitment to social mobility has seen a number of employment programmes launched, notably the UK’s first technology degree apprenticeships, with Queen’s University one of five universities selected to run the programme. And it’s expanding its Hive Academy programme, which delivers free technology education to primary and secondary schools, to the Channel Islands.This year the firm challenged itself and created a unique charity partnership – the PwC Challenge – to create innovative suicide prevention programmes.“Our purpose is to build trust in society and solve important problems, and it really does feature in how we look at what we do. We strive to celebrate and share our knowledge widely and unselfishly with our people and communities and not be afraid to take a stand and do the right thing. And we put it at the heart of what we do every day. “Take the PwC Challenge: more people in Northern Ireland have died by suicide since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement than from the violence in the years before. This is a crisis, and it’s one which affects our people, and our communities. So we asked local charities in north and west Belfast, the worst affected areas in the UK, to collaborate and devise really innovative approaches programmes to give opportunities to young people and their families through education, technology, sports, and mental health coaching.“As well as the clubs in PwC which fundraise every year for the challenge, our own people are volunteering every week in ious projects – particularly with our Hive Academy. We want to ensure that people, who are high achievers in many dferent fields, are supported to play their fullest part in society.” For Paul, it’s all about the people. Last year PwC invested around £m on staff development here, and this year, a number of people have begun the first Masters in Operation service delivery, run by Ulster University. “It’s important to support people to develop their careers in ways they mightn’t have considered when they joined. That’s a key building block of our purpose – it drives social mobility, equality and ersity.“It’s true thatsomeone decides they want to head off and join PwC Australia or New York, they can. That’s the beauty of working for a global firm – those opportunities are there. But what I really want to make sure is that you don’t have to leave:you want to live and work in Belfast, and have global clients, work with cutting-edge technology and be part of a firm that’s engaged in society, you can do that too.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/eopen_1.jpg","title":"the open its the biggest thing since sliced bread","story":"Posted on Wednesday March  by Ulster Business With just  weeks until Northern Ireland hosts the biggest sporting event in its history, John Mulgrew speaks to the bosses tasked with organising the legendary Open Championship We’ve come a long way in just a short few years. Despite its huge golfing credentials, especially in the modern game, it had been more than  years since Northern Ireland played host to the Irish Open.That all changed in , when it ed north to Royal Portrush. And that, buoyed on a refreshed and renewed interest in both the tournament, and the sport itself.Now, in  weeks, that same links course will see more than , people flock to arguably the world’s greatest golf tournament and the largest sporting event ever hosted on these shores – The Open – transforming a small Co Antrim town for a handful of summer days.“There is a buzz with everyone at the RA,” Johnnie Cole-Hamilton tells Ulster Business. He’s executive director of championships at the RA – the ruling authority of golf throughout the world, aside from areas such as the US, and organisation responsible for organising The Open.“This will be my th Open Championship, and one reason I continue to be involved is that it’s a challenge every time.”It will see Irish golfing greats, including Open winners Rory McIlroy and Darren Clarke, Graeme McDowelland Padraig Harrington – among others – join the biggest name in sport, Tiger Woods.“One of big drivers to ing to Royal Portrush was the success of the Northern Irish and Irish golfers. They have raised the profile of golf immeasurably. “We are absolutely delighted with the response so far – % of tickets sold in  hours, and sold out within a record-breaking eight weeks.”Johnnie says the decision to choose Portrush, bringing it back to the course after a  year hiatus, was the correct one – buoyed by the support from the community, agencies and organisations. The th Open will be held at Royal Portrush from July -.“In my career, we had a similar scenario, ing to Liverpool for the first time in  years, and we had a very similar response. It ed in , and now Royal Liverpool is firmly on the rota, and I hope that Royal Portrush is similar.”Of course, aside from the golf, both the short-term and long-term economic benefits will trickle down and benefit, not on the surrounding areas, but prop Northern Ireland up on yet another global .According to Tourism NI chief executive John McGrillen that longer-term benefit could be worth up to £m for the wider economy.“There will be , tickets sold for championship days, and % of those sold to people out of state, outside Northern Ireland,” he tells Ulster Business.“It allows us to present an extremely positive image for Northern Ireland, and into key markets across the globe. We will never have experienced the opportunity to provide such a positive image of Northern Ireland. Despite what we might think, there are perception issues.“Northern Ireland has a normalised society and some of the most dramatic golf courses, scenery and landscape to see.“More specically, the fact that the Open will have been here, as one of the world’s top golf courses, will drive up the amount of spend, especially from golf tourism.”That alone makes up around % of Northern Ireland’s tourism intake. John says he wants that to grow to £m by . He says golfing visitors spend around four times that of an average tourist.Johnnie says all signs so far suggest that the Open in Portrush is “going to be an enormous” success. But the process hasn’t come without its challenges – namely theIrish Sea.“This is the first Open Championship we have hosted in my time, in which we have a body of water between our base and our contractor base. There’s getting things across water, and an enormous amount of work on the golf course – new holes, a new road system around the course and a tunnel for the players from one of the new greens to tee. You can’t do that without support from the golf club“The members have been hugely supportive, turning the course upside down, but maintaining integrity and enhancing .”He said, along with the blue light services, local authorities, council and tourism groups, the community in and around Portrush “understands that this will bring great benefits” to the area and Northern Ireland as a whole. “You can overcome dficulties with support,” he says.“Royal Portrush has never had more than , people drive to it, or get the train to it, at the same time. It’s a challenge to make sure we deliver a wonderful Open Championship and a spectator experience.”John McGrillen says the triumph in landing the Open itself was down to the success of the Irish Open in the last few years. “You had more than , people turning out at Portrush… visitor numbers had been dwindling.“That allows us to demonstrate that the course can deal with that many people. Everyoneworked very well, collectively, and that gave confidence to the RA that we would have the capacity to deliver it. The risk factors they had were eliminated because of the success of the Irish Open, and that was very critical.”As for boosting many of the hundreds of businesses in and around the area, John said: “It will do, as it’s showing off Northern Ireland… we have seen a big boost in the number of Americans playing golf. We don’t have to wait until after the event. “The visibility the Irish Open has given us. We have Royal County Down, Royal Portrush and Portstewart – that’s increased signicantly. It’s not just those courses which are benefiting – it’s being spread. People will typically stay in Belfast and travel around.”For John, the best outcome is, of course, an Irish winner. Oh, and clear skies. “A local winner would be phenomenal. It would be fantastic to see Rory win, or Tiger Woods.“If Tiger Woods won the Open in Portrush, that would remain in peoples’ memories forever.
